In response, the department has noted that the Defense Travel System (DTS), in part, will help correct these problems. Because of the widespread congressional interest in DTS, GAO initiated the audit under the statutory authority of the Comptroller General of the United States.

Consequently, critical flaws have been identified that resulted in significant schedule slippages between the planned and actual system deployment. GAO's recent analysis of selected requirements related to DTS's reservation module disclosed that system testing was ineffective in ensuring that the promised capability has been delivered as intended. For example, GAO found that DOD did not have reasonable assurance that DTS properly displayed flight and airfare information. This problem was not detected prior to deployment, since DOD failed to properly test system interfaces. While DTS has corrected some of the previously reported travel problems, others remain. Specifically, DTS has resolved the problem related to duplicate payment for airline tickets purchased with the centrally billed accounts. However, problems remain related to improper premium-class travel, unused tickets that are not refunded, and accuracy of travelers' claims. These remaining problems cannot be resolved solely within DTS and will take departmentwide action to address. GAO also identified two key challenges facing DTS in becoming DOD's standard travel system: (1) developing needed interfaces and (2) underutilization of DTS at sites where it has been deployed. While DTS has developed 36 interfaces with various DOD business systems, it will have to develop interfaces with at least 18 additional systems--not a trivial task. Additionally, the continued use of the existing legacy travel systems results in underutilization of DTS and affects the savings that DTS was planned to achieve. Furthermore, GAO has identified concepts that the department can adopt to streamline its travel management practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 10 years ago, the Department of Defense (DOD) Task Force to  Reengineer Travel issued a report that pinpointed three principal causes for  DOD\u2019s inefficient travel system: (1) travel policies and programs were  focused on compliance with rigid rules rather than mission performance,  (2) travel practices did not keep pace with travel management  improvements implemented by industry, and (3) the travel systems were  not integrated.

In September  2005, we testified on our preliminary results regarding this audit of DTS.", "Our audit objectives were to (1) determine if DOD effectively tested key  DTS functionality related to flights and fare information, (2) ascertain if  DTS will correct the internal control weaknesses and improper payments  previously identified, (3) identify the challenges that remain in ensuring  DTS achieves its goal as DOD\u2019s standard travel system, and (4) identify  opportunities for DOD to streamline the entire travel process. To address  the first objective, we reviewed two key DTS flight-related requirements  and the related testing to determine if the desired functionality was  effectively implemented. To address the second objective, we analyzed   (1) our prior reports and testimonies, (2) selected Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) reports, and (3) DOD congressional  testimonies to identify the specific problems that DTS was intended to  resolve. Further, we randomly selected for review travel vouchers drawn  from the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 (October through December 2004)  to determine if DTS calculation problems identified by DFAS had been  resolved.  To address the third objective, we discussed with the PMO-DTS  the deployment of DTS as it relates to the transmission of data, such as  finance and accounting information, between DTS and the other systems  belonging to DOD, as well as private sector businesses.  We also analyzed  DOD data related to the utilization of DTS.  To address the fourth objective,  we analyzed the department\u2019s current travel processes, discussed them  with the PMO-DTS, and reviewed our past reports that discussed federal  agency travel practices.  We determined that the DOD data we used as the  basis for our evaluation in this report were sufficiently reliable by  (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing  existing information about the data and the system that produced them,  and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data.", "Because of the widespread congressional interest in DTS, this assignment  was performed at our initiative under the statutory authority provided to  the Comptroller General of the United States.

The task force\u2019s January 1995 report pinpointed three  principal causes for DOD\u2019s inefficient travel system: (1) travel policies and  programs were focused on compliance with rigid rules rather than mission  performance, (2) travel practices did not keep pace with travel  management improvements implemented by industry, and (3) the travel  system was not integrated.", "On December 13, 1995, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Technology and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief  Financial Officer issued a memorandum, \u201cReengineering Travel Initiative,\u201d  establishing the PMO-DTS to acquire travel services that would be used  DOD-wide.  Additionally, in a 1997 report to the Congress, the DOD  Comptroller pointed out that the existing DOD TDY travel system was never designed to be an integrated system. The report stated that because  there was no centralized focus on the department\u2019s travel practices, the  travel policies were issued by different offices and the process had become  fragmented and \u201cstovepiped.\u201d The report further noted that there was no  vehicle in the current structure to overcome these deficiencies, as no one  individual within the department had specific responsibility for  management control of DOD TDY travel.", "To address these concerns and after the use of competitive procedures, the  department awarded a firm fixed-price, performance-based services  contract to BDM International, Inc. (BDM) in May 1998.  In September  1998, GAO denied a bid protest challenging the department\u2019s selection of  BDM. Under the terms of the contract, the contractor was to start  deploying a travel system and to begin providing travel services for  approximately 11,000 sites worldwide within 120 days of the effective date  of the contract, completing deployment approximately 38 months later. The  contract specified that upon DTS achieving initial operational capability  (IOC), BDM was to be paid a onetime deployment fee of $20 for each user  and a transaction fee of $5.27 for each travel voucher processed. The  estimated cost for the contract was approximately $264 million.  Prior to  commencing the work, BDM was acquired by TRW, Inc. (TRW), which  became the contractor of record.", "The operational assessment of DTS at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri,  from October through December 2000, disclosed serious failures. For  example, the system\u2019s response time was slower than anticipated, the  result being that it took longer than expected to process a travel  order/voucher. Because of the severity of the problems, in January 2001 a  joint memorandum was issued by the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics) directing a functional and technical assessment  of DTS.  The memorandum also directed that a determination be made of  any future contract actions that would be necessary, based on the  assessment results. In July 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics) approved proceeding with DTS and  restructuring the contract with TRW.", "The TRW contract was restructured through a series of contract  modifications, which were finalized on March 29, 2002.  The government  agreed to provide TRW consideration in the amount of about $44 million  for the restructure of the contract.  TRW agreed to release and discharge  the government from liability and agreed to waive any and all liabilities,  obligations, claims, and demands related to or arising from its early  performance efforts under the original contract.

Figure 1 depicts  the designated DOD travel process using DTS.", "The three essential players in the processing of a travel authorization and  related payment are the traveler, the CTO, and the AO.  The traveler  generates a travel authorization and enters the appropriate information  into DTS, such as travel dates, departure and arrival airports, and hotel and  rental car arrangements.  When the traveler is finished, DTS sends a  prebuilt passenger name record to the CTO. If possible, requested  arrangements will automatically book without CTO intervention. In cases  where the travel arrangements do not automatically book, the CTO must  intervene and take additional steps to book the requested arrangements.  Next, the traveler\u2019s AO receives an e-mail notification from DTS stating that  there is a travel authorization awaiting review and approval.", "The AO is a key internal control point in the travel authorization process.  AO responsibilities include reviewing the travel authorization for  compliance with travel laws, regulations, and policies; determining if the  trip is mission essential and funds are available; assigning the proper line of  accounting prior to authorization; reviewing all policy exceptions, and  approving or rejecting the travel authorization as appropriate. When the AO  approves a travel authorization by electronically signing the document in  DTS, DTS routes the approved travel authorization to the CTO for ticketing,  sends an obligation transaction to the appropriate accounting system and  notifies the traveler via e-mail that the travel authorization has been  approved.", "When the trip is complete, the traveler creates a travel voucher for  reimbursable travel-related expenses from the travel authorization data  stored in DTS, and electronically signs the voucher.  DTS electronically  routes the travel voucher to the AO for approval. An AO is then  responsible for certifying a travel voucher for payment by electronically  signing the document.

During fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD  spent almost $124 million on airline tickets that included at least one leg  of the trip in premium-class\u2014usually business class.  Because each  premium-class ticket costs the government up to thousands of dollars more than a coach class ticket, unauthorized premium-class travel  resulted in millions of dollars of unnecessary costs annually.", "Because of control breakdowns, DOD paid for airline tickets that were  neither used nor processed for refund\u2014amounting to about 58,000  tickets totaling more than $21 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  DOD was not aware of this problem before our audit and did not  maintain any data on unused tickets. Based on limited data provided by  the airlines, it is possible that the unused value of the fully and partially  unused tickets that DOD purchased from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal  year 2003 with its CBA could be at least $100 million.", "We found that DOD sometimes paid twice for the same airline ticket\u2014 first to Bank of America for the monthly DOD credit card bill, and  second to the traveler, who was reimbursed for the same ticket. Based  on our mining of limited data, the potential magnitude of the improper  payments was 27,000 transactions for over $8 million. For example,  DOD paid a Navy GS-15 civilian employee approximately $10,000 for 13  airline tickets he had not purchased."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ongoing DTS Testing Remains a Concern", "paragraphs": ["DTS development and implementation have been problematic, especially in  the area of requirements and testing key functionality to ensure that the  system would perform as intended.  Given the lack of adherence to such  key practices, it is not surprising that critical flaws have been identified  after deployment, resulting in significant schedule slippages. In July 2002, a  DOD Inspector General\u2019s report noted that in early 1999, it was evident that  the commercial-off-the-shelf software would require extensive  modification in order to meet DOD\u2019s needs. Further, the report pointed  out that operational problems continued to arise during the third phase of  the system testing in the fall of 2000.   As originally envisioned, the initial  deployment of DTS was to commence 120 days after the effective date of  the contract award in September 1998, with complete deployment to  approximately 11,000 locations by April 2002.  However, that date has been  changed to September 2006\u2014a slippage of over 4 years. Figure 2 shows the  schedule slippage between the planned and actual implementation of DTS.", "Our recent analysis of selected requirements disclosed that the testing of  DTS is not always adequate prior to updated software being released for  use by DOD personnel.  System testing is a critical process utilized by  organizations to improve an entity\u2019s confidence that the system will satisfy  the requirements of the end user and will operate as intended.  Additionally,  an efficient and effective system testing program is one of the critical  elements that needs to be in place in order to have reasonable assurance that an organization has implemented the disciplined processes necessary  to reduce software development project risks to acceptable levels.", "In one key area, our review identified instances in which the testing of DTS  was inadequate, which precluded DOD from having reasonable assurance  that DTS displayed the proper flights and airfares.  For example, DOD  officials stated that prior to an August 2005 system update, DTS should  have displayed 12 flights, if that many flights were available, within a flight  window. DTS program officials and Northrop Grumman personnel  acknowledged that this particular system requirement had never been  tested because DOD failed to document the requirement until January  2005.  Because a system requirement covering this feature had never been  defined and communicated to the contractor, there was no reasonable  assurance that DTS would display the envisioned number of flights and  related airfares within a given flight window. As we have noted in  previous reports, requirements that are not defined are unlikely to be  tested, with the resulting consequence that they are even less likely to be  satisfied.", "We also noted that even when the requirements were properly defined, the  DOD tests for determining whether DTS displayed the proper flights and  airfares did not provide reasonable assurance that the (1) proper flights  were displayed and (2) airfares for those flights were displayed.   Specifically, DTS uses a commercial product to obtain information from the  database that contains the applicable flight and airfare information\u2014 commonly referred to as a global distribution system (GDS).In testing  whether DTS displayed the proper flights and airfares, the information  returned from the commercial product was compared with the information  displayed in DTS and was found to be in agreement. However, the  commercial product did not provide all of the appropriate flights or airfares  to DTS that were contained in the GDS. Since the PMO-DTS neither  performed an end-to-end test nor made sure that the information returned  from this commercial product was in agreement with the information  contained in the GDS, it did not have reasonable assurance that DTS was  displaying the proper flight and airfare information to the users.  According to DOD officials, this system weakness was detected by users  complaining that DTS did not display all relevant flights and airfares.   Figure 3 illustrates the inadequacy of the DTS testing.", "PMO-DTS officials acknowledged that these two problems have been  ongoing since the initial implementation of DTS.  Accordingly, as a result of  these two weaknesses, DOD travelers might not have received accurate  information on available flights and airfares, which could have resulted in  higher travel costs.  Further, PMO-DTS officials have stated that the two  problems were corrected as part of the August 2005 DTS system update.   However, we found that the problems have not been entirely corrected as  of the September 2005 release.  In reviewing the documentation relating to  the September 2005 release, we found that (1) the requirements generally  described the functionality that was expected relating to the display of  flights and airfares except that the specific flight order was not adequately  documented and (2) testing was inadequate to provide reasonable  assurance that the DTS system requirements associated with the  reservation module were properly tested.", "Our analysis found that the documentation relating to the testing for the  September 2005 release provided reasonable assurance that the proper  GSA city pair airfares were displayed for a given flight.  However, this  documentation did not provide reasonable assurance that the proper flights  were displayed.  Although we were told by PMO-DTS officials that the  testing efforts had checked the number of flights displayed in the GDS to  those that were displayed by DTS to ensure that DTS was properly  displaying the available flights, adequate documentation was not retained  to verify that this comparison had been made.  In November 2005 we  performed a limited test and found that the system did not properly display  the GSA city pair flights between Chicago, Illinois and Dayton, Ohio.  Our  analysis also identified other problems in the display of flight information.", "More specifically, for the reservation module our analysis found that the  flights actually displayed in DTS did not meet the stated DOD  requirements.  According to PMO-DTS officials, DTS is required to display  up to 25 flights within a 12-hour flight window for domestic flights, with the  GSA city pair flights shown first.  When more than one flight is available  within a category, the flights should then be sorted first by the elapsed  flight time and then by the earliest departure time.  Our review found that  the testing performed for the September 2005 release did not provide  reasonable assurance that these requirements were met. Our analysis of  two frequently used city pairs DOD tested disclosed that DTS (1) displayed  more than the 25 flights, (2) included flights that were outside the flight  window, and (3) did not display the flights in the proper order.  The  following examples illustrate these problems.", "The testing documentation showed that 29 flights were displayed for the  Chicago, Illinois, to Dayton, Ohio, flight and that 11 of these flights were  outside the flight window.  For example, the stated departure time was  9:00 a.m. which means that flights from 3:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. should be  considered for inclusion.  Furthermore, 60 percent of the first 10 flights  were outside of this window and leaving at such times as 3:45 p.m.  (fourth item on the display) and 8:55 p.m. (eighth item on the display).", "Although the stated requirement was to show the flights with GSA city  pairs first, sorted by elapsed flight and earliest departure times, the  testing documentation showed for an October 18, 2005, departure time,  that the first flight displayed in DTS left Washington, D.C., at 6:45 a.m.  and arrived at Columbus, Ohio at 9:30 a.m. with an elapsed flight time of  1 hour and 55 minutes when the user entered a 9:00 a.m. departure time.   However, the documentation also showed that 6:55 a.m. (eleventh item  on the display) and 1:35 p.m. (thirteenth item on the display) departing  flights were also available with elapsed times of about 1 hour and 25  minutes.  Based on the stated requirement, these two flights should have  been shown first and second on the display since they had shorter  elapsed flight times and were also GSA city pair flights.  Furthermore,  the flights with the shortest elapsed flight times were direct flights while  the first flight involved stopping at another airport before arriving at  Columbus, Ohio.", "We believe that one factor contributing to the failure to detect the errors in  displaying the flights in the proper order was that the stated requirements  for the order had not been properly documented.  Specifically, the  requirements that were included in the testing documentation stated that  the flights were to be displayed in the following order: GSA city pair flights  with capacity limits, GSA city pair flights, and all other unrestricted flights.   These requirements did not contain additional information to state that  elapsed flight time and earliest departure time should also be considered in  the display.  As we noted in our September 2005 testimony, requirements  that are not defined are unlikely to be tested.", "PMO-DTS officials stated that subsequent to the September 2005 release,  they had identified the flight order display problem and that it had been  corrected in a subsequent release.  Our limited test in November 2005  showed that the flights were now displayed in the proper order for the two  city pairs for which we had identified problems in the September 2005  testing.  PMO-DTS officials stated that they would investigate the reasons  (1) that more than 25 flights were displayed, (2) why flights that were  outside the 12-hour flight window were displayed, and (3) why all GSA city  pair fights were not included in the display."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DTS Has Corrected Some Previously Reported Travel Problems", "paragraphs": ["DTS has corrected one of the previously reported travel problems, but  others remain.

Subsequently, several policy changes were made to improve  the control and accountability over premium-class travel.  For example, the  approval level for first-class travel was elevated to a three-star general and  for business-class travel to a two-star general or civilian equivalent.  Other  changes included strengthening the description of circumstances when  premium-class travel may be used to more clearly show that it is an  exceptional circumstance and not a common practice.  In all cases, AOs  must have their own premium-class travel approved at the next higher  level. These changes also set a broad policy that CTOs are not to issue  premium-class tickets without proper authorization.  In September 2004,  the PMO-DTS made system changes to DTS that blocked eight fare codes  that were considered to be premium-class fare codes from being displayed  or selected by the traveler through DTS.  According to the PMO-DTS, the  airline industry does not have standardized fare code indicators to identify  first-class, business-class, and economy-class.  Subsequently, DOD found  that economy class fare codes were being blocked using the eight codes  and, in May 2005, reduced the list to three codes.  According to PMO-DTS  officials, these three codes are consistently used among the various airlines  to designate premium-class travel.", "Despite these various changes in policy and to DTS, we continue to identify  instances in which premium-class travel is occurring without the proper  authorization.  Our analysis disclosed at least 68 cases that involve  improper premium-class travel. Table 1 presents a summary of our  analysis.", "DOD regulations require that authorization for premium-class  accommodations be made in advance of travel unless extenuating  circumstances or emergency situations make advance authorization  impossible.  Further, consistent with the Federal Travel Regulation, DOD  restricts premium-class travel to one of the following eight circumstances:  (1) regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination provide only  premium-class accommodations, and this is certified on the travel voucher;  (2) coach class is not available in time to accomplish the purpose of the  official travel, which is so urgent it cannot be postponed; (3) premium-class  travel is necessary to accommodate the traveler\u2019s disability or other  physical impairment, and the condition is substantiated in writing by  competent medical authority; (4) premium-class travel is needed for  security purposes or because exceptional circumstances make its use  essential to the successful performance of the mission; (5) coach-class  accommodations on authorized/approved foreign carriers do not provide  adequate sanitation or meet health standards; (6) premium-class  accommodations would result in overall savings to the government  because of subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time that would  be incurred while awaiting coach-class accommodations;   (7) transportation is paid in full by a nonfederal source; and (8) travel is to  or from a destination outside the continental United States, and the  scheduled flight time is in excess of 14 hours. However, a rest stop is  prohibited when travel is authorized for premium-class accommodations.   Based upon the documentation provided by DOD, we found that none of  the 68 cases meet the above criteria or were approved at the appropriate  level.", "Further, as shown in table 1, we were unable to ascertain if premium-class  travel occurred for 321 travel legs.  For 245 travel legs, no documentation  was received, and for 76 travel legs, the documentation provided was  inconclusive.  On numerous occasions, we requested that the DOD  components provide us with documentation, such as ticket stubs or travel  itineraries, to substantiate whether the travel legs were premium- or  economy-class travel. If the documentation indicated premium-class travel,  we requested that the proper authorization and justification be provided.  At the end of September 2005, the DOD components had not provided the  requested documentation for 245 travel legs. Therefore, we could not  ascertain and\u2014more importantly\u2014on the basis of the documentation  provided, DOD is not in position to determine, if the airfare was for  premium-class or economy-class travel.", "Specific examples of the 68 instances of improperly approved premium- class travel are highlighted below:   A Navy senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8) flew from Norfolk via Detroit to  Seattle, Seattle to Los Angeles, drove from Los Angeles to San Diego,  and flew first class from San Diego via Detroit to Norfolk.  The traveler  charged $1,578 on the government travel card for travel from Norfolk to  Seattle and San Diego to Norfolk, whereas GSA city pair fare was only  $359.  Similarly, the traveler paid $298 to fly from Seattle to Los Angeles  compared to the GSA city pair fare of $149.  The CTO remarked on the  travel authorization that it would not issue a first-class ticket without  properly approved documentation and the lowest government fare was  $414. The traveler submitted the travel voucher and the approving  official (civilian GS-9) approved the premium-class travel costs without  documentation of proper authorization from a premium-class approving  official. According to a Navy official, the traveler purchased his own  ticket at the airport. However, this has no bearing on the fact that  reimbursement was made without the proper authorization.", "A Department of the Army civilian employee (GS-12) flew from  Columbia, South Carolina, via Atlanta, Georgia, to Gulf Port, Mississippi,  to attend a conference.  One leg of the return trip included a first-class  flight.  From our review and analysis of Bank of America data and the  travel voucher, DOD paid $1,107 for the airfare.  The cost of a GSA city  pair round trip airfare was $770.  According to information provided by  the Army, the traveler informed the Army that he was meeting another  traveler at the destination; they were going to share a rental car; and  there were no seats available on the flight the other traveler had booked.  Therefore, the individual selected a flight arriving as close as possible to  the time of the traveler he was meeting. The justification provided by the  traveler is not in accordance with DOD\u2019s criteria.  As a result, the  premium-class fare was not properly approved.", "Fifty-eight of the 68 travel legs identified as premium-class travel were for  international travel, mostly intra-European flights. For 31 of the 58 travel  legs, the CTOs claimed that these flights were the lowest unrestricted fares  available, and therefore it is not necessary to obtain permission for  premium-class travel.  However, effective August 16, 2004, paragraph  U3125-B5.b of the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) and paragraph  C2204-B.5.b of the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) require the approval of  premium-class travel under these circumstances.

The  act directs DOD to put in place a definite management structure  responsible for the control and accountability over business systems  investments, by establishing a hierarchy of investment review boards from  across the department, and directs that the boards use a standard set of  investment review and decision-making criteria to ensure compliance and  consistency with the department\u2019s business enterprise architecture.  The  continuation of the status quo should not be tolerated.

For example, assume that the GSA city  pair rate between city A and city B was $300 and a traveler selected a  restricted airfare for $250. If the traveler incurred a $35 change fee for  personal reasons, then the traveler would be allowed to claim for  reimbursement the $35 fee since the total price of the ticket ($285) was less  than the GSA city pair fare.

A  better approach would be to establish guidance on when unrestricted and  restricted airfares should be used and then monitor how that policy is  implemented. For example, travelers could be instructed to select  restricted airfares when (1) the certainty of the trip occurring is highly  probable, (2) the cost differential between unrestricted and restricted  airfare would cover the costs of at least one change fee, and  (3) the restricted airfare meets mission requirements.  Once these business  rules were defined, DTS could be modified to incorporate them into its  displays of available flights, which would assist the traveler in identifying  restricted airfares that may be of interest and in compliance with DOD  guidance.  Although development of the guidance is an important first step,  management also needs to determine (1) whether the policy was being  followed and (2) what changes are needed to make it more effective. For  example, a periodic review of the change fees associated with restricted  airfares could be made to determine such items as (1) whether, after  consideration of these fees, savings were accruing to the department and  (2) if the change fees were significant, the reasons for those change fees.

Currently, a DOD traveler is required to provide a copy of the  receipt associated with the airline ticket, except when the ticket is  purchased via the CBA. However, adequate information may be available  from automated sources that would provide at least the same degree of  assurance as the receipts.

Besides the airline tickets, information  on the government charge card could also be used to validate the claim for  reimbursement for travel fees paid to the CTO and fuel charges.   Furthermore, if DOD gained access to the information contained in ARC as  discussed previously, then this information could be used to further  support the costs associated with the travel claim.", "Other automated methods that may be able to produce reasonable  assurance of the claim may require consultation with IRS.  For example,  IRS requires that lodging expenses be supported by receipts showing   (1) the name and location of the hotel; (2) the dates the employee stayed  there; and (3) separate amounts for charges such as lodging, meals, and  telephone calls. In the case of federal travel, such information is critical to  determining whether the individual is receiving duplicate reimbursement.  For example, if the employee was reimbursed $70 for lodging expenses,  which included a $5 meal, then that employee could be compensated for  the meal twice\u2014once under the per diem allowance paid and then again  under the lodging expenses. The information currently displayed by the  government charge card vendor does not provide this level of detail.

Reasonable assurance that the amounts actually claimed represented  the actual charges for those items can be obtained by using the data  already captured (or available) through two methods.  First, since DTS  knows the travel claims for a large number of individuals, it will have a  high probability of knowing (1) the lodging expenses incurred by others  at that facility and (2) the applicable tax rate for lodging associated with  a given zip code.  For example, if 10 travelers stay within a given zip  code and the tax rate is 5 percent, then it is reasonable to expect that  another claim in that zip code with a 5 percent tax rate is reasonable.   Second, it may be possible to compare the rate claimed by multiple  individuals at a given facility even though those individuals may not  have been associated with the trip or stayed at the facility on the same  day.  For example, if 5 travelers stayed at hotel A during a 6-month  period and all of them claimed the same for lodging and taxes, then it  would be reasonable to assume that this figure was the actual amount  paid.  Using these techniques, anomalies could be detected.", "The term \u201creasonable assurance\u201d is important because no matter how well  designed and operated, an internal control system cannot provide absolute  assurance that agency objectives will be met. Furthermore, an important  concept in internal control considerations is the relationship between costs  and benefits. Because techniques and technology may allow DOD to  achieve the reasonable assurances needed by IRS that, in effect, require  DOD to obtain lodging and similar receipts, DOD could explore with IRS  acceptable approaches for reducing the number of receipts required for the  paper-based receipt process.  Reducing the need for paper receipts would  also reduce the administrative burden on the travelers and the AOs and the  costs incurred by DOD for capturing and storing these receipts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Overhauling DOD\u2019s financial management and business operations\u2014one of  the largest and most complex organizations in the world\u2014represents a  daunting challenge.  DTS, intended to be the department\u2019s end-to-end travel  management system, illustrates some of the obstacles that must be  overcome by DOD\u2019s array of transformation efforts.  With over 3.3 million  military and civilian personnel as potential travel system users, the sheer  size and complexity of the undertaking overshadows any such project in  the private sector.  Nonetheless, standardized business systems across the  department will be the key to achieving billions of dollars of annual savings  through successful DOD transformation.  As we have previously reported,  because each DOD component receives its own funding for the operation,  maintenance, and modernization of its own systems, nonintegrated,  parochial business systems have proliferated\u20144,150 business systems  throughout the department by a recent count. The elimination of  stovepiped legacy travel systems and cheaper electronic processing, which  could be achieved with the successful implementation of DTS, is critical to  realizing the anticipated savings.  Further, opportunities exist to streamline  the department\u2019s overall travel management practices thereby reducing the  administrative burden and cost without affecting internal controls and, in  some cases, improving internal controls over the department\u2019s travel  management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the department\u2019s management and oversight of DTS and  streamline its administrative process for travel, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense take the following 10 actions:  direct the PMO-DTS to effectively implement the disciplined processes  necessary to provide reasonable assurance that (1) requirements are  properly documented and (2) requirements are adequately tested;     direct the PMO-DTS to properly test new or modified system interfaces  so that the intended functionality is properly operating prior to a  software update being provided to DTS users;  direct the PMO-DTS to require that all CTOs adhere to the department\u2019s  policy on the use of premium-class travel, even in those instances where  it is listed as the only available airfare;   direct the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the  heads of all DOD agencies, to reemphasize that travelers are to justify  exceptions from department policy and the importance of the  authorizing officials not approving any travel authorization in which  exceptions are not properly justified;  direct the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the  heads of all DOD agencies, to routinely monitor, such as on a quarterly  basis, information on the number and cost of processing travel vouchers  outside of DTS and initiate action to eliminate funding for legacy  systems, where applicable;  direct the PMO-DTS to develop and implement the means to automate  the approval of changes to authorized travel expenses where possible;   direct the PMO-DTS to consider the viability of using commercial  databases to identify unused airline tickets, for which reimbursement  should be obtained and help improve the assurance that the actual  travel taken was consistent with the information shown on the travel  voucher;  direct the PMO-DTS to consider simplifying the display of airfares in   direct the PMO-DTS to determine the feasibility of utilizing restricted  airfares, where cost effective; and   direct the PMO-DTS to work with IRS to develop an approach that will  permit the use of automated methods to reduce the need for hard copy  receipts to satisfy requirements to substantiate travel expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Director,  DFAS, which are reprinted in appendix II.

In this regard, we focused on how DTS  addresses issues related to premium-class travel, unused tickets, and  centrally billed accounts (CBA) and the accuracy of claims for travel  reimbursement.  More specifically, to determine if DTS will correct the  weaknesses related to premium-class travel, we  identified and tested all individually billed account (IBA) and CBA  premium-class travel transactions processed by DTS for the first quarter  of fiscal year 2005 (October through December 2004) for proper  approval and justification and   obtained an understanding of the process to purchase properly  approved and justified premium-class travel through DTS, and of the  controls in DTS to prevent a traveler from purchasing premium-class  travel without proper approval.", "To assess the use of premium-class travel for IBA, we obtained from Bank  of America a database of fiscal year 2005 first quarter (October through  December 2004) air travel transactions charged to IBA accounts. The  database contained transaction specific information, such as the price of  the ticket, ticket number, name of passenger, date and destination of travel,  and service code (first, business, or coach class seating accommodations).   We also obtained from the Project Management Office\u2014Defense Travel  System (PMO-DTS) a database containing all vouchers processed by DTS  for the same time period. We extracted all unique Social Security Numbers  (SSN) from the PMO-DTS database and compared the information with the  data from Bank of America.  This comparison resulted in the identification  of the IBA transactions that could be potential premium-class airline  tickets.  We eliminated all airfare charges that were less than $200, which  created a listing of 380 potential premium-class travel IBA charges. In those  instances in which there was insufficient information in DTS to ascertain if  a premium-class airline ticket had been purchased, we requested additional  information from the military services, such as travel itinerary or ticket  stub providing information on the class of service (economy, business,  first) purchased.  We reviewed the travel authorization and all supporting  documentation to determine the class of service provided and determined  if there was proper approval and justification for premium-class travel.", "To ascertain if the CBAs were being used for the purchase of premium- class travel, we followed the same methodology used in reviewing IBAs.   Our comparison resulted in the identification of 244 potential CBA  premium-class travel transactions. The CBA listing only contained the  travelers\u2019 names and not their respective SSNs, therefore we requested  additional information from the military services.  In performing our  analysis of the IBA and CBA, besides the $200 criteria mentioned above, we  also eliminated all airfare transactions that were not processed through  DTS or that we determined were economy-class airfare transactions.  This  process resulted in the identification of potentially 419 transactions in  which a premium-class ticket could have been issued.", "To address the issue of unused airline tickets, we discussed with the PMO- DTS specific actions that were being taken and visited five locations to  ascertain if the commercial travel offices were preparing the unused airline  ticket reports.  In regard to the duplicate payment for airline tickets  purchased through the CBA, we reviewed DTS controls to ascertain if they  were designed to ensure that tickets purchased through the CBA cannot be  claimed on an individual\u2019s travel voucher as a reimbursement to the  traveler.", "To test for the accuracy of travel voucher reimbursements, we utilized the  DTS database previously mentioned covering the first quarter of fiscal year  2005.  From this database, we extracted all temporary duty travel vouchers  where the travel occurred from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004.  We  assumed a 10 percent rate of control violations, and we desired a precision  of +/- 5 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.  These  parameters, along with an assumed 80 percent response rate, led to a  sample size of 173 travel vouchers. Because we followed a probability  procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large  number of samples that we might have drawn.  Since each sample could  have provided different estimates, we express the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or  minus 5 percentage points).  This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.   As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence  intervals in this report will include the true values in the study population.", "To identify some of the challenges confronting DOD in making DTS the  department\u2019s standard travel system, we discussed with PMO-DTS officials  their implementation strategy and reviewed past GAO reports and  testimonies related to the department\u2019s efforts to improve the accuracy and  reliability of the information in its business systems. Additionally, we  analyzed data on the number of systems interfaces that have been  developed and implemented to date and those that need to be developed in  the future.  We also discussed with the PMO-DTS some of the specific  actions that could be taken to further streamline the department\u2019s travel  management practices.  In this regard, we reviewed past GAO reports that  discuss specific actions agencies can take to streamline their respective  travel management practices.", "We assessed the reliability of the DOD data used for our audit by   (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing  existing information about the data and the system that produced them,  and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data.
