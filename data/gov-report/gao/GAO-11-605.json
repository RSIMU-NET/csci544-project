Specifically, GAO identified several distinct ways that 23 of 24 major agencies are using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. These include reposting information available on official agency Web sites, posting information not otherwise available on agency Web sites, soliciting comments from the public, responding to comments on posted content, and providing links to non-government sites. For example, agencies used Facebook to post pictures or descriptions of the activities of agency officials and to interact with the public. Agencies used Twitter to provide information in an abbreviated format and to direct the public back to official agency sites. YouTube was used to provide alternate means of accessing videos available on official agency sites, share videos of agency officials discussing topics of interest, or to solicit feedback from the public. The use of these services can pose challenges in managing and identifying records, protecting personal information, and ensuring the security of federal information and systems. However, the 23 major agencies that GAO identified as using social media have made mixed progress in developing and implementing policies and procedures to address these challenges: (1) Records management: 12 of the 23 agencies have developed and issued guidance that outlines processes and policies for identifying and managing records generated by their use of social media and record-keeping roles and responsibilities. (2) Privacy: 12 agencies have updated their privacy policies to describe whether they use personal information made available through social media, and 8 conducted and documented privacy impact assessments to identify potential privacy risks that may exist in using social media given the likelihood that personal information will be made available to the agency by the public. (3) Security: 7 agencies identified and documented security risks (such as the potential for an attacker to use social media to collect information and launch attacks against federal information systems) and mitigating controls associated with their use of social media. In several cases, agencies reported having policies in development to address these issues. In other cases, agencies reported that there was no need to have policies or procedures that specifically address the use of social media, since these are addressed in existing policies. However, social media technologies present unique challenges and risks, and without establishing guidance and assessing risks specific to social media, agencies cannot be assured that they are adequately meeting their responsibilities to manage and preserve federal records, protect the privacy of personal information, and secure federal systems and information against threats."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that agencies ensure that appropriate records management, privacy, and security measures are in place.

Within its October  2010 bulletin, NARA presented a list of options for how to preserve social  media records, such as Web capture tools to create local versions of sites  and convert content to other formats. NARA officials stated that activities  are underway to provide further assistance to agencies in determining  appropriate methods for capturing social media content as federal  records. Specifically, in January 2011 NARA initiated a working group in  partnership with the Federal Records Council to evaluate Web 2.0 issues  regarding records management and develop strategies for capturing social  media content as federal records. However, NARA has yet to establish a  time frame for issuing new guidance as a result of these efforts. Until  guidance is developed that identifies potential mechanisms for capturing  social media content as records, potentially important records of  government activity may not be appropriately preserved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Made Mixed Progress in Updating Privacy Policies and Assessing Privacy Risks Associated with Use of Social Media Services", "paragraphs": ["Social media services often encourage people to provide extensive  personal information that may be accessible to other users of those  services. Government agencies that participate in such sites may have  access to this information and may need to establish controls on how such  information can be used. We previously reported that, while such agencies  cannot control what information may be captured by social networking  sites, they can make determinations about what information they will  collect and how it will be used. In June 2010, OMB issued memorandum  M-10-23, which specified a variety of actions agencies should take to  protect individual privacy whenever they use third-party Web sites and  applications to engage with the public. Two key requirements established  by OMB were the need for each agency to (1) update its privacy policy in  order to provide the public with information on whether the agency uses  PII made available through its use of third-party Web sites for any purpose,  and (2) conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA) whenever an agency\u2019s  use of a third-party Web site makes PII available to the agency.", "Assessing privacy risks is an important element of conducting a PIA  because it helps agency officials determine appropriate privacy protection  policies and techniques to implement those policies. A privacy risk  analysis should be performed to determine the nature of privacy risks and  the resulting impact if corrective actions are not implemented to mitigate  those risks. Such analysis can be especially helpful in connection with the  use of social media because there is a high likelihood that PII will be made  available to the agency.", "Twelve out of 23 agencies updated their privacy policies to include  discussion on the use of personal information made available through  social media services. In general, agencies stated that while PII was made  available to them through their use of social media services, they did not  collect or use the PII. For example, HUD updated the privacy policy on its  main Web site, www.hud.gov, to state that \u201cno personally identifiable  information (PII) may be requested or collected from  social  media sites.\u201d As another example, the Department of Energy included a  discussion of its policy of removing PII that may be posted on its social  media page, noting that officials reserved the right to moderate or remove  comments that include PII.", "Officials from 5 of the 11 agencies that have not updated their privacy  policies reported taking actions to do so. Officials from 6 additional  agencies (the Departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services,  Labor, and Transportation; the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the Social Security Administration) stated that they  intended to update their privacy policies but did not report taking any  actions to do so.", "Eight agencies conducted PIAs to assess the privacy risks associated with  their use of the three services. For example, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) published a PIA that assessed the risks of the agency\u2019s use  of social networking tools, including the potential for agency access to the  personal information of individuals interacting with the department on  such sites. To mitigate this risk, the department established a policy of  prohibiting the collection of personal information by DHS officials using  social media sites. Likewise, the Department of Transportation completed  a PIA for the use of third-party Web sites and applications, including  Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The PIA outlined, among other things,  what types of PII may potentially be made available to the agency through  its use of social media, including the name, current residence, and age of  users who may friend, follow, subscribe to or otherwise interact with an  official department page on a third-party site. In these instances, the  department\u2019s PIA directed officials to avoid capturing and using the PII  and to redact any PII contained in screenshots that may be saved for  recordkeeping purposes.", "Officials from 13 agencies had not completed PIAs for their use of any of  the social media services, while an additional 2 agencies performed  assessments that only evaluated risks associated with using Facebook.  Officials from 10 of these agencies reported taking actions to conduct the  assessments. Officials from 2 other agencies (the Department of State  and the Small Business Administration) stated that they intended to  conduct assessments but did not report taking any actions to do so.  Officials from the other 3 agencies (the Departments of Agriculture and  the Treasury; and the General Services Administration) stated that they  did not plan to conduct PIAs because they were not planning to collect  personal information provided on their social media sites and, therefore,  an assessment was unnecessary.", "However, OMB\u2019s guidance states that when an agency takes action that  causes PII to become accessible to agency officials\u2014such as posting  information on a Facebook page that allows the public to comment\u2014PIAs  are required. Given that agency officials have access to comments that  may contain PII and could collect and use the information for another  purpose, it is important that an assessment be conducted, even if there are  no plans to save the information to an agency system.", "Without updating privacy policies and performing and publishing PIAs,  agency officials and the public lack assurance that all potential privacy  risks have been evaluated and that protections have been identified to  mitigate them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Made Mixed Progress in Assessing Security Risks Associated with Use of Commercially Provided Social Media Services", "paragraphs": ["Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks continue to pose a potentially  devastating threat to the systems and operations of the federal  government. As part of managing an effective agencywide information  security program to mitigate such threats, FISMA requires that federal  agencies conduct periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm  that could result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of agency information and information  systems. To help agencies implement such statutory requirements, NIST  developed a risk management framework for agencies to follow in  developing information security programs. As part of this framework,  federal agencies are to assess security risks associated with information  systems that process federal agency information and identify security  controls that can be used to mitigate the identified risks. In associated  guidance, NIST highlighted that using such a risk-based approach is also  important in circumstances where an organization is employing  information technology beyond its ability to adequately protect essential  missions and business functions, such as when using commercially  provided social media services. By identifying the potential security  threats associated with use of such third-party systems, agencies can  establish proper controls and restrictions on agency use.", "Seven out of 23 agencies performed and documented security risk  assessments concerning their use of the three social media services. For  example, the Department of Labor outlined the agency\u2019s use of the three  tools within one risk assessment, evaluating potential threats and  vulnerabilities, and recommended controls to mitigate risks associated  with those threats and vulnerabilities. The department identified, among  other things, the potential risk of having unauthorized information posted  to its social media page by agency officials with social media  responsibilities and identified the need for such individuals to receive  training on proper use of social media sites. Additionally, a Department of  Health and Human Services security document stated that, due to risks  associated with use of social media, including the potential for social  media sites to be used as a vehicle for transmitting malicious software, the  department would block use of social media sites\u2014including Facebook,  Twitter, and YouTube\u2014by employees, with specific allowances made for  those with documented business needs.", "According to officials, 16 agencies had not completed and documented  assessments for their use of any of the social media services.

Officials from 2 additional agencies (the Department of Commerce and the  National Science Foundation) stated that they intended to conduct  assessments but did not report taking any actions to do so. Officials at 1  other agency (the Department of State) reported that they did not plan to  conduct assessments because their internal policies and procedures did  not require them to perform risk assessments. As we previously stated,  however, NIST guidance requires the application of the risk management  process to social networking uses to establish proper controls and  restrictions on agency use. Officials from 1 other agency (the Department  of Transportation) reported that they had conducted a security risk  assessment but did not document the results. Without such  documentation, the agency may lack evidence of the justification and  rationale for decisions made based on the risk assessment and,  consequently, the assurance that security controls have been implemented  to properly address identified security threats.", "Without conducting and documenting a risk assessment, agency officials  cannot ensure that appropriate controls and mitigation measures are in  place to address potentially heightened threats associated with social  media, including spear phishing and social engineering."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are increasingly making use of social media technologies,  including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to provide information about  agency activities and interact with the public.

Specifically, just over half of the major agencies using social  media have established policies and procedures for identifying what  content generated by social media is necessary to preserve in order to  ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act, and they continue to  face challenges in effectively capturing social media content as records.  Without clear policies and procedures for properly identifying and  managing social media records, potentially important records of  government activity may not be appropriately preserved. In addition, most  agencies have not updated their privacy policies or assessed the impact  their use of social media may have on the protection of personal  information from improper collection, disclosure, or use, as called for in  recent OMB guidance. Performing PIAs and updating privacy policies can  provide individuals with better assurance that all potential privacy risks  associated with their personal information have been evaluated and that  protections have been identified to mitigate them. Finally, most agencies  did not have documented assessments of the security risks that social  media can pose to federal information or systems in alignment with FISMA  requirements, which could result in the loss of sensitive information or  unauthorized access to critical systems supporting the operations of the  federal government.
