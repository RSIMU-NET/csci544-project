In February 2010, the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy disbanded the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)--a tri-agency satellite acquisition that had encountered continuing cost, schedule, and management problems--and instructed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) to undertake separate acquisitions. Both agencies have begun planning their respective programs--the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS)--including creating program offices and transitioning contracts. GAO was asked to summarize the status of ongoing work assessing (1) NOAA's and DOD's plans for their separate acquisitions and (2) the key risks in transitioning from NPOESS to these new programs. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on the work supporting previous reports, attended monthly program management meetings, reviewed documentation on both programs, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In May 2010, GAO reported on the transition from NPOESS to two separate programs, and recommended that both NOAA and DOD expedite decisions on the cost, schedule, and capabilities of their respective programs. Since that time, both agencies have made progress on their programs, but neither has finalized its plans or fully implemented the recommendations. NOAA is currently focusing on the October 2011 launch of the NPOESS Preparatory Project satellite--a demonstration satellite that the agency now plans to use operationally in order to minimize potential gaps in coverage. In addition, NOAA has transferred contracts for satellite sensors from the NPOESS program to the JPSS program. However, NOAA officials stated that the agency slowed down the development of the first JPSS satellite due to budget constraints, causing a delay in the launch date. As a result, NOAA is facing a potential gap in satellite data continuity. Such a delay could significantly impact the nation's ability to obtain advanced warning of extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Meanwhile, DOD began planning for its satellite program. Department officials reported that DWSS is to consist of two satellites with three sensors: an imager, microwave imager/sounder, and a space environment sensor. The first satellite is to be launched no earlier than 2018. The department has not, however, finalized the cost, schedule, and functionality of the program. It expects to do so in early 2012. Until both NOAA and DOD develop and finalize credible plans for their respective programs, it will not be clear what the programs will deliver, when, and at what cost. In its prior report, GAO also recommended that NOAA and DOD establish plans to mitigate key risks in transitioning from NPOESS to the successor programs, including ensuring effective oversight of JPSS program management, and addressing cost and schedule implications from contract and program changes. Both agencies have taken steps to mitigate these risks, but more remains to be done. For example, NOAA could not provide firm time frames for completing its management control plan or addressing residual contracting issues. Moving forward, it will be important for the agencies to continue efforts to mitigate these risks in order to ensure the success of their respective programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on efforts to  disband and replace the National Polar-orbiting Operational  Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).

Managed jointly by the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department of Defense  (DOD)/U.S. Air Force, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), the program was considered critical to the  nation\u2019s weather forecasting and climate monitoring needs through the  year 2026. However, to address continuing cost, schedule, management,  and technical challenges, the White House\u2019s Office of Science and  Technology Policy decided in February 2010 to disband the NPOESS  acquisition and, instead, to have NOAA and DOD undertake separate  acquisitions. As requested, this statement summarizes ongoing work we  are doing for your full committee to assess the status of NOAA\u2019s and  DOD\u2019s plans for separate acquisitions and key risks in transitioning from  NPOESS to these new programs.", "In preparing this testimony, we relied on the work supporting our previous  reports and on observations from our ongoing work.

Satellites provide a global perspective of the environment and allow  observations in areas that may be otherwise unreachable or unsuitable  for measurements. Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne  observing systems, satellites have become an indispensable part of  measuring and forecasting weather and climate. For example, satellites  provide the graphical images used to identify current weather patterns, as  well as the data that go into numerical weather prediction models. These  models are used to forecast weather 1 to 2 weeks in advance and to  issue warnings about severe weather, including the path and intensity of  hurricanes. Satellite data are also used to warn infrastructure owners  when increased solar activity is expected to affect key assets, including  communication satellites or the electric power grid. When collected over  time, satellite data can also be used to observe climate change\u2014the  trends and changes in the earth\u2019s climate. These data are used to monitor  and project seasonal, annual, and decadal changes in the earth\u2019s  temperature, vegetation coverage, and ozone coverage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The NPOESS Program: Inception, Challenges, and Divergence", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1960s, the United States has operated two separate  operational polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems: the Polar- orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series, which is  managed by NOAA, and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program  (DMSP), which is managed by the Air Force. Two operational DMSP  satellites and one operational POES satellite are currently in orbit and are  positioned so that they cross the equator in the early morning,  midmorning, and early afternoon. In addition, the government relies on a  European satellite, called the Meteorological Operational satellite, for data  in the midmorning orbit. Together, they ensure that, for any region of the  earth, the data provided to users are generally no more than 6 hours old.", "With the expectation that combining the POES and DMSP programs  would reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994  Presidential Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the  two satellite programs into a single satellite program\u2014NPOESS\u2014capable  of satisfying both civilian and military requirements. To manage this  program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed a tri-agency Integrated  Program Office, with NOAA responsible for overall program management  for the converged system and for satellite operations, the Air Force  responsible for acquisition, and NASA responsible for facilitating the  development and incorporation of new technologies into the converged  system.", "When its primary contract was awarded in August 2002, NPOESS was  estimated to cost about $7 billion through 2026 and was considered  critical to the United States\u2019 ability to maintain the continuity of data  required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring. To reduce  the risk involved in developing new technologies and to maintain climate  data continuity, the program planned to launch a demonstration satellite,  called the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) in May 2006. NPP was to  demonstrate selected instruments that would later be included on the  NPOESS satellites. The first NPOESS satellite was to be available for  launch in March 2008.", "However, in the years after the program was initiated, NPOESS  encountered significant technical challenges in sensor development,  program cost growth, and schedule delays. By November 2005, we  estimated that the program\u2019s cost had grown to $10 billion, and the  schedule for the first launch was delayed by almost 2 years. These issues  led to a 2006 restructuring of the program, which reduced the program\u2019s  functionality by decreasing the number of planned satellites, orbits, and  instruments. The restructuring also led agency executives to decide to  mitigate potential data gaps by using NPP as an operational satellite.  Even after the restructuring, however, the program continued to  encounter technical issues in developing two sensors, significant tri- agency management challenges, schedule delays, and further cost  increases. To help address these issues, in recent years we have made a  series of recommendations to, among other things, improve executive- level oversight and develop realistic time frames for revising cost and  schedule baselines.", "Faced with costs that were expected to exceed $14 billion and launch  schedules that were delayed by over 5 years, in August 2009, the  Executive Office of the President formed a task force, led by the Office of  Science and Technology Policy, to investigate the management and  acquisition options that would improve the NPOESS program. As a result  of this review, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy  announced in February 2010 that NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly  procure the NPOESS satellite system; instead, each agency would plan  and acquire its own satellite system. Specifically, NOAA is responsible  for the afternoon orbit and the observations planned for the first and third  NPOESS satellites. DOD is responsible for the early-morning orbit and  the observations planned for the second and fourth NPOESS satellites.

Specifically, NOAA planned to  acquire two satellites (called JPSS-1 and JPSS-2) for launch in 2015 and  2018. NOAA also planned technical changes to the satellites, including  using a smaller spacecraft than the one planned for NPOESS and  removing sensors that were planned for the NPOESS satellites in the  afternoon orbit.", "In addition, NOAA planned to transfer the management of the satellite  acquisition from the NPOESS program office to NASA\u2019s Goddard Space  Flight Center so that it could be co-located at a space system acquisition  center, as advocated by an independent review team. NOAA developed a  team to lead the transition from NPOESS to JPSS and planned to begin  transitioning in July 2010 and complete a transition plan\u2014including cost  and schedule estimates\u2014by the end of September 2010. NOAA  estimated that the JPSS program would cost approximately $11.9 billion  to complete through 2024.

At that  time, DOD expected to make final decisions on the spacecraft, sensors,  procurement strategy, and staffing in August 2010, and to begin the  program immediately.", "In our report, we noted that both agencies faced key risks in transitioning  from NPOESS to their separate programs. These risks included the loss  of key staff and capabilities, delays in negotiating contract changes and  establishing new program offices, the loss of support for the other  agency\u2019s requirements, and insufficient oversight of new program  management.

Over the past year, as  program officials made critical decisions to defer work on JPSS in order to  keep NPP on track, the launch dates for JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 have  changed. Program officials currently estimate that the satellites will launch  in late 2016 and 2021.", "There are two key scenarios that could lead to a gap in satellite data in  the afternoon orbit between the end of life of the NPP satellite and the  availability of the first JPSS satellite. Under the first scenario, NPP  sensors may not last until JPSS-1 is launched. The NASA Inspector  General reported that NASA is concerned that selected NPP sensors may  last only 3 years because of workmanship issues.

Today, the agencies  continue to face key risks in transitioning from NPOESS to their new  programs. These risk areas are discussed below.  \uf0b7  Supporting the other agency\u2019s requirements: As a joint program,  NPOESS was expected to fulfill many military, civilian, and research  requirements for environmental data. However, because the  requirements of NOAA and DOD are different, the agencies may  develop programs that meet their own needs but not the other\u2019s.  Because both NOAA and DOD have not decided on the final  functionality of their respective programs, each could choose to  remove functionality that is important to the other agency and its  users. This has started to occur. NOAA has already made decisions  to remove a transmission capability that is important to the Navy.  Other functions that are currently under consideration (such as  delaying receipt of the data or removing ground processing functions)  could also affect military operations. Agency officials reported that  they formed a joint working group in July 2011 to discuss and mitigate  these issues, but it is too soon to determine what progress has been  made, if any. If the agencies cannot find a way to build an effective  partnership that facilitates both efficient and effective decision-making  on data continuity needs, the needs of both agencies\u2014and their  users\u2014may not be adequately incorporated into the new programs.  \uf0b7  Oversight of new program management: Under its new JPSS  program, NOAA plans to transfer parts of the NPOESS program to  NASA, but it has not yet defined how it will oversee NASA\u2019s efforts.  We have reported that NASA has consistently underestimated time  and cost and has not adequately managed risk factors such as  contractor performance. Because of such issues, we listed NASA\u2019s  acquisition management as a high-risk area in 1990, and it remains a  high-risk area today. NOAA officials reported that they are  developing a management control plan with NASA and intend to  perform an independent review of this plan when it is completed. This  plan has now been in development for about 18 months, and neither  NOAA nor NASA could provide a firm time frame for its completion.  Without strong NOAA oversight of NASA\u2019s management of program  components, JPSS may continue to face the same cost, schedule,  and contract management challenges as the NPOESS program.  \uf0b7  Cost and schedule implications resulting from contract and program  changes: NASA has transferred the sensor development and common  ground systems contracts from the NPOESS contract. However,  NOAA has been in negotiations for at least 6 months with the  NPOESS contractor regarding intellectual property rights for  components of JPSS. The agency could not provide a time frame for  when it expects this issue to be resolved. Until these issues are  resolved, the full cost and schedule implications of contract and  program changes will be unknown.  \uf0b7  Ensuring key staff and capabilities: The NPOESS program office was  composed of NOAA, NASA, Air Force, and contractor staff with  knowledge and experience in the status, risks, and lessons learned  from the NPOESS program. This knowledge would be important to  both programs after the transition period. According to NOAA and  NASA officials, the JPSS program office is now fully staffed. On the  other hand, the DOD program has only staffed approximately 80 out  of 155 positions in its program office. In addition, NOAA officials  acknowledged that they had estimated that a contractor workforce of  approximately 1,600 would work on JPSS activities; however, only  819 are on board due to budget constraints. Unless DOD is proactive  in ensuring that its program office is fully staffed and NOAA  contractors are able to fill all necessary positions, the new programs  may not be able to complete work as scheduled and satellite launches  could be delayed.", "In summary, the NPOESS program was disbanded in the hope that separate  DOD and NOAA programs could prove more successful than the joint  program, that costs and schedules might finally begin to stabilize, and that  the continuity of satellite data critical to both military and civilian missions  would be assured. However, over 18 months later, NOAA and DOD are still  scrambling to establish their respective programs and to develop baseline  cost and schedule estimates for those programs. As a result, it still is not  clear what the programs will deliver, when, and at what cost.", "In addition, the agencies continue to face a number of transition risks,  including the continued need to support each other\u2019s requirements and  residual contracting issues. As NOAA makes difficult decisions on  whether to remove promised JPSS functionality in order to mitigate a  satellite data gap, it will be important to prioritize the functionality and to  work with DOD to ensure that critical requirements are still met. Timely  decisions on cost, schedule, and capabilities are needed to allow both  acquisitions to move forward and to ensure that painful gaps in satellite  data can be minimized. Until both NOAA and DOD can develop and  finalize credible plans for their respective programs, and mitigate or  minimize the risks, neither agency\u2019s users can plan for how to address  this gap.", "Chairman Broun, Chairman Harris, Ranking Member Miller, Ranking  Member Edwards, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes  my prepared statement.
