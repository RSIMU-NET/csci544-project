Overall, MARAD did not employ procedures that would help it adequately manage the financial risk of the program. MARAD could benefit from following the practices of selected private sector maritime lenders. These lenders separate key lending functions, offer less flexibility on key lending standards, use a more systematic approach to loan monitoring, and rely on experts to estimate the value of defaulted assets. With regard to credit reform implementation, MARAD uses a simplistic cash flow model to calculate cost estimates, which have not reflected recent experience. If this pattern of recent experience were to continue, MARAD would have significantly underestimated the cost of the program. MARAD does not operate the program in a businesslike fashion. Consequently, MARAD cannot maximize the use of its limited resources to achieve its mission, and the program is vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Also, because MARAD's subsidy estimates are questionable, Congress cannot know the true costs of the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under the Title XI Loan Guarantee Program, the Maritime Administration  (MARAD) committed to guarantee more than $5.6 billion in shipyard  modernization and ship construction projects over the last 10 years.  During this period, MARAD experienced nine defaults associated with  these loan guarantee commitments totaling over $1.3 billion. The defaulted  amounts associated with these nine loan guarantee commitments totaled  $489 million. Five of these defaults were by subsidiaries of American  Classic Voyages Company (AMCV), a shipowner. AMCV defaults  represented 67 percent of all defaulted amounts experienced by MARAD  during this period, with this borrower having defaulted on guaranteed loan  projects in amounts totaling $330 million. The largest loan guarantee ever  approved by MARAD, for over $1.1 billion, was for Project America, Inc., a  subsidiary of AMCV. Project America, Inc., had entered into a contract in  March 1999 with Northrup Grumman Corporation (formerly Litton Ingalls  Shipbuilding) in Pascagoula, Mississippi, for the construction of two cruise  ships. In October 2001, AMCV filed for bankruptcy, defaulting on $187  million in loan guarantees associated with Project America.", "As of December 31, 2002, MARAD\u2019s portfolio included approximately $3.4  billion in executed loan guarantees, representing 103 projects for 818  vessels and four shipyard modernizations. At the end of fiscal year 2002,  MARAD had approximately $20 million in unexpended, unobligated budget  authority that had been appropriated in prior years. In its 2004 budget, the  administration requested no new funds for the Title XI program.", "Because of concerns about the scale of recent defaults experienced by  MARAD, particularly those associated with AMCV, you asked us to  conduct a study of the Title XI loan guarantee program. Specifically, you  asked us to (1) determine whether MARAD complied with key Title XI  program requirements in approving initial and subsequent agreements,  monitoring and controlling funds, and handling defaults; (2) describe how  MARAD\u2019s practices for managing financial risk compare to those of  selected private-sector maritime lenders; and (3) assess MARAD\u2019s  implementation of credit reform as it relates to the Title XI program.", "To determine whether MARAD complied with key Title XI program  requirements, we identified key program requirements and reviewed how  these were applied to the management of five loan guarantee projects. To  determine how MARAD\u2019s practices for managing financial risk compare to  those of selected private-sector maritime lenders, we interviewed three  maritime lenders to learn about lending practices, and compared these  practices to MARAD\u2019s. To assess MARAD\u2019s implementation of credit  reform, we analyzed MARAD\u2019s subsidy cost estimation and reestimation  processes and examined how the assumptions MARAD uses to calculate  subsidy cost estimates compare to MARAD\u2019s actual program experience.  We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and New York, N.Y., between  September 2002 and April 2003 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Appendix I contains a full description of  our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, authorizes the  Secretary of Transportation to guarantee debt issued for the purpose of  financing or refinancing the construction, reconstruction, or  reconditioning of U.S.-flag vessels or eligible export vessels built in U.S.  shipyards and the construction of advanced and modern shipbuilding  technology of general shipyard facilities located in the United States. Title  XI guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Title XI was created to help promote growth and modernization of the U.S.  merchant marine and U.S. shipyards by enabling owners of eligible vessels  and shipyards to obtain long-term financing on terms and conditions that  might not otherwise be available. Under the program, MARAD guarantees  the payment of principal and interest to purchasers of bonds issued by  vessel and shipyard owners. These owners may obtain guaranteed  financing for up to 87.5 percent of the total cost of constructing a vessel or  modernizing a shipyard. Borrowers obtain funding for guaranteed debt  obligations in the private sector, primarily from banks, pension funds, life  insurance companies, and the general public. MARAD loan guarantees  represent about 10 percent of the U.S.-flagged maritime financing market,  according to MARAD officials. However, MARAD plays a greater role in  certain segments of the maritime finance market. For example, according  to a private-sector maritime lender, MARAD guarantees financing on about  15 percent of the country\u2019s inland barge market.", "Over the last 10 years, MARAD experienced defaults in amounts that  totaled $489 million. One borrower, AMCV, defaulted on five loan  guarantee projects in amounts totaling $330 million, 67 percent of the total  defaulted amounts. Figure 1 shows the nine defaults experienced by  MARAD over the past 10 years, five of which were associated with AMCV  and which are shown in gray.", "Once an applicant submits a Title XI application to MARAD, and prior to  execution of a guarantee, MARAD must determine the economic  soundness of the project, as well as the applicant\u2019s capability to construct  or operate the ship or shipyard. For example, the shipowner or shipyard  must have sufficient operating experience and the ability to operate the  vessels or employ the technology on an economically sound basis. The  shipowner or shipyard must also meet certain financial requirements with  respect to working capital and net worth.", "The amount of the obligations that MARAD may guarantee for a project is  based on the ship or shipyard costs. Title XI permits guarantees not  exceeding 87.5 percent of the actual cost of the ship or shipyard, with  certain projects limited to 75 percent financing. The interest rate of the  guaranteed obligations is determined by the private sector. MARAD also  levies certain fees associated with the Title XI program. For example,  applicants must pay a nonrefundable filing fee of $5,000. In addition, prior  to issuance of the commitment letter, the applicant must pay an  investigation fee against which the filing fee is then credited. Participants  must also pay a guarantee fee, which is calculated by determining the  amount of obligations expected to be outstanding and disbursed to the  shipowner or shipyard during each year of financing.", "The Title XI program is also subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act  (FCRA) of 1990, which was enacted to require that agency budgets reflect  a more accurate measurement of the government\u2019s subsidy costs for direct  loans and loan guarantees. FCRA is intended to provide better cost  comparisons both among credit programs and between credit and  noncredit programs. The credit subsidy cost is the government\u2019s estimated  net cost, in present value terms, of direct or guaranteed loans over the  entire period the loans are outstanding. Credit reform was intended to  ensure that the full cost of credit programs would be reflected in the  budget so that the executive branch and Congress might consider these  costs when making budget decisions. Each year, as part of the President\u2019s  Budget, agencies prepare estimates of the expected subsidy costs of new  lending activity for the upcoming year. Unless OMB approves an  alternative proposal, agencies are also required to reestimate this cost  annually. OMB has oversight responsibility for federal loan program  compliance with FCRA requirements and has responsibility for approving  subsidy estimates and reestimates.", "All credit programs automatically receive any additional budget authority  that may be needed to fund reestimates. For discretionary programs this  means there is a difference in the budget treatment of the original subsidy  cost estimates and of subsidy cost reestimates. The original estimated  subsidy cost must be appropriated as part of the annual appropriation  process and is counted under any existing discretionary funding caps.", "However, any additional appropriation for upward reestimates of subsidy  cost is not constrained by any budget caps. This design could result in a  tendency to underestimate the initial subsidy costs of a discretionary  program. Portraying a loan program as less costly than it really is when  competing for funds means more or larger loans or loan guarantees could  be made with a given appropriation because the program then could rely  on a permanent appropriation for subsequent reestimates to cover any  shortfalls. This built-in incentive is one reason to monitor subsidy  reestimates. Monitoring reestimates is a key control over tendencies to  underestimate costs as well as a barometer of the quality of agencies\u2019  estimation processes.", "When credit reform was enacted, it generally was recognized that agencies  did not have the capacity to implement fully the needed changes in their  accounting systems in the short-term and that the transition to budgeting  and accounting on a present-value basis would be difficult. However,  policy makers expected that once agencies established a systematic  approach to subsidy estimation based on auditable assumptions, present  value-based budgeting for credit would provide them with significantly  better information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MARAD Has Not Fully Complied with Some Key Title XI Program Requirements", "paragraphs": ["MARAD has not fully complied with some key Title XI program  requirements.

MARAD used waivers or modifications, which, although  permitted by MARAD regulations, allowed MARAD to approve some  applications even though borrowers had not met all financial  requirements. MARAD did not fully comply with regulations and  established practices pertaining to project monitoring and fund  disbursement. Finally, while MARAD has guidance governing the  disposition of defaulted assets, adherence to this guidance is not  mandatory, and MARAD did not always follow it in the defaulted cases we  reviewed. We looked at five MARAD-financed projects (see table 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MARAD Used Waivers and Modifications to Approve Loans That Would Otherwise Not Be Approved", "paragraphs": ["MARAD regulations do not permit MARAD to guarantee a loan unless the  project is determined to be economically sound. MARAD generally  complied with requirements to assess an applicant\u2019s economic soundness  before approving loan guarantees, and we were able to find  documentation addressing economic soundness criteria for the projects  included in our review. Specifically, we were able to find documentation  addressing supply and demand projections and other economic soundness  criteria for the projects included in our review. In 2002, MARAD\u2019s Office  of Statistical and Economic Analysis found a lack of a standardized  approach for conducting market analyses. Because of this concern, in  November 2002, it issued guidance for conducting market research on  marine transportation services. However, adherence to these guidelines is  not required. According to the Department of Transportation (DOT)  Assistant Secretary for Administration, the market research guidelines  developed by the Office of Statistical and Economic Analysis were neither  requested nor approved by Title XI program management. Finally, while  MARAD may not waive economic soundness criteria, officials from the  Office of Statistics and Economic Analysis which is responsible for  providing independent assessment of the market impact on economic  soundness expressed concern that their findings regarding economic  soundness might not always be fully considered when MARAD approved  loan guarantees. They cited a recent instance where they questioned the  economic soundness of a project that was later approved without their  concerns being addressed. According to the Associate Administrator for  Shipbuilding, all concerns, including economic soundness concerns, are  considered by the MARAD Administrator.", "Shipowners and shipyard owners are also required to meet certain  financial requirements during the loan approval process. However,  MARAD used waivers or modifications, which, although permitted by Title  XI regulations, allowed MARAD to approve some applications even though  borrowers had not met all financial requirements that pertained to  working capital, long-term debt, net worth, and owner-invested equity.  For example, AMCV\u2019s Project America, Inc., did not meet the qualifying  requirements for working capital, among other things. Although MARAD  typically requires companies to have positive working capital, an excess of  current assets over current liabilities, the accounting requirements for  unterminated passenger payments significantly affect this calculation  because this deferred revenue is treated as a liability until earned.  Because a cruise operator would maintain large balances of current  liabilities, MARAD believed it would be virtually impossible for AMCV to  meet a positive working capital requirement if sound cash management  practices were followed. Subsequently, MARAD used cash flow tests for  Project America, Inc., in lieu of working capital requirements for purposes  of liquidity testing. According to the Assistant Secretary for  Administration, one of the major cruise lines uses cash flow tests as a  measure of its liquidity.", "According to MARAD officials, waivers or modifications help them meet  the congressional intent of the Title XI program, which is to promote the  growth and modernization of the U. S. merchant marine industry. Further,  they told us that the uniqueness of the Title XI projects and marine  financing lends itself to the use of waivers and modifications. However, by  waiving or modifying financial requirements, MARAD officials may be  taking on greater risk in the loans they are guaranteeing. Consequently, the  use of waivers or modifications could contribute to the number or severity  of loan guarantee defaults and subsequent federal payouts. In a recent  review, the Department of Transportation Inspector General (IG) noted  that the use of modifications increases the risk of the loan guarantee to the  government and expressed concern about MARAD undertaking such  modifications without taking steps to mitigate those risks. The IG  recommended that MARAD require a rigorous analysis of the risks from  modifying any loan approval criteria and impose compensating  requirements on borrowers to mitigate these risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MARAD Did Not Follow Requirements for Monitoring the Financial Condition of Projects and for Controlling the Disbursement of Loan Funds", "paragraphs": ["MARAD did not fully comply with requirements and its own established  practices pertaining to project monitoring and fund disbursement.  Program requirements specify periodic financial reporting, controls over  the disbursement of loan funds, and documentation of amendments to  loan agreements. MARAD could not always demonstrate that it had  complied with financial reporting requirements. In addition, MARAD could  not always demonstrate that it had determined that projects had made  progress prior to disbursing loan funds. Also, MARAD broke with its own  established practices for determining the amount of equity a shipowner  must invest prior to MARAD making disbursements from the escrow  fund. MARAD did so without documenting this change in the loan  agreement. Ultimately, weaknesses in MARAD\u2019s monitoring practices  could increase the risk of loss to the federal government.", "MARAD regulations specify that the financial statements of a company in  receipt of a loan guarantee shall be audited at least annually by an  independent certified public accountant. In addition, MARAD regulations  require companies to provide semiannual financial statements. However,  MARAD could not demonstrate that it had received required annual and  semiannual statements. For example, MARAD could not locate several  annual or semiannual financial statements for the Massachusetts Heavy  Industries (MHI) project. Also, MARAD could not find the 1999 and 2000  semiannual financial reports for AMCV. The AMCV financial statements  were later restated, as a result of a Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) finding that AMCV had not complied with generally accepted  accounting principles in preparing its financial statements. In addition,  several financial statements were missing from MARAD records for Hvide  Van Ommeran Tankers (HVIDE) and Global Industries Ltd. When MARAD  could provide records of financial statements, it was unclear how the  information was used. Further, the Department of Transportation  Inspector General (IG) in its review of the Title XI program found that  MARAD had no established procedures or policies incorporating periodic  reviews of a company\u2019s financial well-being once a loan guarantee was  approved.", "An analysis of financial statements may have alerted MARAD to financial  problems with companies and possibly given it a better chance to  minimize losses from defaults. For example, between 1993 and 2000,  AMCV had net income in only 3 years and lost a total of $33.3 million. Our  analysis showed a significant decline in financial performance since 1997.  Specifically, AMCV showed a net income of $2.4 million in 1997, with  losses for the next 3 years, and losses reaching $10.1 million in 2000.  Although AMCV\u2019s revenue increased steadily during this period by a total  of 25 percent, or nearly $44 million, expenses far outpaced revenue during  this period. For example, the cost of operations increased 29 percent, or  $32.3 million, while sales and general and administrative costs increased  over 82 percent or $33.7 million. During this same period, AMCV\u2019s debt  also increased over 300 percent. This scenario combined with the decline  in tourism after September 11, 2001, caused AMCV to file for bankruptcy.", "On May 22, 2001 Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding notified AMCV that it was in  default of its contract due to nonpayment. Between May 22 and August 23,  2001, MARAD received at least four letters from Ingalls, the shipbuilder,  citing its concern about the shipowner\u2019s ability to pay construction costs.  However, it was not until August 23 that MARAD prepared a financial  analysis to help determine the likelihood of AMCV or its subsidiaries  facing bankruptcy or another catastrophic event.", "MARAD could not always demonstrate that it had linked disbursement of  funds to progress in ship construction, as MARAD requires. We were not  always able to determine from available documents the extent of progress  made on the projects included in our review. For example, a number of  Project America, Inc., disbursement requests did not include  documentation that identified the extent of progress made on the project.  Also, while MARAD requires periodic on-site visits to verify the progress  on ship construction or shipyard refurbishment, we did not find evidence  of systematic site visits and inspections. For Project America, Inc.,  MARAD did not have a construction representative committed on-site at  Ingalls Shipyard, Inc. until May 2001, 2 months after the MARAD\u2019s Office  of Ship Design and Engineering Services recommended a MARAD  representative be located on-site. For the Searex Title XI loan guarantee,  site visits were infrequent until MARAD became aware that Ingalls had cut  the vessels into pieces to make room for other projects. For two projects  rated low-risk, Hvide Van Ommeran Tankers and Global Industries, Ltd.,  we found MARAD conducted site visits semiannually and annually,  respectively. We reviewed MHI\u2019s shipyard modernization project, which  was assigned the highest risk rating, and found evidence that construction  representatives conducted monthly site visits. However, in most instances,  we found that a project\u2019s risk was not routinely linked to the extent of  project monitoring. Further, without a systematic approach to on-site  visits, MARAD relied principally on the shipowner\u2019s certification and  documentation of money spent in making decisions to approve  disbursements from the escrow fund.", "We also found that, in a break with its own established practice, MARAD  permitted a shipowner to define total costs in a way that permitted earlier  disbursement of loan funds from the escrow fund. MARAD regulations  require that shipowners expend from their own funds at least 12.5 percent  or 25 percent, depending on the type of vessel or technology, of the actual  cost of a vessel or shipyard project prior to receiving MARAD-guaranteed  loan funds. In practice, MARAD has used the estimated total cost of the  project to determine how much equity the shipowner should provide. In  the case of Project America, Inc., the single largest loan guarantee in the  history of the program, we found that MARAD permitted the shipowner to  exclude certain costs in determining the estimated total costs of the ship  at various points in time, thereby deferring owner-provided funding while  receiving MARAD-guaranteed loan funds. This was the first time MARAD  used this method of determining equity payments, and MARAD did not  document this agreement with the shipowner as required by its policy. In  September 2001, MARAD amended the loan commitment for this project,  permitting the owner to further delay the payment of equity. By then,  MARAD had disbursed $179 million in loan funds. Had MARAD followed  its established practice for determining equity payments, the shipowner  would have been required to provide an additional $18 million. Because  MARAD had not documented its agreements with AMCV, the amount of  equity the owner should have provided was not apparent during this  period. Further, MARAD systems do not flag when the shipowner has  provided the required equity payment for any of the projects it finances.", "MARAD officials cited several reasons for its limited monitoring of Title XI  projects, including insufficient staff resources, travel budget restrictions  and limited enforcement tools. For example, officials of MARAD\u2019s Office  of Ship Construction, which is responsible for inspection of vessels and  shipyards, told us that they had only two persons available to conduct  inspections, and that the office\u2019s travel budget was limited. The MARAD  official with overall responsibility for the Title XI program told us that, at a  minimum, the Title XI program needs three additional staff. The Office of  Ship Financing needs two additional persons to enable a more thorough  review of company financial statements and more comprehensive  preparation of credit reform materials. Also, the official said that the  Office of the Chief Counsel needs to fill a long-standing vacancy to enable  more timely legal review. With regard to documenting the analysis of  financial statements, MARAD officials said that, while they do require  shipowners and shipyard owners to provide financial statements, they do  not require MARAD staff to prepare a written analysis of the financial  condition of the Title XI borrower. MARAD Assistant Secretary for  Administration noted that if financial documents were not submitted after  a request for missing documents was made, MARAD\u2019s only legal recourse  was to call the loan in default, pay off the Title XI debt and then seek  recovery against the borrower.", "He said that MARAD tries to avoid takings these steps. We found no  evidence that MARAD routinely requested missing financial statements or  did any analysis. Also, the IG report on the Title XI program released in  March 2003 noted that MARAD does not closely monitor the financial  health of its borrowers over the term of their loans. We recognize that  MARAD has limited enforcement resources, however, for such publicly  traded companies as AMCV, financial statements filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission could be used. However, we found no  evidence that MARAD attempted to use SEC filings.", "Inconsistent monitoring of a borrower\u2019s financial condition limits  MARAD\u2019s ability to protect the federal government\u2019s financial interests.  For example, MARAD would not know if a borrower\u2019s financial condition  had changed so that it could take needed action to possibly avoid defaults  or minimize losses. Further, MARAD\u2019s practices for assessing project  progress limit its ability to link disbursement of funds to progress made by  shipowners or shipyard owners. This could result in MARAD disbursing  funds without a vessel or shipyard owner making sufficient progress in  completing projects. Likewise, permitting project owners to minimize their  investment in MARAD-financed projects increases the risk of loss to the  federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MARAD Does Not Have Requirements in Place to Govern the Handling of Defaulted Assets", "paragraphs": ["MARAD has guidance governing the disposition of defaulted assets.  However, MARAD is not required to follow this guidance, and we found  that MARAD does not always adhere to it. MARAD guidelines state that an  independent, competent marine surveyor or MARAD surveyor shall survey  all vessels, except barges, as soon as practicable after the assets are taken  into custody. In the case of filed or expected bankruptcy, an independent  marine surveyor should be used. In the case of Searex, MARAD conducted  on-site inspections after the default. However, these inspections were not  conducted in time to properly assess the condition of the assets. With  funds no longer coming in from the project, Ingalls cut the vessels into  pieces to make it easier to move the vessels from active work-in-process  areas to other storage areas within the property. The Searex lift boat and  hulls were cut before MARAD inspections were made. According to a  MARAD official, the cutting of one Searex vessel and parts of the other  two Searex vessels under construction reduced the value of the defaulted  assets. The IG report on the Title XI program released in March 2003 noted  that site visits were conducted on guaranteed vessels or property only in  response to problems or notices of potential problems from third parties  or from borrowers.", "The guidelines also state that sales and custodial activities shall be  conducted in such a fashion as to maximize MARAD\u2019s overall recovery  with respect to the asset and debtor. Market appraisals (valuations) of the  assets shall be performed by an independent appraiser, as deemed  appropriate, to assist in the marketing of the asset. MARAD did not have a  market appraisal for the defaulted Project America assets. Also, MARAD  relied on an interested party to determine the cost of making Project  America I seaworthy. An appraisal of Project America assets immediately  after default would have assisted MARAD in preparing a strategy for  offering the hull of Project America I and the parts of Project America II  for sale. According to MARAD officials, as of March 2003, MARAD had  received $2 million from the sale of the Project America I and II vessels.  Without a market appraisal, it is unclear whether this was the maximum  recovery MARAD could have received.", "MARAD hired the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to verify the  costs incurred by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc., since January 1,  2002, for preparing and delivering Project America I in a weather-tight  condition suitable for ocean towing in international waters. A MARAD  official said that the DCAA audit would allow MARAD to identify any  unsupported costs and recover these amounts from the shipyard. The  DCAA review was used to verify costs incurred, but not to make a  judgment as to the reasonableness of the costs. DCAA verified costs of  approximately $17 million.", "MARAD officials cite the uniqueness of the vessels and projects as the  reason for using guidelines instead of requirements for handling defaulted  assets. However, certain practices for handling defaulted assets can be  helpful regardless of the uniqueness of a project. Among these are steps to  immediately assess the value of the defaulted asset. Without a definitive  strategy and clear requirements, defaulted assets may not always be  secured, assessed, and disposed of in a manner that maximizes MARAD\u2019s  recoveries\u2014resulting in unnecessary costs and financial losses to the  federal government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "MARAD Techniques to Manage Financial Risk Contrast to Techniques of Selected Private- sector Maritime Lenders", "paragraphs": ["Private-sector maritime lenders we interviewed told us that it is imperative  for lenders to manage the financial risk of maritime lending portfolios.

The lenders try to be very selective  when originating loans for the shipping industry. While realizing that  MARAD does not operate for profit, it could benefit from the internal  control practices employed by the private sector to more effectively utilize  its limited resources and to enhance its ability to accomplish its mission.

For example, marketing  executives from two private-sector maritime lending institutions stated  that they do not have lending authority. Also, separate individuals are  responsible for accepting applications and processing transactions for  loan underwriting.", "In contrast, we found that the same office that promotes and markets the  MARAD Title XI program also has influence and authority over the office  that approves and monitors Title XI loans. In February 1998, MARAD  created the Office of Statistical and Economic Analysis in an attempt to  obtain independent market analyses and initial recommendations on the  impact of market factors on the economic soundness of projects. Today,  this office reports to the Associate Administrator for Policy and  International Trade rather than the Associate Administrator for  Shipbuilding. However, the Associate Administrator for Shipbuilding is  primarily responsible for overseeing the underwriting and approving of  loan guarantees. Title XI program management is primarily handled by  offices that report to the Associate Administrator for Shipbuilding. In  addition, the same Associate Administrator controls, in collaboration with  the Chief of the Division of Ship Financing Contracts within the Office of  the Chief Counsel, the disposition of assets after a loan has defaulted.  Most recently, MARAD has taken steps to consolidate responsibilities  related to loan disbursements. In August 2002, the Maritime Administrator  gave the Associate Administrator for Shipbuilding sole responsibility for  reviewing and approving the disbursement of escrow funds. According to  a senior official, prior to August 2002 this responsibility was shared with  the Office of Financial and Rate Approvals under the supervision of the  Associate Administrator for Financial Approvals and Cargo Preference. As  a result of the consolidation, the same Associate Administrator who is  responsible for underwriting and approving loan guarantees and disposing  of defaulted assets is also responsible for approval of loan disbursements  and monitoring financial condition. MARAD undertook this consolidation  in an effort to improve performance of analyses related to the calculation  of shipowner\u2019s equity contributions and monitoring of changes in financial  condition. However, as mentioned earlier, MARAD does not have controls  for clearly identifying the shipowner\u2019s required equity contribution. The  consolidation of responsibilities for approval of loan disbursements does  not address these weaknesses and precludes any potential benefit from  separation of duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private-sector Practices Employ Less Flexible Lending Standards", "paragraphs": ["The private-sector lenders we interviewed said they apply rigorous  financial tests for underwriting maritime loans. They analyze financial  statements such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow  statements, and use certain financial ratios such as liquidity and leverage  ratios that indicate the borrower\u2019s ability to repay. Private-sector maritime  lenders told us they rarely grant waivers, or exceptions, to underwriting  requirements or approve applications when borrowers do not meet key  minimum requirements. Each lender we interviewed said any approved  applicants were expected to demonstrate stability in terms of cash on  hand, financial strength, and collateral. One lender told us that on the rare  occasions when exceptions to the underwriting standards were granted,  an audit committee had to approve any exception or waiver to the  standards after reviewing the applicant\u2019s circumstances. However,  according to one MARAD official the waivers are often made without a  deliberative process. Nonetheless, MARAD points to its concurrence  system as a deliberative process for key agency officials to concur on loan  guarantees and major waivers and modifications. However, as mentioned  earlier, the official responsible for performing a macro analysis of the  market is not always included in the concurrence process. We found in the  cases we reviewed that MARAD often permits waivers or modifications of  key financial requirements.

For example, two lenders stated that they annually analyzed  financial statements such as income statements and balance sheets. The  third lender evaluated financial statements quarterly. Based on the results  of these financial statement reviews, private-sector lenders then reviewed  and evaluated the risk ratings that had been assigned at the time of  approval. Two lenders commented that higher risk ratings indicated a  need for closer supervision, and they then might require the borrower to  submit monthly or quarterly financial statements. In addition, a borrower  might be required to increase cash reserves or collateral to mitigate the  risk of a loan. Further, the lender might accelerate the maturity date of the  loan. MARAD notes that in certain cases, such as a loan guarantee to a  subsidiary of Enron, it already uses such requirements. The DOT IG noted  that MARAD should place covenants in its loan guarantees concerning the  required financial performance and condition of its borrowers, as well as  measures to which MARAD is entitled should these provisions be violated.

For loan guarantees, this cost, known as the subsidy cost, is the present  value of estimated cash flows from the government, primarily to pay for  loan defaults, minus estimated loan guarantee fees paid and recoveries to  the government. Agency management is responsible for accumulating  relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on which to base the estimate and for  establishing and using reliable records of historical credit performance. In  addition, agencies are supposed to use a systematic methodology to  project expected cash flows into the future. To accomplish this task,  agencies are instructed to develop a cash flow model, using historical  information and various assumptions including defaults, prepayments,  recoveries, and the timing of these events, to estimate future loan  performance.", "MARAD uses a relatively simplistic cash flow model, which contains five  assumptions\u2014default amount, timing of defaults, recovery amount, timing  of recoveries, and fees\u2014to estimate the cost of the Title XI loan guarantee  program. We found that relatively minor changes in these assumptions can  significantly affect the estimated cost of the program and that, thus far,  three of the five assumptions, default and recovery amounts and the timing  of defaults, differed significantly from recent actual historical experience.

Therefore, we believe MARAD\u2019s  subsidy cost estimates to be questionable. Because MARAD has not  evaluated its default and recovery rate assumptions since they were  developed in 1995, the agency does not know whether its cash flow model  is reasonably predicting borrower behavior and whether its estimates of  loan program costs are reasonable.", "The nature and characteristics of the Title XI program make it difficult to  estimate subsidy costs. Specifically, MARAD approves a small number of  guarantees each year, leaving it with relatively little experience on which  to base estimates for the future. In addition, each guarantee is for a large  dollar amount, and projects have unique characteristics and cover several  sectors of the market. Further, when defaults occur, they are usually for  large dollar amounts and may not take place during easily predicted time  frames. Recoveries may be equally difficult to predict and may be affected  by the condition of the underlying collateral. This leaves MARAD with  relatively limited information upon which to base its credit subsidy  estimates. Also, MARAD may not have the resources to properly  implement credit reform. MARAD officials expressed frustration that they  do not have and, therefore, cannot devote, the necessary time and  resources to adequately carry out their credit reform responsibilities.", "Notwithstanding these challenges, MARAD has not performed the basic  analyses necessary to assess and improve its estimates. According to  MARAD officials, they have not analyzed the default and recovery rates  because most of their loan guarantees are in about year 7 out of the 25- year term of the guarantee, and it is too early to assess the reasonableness  of the estimates. We disagree with this assessment and believe that an  analysis of the past 5 years of actual default and recovery experience is  meaningful and could provide management with valuable insight into how  well its cash flow models are predicting borrower behavior and how well  its estimates are predicting the loan guarantee program\u2019s costs.

Eight of these nine defaults, totaling  $487.7 million, occurred since MARAD implemented its risk category  system in 1996. Because these eight defaults represent the vast majority  (99.6 percent) of MARAD\u2019s default experience, we compared the  performance of all loans guaranteed between 1996\u20132002 with MARAD\u2019s  estimates of loan performance for this period. We found that actual loan  performance has differed significantly from agency estimates. For  example, when defaults occurred, they took place much sooner than  estimated. On average, defaults occurred 4 years after loan origination,  while MARAD had estimated that, depending on the risk category, peak  defaults would occur between years 10\u201318. Also, actual default costs thus  far have been much greater than estimated. We estimated, based on  MARAD data, that MARAD would experience $45.5 million in defaults to  date on loans originated since 1996. However, as illustrated by figure 2,  MARAD has consistently underestimated the amount of defaults the Title  XI program would experience. In total, $487.7 million has actually  defaulted during this period\u2014more than 10 times greater than estimated.  Even when we excluded AMCV, which represents about 68 percent of the  defaulted amounts, from our analysis, we found that the amount of  defaults MARAD experienced greatly exceeded what MARAD estimated it  would experience by $114.6 million (or over 260 percent).", "In addition, MARAD\u2019s estimated recovery rate of 50 percent of defaulted  amounts within 2 years of default is greater than the actual recovery rate  experienced since 1996, as can be seen in figure 3. Although actual  recoveries on defaulted amounts since 1996 have taken place within 1\u20133  years of default, most of these recoveries were substantially less than  estimated, and two defaulted loans have had no recoveries to date. For the  actual defaults that have taken place since 1996, MARAD would have  estimated, using the 50 percent recovery rate assumption, that it would  recover approximately $185.3 million dollars. However, MARAD has only  recovered $94.9 million or about 51 percent of its estimated recovery  amount. When we excluded AMCV, which represents about 68 percent of  the defaulted amounts, from our analysis, we found that MARAD has more  accurately estimated the amount it would recover on defaulted loans, and  in fact, has underestimated the actual amount by about $10 million (or  about 15 percent). If the overall pattern of recent default and recovery  experiences were to continue, MARAD would have significantly  underestimated the costs of the program.", "We also attempted to analyze the process MARAD uses to designate risk  categories for projects, but were unable to do so because the agency could  not provide us with any documentation about how the risk categories and  MARAD\u2019s related numerical weighting system originally were developed.", "According to OMB guidance, risk categories are subdivisions of a group of  loans that are relatively homogeneous in cost, given the facts known at the  time of designation. Risk categories combine all loan guarantees within  these groups that share characteristics that are statistically predictive of  defaults and other costs. OMB guidance states that agencies should  develop statistical evidence based on historical analysis concerning the  likely costs of expected defaults for loans in a given risk category. MARAD  has not done any analysis of the risk category system since it was  implemented in 1996 to determine whether loans in a given risk category  share characteristics that are predictive of defaults and other costs and  thereby comply with guidance. In addition, according to a MARAD official,  MARAD\u2019s risk category system is partially based on outdated MARAD  regulations and has not been updated to reflect changes to these  regulations.", "Further, MARAD\u2019s risk category system is flawed because it does not  consider concentrations of credit risk. To assess the impact of  concentration risk on MARAD\u2019s loss experience, we analyzed the defaults  for loans originated since 1996 and found that five of the eight defaults,  totaling $330 million, or 68 percent of total defaults, involved loan  guarantees that had been made to one particular borrower, AMCV.  Assessing concentration of credit risk is a standard practice in private- sector lending. According to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Commercial  Bank Examination Manual, limitations imposed by various state and  federal legal lending limits are intended to prevent an individual or a  relatively small group from borrowing an undue amount of a bank\u2019s  resources and to safeguard the bank\u2019s depositors by spreading loans  among a relatively large number of people engaged in different businesses.

Reestimates allow agency management to compare original  budget estimates with actual costs to identify variances from the original  estimates, assess the reasonableness of the original estimates, and adjust  future program estimates, as appropriate.

However, without conducting  our own independent analysis of these and other factors, we were unable  to determine whether any of MARAD\u2019s reestimates were reasonable.  Further, MARAD has reestimated the loans that were disbursed in fiscal  years 1993, 1994, and 1995 downward so that they now have negative  subsidy costs, indicating that MARAD expects these loans to be profitable.  However, according to the default assumptions MARAD uses to calculate  its subsidy cost estimates, these loans have not been through the period of  peak default, which would occur in years 10\u201318 depending on the risk  category. MARAD officials told us that several of these loans were paid off  early, and the risk of loss in the remaining loans is less than the estimated  fees paid by the borrowers. However, MARAD officials were unable to  provide us with adequate supporting information for its assessment of the  borrowers\u2019 financial condition and how it determined the estimated  default and recovery amounts to assess the reasonableness of these  reestimates. Our analysis of MARAD\u2019s defaults and recoveries  demonstrates that, when defaults occur, they occur sooner and are for far  greater amounts than estimated, and that recoveries are smaller than  estimated.

The  department believes it is important for us to recognize that most projects  (70 percent) have been for mortgage period financing because there are no  disbursements made from an escrow fund for these types of projects, and  there is virtually no need for agency monitoring of the construction  process for these types of projects because the ship owner does not  receive any Title XI funds until the vessel has been delivered and certified  by the regulatory authorities as seaworthy. We believe that projects  involving construction financing are at greater risk of fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement, and therefore require a greater level of oversight  compared to projects involving only mortgage period financing.

We believe that while the use of rigorous  program guidelines may not have prevented Ingalls from dismantling the  vessels, adherence to existing program guidelines would have provided  evidence of the value and condition of the assets at the time of default.  This documentary evidence would be advantageous if legal action  occurred. In the case of Project America, DOT believes that the report  incorrectly asserts that MARAD relied on an interested party, Ingalls  Shipbuilding, Inc., to determine the value of the Project America I assets.  The department believes that MARAD relied on the shipbuilder only to  provide an estimate of the cost of making Project America seaworthy. We  revised the report to reflect that MARAD did not obtain a market appraisal  of the assets, and that it relied on Ingalls to estimate the cost of making the  vessel seaworthy. We believe that in order to market the Project America  assets, MARAD needs to know the costs of the available options including  the cost of making the hull seaworthy.", "The department also believes that the report does not convey a clear  understanding of DCCA\u2019s role in the handling of Project America assets  after default. We disagree with this assertion, and believe that the report  appropriately reflects DCCA\u2019s role as outlined in its report entitled the  Application of Agreed-Upon Procedures Incurred on Project America.", "DOT believes that the report uses a number of examples to show that  granting waivers or \u201cother occurrences\u201d related to program guidelines  somehow contributed to the three defaults among the cases studied and  expresses concern that the report concludes that weak program oversight  contributed to the defaults examined in the draft. First, the report  correctly notes that MARAD is permitted to approve waivers under certain  circumstances. Nonetheless, waiving financial requirements increases the  risk borne by the federal government. MARAD is now recognizing this by  agreeing to implement the IG recommendations calling for compensating  provisions to mitigate risk when approving waivers. Second, the program\u2019s  vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement is not only due to  MARAD not complying with program requirements, but also because  MARAD lacks requirements for the management of defaulted assets, does  not utilize basic internal control practices, such as separation of duties,  and cannot reasonably estimate the program\u2019s cost.", "With regard to the private sector comparison, DOT does not agree that  MARAD lacks a deliberative process for loan approvals. The department  believes that, in each written loan guarantee analysis, MARAD discusses  the basis for granting major modifications or waivers. Also, DOT believes  MARAD has a deliberative process through its written concurrence system  whereby key agency offices have to concur on actions authorizing waivers  or modifications. We revised the report to reflect the differing opinions of  MARAD officials regarding the process for approving loan guarantees and  waivers or modifications. We believe that it is not clear that MARAD uses a  deliberative process and our review of the project files showed that key  agency offices were not always included in the concurrence process.", "DOT believes that the report should acknowledge that MARAD maintains  separation of duties for disbursement. The report correctly notes that the  ultimate decision to disburse funds is made by the same office that  approves and monitors the Title XI loans. We added the name of the office  that it then instructs to disburse funds.", "DOT noted that certain lenders consolidate rather than separate approval  and monitoring functions in order to improve efficiencies. The lenders we  spoke to, who are major marine lenders, do not combine these functions.  They also separate approval and monitoring functions from marketing and  disposition functions. Further, we do not believe that efficiencies achieved  through consolidating these functions outweigh the greater vulnerability  to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement associated with consolidation.", "The department believes that MARAD\u2019s determination of subsidy costs is  in accordance with OMB guidance. While we did not assess MARAD\u2019s  compliance with OMB guidance, MARAD did not comply with other  applicable, more specific guidance, which states that estimated cash flows  should be compared to actuals, and estimates should be based on the best  available data. The guidance is in the Accounting and Auditing Policy  Committee\u2019s Technical Release 3, Preparing and Auditing Direct Loan  and Loan Guarantee Subsidies Under the Federal Credit Reform Act.  This guidance was developed by an interagency group including members  from OMB, Treasury, GAO, and various credit agencies to provide detailed  implementation guidance on how to prepare reasonable credit subsidies.  Regardless of whether MARAD complied with all applicable guidance,  because MARAD did not conduct this fundamental analysis to assess  whether its cash flow model was reasonably predicting borrower  behavior, it did not know that for the past 5 years, defaults were occurring  at a much higher rate and costing significantly more than estimated, and  recoveries were significantly less than expected. In addition, MARAD did  not appropriately incorporate these higher default rates and lower  recovery rates into its cash flow models.", "The department also stated that the report should recognize that, as a  result of its full compliance with FCRA, MARAD set aside adequate funds  for all defaults to date. While MARAD may have complied with some of the  broad requirements of FCRA in preparing estimates and reestimates, these  estimates were based on outdated assumptions and MARAD could not  demonstrate that the estimates were based on historical data or other  meaningful analyses. Further, DOT\u2019s response does not recognize that the  appropriated funds are to cover expected losses over the life of the loan  guarantee program. Because actual losses for the last 5 years have been  significantly more and recoveries significantly less than expected, in the  future actual losses will need to be significantly less and recoveries  significantly more than estimated for MARAD not to require additional  funding.", "In addition, DOT believes that our analysis of MARAD\u2019s subsidy estimates  was inaccurate and based on incomplete or incorrect data, and that we  underreported actual recoveries from one of the defaulted projects (MHI).  We disagree and believe our analysis was accurate, based on the  information MARAD had provided. In its comments, the department  provided new information on recoveries for the MHI project. We have now  incorporated this new data, as appropriate, into our analysis. We did not  include data provided on guarantee fees because these are paid upfront  and should not be included in estimates of recoveries.", "The department also provided technical comments, which we have  incorporated as appropriate. The department\u2019s comments appear in  appendix II.", "OMB agreed that recent recovery expectations on certain defaulted  guarantees cited in our report should be incorporated into future  reestimates, and plans to ensure that these expectations are reflected in  next year\u2019s budget. Further, OMB plans to work with MARAD to review  recovery expectations for other similar loan guarantees. In addition, OMB  has been working with DOT and MARAD staff to implement  recommendations contained in the IG report, and expects that resulting  changes will also address many of the concerns raised in our report.", "OMB disagreed with our finding that it provided little review and oversight  of MARAD\u2019s subsidy cost estimates and reestimates and points to the  substantial amount of staff time it devotes to working with agencies on  subsidy cost estimates. OMB claims that the data used in our report does  not seem to support our assertion of a lack of OMB oversight and  disagrees with our implication that the overall subsidy rates would be  higher if it had provided oversight. We clarified our report to convey the  message that if OMB had provided greater oversight, it would have  realized that MARAD did not have adequate support for the default and  recovery assumptions it uses to calculate subsidy cost estimates.  While  OMB asserts that the number of default claims made between 1992 and  1999 is substantially in line with the assumptions underlying the estimated  subsidy costs, we could not verify the magnitude and timing of defaults  prior to the period included in our review (1996\u20132002) because MARAD  could not provide data on historical default experience. Because MARAD  could not provide adequate support for its default and recovery  assumptions, we question the basis for the estimates and whether OMB  had provided sufficient oversight. We continue to believe that MARAD\u2019s  recent actual experience was significantly different than what MARAD had  estimated and OMB had approved. Even when we exclude all of the AMCV  projects, as well as the MHI project, from our analysis, we found that the  amount of defaults MARAD experienced exceeded what MARAD  estimated it would experience by $63.3 million (or about 177 percent).  Should the program receive new funding in the future, the subsidy rate  estimates should be calculated using updated default and recovery  assumptions to incorporate recent actual experience.", "OMB also took issue with our use of data on the eight defaults, particularly  those involving AMCV and MHI, in questioning MARAD\u2019s most recent  reestimates of the costs of loans guaranteed between 1992 and 1995.  However, we continue to question the reasonableness of the negative  subsidies for the loans that were disbursed in fiscal years 1993, 1994, and  1995. First, the loans in these cohorts have not been through what MARAD  considers the period of peak default\u2014years 10\u201318 depending on the risk  category. Second, MARAD was unable to provide us with adequate  supporting information for how it determined the estimated default and  recovery amounts. OMB agrees that recent experience should be used to  calculate reestimates and states in its comments that it generally requires  agencies to use all historical data as a benchmark for future cost estimates  and agreed that recent recovery experience should be incorporated into  future reestimates.", "OMB\u2019s comments appear in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Transportation.

The selected projects represent active and  defaulted loans and five of the six risk categories assigned during the  1996\u20132002 period. The projects selected include barges, lift boats, cruise  ships, and tankers. (See table 3.)

We interviewed agency officials and staff members from the Title  XI support offices that contribute to the approval and monitoring of loans  and disposal of a loan resulting in default.
