For example, preparing cost estimates can be time consuming, particularly for complex changes. Yet the time may be used to help ensure the government has adequate cost data to inform negotiations. In addition, according to agency officials, miscommunication during the contract change process\u2014which can lead to problems such as unauthorized work undertaken by the contractor\u2014can result in additional reviews and longer time frames. According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) data, most of its construction contract changes are finalized within 60 days. Some take much longer, however (see figure).", "Agency officials and industry representatives agreed that perceptions differ about the length of the contract change process. For example, because a change can impact the contractor's cost and schedule immediately, the contractor typically perceives that the process starts earlier\u2014and lasts longer\u2014than the government does.", "Neither GSA nor USACE regularly monitors how long it takes to finalize construction contract changes, limiting management's ability to identify and respond to problems. Internal controls require agencies to collect and use quality data for management purposes such as monitoring agency activities. GSA systems do not collect data that permit analysis of contract change timeframes at the headquarters level. USACE systems produce contract change data for its districts, but data consolidation and calculations must be done manually and are not done regularly. Neither agency has a strategy in place to address these issues. Without regular review of these timeframes, USACE and GSA contracting officials may be unaware of any existing or potential problems, such as long process times that may affect project schedules. In addition, these data system limitations are likely to create difficulties for agencies when providing the information required by new legislation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations: that GSA's Public Buildings Service and USACE each develop a strategy to routinely collect information on and monitor time frames for construction contract changes at the headquarters level.

Some federal contractors have raised concerns that the  government\u2019s process for managing construction contract changes  causes unnecessary delays in payments, creating cash flow issues and  other challenges that can be particularly difficult for small businesses to  manage. Recently, Congress took action that, when implemented, should  provide more information on certain contract changes to prospective  contractors. Section 855 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2019 generally requires agencies to include information  related to the time frames to definitize \u2013 or finalize \u2013 some contract  changes in certain solicitations, beginning in August 2019.", "You asked us to review federal construction contract change processes  and time frames. This report (1) identifies factors that affect the time it  takes to finalize contract changes at selected agencies and (2) assesses  the extent to which selected agencies monitor time frames for finalizing  contract changes.", "To identify agencies for our review, we used federal procurement data to  determine defense and civilian agencies that had a high amount of  construction contract spending, with a significant portion going to small  business. Based on these factors, we selected the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers (USACE) and the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA)  Public Buildings Service (PBS). To identify factors that affect the time it  takes to finalize contract changes, we reviewed federal and agency  acquisition regulations and agency policies. We also interviewed USACE  and PBS contracting officials, agency small business advocates, and  representatives from two associations that represent a variety of federal  construction contractors: the Associated General Contractors of America  and the National Association of Small Business Contractors.", "To assess the extent to which selected agencies monitor time frames for  finalizing contract changes, we reviewed relevant statutes, regulations,  and policies, and interviewed agency officials, including officials from  GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy, which is responsible for  acquisition policy across GSA. We requested data on contract changes  from USACE and PBS, but only USACE was able to provide data. We  reviewed USACE data and analysis on contract changes finalized  between January 2013 and August 2018\u2014representing more than 62,000  changes primarily from the more than 40 USACE districts that execute  construction contracts\u2014to determine the time it takes to process a  contract change.

These changes  are made through modifications to a contract. There are two types of  contract changes discussed in this report: bilateral and unilateral.", "Bilateral change. A bilateral change (also called a supplemental  agreement) is a contract modification that is signed by the contractor  and the contracting officer. In these cases, the contractor and  contracting officer come to an agreement on the price of a contract  change prior to the execution of work.", "Unilateral change. The contracting officer may direct a unilateral  change, executed through a change order, without the contractor\u2019s  agreement on the terms and conditions of the change. A unilateral  contract modification is signed only by the contracting officer. The  contractor is generally required to perform the related work. When  change orders do not include an agreed-upon price for the work, they  may also be referred to as an unpriced change.", "If a contract change causes an increase or decrease to the cost of  performing the work or the scheduled time for performing the work, the  contractor will communicate these price and schedule changes to the  contracting officer. For there to be an adjustment to the contract\u2019s price,  the contractor must submit a specific request or proposal seeking  reimbursement for the change. If the contract change has been ordered  unilaterally by the government, the contractor may submit a request for  equitable adjustment (REA) that reflects these cost and schedule  changes and requests reimbursement. In other circumstances, the  contractor may submit a proposal in response to a request by the agency  that similarly reflects the contractor\u2019s estimate for that increased or  decreased cost and the schedule changes.", "Bilateral and unilateral contract changes typically begin with a similar set  of activities, but then the processes diverge once the bilateral or unilateral  determination is made. Initial process steps include:  identifying the need for a change; determining that the change is within the scope of the existing  receiving a cost estimate; and  verifying that funds are available for the change.", "It is generally after this point that the contracting officer determines the  type of change\u2014unilateral or bilateral\u2014required.

Individual contract changes  may involve circumstances and process steps that are not outlined below.", "Agency regulations and policies provide additional direction for managing  the construction contract change process (see table 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prior GAO Work, Industry Concerns, and Recent Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["In prior work at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we identified  challenges and made several recommendations related to the time  required for the construction contract modification process.", "In 2013, we found that VA had not developed guidance to ensure that  change orders were approved in a prompt manner, and  recommended that officials implement guidance on streamlining the  change-order process. VA agreed with our recommendations and  has implemented them.", "In 2017, we found that VA did not collect sufficient information to  determine if new guidelines intended to ensure the timely processing  of change orders were being followed. We also found that it did not  have a mechanism in place to evaluate data on time frames to  process change orders. Without such a mechanism, VA could not  determine how processing time frames and design changes affect  costs and schedules, and thus was at risk for unexpected cost  increases and schedule delays. We recommended that VA establish a  mechanism to monitor the extent that major facilities projects were  following guidelines on change orders\u2019 time frames and design  changes. VA has also addressed this recommendation.", "In 2018, we found that the Veterans Health Administration, a  component of the VA, had not established time frames for processing  contract changes, and did not have a way to monitor the length of  time or the reason contract changes occur. We recommended that  officials collect information on contract modifications, establish target  time frames that trigger a higher-level review of contract modifications,  and centrally establish a mechanism to monitor and review certain  contract modifications that were taking longer than the established  target time frame. To date, the Veterans Health Administration has  not yet fully implemented the recommendations.", "At a May 2017 congressional hearing before two subcommittees of the  House Committee on Small Business, witnesses from the construction  industry identified the contract change process as a challenge. They  stated that the change process negatively affects cash flows, increases  administrative and legal costs, and creates a risk of not receiving  reimbursement for completed work. Industry representatives we spoke  with reiterated these concerns. Industry representatives also explained  that while contract changes were a challenge for businesses of all sizes,  small business were likely to be more susceptible to challenges due to  their having fewer financial and administrative resources. One resource  for small businesses is an agency\u2019s Office of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization or Office of Small Business Programs. These offices  are responsible for working with agency officials to facilitate participation  of small businesses in procurement. However, the small business  advocates at GSA and USACE told us that their offices had a limited role  in the construction contract change process. According to small business  advocates at GSA, for example, their office may get involved in a limited  manner when a small business contractor is having difficulty receiving  payment by providing guidance on how to make a claim.", "Congress recently took action that will prompt agencies to gather  information on the time it takes to make certain contract changes. Section  855 of the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act includes  a provision that requires agencies to make available information about the  agency\u2019s past performance in finalizing, or \u201cdefinitizing,\u201d REAs with  certain construction solicitations. The provision also requires agencies  to provide information about its policies and practices associated with  how the agencies comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation  requirements to definitize REAs in a timely manner.

According to agency  officials, some of these steps play a role in protecting the government\u2019s  best interests. For example, creating robust cost estimates helps provide  the government with information to inform negotiations with the  contractor. Unauthorized work\u2014resulting from unauthorized direction or  miscommunication\u2014is another factor that can affect the change process  timelines. When the contractor performs unauthorized work, the agency  must then take additional steps, such as reviewing the work to determine  if it should be reimbursed. Data we reviewed from USACE indicate that a  majority of contract changes made from January 2013 through August  2018 were finalized in fewer than 60 days, and a little more than 3  percent took more than 1 year.

For example, USACE officials stated that obtaining a complete  proposal from the contractor\u2014with sufficient information on cost and  schedule changes to begin negotiations\u2014is a significant factor affecting  contract change time frames. Figure 2 illustrates where these factors fall  in a notional change process and describes how they may affect time  frames.", "Agency contracting officials at both PBS and USACE note that some of  these procedural steps are necessary to protect the government\u2019s  interests\u2014which includes negotiating a fair and reasonable price for the  work related to the change.", "According to USACE and PBS contracting officials, any unauthorized  work undertaken by the contractor is another factor that can extend  contract change process timelines. When unauthorized work is done, the  government must take steps such as determining (1) if the work was  required; (2) if the work constituted a change to the existing contract; and  (3) if so, a fair and reasonable price for the work. Unauthorized work may  occur, for example, when the contractor receives direction from a person  who is not authorized to direct work, like a project manager. An  authorized individual, such as the contracting officer, must provide such  direction. Agency officials explained that unauthorized work can be the  result of miscommunication between a government project official and the  contractor. The contractor may interpret instructions from the  unauthorized official as a formal direction to proceed with a change. In  other cases, the contractor may begin work in anticipation of a contract  change, before receiving any direction at all. One contractor  representative told us that, at times, contractors feel pressured to start  work without authorized direction to avoid disruption to the overall project  that may result in negative performance reviews from the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USACE Data Show That More than Half of Construction Contract Changes Are Finalized Within 60 Days, but Some Take Much Longer", "paragraphs": ["According to USACE contracting officials, the agency compiles and  reviews data on construction contract changes on an ad hoc basis to gain  insight into time frames for the contract change process within that  agency.

For example, one industry representative  said that the process begins for some contractors when the need for a  contract change is identified. The representative explained that this is the  point that the project work can change and the contractor begins to  experience an impact on cost and schedule. Another industry  representative said that some businesses think that the process begins  when they submit their request for equitable adjustment, but that the  government may not start measuring the process until a government  official actively begins to address the request.", "Meanwhile, USACE contracting officials stated that process time should  be measured from when they receive a complete proposal from the  contractor, with no missing information. USACE officials told us that the  data collected in its contract information system do not always reflect this  metric, however. USACE contracting officials told us that, when recording  the proposal receipt date that it uses as the start date for the contract  change process, some contracting officers enter the date that the initial  proposal was received, and others enter the date that a complete  proposal was received. USACE contracting officials stated that they plan  to address this issue in the future as part of a larger system upgrade.", "An industry representative explained that these varying viewpoints  between government contracting officials and contractors are  exacerbated by the contractors\u2019 lack of understanding about the contract  change process.

Neither GSA nor USACE has fully established such controls over the  contract change process at the headquarters level, limiting management\u2019s  ability to identify and respond to problems.", "USACE information systems have data on contract changes for its  more than 40 districts that are sufficient to calculate time frames for  finalizing contract changes, but the agency does not regularly  aggregate or monitor the information. Officials explained that this was  in part due to the manual process required to compile the data  centrally and perform calculations. A user must pull data for each  USACE district from its contract information system and then  manually manipulate the data to determine the time frames. As a  result, the data are not reviewed by officials at headquarters on a  routine basis. The contracting officials we spoke with said that  contract change time frames are reviewed at the local level,  specifically by project teams, typically on a weekly basis. Contracting  officials also stated that contract change time frames are a factor in  performance reviews for contracting personnel. There is currently no  agency guidance or documentation for how often contract changes  should be reviewed at either the project or district levels, the officials  said. USACE contracting officials noted that they are in the early  stages of planning for a system upgrade that they hope will automate  the process of compiling and analyzing construction contract change  data. However, these plans are preliminary. USACE has not yet  determined which systems will be involved, nor has it documented  these planning efforts to date.", "PBS contracting officials cannot track time frames for contract  changes. While GSA\u2019s contract information system does track and  centrally compile data on all contract modifications, PBS contracting  officials said there was no efficient way to separate the types of  contract changes that we included in our review from other  modifications, such as administrative changes or the exercise of  options, preventing the calculation of time frames for contract  changes. Our review of the GSA data confirmed that the data cannot  be used to distinguish between the various types of contract changes.  According to PBS contracting officials, to identify a contract change  type, a reviewer would have to seek information at the local level by  going into the individual contract file and reviewing the modification.", "Given these limitations, USACE and PBS cannot centrally identify  emerging problems with contract change time frames or monitor  compliance with existing Department of Defense (DOD) and GSA  requirements. As noted above, DOD and GSA have established time  frames for certain contract changes. USACE contracting officials said that  they would likely establish additional, broad goals for finalizing contract  changes in future policy revisions because more targeted goals were  often not practical due to the unique circumstances that may affect  process times. PBS contracting officials said that compliance with those  time frames should be monitored by local staff, such as the contracting  officer assigned to the project; however, there is no regular monitoring of  that data or systematic way for contracting officers to track this  information at the local level. There is currently no effort under way to  develop a strategy to address data limitations at the local and  headquarters level via information technology system upgrades,  according to GSA officials.", "Further, USACE and GSA anticipate, and our analysis of available data  confirms, that system limitations at both agencies are likely to make  implementing section 855 of the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense  Authorization Act more difficult. This provision generally requires  agencies to include information on recent time frames for definitizing  REAs with any construction solicitations anticipated to be awarded to  small businesses no later than August 2019. For example, GSA officials  stated that to implement this provision would require substantial changes  to their contract information system, which they must plan for 2 years in  advance. USACE officials said that staff level discussions were ongoing  on potential ways to comply with the requirement. They added, however,  that in the absence of a system change making the data readily available,  they would likely compile data manually, similar to what was provided to  us, as an ad hoc substitute.", "In addition, both agencies said that they had questions about what  information they would include in solicitations. Specifically, while section  855 refers to REAs, a USACE contracting official stated that REA could  be interpreted differently by the government and industry. Similarly, GSA  contracting officials said that the statutory language potentially covers a  broad category of information, making it difficult to decide what data to  capture and report. USACE officials stated that they will wait for DOD and  the Department of the Army to provide direction before changing their  system. GSA officials stated that they were not going to take action until  further information is provided. One potential source of additional  direction is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) case 2018-020, which is  developing a proposed FAR rule to implement section 855.

GSA lacks information on the  contract change process and its time frames at the headquarters,  regional, and local levels. Without regular collection and review of  information on the contract change process, contracting officials may be  unable to spot potential problems\u2014such as long process times that may  affect project schedules\u2014as they occur and respond accordingly. In  addition to needing data for management purposes, agencies must also  implement new legislative requirements when issuing certain construction  solicitations starting in August 2019. While the proposed FAR rule, when  issued, should provide agencies with more information on how to  implement the new requirements, GSA and USACE could immediately  begin to develop strategies to support routine collection and monitoring of  time frames. Pursuing preliminary strategies on basic issues\u2014such as  what systems may need to be updated and what groups or individuals  should be involved\u2014would help these agencies better position  themselves to comply with the requirement in a timely manner, and more  quickly expand the data available for management purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations:  The Administrator of General Services should ensure that the  Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service develops a strategy that  outlines the steps needed to routinely collect information on and monitor  the time frames for finalizing construction contract changes at the  headquarters level.
