The results of this research can become the impetus for change in federal policies, regulations, and programs. For example, research in medicine, aviation, and agriculture affect policy or regulatory decisions for drug and airline safety and pesticide use. Thus, the Congress and the public rely on federal agencies to fund and conduct research that produces high-quality results. To help ensure the quality and integrity of the research, U.S. science has traditionally relied on independent reviews by peers.", "This report responds to your request that we study the peer review and other quality assurance processes that federal agencies use in conducting scientific research and development. Specifically, as agreed with your offices, we (1) define what is meant by peer review, (2) describe the federal government\u2019s peer review policy, (3) describe the peer review practices of 12 federal agencies that conduct scientific research, (4) describe other agency quality assurance reviews; , and (5) identify which research is not subjected to review.", "On the basis of discussions with your staffs, we included the following 12 federal agencies in our review: 3 entities within the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Research Service, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, and the Forest Service; 2 entities within the Department of Commerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Department of Energy; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institutes of Health; the Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National Science Foundation; and the Federal Aviation Administration within the Department of Transportation. In this report, we refer to the Department of Energy, the bureaus, and independent agencies as agencies. These agencies account for more than 90 percent of the federal R&D budget in fiscal year 1999, excluding the Department of Defense."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Scientific research has traditionally been considered to be valuable to society. The knowledge gained from federally supported research leads to the development of new products and processes. Research results also provide information needed to make policy decisions. The Congress is concerned that quality research is used to provide a rational basis for federal rule- making, as with regulations established to protect human health and safety and the environment. Peer review has been used to judge the quality of science for over 3 centuries. Historically, peer review has been used extensively in the selection of proposed research projects and to a lesser extent to evaluate R&D programs and their likely effects.", "The Congress and the President have taken steps to help improve the management of and accountability for federal R&D spending. In 1976, the Congress established the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which serves as a source of scientific, engineering, and technological analysis and judgment for the President and assists him in providing leadership and coordination for federal R&D programs. In November 1993, by executive order, the President also established the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council to coordinate federal R&D and to establish clear national goals for science and technology investments. Through this Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy helps the President coordinate science, space, and technology policy and programs across the federal government and leads an interagency effort to develop and implement science and technology policies and budgets across federal agencies.", "In 1993, the Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act to encourage efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in federal programs. The act requires federal agencies to produce strategic performance plans with annual targets and annual performance reports that explain whether those targets have been met. A recent report by the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy concluded that the most effective means of evaluating federally funded research programs is expert review. The best known form of expert review is peer review; two other forms are relevance review that examines whether the research program focuses on an agency\u2019s mission and international benchmarking that determines whether the research is at the forefront of scientific and technological knowledge."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Peer Review", "paragraphs": ["There is no written definition of peer review that applies across the federal government. Officials at the Office of Science and Technology Policy described peer review as a merit-based process or independent merit assessment, generally used in decisions about which research projects to fund. Individual agencies define peer review somewhat differently; however, all of the agencies\u2019 definitions or descriptions of peer review contained the fundamental concept of a review of technical or scientific merit by individuals with sufficient technical competence and no unresolved conflict of interest.", "Peers generally are considered to be scientists or engineers who have qualifications and expertise equivalent to those of the researcher whose work they review. In addition, peers must be capable of making an independent judgment of the merits and relevance of the research. Officials at the Office of Science and Technology Policy said that peers do not have to be external to the funding agency, as long as there is no unresolved conflict of interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peer Review Policy", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the Office of Science and Technology Policy said that there is no governmentwide legislation or policy that requires agencies to conduct peer reviews or dictates how the reviews should be conducted. However, the office advocates the use of peer review and provides guidance to agencies on the use of peer review to assess the quality of research. For example, the office works with the Office of Management and Budget to promote peer review. Beginning with the fiscal year 1996 budget cycle, the two offices have jointly provided annual direction to agencies encouraging them to emphasize the funding of peer-reviewed research over nonpeer-reviewed research. As a result, Office of Science and Technology Policy officials said that agencies have shifted funding toward more peer-reviewed research. The guidance also encourages agencies to solicit proposals from many researchers on how to solve research problems.", "Officials at the Office of Science and Technology Policy said that agencies\u2019 peer review practices should be flexible and tailored to agency missions and type of research, and that specific uniform practices should not be dictated for every agency or all federally funded research. A variety of peer review methods is viewed by the agencies as both appropriate and essential, reflecting the varying nature of the research and its purposes, the differences in research timelines, the broad spectrum of R&D performers, and the varying funding mechanisms, such as grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. For example, agency officials noted that specific peer reviews can have quite different purposes such as the review of research results prior to publication versus the review of agency or program performance.", "While peer review has come to be viewed by some observers as the best assurance that quality criteria will prevail over social, economic, and political considerations, others view peer review as an element of elitism in science that tends to discount such concerns as economic considerations. Officials at the National Science Foundation said that under certain conditions, over emphasis on peer review for funding decisions may discourage funding of innovative research because peers generally tend to view research somewhat conservatively. Officials at the Office of Science and Technology said that this phenomenon has been noted by other agencies, and the Office is initiating an interagency effort to examine how peer review practices (and other federal R&D policies) might better facilitate innovation. \u201cScience agencies must devise assessment strategies that are appropriate to the nature of scientific processes and to the enabling role of fundamental science in support of over-arching national goals... should be designed to...respond to surprises, pursue detours, and revise program agendas in response to new scientific information and technical opportunities essential to the future well-being of all our people.\u201d", "All the agencies that we contacted identified policies, orders, or other internal guidance regarding the conduct of peer review. Some of these policies are legislatively mandated. For example, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to peer review Department-funded research.The law also requires grantees to arrange for a peer review of special grants mandated by the Congress. Overall, we found that eight agencies\u2014the Agricultural Research Service, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2014have laws or regulations that require peer review of competitively selected grant proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peer Review Practices Vary", "paragraphs": ["The peer review practices differ among and within federal research agencies in two ways. First, agencies use peer review in varying degrees to assess the merit of research at different stages in the research process, including selecting research projects for funding; monitoring in-progress research; and evaluating research products prior to publication. Second, the implementation of the peer review process varies. The following highlights the extent to which agencies use peer review and some of the various ways they implement peer review.

All 12 agencies also use peer review to help determine funding for at least a portion of their other research, including peer reviews of the agencies\u2019 intramural or internal research proposals or plans. The agencies use a combination of external and internal reviewers with subject matter expertise. However, Federal Aviation Administration officials said that their peer reviewers are primarily agency employees who are not involved in the project but have the required subject matter expertise.", "The agencies conduct the peer reviews by mail, panels or committees, or a combination of methods. They also differ in the number of reviewers used in the process. For example, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service uses panels of outside experts to review competitive research proposals. One Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service program, the National Research Initiative, uses panels that meet throughout the year. Each panel member reviews about 30 research proposals and provides written comments on about 20 of the proposals. Mail reviews and ad hoc reviewers are also used when additional expertise is needed. In contrast, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration generally conducts reviews by mail to obtain specialized expertise on technical issues and approaches, followed by reviews by panels of 7 to 10 experts with broader perspectives to reconcile differences among the mail reviewers\u2019 comments.", "The agencies use various criteria to assess proposed research, including technical or scientific merit, relevance to agency mission and priorities, and the qualifications of the researcher. Agency officials responsible for selecting research for funding generally consider the peer reviewers\u2019 advice or recommendations along with other financial and management factors to make their funding decisions.", "In some circumstances, agencies use these same types of peer review processes to assess the merit of research that is not funded through competitive selection, generally this research is internal to the agencies. For example, the Forest Service conducts peer reviews of its scientists\u2019 research study plans prior to approval by project leaders. The U.S. Geological Survey conducts peer reviews of all intramural project proposals to ensure technical quality prior to final approval and implementation. At the Agricultural Research Service, internal peers, who are not involved in the funding decision, review detailed project plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reviews of In-Progress Research", "paragraphs": ["While all 12 agencies provided examples of peer reviews of research that are in-progress, there is much variation in the frequency and purpose of those reviews. The purposes of these reviews include assessments of research projects to determine if funding should be renewed or to assess the progress of on-going research at the program level, or at research stations or laboratories. For example, in-progress Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Survey projects that are assessed for renewal within 2 to 3 years compete with new proposals in the same merit review process. If the review panel considers the research progress to be unsatisfactory, the research project will not receive additional funding. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration requires that for any project that continues for more than 3 years, the researcher must submit a new proposal, which is subject to external peer review.", "The National Institutes of Health uses boards of outside experts to peer review its on-going intramural research, and the Agricultural Research Service convenes panels in a workshop format to review intramural research projects. The U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s peer review guidance requires that on-going programs undergo external peer review about every 5 years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also has peer reviews of the work funded and completed at its laboratories. Every 3 to 5 years, qualified peers evaluate program accomplishments and impacts in the context of the resources invested in them. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Research Council\u2019s Board on Assessment of the Institute\u2019s programs annually conducts reviews of the technical quality and relevance of planned, ongoing, and completed laboratory programs.

This process results in recommendations about the merit of the research and funding priorities in the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s six program areas. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Science Advisory Board, consisting of scientists, engineers, and economists from academia, industry, and environmental communities, reviews the technical basis for the agency\u2019s science policy positions, including scientific documents used to support environmental regulations. Independent scientists provide advice to the Department of Energy on the quality, relevance, and productivity of its laboratory research, in conjunction with program reviews and advisory committee oversight.

These reviews are generally conducted by supervisors or managers and are, therefore, not independent reviews of the research. Agencies conduct these quality assurance reviews to assess the merit of proposed research, to assess the progress of on-going research, and to evaluate research results. These reviews occur at both the project and program level. TThe following are examples of agencies\u2019 internal reviews.", "Scientists at the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service review noncompetitive proposals for formula-funded awards and for congressionally mandated research. Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service scientists also review annual progress reports prepared by the researchers. Likewise, Agricultural Research Service line managers review annual project progress reports submitted by the Service\u2019s lead scientists. These reviews may lead to revisions of program plans. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials track the results of research funded by the Advanced Technology Program, using quarterly progress reports and annual meetings with recipients. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration project managers and staff frequently comment on technical, management, and financial aspects of a proposal, since science reviewers may not be qualified experts in these fields. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Civil Aeromedical Institute, which conducts mostly intramural research, reviews the technical details of proposed projects. According to Federal Aviation Administration officials, the Institute employs some of the world\u2019s best scientists, so the number of outside experts is limited. Research performed under Federal Aviation Administration procurement contracts is reviewed during the annual programming and budgeting process. Subsequently, when a decision is made to fund research through a contract, Federal Aviation Administration technical staff monitor the work.", "In addition, the Agricultural Research Service, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, the Forest Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation use advisory committees to help establish research programs or priorities. For example, section 103 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 requires that the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education, and Economics Advisory Board annually review the Department of Agriculture\u2019s research priority setting. A Forest Research Advisory Committee to the Secretary of Agriculture, made up of university, industry, and interest group representatives, also reviews and comments on the Forest Service\u2019s current and future research priorities. The National Institute of Standards and Technology statutory Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology meets quarterly to review agency research policies, budget, organization, and programs.", "A few agency officials also discussed their use of peer review in their efforts to comply with the Results Act requirements for reporting performance measures, goals, and outcomes of their research.

In addition, research performed jointly with outside entities, such as with cooperative research and development agreements, may not always be fully subjected to review, depending on factors such as the nature of the partnership and the presence of proprietary information. The Congress directs the Agricultural Research Service to allocate about $10 million annually to external researchers for specific cooperative agreements. While the Agricultural Research Service does not usually peer review this research prior to funding, it does review progress reports that the researcher is required to submit annually. Officials from the National Institutes of Health said that supplemental funding requested to carry on previously reviewed and funded research might not be subject to peer review.
