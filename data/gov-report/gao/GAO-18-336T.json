For the October 2017 report, GAO reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS's strategy to prevent opioid misuse.

CMS's criteria focused on beneficiaries who do all the following: (1) receive prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) receive prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) fill prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS, this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm.", "CMS's criteria, including recent revisions, do not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimates that while 33,223 beneficiaries would have met the revised criteria in 2015, 727,016 would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use. This approach misses some who could be at risk of harm, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. As a result, CMS is limited in its ability to assess progress toward meeting the broader goals of its Opioid Misuse Strategy for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which includes activities to reduce the risk of harm to beneficiaries from opioid use.", "CMS oversees the prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects, but does not analyze data specifically on opioids. According to CMS officials, CMS and plan sponsors identify providers who prescribe large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse, and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement. However, GAO found that CMS does not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs, and does not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identify such providers. As a result, CMS is lacking information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time, and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the October 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations that CMS (1) gather information on the full number of at-risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids, (2) identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and (3) require plan sponsors to report to CMS on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids. HHS concurred with the first two recommendations, but not with the third. GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report and in this statement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss our recently released report on  oversight of opioid prescribing in the Medicare program. Misuse of  prescription opioids, which are used to treat both acute and chronic pain,  has become a serious public health problem for the U.S. population,  including Medicare beneficiaries. The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) reported that from 1999 to 2013 the rate of drug  poisoning deaths from prescription opioids nearly quadrupled from 1.4 to  5.1 per 100,000 people. In addition, the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) reported  that 14.4 million people (about one-third) who participate in Medicare Part  D received at least one prescription for opioids in 2016, and that Part D  spending for opioids in 2016 was almost $4.1 billion. GAO and the HHS- OIG have previously reported on inappropriate activities that can be  associated with such prescriptions, including \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d to receive  multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers; the diversion of  prescription drugs for uses other than what was intended; and  questionable prescribing practices by providers, including those in  Medicare.", "In March 2015, HHS announced plans to make addressing opioid abuse  a high priority through two broad goals: (1) decreasing opioid overdoses  and overall overdose deaths, and (2) decreasing the prevalence of opioid  use disorder. In 2016, CDC issued guidelines with recommendations for  prescribing opioids in outpatient settings for chronic pain.  The guidelines  recommended that providers use caution when prescribing opioids at any  dose, carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when  increasing opioid dosage to 50 mg morphine-equivalent dose (MED) per  day or more, and either avoid or carefully justify dosage at 90 mg MED or  more. CDC guidelines also noted that providers should use additional  caution in prescribing opioids to patients aged 65 and older, because the  drugs can accumulate in the body to toxic levels. Further, in January  2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the HHS  agency that administers Medicare, issued its Opioid Misuse Strategy for  the Medicaid and Medicare programs, including Medicare Part D. The  strategy includes the agency\u2019s plans to address concerns about  beneficiary use of opioids and the prescribing of opioids by providers.", "My remarks today discuss the findings and recommendations from our  report on CMS efforts to oversee prescription opioids. Accordingly, this  testimony focuses on (1) how CMS oversees beneficiaries who receive  opioid prescriptions under Medicare Part D, and (2) how CMS oversees  providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. For our  report, we reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS  guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS\u2019s strategy to prevent opioid misuse.  We also interviewed officials from CMS, the six largest Part D plan  sponsors\u2014private organizations, such as health insurance companies,  contracted by CMS to provide outpatient drug benefit plans to Medicare  beneficiaries\u2014and 12 national associations selected to represent  insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers, physicians, patients, and  regulatory and law enforcement agencies. More detailed information on  our objectives, scope, and methodology for that work can be found in the  issued report. We conducted the work on which this statement is based in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The agency includes  this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call letters;  it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012. Among  other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors to  implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor  beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR systems,  CMS requires plan sponsors to have methods to identify beneficiaries  who are potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of drugs, including  opioids.", "Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS),  which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids  and to oversee sponsors\u2019 compliance with CMS\u2019s opioid overutilization  policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems,  but they have some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria within  CMS guidance. At the time of our review, the OMS considered  beneficiaries to be at a high risk of opioid overuse when they met all three  of the following criteria:  1.  received a total daily MED greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive  2.  received opioid prescriptions from four or more providers in the  previous 12 months, and  3.  received opioids from four or more pharmacies in the previous 12  months.", "The criteria excluded beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis and those in  hospice care, for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate.", "Through the OMS, CMS generates quarterly reports that list beneficiaries  who meet all of the criteria and who are identified as high-risk, and then  distributes the reports to the plan sponsors. Plan sponsors are expected  to review the list of identified beneficiaries, determine appropriate action,  and then respond to CMS with information on their actions within 30 days.  According to CMS officials, the agency also expects that plan sponsors  will share any information with CMS on beneficiaries that they identify  through their own DUR systems. We found that some actions plan  sponsors may take include", "Case management. Case management may include an attempt to  improve coordination issues, and often involves provider outreach,  whereby the plan sponsor will contact the providers associated with  the beneficiary to let them know that the beneficiary is receiving high  levels of opioids and may be at risk of harm.", "Beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) edits. Beneficiary-specific  POS edits are restrictions that limit these beneficiaries to certain  opioids and amounts. Pharmacists receive a message when a  beneficiary attempts to fill a prescription that exceeds the limit in place  for that beneficiary.", "Formulary-level POS edits. These edits alert providers who may not  have been aware that their patients are receiving high levels of  opioids from other doctors.", "Referrals for investigation. According to the six plan sponsors we  interviewed, the referrals can be made to CMS\u2019s National Benefit  Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (NBI MEDIC), which is  responsible for identifying and investigating potential Part D fraud,  waste, and abuse, or to the plan sponsor\u2019s own internal investigative  unit, if they have one. After investigating a particular case, they may  refer the case to the HHS-OIG or a law enforcement agency,  according to CMS, NBI MEDIC, and one plan sponsor.", "Based on CMS\u2019s use of the OMS and the actions taken by plan sponsors,  CMS reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through  2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high  risk\u2014from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries\u2014which agency officials  consider an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use  disorder.", "In addition, we found that CMS relies on separate patient safety  measures developed and maintained by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to  assess how well Part D plan sponsors are monitoring beneficiaries and  taking appropriate actions. In 2016, CMS started tracking plan sponsors\u2019  performance on three patient safety measures that are directly related to  opioids. The three measures are similar to the OMS criteria in that they  identify beneficiaries with high dosages of opioids (120 mg MED),  beneficiaries that use opioids from multiple providers and pharmacies,  and beneficiaries that do both. However, one difference between these  approaches is that the patient safety measures separately identify  beneficiaries who fulfill each criterion individually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Does Not Have Sufficient Information on Most Beneficiaries Potentially at Risk for Harm", "paragraphs": ["Our October 2017 report also found that while CMS tracks the total  number of beneficiaries who meet all three OMS criteria as part of its  opioid overutilization oversight across the Part D program, it does not  have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high  doses of opioids\u2014regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies  used\u2014and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to CDC  guidelines. These guidelines note that long-term use of high doses of  opioids\u2014those above a MED of 90 mg per day\u2014are associated with  significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible.", "Based on the CDC guidelines, outreach to Part D plan sponsors, and  CMS analyses of Part D data, CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to  include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. The new OMS  criteria define a high user as having an average daily MED greater than  90 mg for any duration, and who receives opioids from four or more  providers and four or more pharmacies, or from six or more providers  regardless of the number of pharmacies, for the prior 6 months. Based  on 2015 data, CMS found that 33,223 beneficiaries would have met these  revised criteria. While the revised criteria will help identify beneficiaries  who CMS determined are at the highest risk of opioid misuse and  therefore may need case management by plan sponsors, OMS will not  provide information on the total number of Part D beneficiaries who may  also be at risk of harm. In developing the revised criteria, CMS conducted  a one-time analysis that estimated there were 727,016 beneficiaries with  an average MED of 90 mg or more, for any length of time during a 6  month measurement period in 2015, regardless of the number of  providers or pharmacies used. These beneficiaries may be at risk of harm  from opioids, according to CDC guidelines, and therefore tracking the  total number of these beneficiaries over time could help CMS to  determine whether it is making progress toward meeting the goals  specified in its Opioid Misuse Strategy to reduce the risk of opioid use  disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion.  However, CMS officials told us that the agency does not keep track of the  total number of these beneficiaries, and does not have plans to do so as  part of OMS. (See fig. 1.)", "We also found that in 2016, CMS began to gather information from its  patient safety measures on the number of beneficiaries who use more  than 120 mg MED of opioids for 90 days or longer, regardless of the  number of providers and pharmacies. The patient safety measures  identified 285,119 such beneficiaries\u2014counted as member-years\u2014in  2016. However, this information does not include all at-risk  beneficiaries, because the threshold is more lenient than indicated in  CDC guidelines and CMS\u2019s new OMS criteria. Because neither the OMS  criteria nor the patient safety measures include all beneficiaries potentially  at risk of harm from high opioid doses, we recommended that CMS  should gather information over time on the total number of beneficiaries  who receive high opioid morphine equivalent doses regardless of the  number of pharmacies or providers, as part of assessing progress over  time in reaching the agency\u2019s goals related to reducing opioid use. HHS  concurred with our recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Oversees Providers through its Contractor and Plan Sponsors, but Efforts Do Not Specifically Monitor Opioid Prescriptions", "paragraphs": ["Our October 2017 report found that CMS oversees providers who  prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor,  NBI MEDIC, and the Part D plan sponsors.", "NBI MEDIC\u2019s data analyses to identify outlier providers.

NBI MEDIC gathers and analyzes data  on Medicare Part C and Part D, including projects using the Predictive  Learning Analytics Tracking Outcome (PLATO) system. According  to NBI MEDIC officials, these PLATO projects seek to identify  potential fraud by examining data on provider behaviors.", "NBI MEDIC\u2019s investigations to identify fraud, waste, and abuse. NBI  MEDIC officials conduct investigations to assist CMS in identifying  cases of potential fraud, waste, and abuse among providers for  Medicare Part C and Part D. The investigations are prompted by  complaints from plan sponsors; suspected fraud, waste, or abuse  reported to NBI MEDIC\u2019s call center; NBI MEDIC\u2019s analysis of outlier  providers; or from one of its other data analysis projects.", "NBI MEDIC\u2019s referrals. After identifying providers engaged in potential  fraudulent overprescribing, NBI MEDIC officials said they may refer  cases to law enforcement agencies or the HHS-OIG for further  investigation and potential prosecution.", "Plan sponsors\u2019 monitoring of providers. CMS requires all plan  sponsors to adopt and implement an effective compliance program,  which must include measures to prevent, detect, and correct Part C or  Part D program noncompliance, as well as fraud, waste, and abuse.  CMS\u2019s guidance focuses broadly on prescription drugs, and does not  specifically address opioids.", "Our report concluded that although these efforts provide valuable  information, CMS lacks all the information necessary to adequately  oversee opioid prescribing. CMS\u2019s oversight actions focus broadly on  Schedule II drugs rather than specifically on opioids. For example, NBI  MEDIC\u2019s analyses to identify outlier providers do not indicate the extent to  which they may be overprescribing opioids specifically. According to CMS  officials, they direct NBI MEDIC to focus on Schedule II drugs, because  these drugs have a high potential for abuse, whether they are opioids or  other drugs. However, without specifically identifying opioids in these  analyses\u2014or an alternate source of data\u2014CMS lacks data on providers  who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and therefore cannot assess  progress toward meeting its goals related to reducing opioid use, which  would be consistent with federal internal control standards. Federal  internal control standards require agencies to conduct monitoring  activities and to use quality information to achieve objectives and address  risks. As a result, we recommended that CMS require NBI MEDIC to  gather separate data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids.  This would allow CMS to better identify those providers who are  inappropriately and potentially fraudulently overprescribing opioids. HHS  agreed, and noted that it intends to work with NBI MEDIC to identify  trends in outlier prescribers of opioids.", "Our report also found that CMS also lacks key information necessary for  oversight of opioid prescribing, because it does not require plan sponsors  to report to NBI MEDIC or CMS cases of fraud, waste, and abuse; cases  of overprescribing; or any actions taken against providers. Plan  sponsors collect information on cases of fraud, waste, and abuse, and  can choose to report this information to NBI MEDIC or CMS. While CMS  receives information from plan sponsors who voluntarily report their  actions, it does not know the full extent to which plan sponsors have  identified providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, or the full  extent to which sponsors have taken action to reduce overprescribing.  We concluded that without this information, it is difficult for CMS to assess  progress in this area, which would be consistent with federal internal  control standards. In our report, we recommended that CMS require plan  sponsors to report on investigations and other actions taken related to  providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. HHS did not concur  with this recommendation. HHS noted that plan sponsors have the  responsibility to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, and that  CMS reviews cases when it conducts audits. HHS also stated that it  seeks to balance requirements on plan sponsors when considering new  regulatory requirements. However, without complete reporting\u2014such as  reporting from all plan sponsors on the actions they take to reduce  overprescribing\u2014we believe that CMS is missing key information that  could help assess progress in this area. Due to the importance of this  information for achieving the agency\u2019s goals, we continue to believe that  CMS should require plan sponsors to report on the actions they take to  reduce overprescribing.  - - - - -  In conclusion, a large number of Medicare Part D beneficiaries use  potentially harmful levels of prescription opioids, and reducing the  inappropriate prescribing of these drugs is a key part of CMS\u2019s strategy to  decrease the risk of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and deaths. Despite  working to identify and decrease egregious opioid use behavior\u2014such as  doctor shopping\u2014among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, CMS lacks the  necessary information to effectively determine the full number of  beneficiaries at risk of harm, as well as other information that could help  CMS assess whether its efforts to reduce opioid overprescribing are  effective. It is important that health care providers help patients to receive  appropriate pain treatment, including opioids, based on the consideration  of benefits and risks. Access to information on the risks that Medicare  patients face from inappropriate or poorly monitored prescriptions, as well  as information on providers who may be inappropriately prescribing  opioids, could help CMS as it works to improve care.", "Chairman Jenkins, Ranking Member Lewis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
