VA has the authority to bill and retain all collections from these third-party insurers for any health care it provides to veterans for non-service-connected conditions. Collections from third- party insurers are VA\u2019s largest source of revenue and are used to supplement its medical care appropriations.", "Over the past several years, concerns have been raised about VA\u2019s ability to optimize its third-party revenues. For example, in 1997 we reported that VA was billing for medical care that it could not expect to collect. In 1998, a national VA review found process inefficiencies, significant errors resulting in rework, and ineffective use of available automation. In the same year, VA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General indicated that VA was not billing all appropriate episodes of care and not aggressively pursuing unpaid bills. And in 1999, we testified on our concerns about declining VA collections and its uneven management improvements across facilities.While these and other assessments recognize a number of largely uncontrollable factors that limit VA\u2019s potential revenue\u2014such as the declining number of veterans and smaller bills associated with VA\u2019s shift from inpatient to outpatient care\u2014they all found that VA\u2019s process for collecting payments from third-party payers has limited the amount of revenue it has generated.", "In 1999, VA submitted a business plan to the Congress that called for an evaluation of two major alternatives for improving revenue operations and collections. Both alternatives called for each network to consolidate portions of the revenue operations, but one alternative called for using in- house staff while the other would have used contractor staff. My testimony today will focus on the status of VA\u2019s collections this past year and VA\u2019s progress in pursuing its business plan. To assess VA\u2019s efforts, we visited revenue operations at four facilities and one network; surveyed all facilities and networks and interviewed headquarters officials; obtained and analyzed private sector benchmarks; and reviewed relevant VA studies and plans, including its September 2001 Revenue Cycle Improvement Plan.", "In summary, this fiscal year, for the first time since fiscal year 1995, VA has reversed the general decline in its third-party collections. However, the fiscal year 2001 increase appears to be largely the result of VA\u2019s implementation of a new system, known as the reasonable charges billing system, which allowed VA to move from a flat-rate billing system to one that itemizes charges for the care it provides to veterans. However, long- standing problems in VA\u2019s revenue operations appear to persist, and when compared to private sector standards, VA\u2019s collections performance is poor. For example, VA takes 14 times longer to bill, on average, than a benchmark for private sector hospitals. Moreover, VA\u2019s various attempts to try consolidation using either in-house or contractor staff have provided little basis for selecting the best alternative to address VA\u2019s collections problems. For example, VA initiated a pilot to test the relative cost- effectiveness of contracting out or using in-house staff, but as a result of changes in the pilot\u2019s design for contracting, this test is unlikely to yield data needed to compare the two alternatives and determine which option is best. In addition, VA\u2019s recent 2001 Revenue Cycle Improvement Plan does not call for a comprehensive comparison of alternatives nor does it focus on net revenues\u2014collections minus operations costs.

As part of this plan, VA anticipated that by the end of fiscal year 2002, it would obtain 10 percent of its funding from third-party collections and other alternative revenue streams, such as veteran copayments, Medicare payments, and proceeds from sharing agreements (where VA sells services to the Department of Defense, private hospitals, and other providers). In fiscal year 2000, VA acknowledged that it would not meet its 10-percent goal, in part because the Congress did not authorize Medicare payments to VA for health care provided to Medicare enrollees. For fiscal year 2002, VA estimates that revenue from alternative sources would be about 4 percent of its medical care funding, or $896 million.", "VA\u2019s third-party revenue operations consists of five sequential processes. (See table 1.)", "With the exception of six networks that have consolidated some of these processes, revenue operations management is currently decentralized and the processes are performed at each medical center where health care is provided to veterans.", "In the 1990s, VA sponsored two studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of contracting out most revenue operations. The results of these studies were not fully conclusive and were contradictory. The first study, conducted by Birch and Davis and reported on in 1995, concluded that VA\u2019s costs would be slightly less if operations were maintained in-house instead of using a contractor. In contrast, the second study, conducted by Coopers and Lybrand and reported in 1998, found that, based on three contractors\u2019 estimates, contracting out would be less expensive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collections Have Increased in the Past Year, but Underlying Problems Continue", "paragraphs": ["If VA\u2019s current pattern of third-party collections continues into the last months of fiscal year 2001, VA will significantly increase its third-party collections for the first time since fiscal year 1995.

Nationally, VA bills insurers for only 16 percent of patients treated but reports that substantial numbers of veterans have probably not disclosed their insurance.", "Medical documentation: About 74 percent of surveyed facilities reported that weaknesses in physicians\u2019 documentation of care for billing purposes limits collections. One official was concerned that his facility could not meet its timeliness goal unless clinical staff provided more timely documentation for billing. He also noted that not all billable care could be charged to insurers because of incomplete or insufficient documentation. A VA contractor this year estimated that VA could collect $459 million more nationally if physicians\u2019 oversight of resident physicians was properly documented. However, the contractor also found that some physicians were concerned that spending more time on documenting care for billing purposes would take away from the time spent with patients.", "Coding: VA has acknowledged its difficulty maintaining sufficient staff who can correctly code medical procedures and services for billing. A 2000 study also found these problems and attributed them to competition from other employers for coders, low VA entry-level wages, and VA\u2019s frequent problems with retaining and promoting qualified and proficient staff. At three sites we visited, for example, revenue officials noted that they had difficulties hiring experienced coders at VA salaries.", "Billing: A VA-sponsored 2001 study of the possible uses of commercial software found limitations in VA\u2019s current billing software that led to manual processes. As a result, there is an increased probability of errors, slower production, and lower collections. A contractor who provided services to both VA and private sector hospitals also told us that VA\u2019s process for creating bills and identifying errors is less automated than the private sector.", "Accounts receivable: The majority of VA\u2019s accounts receivables exceed 90 days and VA is concerned that insufficient follow-up is given to collections. According to a contractor that services both VA and private sector hospitals, VA staff at one facility were not following standard business practices of contacting insurers to resolve problems with bills but instead were just sending additional copies of bills. At another site we visited, two accounts-receivable staff were having difficulties reducing a backlog of about 3,000 to 4,000 unpaid claims because each day they were only able to make a total of 60 follow-up calls to insurers.", "Private sector hospitals appear to manage these processes more efficiently.", "VA\u2019s average lag times from the date of discharge or care to the date of billing are 74 days for inpatient care and 143 days for outpatient care.

For example, VA bills both for facility and provider charges, whereas the two private sector hospitals we visited only billed for facility charges; medical groups bill separately for physician fees. In addition, VA can only collect on the Medicare supplemental portion of the payment, whereas the private hospital can collect both Medicare and supplemental payments. VA reports that about 70 percent of its bills are sent to Medicare supplemental insurers, and for these, it can only expect to collect abut 20 percent of the billed amount. Consequently, VA would have a higher cost-to-collect ratio even if it were as efficient as its private sector counterparts.

Under the reasonable charges billing system, VA assigns hundreds of diagnoses codes and thousands of procedure codes based on the documentation of the services provided to veterans. Therefore, before reasonable charges, an outpatient surgery, such as one to repair a hernia, would result in one all-inclusive charge. Under reasonable charges, VA must now create separate bills for physician charges and for outpatient facility charges for the same outpatient surgery. Although estimates varied at the sites we visited, one official estimated that using reasonable charges increased the number of bills by about 5 times.", "Officials at all sites we visited reported acquiring more staff\u2014both in- house and through contracts\u2014to process bills under reasonable charges. For example, since reasonable charges was implemented, one site\u2019s total number of coders and billers more than doubled, from 7 to 19. Based on the 133 facilities reporting to our survey, increases of VA staff continued into this fiscal year.

VA has noted that although its national policies address key components of revenue operations, they are not followed in a standard and consistent manner. For example, VA has encouraged physicians to enter their notes electronically; however, physicians at one location we visited were dictating their notes for transcription, which were then transferred to the electronic system. At another site, an official told us that while other facilities were able to create an electronic interface with an intermediary to transmit bills to insurance companies, his facility had not. Therefore, bills were keyed in and printed, then re-keyed in by data entry staff to allow electronic transmission to the intermediary.", "Collections performance also varies widely from facility to facility. For example, one facility takes an average of 16 days to send an inpatient bill, while another averages 342 days. Facilities\u2019 performance in cost to collect were similarly diverse. According to data reported to us by facilities for the first half of fiscal year 2001, VA\u2019s average personnel cost to collect a dollar was 24 cents across both inpatient and outpatient bills, with facilities in the top 25 percent of performance reporting personnel costs to collect a dollar ranging from 5 to 15 cents and facilities in the bottom 25 percent of performance reporting personnel costs to collect a dollar ranging from 31 to 64 cents.", "In addition, the data accumulated from the various facility systems are not adequate to nationally manage performance. VA notes that the lack of software and data standardization across facilities impairs its ability to consistently measure performance and set performance goals. Moreover, because VA\u2019s accounting system does not break out third-party collections or operations costs, net revenues (that is, gross revenue collections minus operations costs) cannot be monitored at a national level. According to an official at VA\u2019s national headquarters, data on facility performance are also unreliable because they are not verified. For example, some facilities reported high and unreasonable numbers\u2014such as thousands of days to bill\u2014which the facilities could not explain.

The 1999 business plan further suggested consolidating some network operations with a high- performing VA unit within the network as a comparison to contracting. Both approaches could increase standardization of processes and introduce best practices.", "Some networks have consolidated some revenue operations. Networks and facilities have also used contracting, but these contracting efforts have primarily been small-scale and aimed at addressing immediate problems. Few facilities have contracted out an entire process of revenue operations. (See table 2.)", "VA facilities and networks reported to us that most of their contracts are viewed as temporary to meet immediate needs, such as supplementing their staffs to reduce backlogs of claims. Revenue operations managers also voiced a number of concerns that indicated that they would be unlikely to pursue extensive contracting. Our survey showed that less than 1 percent of either network or facility revenue-operations managers reported that contracting out the majority of revenue operations would be the most effective alternative. In addition, they noted various implementation barriers that would have to be resolved. For example, contractors would need to be trained about VA\u2019s rules and regulations, an interface between VA\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s computer systems would need to be developed, and union issues that would arise around the loss of VA jobs would need to be addressed.", "A recent VA-sponsored survey of eight health care revenue collection firms and a VA-hosted vendor conference indicated that contractors have an interest in performing most revenue processes\u2014from intake through accounts receivable\u2014and they had anticipated some of the barriers facilities and networks identified. For example, contractors identified the need to establish an interface with VA\u2019s data systems. Without such an interface, the contractor might only be able to provide contract workers to use VA\u2019s data systems rather than to bring the full capacity of the contractor\u2019s own data systems to improve operations. The contractors also believed that if the contractor were only engaged in the latter parts of revenue operations\u2014billing and accounts receivable\u2014the effect on increasing collections would be limited because generating additional revenue is critically affected by front-end activities such as insurance identification, documentation, and coding.", "While there were similar concerns about consolidation, it appears to have more acceptance among VA revenue managers than extensive contracting. In our survey, 36 percent of network respondents and 11 percent of facility respondents indicated that network-level consolidation would be the most effective alternative for managing third-party collections.
