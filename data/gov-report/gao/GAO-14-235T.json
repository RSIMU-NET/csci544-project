To help accomplish its mission, FPS conducts facility security assessments and has approximately 13,500 contract security guards deployed to federal facilities.", "This testimony discusses challenges FPS faces in (1) ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and (2) conducting risk assessments at federal facilities. It is based on GAO work issued from 2008 through 2013 on FPS's contract guard and risk assessment programs, and preliminary results of GAO's ongoing work to determine the extent to which FPS and select federal agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies align with federal risk assessment standards. To perform this work, GAO reviewed FPS's and eight federal agencies' risk assessment documentation and compared it to the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) standards. These agencies were selected based on their missions and types of facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FPS faces challenges ensuring that contract guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities around the country. In its September 2013 report, GAO found that providing active shooter response and screener training is a challenge for FPS. For example, according to officials at five guard companies, their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active shooter. Without ensuring that all guards receive training on how to respond to incidents at federal facilities involving an active-shooter, FPS has limited assurance that its guards are prepared for this threat. Similarly, an official from one of FPS's contract guard companies stated that 133 (about 38 percent) of its approximately 350 guards have never received screener training. As a result, guards deployed to federal facilities may be using x-ray and magnetometer equipment that they are not qualified to use which raises questions about their ability to screen access control points at federal facilities--one of their primary responsibilities. GAO was unable to determine the extent to which FPS's guards have received active-shooter response and screener training, in part, because FPS lacks a comprehensive and reliable system for guard oversight. FPS agreed with GAO's 2013 recommendation that they take steps to identify guards that have not had required training and provide it to them. GAO also found that FPS continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements. For instance, although FPS agreed with GAO's 2012 recommendation that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards' training, certifications, and qualifications, it does not yet have such a system.", "FPS also continues to face challenges assessing risk at federal facilities. GAO reported in 2012 that FPS is not assessing risks at federal facilities in a manner consistent with federal standards. GAO's preliminary results from its ongoing work on risk assessments at federal facilities indicate that this is still a challenge for FPS and several other federal agencies. Federal standards, such as the National Infrastructure Protection Plan 's risk management framework and ISC's risk assessment provisions, state that a risk assessment should include threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessments. Risk assessments help decision-makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures to mitigate the risk. Instead of conducting risk assessments, FPS is using an interim vulnerability assessment tool, referred to as the Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST) to assess federal facilities until it develops a longer-term solution. However, MIST does not assess consequence (the level, duration, and nature of potential loss resulting from an undesirable event). Three of the four risk assessment experts GAO spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess risks. Thus, FPS has limited knowledge of the risks facing about 9,600 federal facilities around the country. FPS officials stated that they did not include consequence information in MIST because it was not part of the original design. GAO will continue to monitor this issue and plans to report its final results early next year."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DHS and FPS agreed with the recommendations in GAO's 2012 and 2013 reports to improve FPS's contract guard and risk assessment processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss the efforts of the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS) to protect  the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the control and custody of  the General Services Administration (GSA), including the challenges  associated with FPS\u2019s use of contract guards and risk assessments. The  2012 shooting at the Anderson Federal Building in Long Beach,  California, the results of our 2009 covert testing, and FPS\u2019s ongoing  penetration testing demonstrate the continued vulnerability of federal  facilities. Although FPS does not protect the Washington Navy Yard, the  recent killing of 13 people there once again showed how federal facilities  can become targets of violence. The challenge of protecting federal  facilities is one of the major reasons why we have designated federal real  property management as a high-risk area.", "FPS is authorized to (1) protect the buildings, grounds, and property that  are under the control and custody of GSA, as well as the persons on the  property; (2) enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting  such property and persons on the property; and (3) investigate offenses  against these buildings and persons.providing security services through two types of activities:   FPS conducts its mission by physical security activities\u2014conducting security assessments and  recommending countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents\u2014and  law enforcement activities\u2014proactively patrolling facilities, responding  to incidents, conducting criminal investigations, and exercising arrest  authority. To accomplish its mission, FPS currently has almost 1,200  full-time employees and about 13,500 contract guards deployed at  federal facilities across the country. It expects to receive  approximately $1.3 billion in fees for fiscal year 2013.", "Since 2008, we have reported on the challenges FPS faces with carrying  out its mission, including overseeing its contract guards and assessing  risk at federal facilities. FPS\u2019s contract guard program is the most visible  component of the agency\u2019s operations, and the agency relies on its  guards to be its \u201ceyes and ears\u201d while performing their duties. However,  we reported in 2010 and again in 2013 that FPS continues to experience  difficulty ensuring that its guards have the required training and  certifications. Before guards are assigned to a post (an area of  responsibility) at a federal facility, FPS requires that they all undergo  employee fitness determinations and complete approximately 120 hours  of training provided by the contractor and FPS, including basic training  and firearms training. Among other duties, contract guards are  responsible for controlling access to facilities; conducting screening at  access points to prevent the introduction of prohibited items, such as  weapons and explosives; and responding to emergency situations  involving facility safety and security. FPS also faces challenges  assessing risks at the 9,600 facilities under the control and custody of  GSA. For instance, in 2012, we reported that FPS\u2019s ability to protect and  secure federal facilities has been hampered by the absence of a risk  assessment program that is consistent with federal standards. To address  this issue, we made several recommendations which FPS agreed to  implement. These recommendations and their status are discussed later  in this statement.", "This testimony discusses challenges FPS faces in (1) ensuring contract  security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and  certified and (2) conducting risk assessments at federal facilities.

This testimony is also based on preliminary results of our ongoing effort to  determine the extent to which FPS and select other federal agencies  assess risk in accordance with federal risk assessment standards. We  plan to issue our report early next year. As part of that work, we reviewed  and analyzed risk assessment documentation and interviewed officials at  nine federal agencies and compared each agency\u2019s methodology to  Interagency Security Committee (ISC) standards. The nine selected  agencies include: Department of Energy, Office of Health, Safety, and  Security; Department of Interior; Department of Justice, Justice Protective  Service; Department of State, Diplomatic Security; Department of  Veterans Affairs; Federal Emergency Management Agency; Federal  Protective Service; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and Office of  Personnel Management.

Without a comprehensive guard management system, FPS has  no independent means of ensuring that its contract guard companies  have met contract requirements, such as providing qualified guards to  federal facilities. Instead, FPS requires its guard companies to maintain  files containing guard-training and certification information and to provide  it with a monthly report containing this information.
