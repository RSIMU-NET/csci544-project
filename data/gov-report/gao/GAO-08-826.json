GAO was asked to (1) examine the extent to which individuals holding a current CDL have serious medical conditions and (2) provide examples of commercial drivers with medical conditions that should disqualify them from receiving a CDL. To examine the extent to which individuals holding CDLs have serious medical conditions, GAO identified those who were in both DOT's CDL database and selected federal disability databases of the Social Security Administration, Office of Personnel Management, and Departments of Veterans Affairs and Labor and have been identified as 100 percent disabled according to the program's criteria. Because DOT's data also include inactive licenses, GAO obtained current CDL data from 12 selected states based primarily on the size of CDL population. To provide case study examples, GAO focused on four states--Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and Virginia.

GAO's analysis provides a starting point for exploring the effectiveness of the current CDL medical certification process. Our analysis of commercial license data from DOT and medical disability data from the Social Security Administration, Office of Personnel Management, and Departments of Veterans Affairs and Labor found that about 563,000 of such individuals had commercial driver licenses and were determined by the federal government to be eligible for full disability benefits. This represented over 4 percent of all commercial driver licenses in the DOT database. Our analysis of 12 selected states indicates that most of these commercial drivers still have active licenses. Specifically, for these 12 selected states, about 85 percent had a current CDL even though they had a medical condition from which they received full federal disability benefits. The majority of these drivers were issued a CDL after the driver was approved for full federal disability benefit.

We presumed that individuals  receiving full federal disability benefits were eligible for these benefits  because of the seriousness of their medical conditions.  DOT\u2019s CDLIS  database contains an archive of all CDLs reported to DOT by the states.  We obtained this database and compared the CDL holders from CDLIS  with the disability recipients of selected federal programs administered by  the Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Department of Labor  (DOL). Specifically, we identified CDL holders that are both currently  receiving disability benefits and have been identified as 100 percent  disabled according to the program\u2019s criteria. We further analyzed the  recipient files to extract those medical conditions that would likely  disqualify a driver from a CDL, such as deafness and epilepsy. Because  CDLIS contains inactive CDLs in its population, we obtained data of active  CDLs from a nonrepresentative selection of 12 states to identify those CDL  holders in CDLIS that have an active CDL. Further, because commercial  drivers may contract a serious medical condition after the issuance of the  CDL, we determined the number of individuals that received their CDL  subsequent to the federal agencies determination that the individual is  eligible for full benefits due to their medical condition. In addition, our  estimate does not include drivers with severe medical conditions that are  not in the selected federal programs we analyzed.", "To provide case-study examples of commercial drivers who hold active  CDLs and also receive full federal benefits due to a CDL disqualifying  medical condition, we focused on four states as agreed to with your  staff\u2014Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and Virginia. From these four states,  we selected, for detailed investigation, 15 commercial drivers that we  identified based on our data analysis and mining. For each case, we  interviewed, as appropriate, the commercial driver, the driver\u2019s employer,  and the driver\u2019s physician to determine whether, under current DOT  regulations and guidelines, the medical condition should have precluded  the driver from holding a valid CDL. For these 15 cases, we also reviewed  relevant state department of motor vehicle reports, police reports, and  other public records.", "We performed our investigative work from May 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency.

In 2006,  about 5,300 people died as a result of crashes involving large commercial  trucks or buses, and about 126,000 more were injured. A recent study  performed by DOT showed that a significant number of commercial driver  crashes were due to a physical impairment of the driver. Specifically, DOT  found that about 12 percent of the crashes where the crash cause could be  identified were due to drivers falling asleep, being disabled by a heart  attack or seizure, or other physical impairments.", "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) within DOT  shoulders the primary federal responsibility for reducing crashes, injuries,  and fatalities involving large trucks and buses. FMCSA\u2019s primary means of  preventing these crashes is to develop and enforce regulations to help  ensure that drivers and motor carriers are operating in a safe manner.  FMCSA\u2019s regulations, among other things, require that drivers of  commercial motor vehicles are 21 years old, can read and speak the  English language, have a current and valid commercial motor vehicle  operator\u2019s license, have successfully completed a driver\u2019s road test, and  are physically qualified to drive. As part of these regulations, FMCSA  established standards for the physical qualifications of commercial  drivers, including the requirement of a medical certification from a  medical examiner stating that the commercial driver is physically qualified  to operate a commercial motor vehicle. See appendix II for a description  of the federal medical requirements.", "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent  federal agency that investigates transportation accidents, considers the  medical fitness of commercial drivers a major concern. Over the past  several years, NTSB has reported on serious flaws in the medical  certification process of commercial drivers. NTSB stated that these flaws  can lead to increased highway fatalities and injuries for commercial  vehicle drivers, their passengers, and the motoring public.", "In 2001 NTSB recommended eight safety actions to improve the oversight  of the medical certification process, in response to a bus crash that killed  22 people in Louisiana. According to NTSB, currently all eight of the  recommendations remain open. In response to FMCSA\u2019s failure to  adequately address NTSB\u2019s recommendations, NTSB placed the oversight  of medical fitness on its \u201cMost Wanted\u201d list in 2003. Table 1 details each of  NTSB\u2019s recommendations.", "Several fatality crashes highlight the need for and the importance of  having an effective medical certificate process. For example,  In July 2000, a truck collided with a Tennessee Highway Patrol vehicle  protecting a highway work zone. The patrol car exploded at impact,  killing the state trooper. The driver of the truck had previously been  diagnosed with sleep apnea and hypothyroidism, and had a similar  crash in 1997, when he struck the rear of a patrol car in Utah. NTSB  stated that it believes that if a comprehensive medical oversight  program been in place at the time of the accident, this driver, with  known and potentially incapacitating medical conditions, would have  been less likely to have been operating a commercial vehicle. This  accident, the NTSB said, \u201cdemonstrates how easily unfit drivers are  able to take advantage of the inadequacies of the current medical  system, resulting in potentially fatal consequences.\u201d", "In May 2005, a truck collided with a sports utility vehicle in Kansas  killing a mother and her 10-month-old baby. Prior to the accident, a  physician diagnosed the truck driver with a severe form of sleep apnea.  The truck driver subsequently went to another physician who issued  the medical certificate because the driver did not disclose this illness.  The truck driver was found guilty of two counts of vehicular  manslaughter.", "In August 2005 in New York, a truck collided with a motor vehicle,  killing the occupants. The truck driver admitted to forging a medical  certificate required to get his CDL license because he had been  diagnosed with a seizure disorder.

Specifically, about 85,000 of the 135,000  individuals, or about 63 percent, had their CDL issued after the federal  agency determined that the individual met the federal requirements for full  disability benefits according to data from our four selected federal  agencies.

For more detailed information on criteria for  selection of the 15 cases, see appendix I.", "On the basis of our investigation of these 15 cases, we identified instances  where careful medical examinations did not occur. Most states do not  require commercial drivers to provide medical certifications to be issued a  CDL. Instead, many states only require individuals to self-certify that a  medical examiner granted them a medical certification allowing them to  operate commercial vehicles, thus meeting the minimum federal  requirements. As a result, we found several commercial drivers who  made false assertions on their self-certification that they received a  medical certification when in fact no certification was made. For more  information on state requirements for medical certifications, see appendix  IV.", "In addition, our investigations found that commercial drivers produced  fraudulent documentation regarding their medical certification.  Specifically, we found instances where commercial drivers forged a  medical examiner\u2019s signature on a medical certification form. In addition,  we also found a driver who failed to disclose to the medical examiner that  another doctor had prescribed him morphine for his back pain.", "Finally, our investigations found certain medical examiners did not follow  the federal requirements in the determination of medical fitness of  commercial drivers. For example, one medical examiner represented to  GAO that she did not know that a driver\u2019s deafness would disqualify the  individual from receiving a medical certification.", "Table 2 highlights 5 of the 15 drivers we investigated.

Specifically, the driver had open heart surgery in 2003 to repair a ruptured  aorta, had a stroke in 2005, and shortly thereafter had another surgery to  replace a heart valve. In June 2006, approximately 3 months after Social  Security determined the driver was fully disabled; the Maryland driver  license agency renewed his CDL for 5 years with a \u201cPassenger\u201d  endorsement. The bus driver provided our investigator a forged medical  certificate. Specifically, we found that  the medical certificate did not have the required medical license  number,  the physician did not have any record that the bus driver underwent a  medical examination for a CDL, and  the physician denied conducting a CDL medical exam or signing the  medical certificate.", "Surprisingly, the medical practice also had a copy of the forged medical  certificate in its files. The medical practice\u2019s staff stated, however, that it is  not uncommon for a patient to bring documents to the office and ask that  they be stored in their medical records. The driver\u2019s CDL does not expire  until 2011.", "Case 2: A Virginia truck driver has received SSA disability benefits for  over 10 years. The driver\u2019s disability records indicate that that driver had  multiple medical conditions, including complications due to an  amputation, and that the driver is \u201calso essentially illiterate.\u201d The truck  driver has a prosthetic right leg resulting from a farm accident. Although  the driver possesses a current medical certificate, the medical examiner  did not specify on the medical certificate that it is only valid when  accompanied with a Skills Performance Evaluation (SPE) certificate. To  test his prosthetic leg, the truck driver stated that he was asked to push  the medical examiner across the room in a rolling chair with the prosthetic  leg. In our investigation, we attempted to contact the medical examiner  but discovered that he is no longer employed by that clinic. The state  revoked his medical license due to illegally distributing controlled  substances.", "In 2006, the truck driver was involved in a single vehicle accident when the  load in his truck shifted when making a turn and the truck overturned.  Prior to October 2007, the truck driver had a CDL with both \u201cTanker\u201d and  \u201cHazmat\u201d endorsements. In October 2007, the state driver license agency  renewed his CDL with a \u201cTanker\u201d endorsement, which will not expire until  2012.", "Case 3: A bus driver has been receiving Social Security disability benefits  since 1994 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). The bus  driver currently uses three daily inhalers to control his breathing and has a  breathing test conducted every 6 months. The bus driver stated that he  \u201cgets winded\u201d when he walks to his mailbox and he \u201coccasionally blacks  out and forgets things.\u201d However, the driver stated that he has no problem  driving a bus, however, he cannot handle luggage or perform any other  strenuous duties.", "Despite not possessing a valid medical certificate, companies continue to  hire him as a bus driver on an ad hoc basis. For example, the driver drove  a passenger bus as recently as 1 month prior to the time of our interview.  The driver stated that the companies have not asked to see his medical  certificate. He further stated that because most companies are \u201churting for  drivers,\u201d they \u201cdon\u2019t ask a lot of questions\u201d and pay many of their drivers in  cash.

FMCSA stated the  following:    Disability, even full disability associated with a diagnosis, does not  necessarily mean that an individual is medically unfit to operate a  commercial vehicle.", "Disability is not related necessarily to when a medical condition  occurred or recurs. The onset of a disease or disabling medical  condition is more relevant to medical fitness than when the disability  benefits and payments began.  As an example, a fully disabled  individual may have accommodated to the disability and may improve  with treatment while receiving lifelong disability payments.", "In general, a medical diagnosis alone is not adequate to determine  medical fitness to operate a commercial vehicle safely.
