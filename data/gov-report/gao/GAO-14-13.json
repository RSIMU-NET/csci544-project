GAO was asked to review the status of V2V technologies. GAO examined (1) the state of development of V2V technologies and their anticipated benefits; (2) the challenges, if any, that will affect the deployment of these technologies and what actions, if any, DOT is taking to address them; and (3) what is known about the potential costs associated with these technologies.", "GAO reviewed documentation on V2V technology-related efforts by DOT and automobile manufacturers, visited a pilot study of V2V technologies in Michigan, and interviewed DOT officials, automobile manufacturers, and 21 experts identified by the National Academies of Sciences.

Efforts by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the automobile industry have focused on developing: 1) in-vehicle components such as hardware to facilitate communications among vehicles, 2) safety software applications to analyze data and identify potential collisions, 3) vehicle features that warn drivers, and 4) a national communication security system to ensure trust in the data transmitted among vehicles. According to DOT, if widely deployed, V2V technologies could provide warnings to drivers in as much as 76 percent of potential multi-vehicle collisions involving at least one light vehicle, such as a passenger car. Ultimately, however, the level of benefits realized will depend on the extent of the deployment of these technologies and the effectiveness of V2V warnings in eliciting appropriate driver responses. The continued progress of V2V technology development hinges on a decision that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to make in late 2013 on how to proceed regarding these technologies. One option would be to pursue a rulemaking requiring their inclusion in new vehicles.", "The deployment of V2V technologies faces a number of challenges, which DOT is working with the automobile industry to address. According to experts, DOT officials, automobile manufacturers, and other stakeholders GAO interviewed, these challenges include: 1) finalizing the technical framework and management framework of a V2V communication security system, which will be unique in its size and structure; 2) ensuring that the possible sharing with other wireless users of the radio-frequency spectrum used by V2V communications will not adversely affect V2V technology's performance; 3) ensuring that drivers respond appropriately to warnings of potential collisions; 4) addressing the uncertainty related to potential liability issues posed by V2V technologies; and 5) addressing any concerns the public may have, including those related to privacy. DOT is collaborating with automobile manufacturers and others to find potential technical and policy solutions to these challenges and plans to continue these efforts. Although V2V technologies are being tested in a real-world pilot that will end in February 2014, DOT officials stated that they cannot fully plan for deployment until NHTSA decides how to proceed later this year.", "DOT and the automobile industry are currently analyzing the total costs associated with V2V technologies, which include the costs of both in-vehicle components and a communication security system. All of the automobile manufacturers GAO interviewed said that it is difficult to estimate in-vehicle V2V component costs at this time because too many factors--such as future production volumes and the time frame of deployment--remain unknown. The costs associated with a V2V communication security system also remain unknown as the specifics of the system's technical framework and management structure are not yet finalized. While the costs of in-vehicle V2V components may be modest relative to the price of a new vehicle, some experts noted that the potential costs associated with the operation of a V2V communication security system could be significant.

Improvements in automobile safety that aim to  protect drivers and occupants in the event of a collision\u2014including  features such as seat belts and airbags\u2014have reduced fatalities.  Recently, however, the automobile industry has begun to introduce  technologies that are intended to prevent accidents.

We interviewed NHTSA and RITA officials  about these efforts. We also visited the DOT-sponsored V2V Safety Pilot  Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and received a demonstration  of V2V technologies in the Detroit area from automobile manufacturers  working on the development of these technologies. We conducted  structured interviews with 21 experts identified by the National Academies  of Sciences as knowledgeable in the areas of V2V technology  development and interoperability, technology deployment, production of  light-duty passenger vehicles, data privacy and security, legal and policy  issues, and human factors issues related to V2V technologies.

According to NHTSA, the rate of 1.10 fatalities per 100 million vehicle  miles traveled in 2011 represented an all-time low and was 28 percent  lower than the rate of 1.52 in 2001. DOT has attributed reductions in  fatality rates to several factors, including increased use of in-vehicle  safety features such as safety belts and a reduction in fatalities related to  alcohol-impaired driving.", "In recent years, automobile manufacturers have begun to equip some  newly manufactured vehicles with sensor-based crash avoidance  technologies intended to prevent accidents and further reduce the  number of fatalities. These technologies employ sensors such as  cameras, radio detection and ranging, and light detection and ranging to  observe a vehicle\u2019s surroundings. A vehicle equipped with such  technologies is capable of detecting potential collisions with other  vehicles or obstacles within a range of about 150 meters (about 500 feet)  and alerting drivers through applications such as forward collision  warnings and lane departure warnings; however, such warnings are  limited to the threats within the field of view of the vehicle\u2019s sensors.", "DOT has worked with the automobile industry and others to lead and fund  research on connected vehicle technologies, which include V2V  technologies as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies. From fiscal  years 2003 through 2012, the funding DOT has made available for efforts  on connected vehicle technologies, part of its Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS) research program, totaled about $445 million and ranged  from a low of $17 million in 2008 to a high of $84 million in 2011. In a  connected vehicle environment, data is shared wirelessly among vehicles  (V2V communications) or between vehicles and infrastructure (vehicle-to- infrastructure communications) using dedicated short-range  communications (DSRC), a technology similar to Wi-Fi that offers a link  through which vehicles and infrastructure can transmit messages over a  range of about 300 to 500 meters (about 1,000 to 1,600 feet). Based on  analysis of internal data and data received from other vehicles, a vehicle  equipped with V2V technologies is able to issue a warning to its driver  when a collision with another similarly equipped vehicle could occur. The  range of V2V communications is not only greater than that of existing  sensor-based technologies, but due to the sharing of data between  vehicles, V2V technologies are capable of alerting drivers to potential  collisions that are not visible to existing sensor-based technologies, such  as a stopped vehicle blocked from view or a moving vehicle at a blind  intersection (see fig. 1).", "While V2V technologies send and receive data among vehicles, vehicle- to-infrastructure technologies send and receive data between vehicles  and infrastructure, such as traffic signals. Vehicle-to-infrastructure  technologies could offer additional safety features that V2V technologies  cannot, such as providing drivers with additional warnings when traffic  signals are about to change, warnings that could help reduce collisions at  intersections. In addition, these technologies can offer potential mobility  and environmental benefits; for example, they can collect, analyze, and  provide drivers with data on upcoming roadway and traffic conditions and  suggest alternate routes when roadways are congested.", "In addition to federal efforts, automobile manufacturers have formed a  number of consortia to research and develop V2V communication-based  technologies and have collaborated with DOT on these efforts. Since  2002, DOT has awarded $77 million in funding, under cost-sharing  agreements to support projects related to V2V technologies, to a number  of consortia established by the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership  (CAMP). This partnership between Ford Motor Company and General  Motors, L.L.C. is currently working with 6 other automobile manufacturers  through the Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) 3 Consortium to  collaboratively address safety issues through advancements in vehicle  communications. Additionally, the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration  Consortium (VIIC) was created in 2005 and is currently comprised of 10  automobile manufacturers with the goal of identifying and promoting  policy solutions needed to support the development and deployment of  V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies.", "The automobile industry (as well as some technology companies such as  Google) is also working to develop autonomous vehicle technologies,  which would control steering, acceleration, and braking without a driver\u2019s  input. Some automobile manufacturers have started to introduce semi- autonomous sensor-based technologies capable of reducing a vehicle\u2019s  speed through adaptive cruise control or even stopping a vehicle  through automatic braking when a collision is imminent. Autonomous  vehicles are being designed with the intent that a driver is needed to  provide destination or navigation information, but not needed to control  the vehicle.", "Because V2V communications depend upon DSRC technology to  transmit data among vehicles, the deployment of V2V technologies will  require use of the radio-frequency spectrum. FCC has allocated spectrum  for use by DSRC technologies that are part of DOT\u2019s ITS research  program. Specifically, in 1999, FCC allocated 75 megahertz (MHz) of  spectrum\u2014the 5.850 to 5.925 gigahertz (GHz) band (5.9 GHz band)\u2014 for the primary purpose of improving transportation safety and adopted  basic technical rules for DSRC operations. In 2003, FCC established  licensing and service rules for the 5.9 GHz band to provide a short-range,  wireless link for transferring information between vehicles and roadside  systems. However, the President and Congress have responded to  growing demand for wireless broadband services by making changes in  the law to promote efficient use of spectrum, including the band  previously set aside for use by DSRC-based technologies. For example,  the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to  conduct a study evaluating spectrum-sharing technologies and the  potential risk to federal users if unlicensed devices were allowed to  operate in the 5.9 GHz band.", "Given the potential benefits of V2V technologies, NHTSA has said it will  decide by the end of 2013 how it will proceed with respect to these  technologies for passenger vehicles.

Existing sensor-based crash  avoidance technologies also provide warnings to drivers through  similar mechanisms. DOT has been developing guidelines for  automobile manufacturers in implementing driver-vehicle interfaces.", "In addition to in-vehicle V2V components, an external communication  security system is needed to ensure that data being transmitted among  vehicles are secure and trusted and have not been altered in the  transmission process. Initial research and proposals by DOT and the  automobile industry on the design of a communication security system  have focused on a public key infrastructure system. Such a system  provides security certificates to vehicles which indicate to other vehicles  that the data being transmitted are to be trusted because they are valid  and have not been altered. Public key infrastructure is used to provide  security for many other types of data transmissions and transactions,  including online banking and Internet commerce. According to CAMP  VSC 3 officials, in-vehicle V2V equipment must be able to detect and  automatically report potentially misbehaving devices\u2014such as devices  that are malfunctioning, used maliciously, or hacked\u2014to a communication  security system. The communication security system must also detect  and automatically revoke certificates from vehicles with such devices.  Vehicles would receive certificates from a security certificate  management authority. However, the technical specifications of how  certificates will be provided, how often they will be validated, and who will  manage this system have not yet been fully defined. According to DOT  officials, a prototype V2V communication security system was developed  and tested as part of the Safety Pilot, but that system\u2019s design would  need additional enhancements to be used for a full deployment.", "In-vehicle V2V components could be factory built into new vehicles and  fully integrated with existing internal electronics and networks. DOT and  the automobile industry have also worked on developing retrofit and  aftermarket V2V devices. Such devices would be installed in a vehicle  post-manufacture and might not be fully integrated with the vehicle and its  existing internal electronics and network. Such aftermarket devices might  not have access to all of a vehicle\u2019s data, such as brake status or steering  wheel angle. As a result, they could provide a less robust set of data to  other vehicles and could generate fewer or less precise warning  messages to drivers. One specific type of aftermarket device that the  automobile industry has worked to develop would only transmit a basic  data set about a vehicle\u2019s speed and location to other vehicles equipped  with V2V technologies; this device would neither receive data from other  vehicles nor provide a driver with a warning message, but would interact  with the V2V communication security system. DOT is now working with  the automobile industry to determine additional standards for such  devices to ensure that they work on all types of vehicles and adhere to  communication standards to ensure the integrity and security of their data  transmission.", "Because V2V communications involve the sharing of data among  different devices and vehicles of various makes and models, they require  technical standards to ensure interoperability. DOT and the automobile  industry have worked through international standards organizations such  as SAE International and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic  Engineers to develop and set standards to facilitate V2V communications.  These efforts have focused on standardizing the data elements that  vehicles transmit and the means through which data are transmitted.", "Although V2V technologies have undergone real-world testing and most  experts we interviewed believed that no major technical challenges  remain in the development of in-vehicle V2V components, some experts  voiced concerns about two technical issues\u2014GPS accuracy and potential  channel congestion\u2014issues that DOT and the automobile industry  continue to study.", "Three experts we interviewed expressed concern that GPS used by  V2V technologies may not provide sufficiently accurate vehicle  position for some V2V applications. Two experts also suggested that  the means through which V2V technologies use GPS to determine  vehicle position (called \u201crelative positioning\u201d) may not be accurate  enough, given the need for precise vehicle location data to support  V2V software applications. According to DOT officials, however, the  department has collected data on the performance of GPS and V2V  communications over 20,000 miles in diverse geographic and  environmental conditions and is confident that the automotive-grade  GPS being used for V2V safety applications is sufficiently accurate.  Nevertheless, DOT continues to work to address this issue through  research to identify the best means to determine vehicle location  through relative positioning. DOT also collected additional data during  the Safety Pilot to help ensure that GPS positioning limitations do not  negatively affect the performance of V2V technologies.", "Two experts noted that, given the volume of V2V data that would be  transmitted in high-traffic areas such as busy highways, channel  congestion on the frequency used by V2V communications could  result in delayed transmissions of V2V data. DOT and automobile  manufacturers continue to engage in collaborative efforts and sponsor  relevant studies to determine the point at which channel congestion  might occur and determine potential solutions, such as limiting the  frequency of V2V data transmissions in high-traffic situations without  compromising safety.", "In the longer term, V2V technology development efforts are likely to  complement efforts to continue to develop and deploy other sensor-based  crash avoidance technologies and autonomous vehicle technologies.  NHTSA\u2019s Administrator stated in May 2013 that DOT sees these three  types of technologies as being part of an evolution from vehicles with  limited automatic controls to vehicles with fully autonomous self-driving  capabilities.

According to  NHTSA, these prevalent crash scenarios represent the majority of all  vehicle crashes. Because automobiles cannot currently take autonomous  actions\u2014such as braking\u2014based on data gathered by V2V technologies,  drivers must act on V2V warnings to prevent collisions from happening.  These crash scenario applications are being tested in the Safety Pilot,  and DOT and the automobile industry have collected data to determine  how to improve the accuracy of the applications. DOT is currently  conducting a benefits assessment based in part on the first 6 months of  data from the Safety Pilot to inform the decision NHTSA plans to make in  late 2013.

This estimate also assumes that V2V technologies  provide warnings in all potential crash scenarios involving at least two  vehicles equipped with these technologies. The actual number of crashes  prevented by V2V technologies will depend on a number of factors,  including the following:", "Deployment Levels: According to DOT, the safety benefits of V2V  technologies will be maximized with near full deployment across the  U.S. vehicle fleet. However, even if NHTSA pursues a rulemaking  requiring installation of these technologies in new vehicles, it could  take a number of years until benefits are fully realized due to the rate  of turnover of the fleet. According to one automobile manufacturer we  interviewed, given the rate of new vehicle sales, it can take up to 20  years for the entire U.S. vehicle fleet to turn over. It may be possible  to see some benefits at lower levels of deployment, as was seen in  the number of interactions among participating vehicles in the Safety  Pilot, according to DOT. Also, aftermarket devices that allow existing  vehicles to be equipped with V2V devices could help speed  deployment. However, three experts we interviewed expressed  concern that drivers may not see value in purchasing aftermarket  devices, which could limit their adoption.", "Driver response: The benefits of V2V technologies will also depend on  how well drivers respond to warning messages. If drivers do not take  appropriate action in response to warnings, then the benefits of V2V  technologies could be reduced. For example, if drivers do not respond  to warnings quickly enough\u2014due to distraction, impairment, or other  reasons\u2014they may not be able to avoid a collision. Furthermore, if  safety applications offer too many false warnings when no imminent  threat exists, drivers could begin to ignore valid warnings or not  respond to them quickly enough. For example, the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety reported that as many as 41 percent of drivers of  certain makes of vehicles with sensor-based lane departure warning  systems found the systems \u201cannoying\u201d due to false alarms and  unnecessary warnings.", "Deployment of other safety technologies: The potential benefits solely  attributable to V2V technologies will also depend on the market  penetration and effectiveness of sensor-based crash avoidance  technologies.

For example, cameras and  radar can be used to provide drivers with forward collision warnings or  lane change warnings when another vehicle is in a blind spot. In  addition, vehicles in the future may use V2V technologies and sensor- based crash avoidance technologies to complement one another. For  example, future vehicles may be able to use V2V data to validate  sensor data and provide drivers with more accurate and certain  warnings as well as to help execute more reliable automated control  actions such as braking. The benefits attributable to V2V technologies  will depend on how these technologies work together and the market  penetration of these technologies.

Some proposals call for using DSRC-equipped roadside infrastructure  to provide security certificates, while other proposals call for using  non-DSRC communications technologies such as cellular.", "Management structure: How a V2V communication security system  will be managed has not yet been determined and the delineation of  relevant roles and responsibilities could be difficult. Twelve of the  experts we interviewed cited the establishment of a management  framework for a security system as a great or very great challenge to  V2V technology deployment. Because no similar institutions exist,  many questions remain about how such a system should be  structured and who should manage it. One expert suggested that  deciding which approach is most appropriate involves weighing  competing philosophies. The expert added that developing the  management structure could prove more difficult than developing the  technical aspects of the security system.", "DOT has researched options to address the technical framework of a V2V  communication security system and officials noted that additional  technical and policy analyses are under way that will determine the  specifics by early 2014. DOT officials stated that a framework that meets  the technical requirements of CAMP will be finalized and subsequently  prototyped and tested. As mentioned earlier, a prototype technical  framework for issuing and managing security certificates has been tested  as part of the Safety Pilot. DOT officials told us that there were no  significant technical challenges identified during the development of this  framework but noted that additional analysis related to the detection and  revocation of credentials from vehicles found to be sharing inaccurate  information is needed. In preparation for the testing of the Safety Pilot\u2019s  prototype technical framework, DOT conducted research on the risks  associated with such a system and identified potential approaches to  address those risks. In addition, the department held public workshops  in April 2012 to bring together various stakeholders to discuss issues  related to a V2V communication security system. DOT officials  explained that NHTSA is currently engaging a firm with expertise in  information security systems to perform a review that will help inform the  eventual technical specifications of a V2V communication security  system. Although various technical frameworks are being considered,  limits to DOT\u2019s authority could limit the viability of some options. For  example, according to DOT officials, the department does not have the  legal authority to require the installation of roadside infrastructure to  support a V2V communication security system because, aside from roads  on federal lands, the federal government does not own or operate U.S.  roadways.", "In addition, DOT has worked with automobile manufacturers through the  VIIC to examine potential management structures for a V2V  communication security system. However, officials told us that it would be  premature to comment on what the management structure will look like  without knowing whether the agency will pursue a rulemaking related to  V2V technologies. As part of its research on the technical framework of a  V2V communication security system, DOT also sought stakeholder input  on the potential management structure and identified three potential  options:", "Federal model: DOT officials explained that, if the federal government  were to provide the security management services required to support  V2V technologies, it most likely would do so through a service  contract that would include specific provisions to ensure adequate  market access, privacy and security controls, and reporting and  continuity of services. According to DOT, the department has  appropriate legal authority to pursue this model but does not have  sufficient resources to introduce such a structure at this time.", "Public-Private model: Under a public-private partnership, the security  system would be jointly owned and managed by the federal  government and private entities. DOT officials stated that statutory  authority would be needed to create a public-private management  structure that is vested with the authority that Congress deems  necessary and appropriate to finance and operate a V2V  communication security system. DOT officials added that the required  legal authority would likely need to include authorization to establish  and collect fees on behalf of the entity and possibly provisions  addressing liability, privacy, data ownership, and security  requirements applicable to such a system.", "Private model: DOT officials stated that its current legal authority and  resources have led NHTSA to focus primarily on working with  stakeholders to develop a viable private model. DOT officials  suggested that, through an agreement with a privately owned and  operated security management provider, a private model could be  used to support a V2V communication security system. Aside from  any aspects specifically detailed in the agreement, DOT suggested  that the governance and financing of a private management structure  would depend on what entity constitutes and owns the entity.", "In response to requirements in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job  Creation Act of 2012, FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in  February 2013 that requested comments on allowing unlicensed devices  to share the 5.9 GHz band of the radio-frequency spectrum that had been  previously set aside for the use of DSRC-based ITS applications such as  V2V technologies. The proposed modifications would provide access to  additional spectrum with consistent technical requirements, resulting in  faster data speeds by allowing unlicensed devices to use wider bandwidth  channels. Existing FCC regulations are designed to ensure that  unlicensed devices do not cause interference with licensed users and  require operators of unlicensed devices to immediately correct the  problem or cease operation if interference occurs. NTIA completed an  evaluation in January 2013 in response to requirements in the act that it  study spectrum-sharing technologies and the risks to federal users  associated with allowing unlicensed devices to share the 5.9 GHz band.  NTIA concluded that further work was needed to determine whether and  how the risks identified can be mitigated and is currently collaborating  with federal and industry stakeholders, as well as FCC, to conduct a  quantitative analysis of potential mitigation strategies. FCC officials told  us that they are unlikely to act further on a rulemaking in this area until  NTIA\u2019s analysis is complete.", "Although existing FCC regulations are designed to ensure that unlicensed  devices do not cause interference, four automobile manufacturers and 16  experts we interviewed expressed concern or uncertainty about the  potential effects of allowing unlicensed devices to share the 5.9 GHz  band. One automobile industry group said that its members are not  opposed to opening the 5.9 GHz band for sharing but emphasized the  importance of understanding the implications of doing so to ensure that it  will not hinder critical V2V safety applications. As part of the federal  rulemaking process, FCC sought public comments on potential  approaches to help minimize any potential harmful interference. In  response, one automobile manufacturer wrote that it is very concerned  that V2V technologies and unlicensed devices will not be able to coexist  on the 5.9 GHz band. This automobile manufacturer recommended that  FCC proceed with extreme caution when allowing sharing of the 5.9 GHz  band, stating that V2V technologies cannot tolerate harmful interference  and suggesting that every potential signal loss could render V2V  communications ineffective at a moment in which they could protect  drivers\u2019 lives. Members of the VIIC also noted that the development and  testing of V2V technologies has always assumed use of the 5.9 GHz  band. Because of this, one expert we interviewed suggested that opening  the 5.9 GHz band for sharing would create an added burden for both  automobile manufacturers and suppliers, which would have to consider  technical steps to make coexistence with unlicensed devices feasible and  conduct additional testing to maintain confidence that V2V technologies  will work as envisioned. In addition, DOT coordinated with NTIA to submit  its concern through comments to FCC that sharing the allocation could  degrade the performance of V2V safety applications.", "As NTIA continues its analysis of potential risk mitigation strategies, DOT  officials told us that the department is working cooperatively with the  agency to examine spectrum-sharing arrangements that have been  proposed for the 5 GHz band and expects results of this analysis to be  available in spring 2014. According to DOT officials, the automobile and  Wi-Fi industries are discussing other possible spectrum sharing  techniques but specific approaches have not yet been defined.", "Because V2V technologies require drivers to take actions based on  warning messages, the ultimate effectiveness and safety benefits of  V2V technologies depend upon how well drivers respond to the warnings.  Addressing the human factors that affect how drivers will respond  includes minimizing the risk that drivers could become too familiar with or  overly reliant upon warnings over time and fail to exercise due diligence in  responding to them, assessing the risk that V2V warnings could distract  drivers and present new safety issues, and determining what types of  V2V warnings will maximize driver response.", "The challenges posed by human factors are in many ways similar to  those posed by sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and some  other vehicle technologies. However, human factors issues may present  even greater challenges to V2V technologies. One automobile  manufacturer explained that, since not all vehicles in the United States  will be equipped with V2V technologies in the early years of their  deployment, it is unknown how drivers will adjust their behavior to  account for the fact that not all of the vehicles on the road are capable of  providing data. By contrast, with sensor-based technologies, drivers know  that their vehicle\u2019s warning system is not dependent on the presence of  similar technologies in nearby vehicles. Further, the potential introduction  of aftermarket V2V devices with a lower level of integration with a  vehicle\u2019s existing internal network could create additional human factors  challenges if aftermarket device warning messages and data are less  robust than fully integrated systems. For these reasons, one automobile  manufacturer said that it is unrealistic to expect aftermarket devices to  perform in all situations.", "Automobile manufacturers have already developed different approaches  to issuing warnings to drivers for existing sensor-based crash avoidance  technologies. Three experts we interviewed suggested that the manner in  which V2V warnings are issued to drivers should be allowed to vary  among automobile manufacturers once basic standards are put in place.  However, two experts suggested that the manner in which V2V warnings  are issued to drivers should be similar across vehicles to avoid the  confusion that might arise from receiving different types of warnings in  similar situations when driving a different vehicle (e.g., a rental car).", "NHTSA has a research program in place to develop human factors  principles that may be used by automobile manufacturers and suppliers  as they design and deploy V2V technology and other safety technology  driver-vehicle interfaces that provide warnings to drivers. This program is  evaluating alternative approaches to issuing warnings relative to  effectiveness and potential driver distraction. In addition, DOT has  surveyed drivers participating in the Safety Pilot about driver distraction,  in addition to other topics, and collected data on driver responses to  various V2V warnings. NHTSA has also sponsored other research on  driver warnings\u2014including initial research on the potential standardization  of warnings across automobile manufacturers\u2014and is planning to  complete a compendium of research findings in late 2013. Based on  research in this area, NHTSA has worked with stakeholders to develop  design principles for V2V driver-vehicle interfaces, which NHTSA plans to  publish in April 2014. DOT continues to determine next steps in this  area.", "Six automobile manufacturers and 17 experts we interviewed expressed  concern about the challenge posed by uncertainties related to potential  liability in the event of a collision involving vehicles equipped with V2V  technologies. This challenge is manifested in a number of potential  liability issues and questions that are unanswered at this time:", "One automobile manufacturer said that because V2V technologies  offer warnings that are based in part on data transmitted by other   vehicles\u2014as opposed to sensor-based systems that collect data  solely from a vehicle\u2019s surroundings\u2014it could be harder to determine  whether fault for a collision between vehicles equipped with V2V  technologies lies with one of the drivers, an automobile manufacturer,  the manufacturer of a V2V device, or another party.", "One expert suggested that, because V2V data may be needed to  determine fault in the event of a collision, there could be challenges in  determining who owns the data transmitted between vehicles. This  expert suggested that establishing rules regarding V2V data  ownership would, in the event of a collision, help to answer questions  about which parties have access to the data.", "There may be challenges in determining liability if V2V technologies  do not work appropriately\u2014for example, if data transmission is  delayed due to channel congestion, hacking into the system, or  inaccurate GPS readings.", "Four automobile manufacturers shared their concern that the  introduction of aftermarket V2V devices into vehicles already on the  road would create additional liability issues. One automobile  manufacturer explained that this is because it is difficult to integrate  aftermarket devices into a vehicle\u2019s existing internal network,  potentially making it more difficult to gather and transmit the same  degree of information as a fully integrated device and, therefore,  making it more difficult to determine the cause of a collision.", "Automobile manufacturers may be reluctant to move forward with plans to  install V2V technologies in their newly manufactured vehicles because of  the uncertainty that accompanies these liability issues. Citing some  automobile manufacturers\u2019 concerns about the liability risks posed by V2V  technologies, members of the VIIC have suggested that additional work  needs to be done to estimate the potential liability and risks associated  with the deployment of V2V technologies and determine ways to mitigate  that risk. One automobile manufacturer and two experts suggested that  congressional action could be needed to limit the liability levels of  automobile manufacturers in the event of a V2V device malfunction. One  of these experts suggested that legislation setting forth liability limits for  V2V devices that are shown to meet certification tests and function  according to regulations and standards may be appropriate. However,  one expert suggested that all vehicle technologies involve liability issues  and that if the automobile industry ensures that V2V technologies work  properly before deployment, V2V technologies should not pose any  greater liability risks than existing sensor-based crash avoidance  technologies.", "DOT officials told us that they do not believe that V2V technologies pose  any greater liability issues for automobile manufacturers than existing  sensor-based crash avoidance technologies and therefore do not believe  that related legislation is necessary. One expert we interviewed  suggested that DOT should help guide the process of determining who or  what entity owns the data transmitted between vehicles by V2V  technologies as that knowledge would make it easier to determine liability  in the event of a crash. Another expert suggested that DOT will have a  role to play in helping to address liability issues once the specifics of the  future deployment of these technologies become clearer.", "DOT and the CAMP VSC 3 Consortium conducted Driver Acceptance  Clinics in 2011 and 2012 to obtain volunteer drivers\u2019 feedback on V2V  technologies, among other purposes, and participants rated the  desirability and usefulness of these technologies highly. However,  according to stakeholders and experts we interviewed, obtaining broad  public acceptance could present a challenge to deployment, as concerns  related to driver privacy and the limited potential benefits of V2V  technologies in the early years of their deployment could impede overall  public acceptance of these technologies.", "Privacy concerns: Public interest groups we interviewed said that  overcoming concerns about privacy under a system that involves the  sharing of data among vehicles will pose a challenge. One group  suggested that the possibility that V2V data could be obtained by third  parties such as law enforcement agencies could harm the deployment  of these technologies. Similarly, one expert suggested that public  acceptance of V2V technologies might be limited without rules  prohibiting the use of vehicles\u2019 speed and location data to issue  tickets or track drivers\u2019 movements. Three experts we interviewed  suggested that legislation may be needed to limit the potential use of  V2V data. Representatives of automobile manufacturers that are  members of the VIIC stated that, although the security system under  development is being designed to ensure data privacy through a  structure that prevents the association of a vehicle\u2019s V2V  communication security certificates with any unique identifier of  drivers of their vehicles, the potential perception of a lack of privacy is  a challenge. Further, one automobile manufacturer that is part of the  VIIC said that it could be difficult to explain how V2V technologies  work to the public without raising concerns related to privacy.", "Perception of functionality: Public acceptance of V2V technologies  could also be negatively affected by drivers\u2019 perception of the  technologies\u2019 limited functionality, especially when few vehicles are  equipped with V2V devices in early years. As mentioned earlier, when  there are few equipped vehicles on the roads, drivers may see limited  benefits of V2V technologies as they may not frequently encounter  similarly equipped vehicles and infrequently receive warning  messages in potential collision scenarios. Some experts said that  limited benefits in the early years of deployment might pose  challenges to consumer acceptance of V2V technologies. For this  reason, six experts we interviewed suggested that the simultaneous  introduction of applications with mobility applications would help  provide benefits to drivers when deployment is low. For example, one  expert suggested that mobility applications capable of helping drivers  avoid congested roads or notifying them of a broken-down car ahead  in the roadway would provide more apparent benefits to drivers, even  with a low rate of deployment of V2V technologies. In addition,  seven experts we interviewed suggested that it would be helpful for  either DOT or automobile manufacturers to reach out to customers to  communicate the potential safety benefits of V2V technologies in  advance of deployment in order to increase public acceptance of  these technologies.", "DOT officials told us that the department recognizes that public  acceptance needs to be considered for the deployment of V2V  technologies and noted that they have worked closely with automobile  manufacturers and other stakeholders to develop a technical approach  that limits risks to individual privacy. DOT officials have emphasized the  need to distinguish between the ability to identify bad actors through a  V2V communication security system and the ability to monitor the  movements of individual vehicles. DOT stated that as currently  conceived, a V2V communication security system would contain multiple  technical, physical, and organizational controls to minimize privacy  risks\u2014including the risk of vehicle tracking by individuals and government  or commercial entities. According to DOT officials, after NHTSA decides  whether to proceed with a rulemaking and it is known what entity will  provide the security for V2V technologies, the department will perform a  comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment, as required by law, to  determine how to balance individual privacy, data security, and safety.  DOT officials have emphasized that, to ensure transparency, it will be  important to communicate what V2V data is generated by a vehicle, the  extent to which it can be linked to drivers, and who or what entities\u2014both  legally and technologically\u2014will be able to collect, use, and share the  data. DOT officials told us that the department will continue to assess any  risks to privacy posed by the introduction of V2V technologies and identify  mitigation measures to minimize those risks as more aspects of a system  of V2V communications are defined. DOT officials also said that, since its  current authority to regulate the interception and use of V2V data is  limited, the department might express a strong policy preference or make  recommendations to Congress for limitations on the use of V2V data by  entities over which the department lacks regulatory authority.", "DOT officials told us that the department does not currently have a  specific plan about how to proceed with public outreach efforts because  NHTSA has not yet decided whether a rulemaking is appropriate at this  time. Additional DOT efforts to address other challenges facing the  deployment of V2V technologies could help increase their public  acceptance. For example, DOT is collecting data from the Safety Pilot  regarding the acceptance of V2V technologies by participating drivers.  Furthermore, DOT\u2019s ongoing development of guidelines for the  implementation of driver-vehicle interfaces to address human factors  challenges could help increase overall acceptance of these technologies.  In addition, DOT has plans for further research on vehicle-to- infrastructure technologies, which could provide additional safety benefits  and enable the types of mobility applications that some experts  suggested could help increase public acceptance of V2V technologies.  Further, DOT is working with industry stakeholders to develop clear  certification standards for aftermarket devices, along with all other V2V  devices, and is considering incentives to encourage drivers to purchase  these devices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of DOT Planning for V2V Technology Deployment", "paragraphs": ["DOT has indicated that its 2015 to 2019 ITS strategic plan\u2014currently  under development and expected to be issued in early 2014\u2014will focus  on the challenges facing the deployment of V2V technologies.

Thus, a federal requirement  that automobile manufacturers install V2V technologies in newly  manufactured vehicles would likely result in lower per-vehicle costs of  in-vehicle V2V components than would otherwise be the case.", "Time frames: The costs of in-vehicle components of V2V technologies  may decline over time due to technological advances. Two automobile  manufacturers we interviewed said that both the automobile and  consumer electronics industries have been successful at driving down  the costs of other technologies over time and suggested that this also  may occur with the cost of in-vehicle V2V components.", "Degree of integration with existing vehicle technologies: Automobile  manufacturers already install sensor-based crash avoidance  technologies in some vehicle models. The extent to which V2V  technologies are integrated with the existing components of these and  other technologies that use similar components will influence the  costs of V2V technologies. For example, vehicles that already have  GPS chips installed for navigation purposes may not need an  additional GPS chip specifically for V2V technologies purposes. One  expert and one automobile manufacturer we interviewed explained  that automobile companies have been successful in integrating  different technologies in their vehicles in recent years, resulting in  reduced costs.", "Federal requirements: The specifics of any federal regulation  regarding V2V technologies, including any possible regulation  mandating their installation in new vehicles, would likely influence  costs. For example, the introduction of requirements related to V2V  technological specifications and standards, the use of hardware for  V2V components, and the use of V2V safety applications would  influence the ultimate costs of V2V technologies.", "Although the costs of in-vehicle V2V components are difficult to estimate  at this time, they may be modest compared to the price of a new vehicle.  According to CAMP VSC 3 Consortium representatives, in-vehicle V2V  components\u2014including the DSRC components and GPS receiver\u2014are  already commercially available at a relatively low cost. A CAMP VSC 3  representative noted that although members of the partnership are unable  to discuss potential V2V technology costs with one another due to  antitrust concerns, they have agreed to focus their V2V technology  development efforts on limiting their costs as much as possible. As a  result, compared to the average sale price of a new vehicle\u2014about  $31,000 in 2012, according to the National Automobile Dealers  Association\u2014the potential costs of these physical components may not  add significantly to a vehicle\u2019s price. One expert we interviewed estimated  that the costs of V2V components would add less than one percent to the  price of a new vehicle. These costs may be less than the costs of sensor- based crash avoidance technologies, according to one industry  association we interviewed, because sensors are more expensive.", "At this time, the potential costs associated with a V2V communication  security system are unknown as specifics of a security system remain  undetermined.

According to DOT  officials, how often vehicles must communicate with the security system  and requirements of how security certificates will be provided will  influence the ultimate cost of a V2V communication security system.  Furthermore, it is currently not only difficult to estimate the potential costs,  but unclear who or what entity\u2014consumers, automobile manufacturers,  DOT, state and local governments, or others\u2014would pay the costs.

One expert said that, given the need for continuous operation  of a security system, the costs are likely to be much greater than the  costs of in-vehicle V2V components. Potential sources of funding may  also face challenges in providing it. For example, if roadside equipment is  needed to support a security system, it could be costly in a nationwide  deployment. Participants in a 2012 DOT-hosted workshop focused on  connected vehicle security noted that the costs of roadside equipment  could range between $25,000 and $30,000 per installation, a cost that  many state and local governments would find prohibitive if they were  responsible for its financing. In addition, three experts whom we  interviewed said that the costs of ongoing maintenance and operation of  such installations could also prove prohibitive. According to DOT officials,  however, the potential costs of roadside equipment could be much lower  if its installation were to be integrated into already planned construction  work at selected sites.

These technologies allow vehicles to wirelessly  communicate with one another through Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC); share data, such as data on  vehicle location and speed; and provide drivers with warnings of potential collisions. GAO is examining these  technologies at the request of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit. Specifically, we are examining:  (1) the progress of development of connected vehicle technologies that involve vehicle-to-vehicle  communications and their anticipated benefits;  (2) the challenges that affect the development and deployment of these technologies and their potential costs; and  (3) how the U.S. Department of Transportation is leading efforts to address these challenges.", "Our work is limited to CVTs involving V2V communications and we are not including vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)  communications beyond the extent to which infrastructure may be needed to support V2V communications. We are  reviewing efforts in the United States and not in other countries. In addition, our work is limited to passenger vehicles and  we are not including commercial and transit uses.", "Please keep the following in mind as you consider your responses to the questions:  \uf0a7  We use the term \u201cstakeholders\u201d to indicate organizations that have been or are expected to be involved in the development or deployment of  CVTs involving V2V communications including, but not limited to, automobile manufacturers, parts suppliers, government agencies, and  telecommunications companies.  \uf0a7  We use the term \u201cCVTs involving V2V communications\u201d to include devices that send and receive data, safety applications (such as Forward  Collision Warning and Emergency Electronic Brake Lights Warning) that analyze data and provide warnings through driver-vehicle interfaces,  and any security system(s) that may be needed to help establish trust between vehicles sharing data.  \uf0a7  We use the term \u201cV2V devices\u201d to represent the devices now being tested in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan:   (1)  Fully-integrated devices: these devices would be installed during vehicle production and send, receive and analyze vehicle data to  generate driver warnings of potential collisions. Because they are fully integrated into vehicles, they can analyze additional vehicle  data\u2014such as steering wheel angle, acceleration rate, brake status and turn signal status\u2014to provide more robust warnings to drivers  and provide more complete data to other vehicles.  (2)  Aftermarket safety devices: these devices, installed after vehicle production, send, receive, and analyze vehicle data to generate  warnings of potential collisions. However, because they are not integrated with vehicles\u2019 electronics architecture and are thus unable  to consider additional data, these devices may be limited in their warnings and driver-vehicle interface.  (3)  Vehicle awareness devices: these devices are installed after vehicle production and are not connected to any vehicle systems. They  send data on a vehicle\u2019s location and speed which may be received by other vehicles, but these devices do not generate driver  warnings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1) Please discuss your views of the status of development of CVTs that involve V2V communications in the United", "paragraphs": ["States, including progress made and successes to date. 2)  In your opinion, what are some of the greatest potential benefits of CVTs that involve V2V communications?   a.
