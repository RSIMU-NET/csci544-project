As a result, PEPFAR began shifting efforts from directly providing treatment services toward support for treatment programs managed by partner countries. GAO was asked to review PEPFAR treatment programs. GAO examined (1) PEPFAR treatment program results and how OGAC measures them and (2) PEPFAR assistance to improve partner countries' M&E systems.

However, these indicators do not reflect some key PEPFAR results. First, although the number of people on treatment directly supported by PEPFAR grew from about 1.7 million to 5.1 million in fiscal years 2008 through 2012, this indicator alone does not provide complete information needed for assessing PEPFAR's contributions to partner countries' treatment programs. Second, although 10 PEPFAR country teams reported that percentages of people alive and on treatment after 12 months exceeded 80 percent, data for this indicator are not always complete and have other limitations. To improve these data, according to OGAC officials, OGAC clarified its guidance and conducted data quality assessments.

In part because of these  investments, more than half of eligible people in low- and middle-income  countries (54 percent) receive treatment, and the estimated number of  AIDS-related deaths worldwide (1.7 million) declined in 2011, according  to data reported by the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS).", "Nevertheless, important challenges remain as PEPFAR continues to help  build partner countries\u2019 capacity to manage their treatment programs.  First, the estimated number of new HIV infections worldwide each year  (2.5 million in 2011) continues to exceed the estimated increase in the  number of people on treatment (about 1.4 million from 2010 to 2011), and  about 6.8 million people eligible for treatment have not yet been treated.  In addition, in passing the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States  Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (2008 Leadership Act), Congress directed  OGAC to continue to expand the number of people receiving PEPFAR  HIV care and treatment services while also making it a major policy goal  to build partner-country capacity to deliver services and promote a  transition toward greater sustainability of country-owned HIV/AIDS  programs. In December 2011, the President announced an increase in  PEPFAR\u2019s target for the number of people receiving treatment directly  supported by PEPFAR\u2014from 4 million to 6 million by the end of fiscal  year 2013.", "OGAC sets overall PEPFAR policy and strategies.

As of February 2013, the U.S. government had signed 22  PEPFAR partnership frameworks. According to OGAC guidance, a key  expectation of the frameworks is that partner-country governments will  become better prepared to assume primary responsibility for their  responses to HIV/AIDS. Moreover, PEPFAR\u2019s 2012 \u201cblueprint\u201d defines  country ownership as the end state in which partner countries lead,  manage, and coordinate the efforts needed to ensure that the AIDS  response is effective, efficient, and durable.", "This is typically measured by CD4 (cluster of differentiation antigen 4) count in a sample  of blood.

Based on WHO guidelines, each  country is expected to establish country-specific guidelines on when to  initiate treatment for these groups. UNAIDS estimated at the end of 2011  that, on the basis of WHO\u2019s 2010 guidelines, 15 million people in low- and  middle-income countries needed treatment; of these, an estimated 8  million people are on treatment. People who are HIV positive but not yet  eligible for treatment generally may seek access to care and support  services as well as regular checkups and laboratory monitoring. People  eligible for treatment should receive antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as well as  checkups and monitoring to assess the effectiveness of treatment.People on treatment also receive various care and support services such  as treatment of opportunistic infections including tuberculosis coinfection,  nutritional support, and programs to promote adherence to treatment and  remaining on treatment (patient retention). People on treatment are  expected to take ARV drugs on a continuing, lifelong basis. . Prior to 2010, WHO\u2019s guidelines recommended treatment for all people with  CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/mm. reporting on PEPFAR results. According to the guidance, these  indicators are intended to demonstrate progress in the fight against  HIV/AIDS while also promoting responsible program management. In  addition, among other things, the guidance establishes a distinction  between national results and PEPFAR direct results. The guidance  defines national results as achievements of all contributors to a partner  country\u2019s HIV/AIDS program and defines PEPFAR direct results as  achievements of the PEPFAR program through its funded activities. (See  app. II for a summary of OGAC criteria for assessing PEPFAR direct  support.) With regard to treatment programs, the guidance instructs  PEPFAR country teams providing direct support for treatment services  to report to OGAC using the PEPFAR direct indicators.

This number is calculated by determining the number of people who ever  started treatment at facilities where PEPFAR directly supports treatment  services, minus patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or  have unknown treatment outcomes. (See app. II for a summary of  OGAC guidance on determining whether people can be counted as  receiving direct services through PEPFAR.) PEPFAR met or exceeded  annual targets for this indicator in fiscal years 2004 through 2012.  Currently, this indicator is used to track treatment program expansion and  to assess progress toward PEPFAR\u2019s target of providing direct support  for treatment for 6 million people by the end of fiscal year 2013. For  fiscal year 2012, PEPFAR\u2019s target for this indicator was 5 million people.  According to data provided by OGAC, the number of people currently on  treatment directly supported by PEPFAR has steadily increased from  about 67,000 people in 11 countries in fiscal year 2004 to more than 5.1  million in 23 countries in fiscal year 2012.

Specifically, this indicator does not  reflect the expansion of partner countries\u2019 treatment programs that  PEPFAR technical assistance and other support for building treatment  program management capacity have made possible. These efforts  include, among others, activities such as implementing revised treatment  guidelines, assisting partner-country district and national health officials  with treatment facility oversight, and training and mentoring treatment  facility staff. In several PEPFAR partner countries, for example, PEPFAR  implementing partners providing direct treatment services have begun  transferring stable patients to other treatment providers, including an  often expanding number of local public and private health clinics, many of  which receive PEPFAR-funded technical assistance and other support. In  part because of this PEPFAR assistance, these providers also have  begun increasing the number of people they enroll in treatment. In such  cases, the PEPFAR direct treatment indicator may not account for these  people. In the past, PEPFAR\u2019s direct results often were equivalent to the  national number of people receiving services, including treatment,  according to PEPFAR\u2019s 2010 Next Generation Indicators Reference  Guide. However, as PEPFAR increases its efforts to build partner-country  capacity to manage treatment programs through technical assistance and  other support, PEPFAR\u2019s direct treatment indicator alone does not  provide complete information for assessing PEPFAR\u2019s contributions to  partner countries\u2019 treatment programs.", "PEPFAR\u2019s 2010 Next Generation Indicators Reference Guide noted that  OGAC was working on a method for deriving PEPFAR direct results from  partner-country national-level indicators but had not yet devised one.  The guidance stated that the new method would take into account the  percentage of PEPFAR funding that contributes to partner-country  programs. In addition, OGAC and PEPFAR country teams have  considered other factors to determine PEPFAR\u2019s contribution to partner- country treatment programs. For example, in their fiscal year 2011 annual  reports to OGAC, seven PEPFAR country teams reported the proportion  of all treatment facilities receiving PEPFAR support or the percentage of  all patients on treatment directly supported by PEPFAR. Some country  teams noted that neither method fully accounted for PEPFAR\u2019s  contributions in these countries.

First, OGAC clarified  guidance to PEPFAR country teams regarding how to calculate and  report on this indicator. Second, PEPFAR implementing agencies  conducted data quality assessments in three PEPFAR countries.

Available data on PEPFAR program results show  some progress. In particular, PEPFAR and UNAIDS data indicate a  steady increase in the number of people on treatment, improved  treatment coverage rates, and high rates of patient retention at many  facilities. However, PEPFAR\u2019s contributions to expansion of partner  countries\u2019 treatment programs are not fully reflected in its results data  because OGAC\u2019s current method for deriving PEPFAR\u2019s direct treatment  indicator does not fully account for PEPFAR\u2019s efforts to improve partner  countries\u2019 capacity to manage their treatment programs. This limits the  usefulness of PEPFAR\u2019s direct treatment indicator for assessing progress  toward expanding partner-country treatment programs. Furthermore,  OGAC has not yet established a common set of indicators to measure the  results of PEPFAR technical assistance and other support intended to  improve the quality of treatment programs. Lacking a standard set of  quality assurance indicators, PEPFAR is limited in its ability to track the  results of PEPFAR\u2019s quality assurance efforts.", "As PEPFAR continues to shift responsibility for managing treatment  programs to partner countries, those countries will need robust M&E  systems to generate the data that are indispensable for ensuring effective  treatment and efficient program management. PEPFAR has dedicated  resources specifically for these efforts, but problems with untimely and  incomplete data collection, as well as with data use, persist. As a result,  PEPFAR has to rely on the M&E systems its implementing partners have  developed rather than on country-managed systems for collecting and  reporting results data. In its guidance, OGAC has not yet established  minimum standards that data generated by partner countries\u2019 M&E  systems should meet in order for PEPFAR country teams to assess these  systems. Without such standards, uncertainty remains as to when  partner-country M&E systems will be ready to be integrated with PEPFAR  systems, thus delaying the achievement of PEPFAR\u2019s goal of using  partner-country M&E system data for PEPFAR treatment program  management and reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the outcomes and quality of treatment programs supported by  PEPFAR, we recommend that the Secretary of State direct the U.S.  Global AIDS Coordinator to take the following three actions in  collaboration with PEPFAR implementing agencies: develop a method that better accounts for PEPFAR\u2019s contributions to establish a common set of indicators to measure the results of  treatment program quality improvement efforts; and establish a set of minimum standards for data generated by partner  countries\u2019 M&E systems, to enable PEPFAR country teams to assess  those systems\u2019 readiness for use in treatment program management  and reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to State, USAID, and CDC.   Responding jointly with CDC and USAID, State provided written  comments (see app. IV for a copy of these comments).

In response to the technical  comments, we incorporated changes to the draft report, as appropriate.  After reviewing the supplementary information, we clarified our findings  and recommendations relating to PEPFAR\u2019s direct treatment indicator  and its support for partner countries\u2019 M&E systems.", "In its written comments, State generally agreed with our three  recommendations. First, State affirmed that it supports our  recommendation to develop a method for fully accounting for PEPFAR\u2019s  contributions to partner-country treatment programs. Observing that  PEPFAR\u2019s direct treatment indicator was intended to capture only  essential components of direct treatment services, State noted that  PEPFAR has recently begun an effort to revise its monitoring, evaluation,  and reporting framework, including an expansion of indicators that would  allow for implementing partners to report on their efforts to help partner  countries build capacity and develop sustainable treatment programs.  Second, State also agreed with the finding leading to our  recommendation regarding the development of indicators to measure the  results of treatment program quality improvement efforts. State cited the  need for a harmonized PEPFAR strategy on treatment quality, including  key indicators, and noted steps it is taking to develop such a strategy. In  addition, stressing that treatment retention indicators are relatively new  and difficult to operationalize, State detailed steps PEPFAR is taking to  help improve treatment retention measurement, evaluation, and  performance. Third, State noted that PEPFAR supports the strengthening  of partner country reporting systems and works with partner countries to  help them develop such systems, both to support national programs as  well as to provide data for PEPFAR and other donors. As part of these  efforts, PEPFAR also works with WHO and the Global Fund on system  standardization and standards for data exchange. State specifically  identified an indicator developed by WHO for documenting data  completeness and timeliness and stated that this indicator can be used to  monitor efforts to develop these reporting systems. We agree that such  an indicator could be useful for PEPFAR country teams trying to  determine when partner-country M&E systems are ready to be integrated  with PEPFAR systems. However, we note that PEPFAR guidance does  not instruct country teams to use the WHO indicator or any other indicator  for this purpose.  We believe that specifying one or more indicators for  PEPFAR country teams to use is important to ensure a consistent  approach to systems integration across the program. Doing this would  emphasize for country partners the importance of harmonizing M&E  systems for mutually beneficial purposes.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

On the basis of these  reviews, as well as interviews with OGAC officials, we determined that the  PEPFAR data on number of people on treatment were sufficiently reliable  for reporting totals rounded to the nearest hundred. In addition, to  illustrate PEPFAR\u2019s contribution to the number of people on treatment in  low- and middle-income countries, we obtained data on the numbers of  people on treatment in all low- and middle-income countries from the  UNAIDS website ( 2011. UNAIDS sets international standards for these data, which it  collects from national governments and uses to report on estimated  numbers of people on treatment; therefore, we deemed them sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting. Data on the number of people  on treatment in low- and middle-income countries were not available for  2012 at the time of this report\u2019s publication. To be able to illustrate  PEPFAR\u2019s contribution to the number of people on treatment in low- and  middle-income countries in 2012, we derived a rough estimate based on  ) for calendar years 2004 through  changes in PEPFAR\u2019s and UNAIDS\u2019s reported numbers of people on  treatment from 2010 to 2011. We observed that the number of people on  treatment directly supported by PEPFAR made up about half of the  increase in the number of people on treatment in low- and middle-income  countries in these years. For fiscal years 2011 to 2012, the number of  people on treatment directly supported by PEPFAR increased by about  1.2 million; if we had assumed that this number continued to make up half  of the increase in low- and middle-income countries in these years, the  estimated increase would have been 2.4 million. Thus, our estimate of an  increase of about 1.5 million people on treatment from 2011 to 2012\u2014 leading to an estimate of 9.5 million people on treatment in low- and  middle-income countries in those years\u2014represents a conservative  projection of possible scenarios.", "In the case of partner countries\u2019 treatment coverage rates, we analyzed  data provided in UNAIDS\u2019s 2012 Global Report: UNAIDS Report on the  Global AIDS Epidemic as well as data available for 2009 through 2011 on  UNAIDS\u2019s website (www.unaids.org). UNAIDS sets international  standards for these data, which it collects from national governments and  uses to report on national treatment coverage rates. On the basis of  review of treatment coverage rates reported by PEPFAR country teams to  OGAC, as well as discussions with OGAC officials, we determined that  UNAIDS\u2019s treatment coverage data were the most complete and current  data available and were thus sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting.", "In addition to information provided by PEPFAR country teams and  reported by OGAC, we also drew on information from a selected set of  studies of treatment programs and M&E systems in PEPFAR partner  countries.
