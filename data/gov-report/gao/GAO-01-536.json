The Board comprises more than 100 nongovernment experts and provides technical advice directly to the EPA Administrator primarily on the basis of its peer reviews\u2014that is, critical evaluations by panels of independent experts. Through such peer reviews, EPA and the Board seek to enhance the quality and credibility of the agency\u2019s highly specialized products. To be effective, peer review panels must be\u2014and also be perceived to be\u2014free of any significant conflict of interest and uncompromised by bias. Peer review panels should also be properly balanced, allowing for a spectrum of views and appropriate expertise.", "You expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest on panels convened by the Board to assess health risk assessment issues. As agreed with your office, we determined whether the policies and procedures of the Board are adequate to ensure that (1) its peer review panelists are independent and the panels are properly balanced and (2) the public is sufficiently informed about the points of view represented on the panels. These policies and procedures are the responsibility of EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board Staff Office, which reports to the Administrator and provides logistical and administrative support to the Science Advisory Board under the leadership of a staff director.", "Federal requirements relevant to independence and balance include (1) the criminal financial conflict-of-interest statute (18 U.S.C. 208) and related U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) regulations that prohibit federal employees from participating in a \u201cparticular matter\u201d in which they have a financial interest and (2) the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires, among other things, balancing viewpoints represented on government committees and providing information about committee activities to the public. The financial conflict-of-interest statute is applicable to the Board\u2019s panelists because they are hired as special government employees.", "To determine how the Board addresses these requirements, we reviewed the written policies and procedures developed by the staff office and also examined their application to four peer review panels you asked us to examine\u2014three on EPA\u2019s draft revised guidelines for assessing cancer health risks and one on a health risk assessment of the chemical 1,3-Butadiene. According to the director of the staff office, these panels are generally representative of Board peer review panels both in subject matter\u2014they address a significant risk assessment methodology and a health risk assessment\u2014and in the processes used in establishing and conducting them. We reviewed the confidential financial disclosure forms of the panelists, along with other information, and discussed with staff office officials the office\u2019s policies and procedures generally as well as how they were applied to the four panels. We did not, however, make independent judgments on whether conflicts of interest existed for members of the four panels or assess whether these panels were properly balanced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Science Advisory Board, which comprises more than 100 nongovernment technical experts, was established in 1978 by the Congress to provide independent scientific and engineering advice to the EPA Administrator on the technical bases for EPA regulations. The Board\u2019s work is coordinated and administered by 19 EPA employees assigned to the Science Advisory Board Staff Office, which is under the leadership of a staff director. The Board and its staff office both report directly to the Administrator. The Board often convenes peer review panels to assess the scientific and technical rationales underlying current or proposed EPA regulations and policies. The Board convenes these panels in public meetings, and the panels\u2019 recommendations are provided to the Administrator in published reports. In fiscal year 2000, the Board conducted 54 public meetings and issued 37 reports on a wide range of scientific issues.", "Board members, who are appointed by the Administrator, have expertise in various technical disciplines and retain their primary employment in academia, industry, state government, and environmental organizations while serving on the Board. The appointments are for 2 years, generally renewable for not more than two additional terms. The Board members serve on 1 or 2 of the Board\u2019s 10 permanent committees, such as the Drinking Water Committee and the Health Effects Committee. As members of these committees, Board members may be assigned to a number of peer review panels depending upon, among other things, their availability. The Board also has some 300 consultants, including scientists, social scientists, engineers, and economists, appointed by the staff director to provide the additional expertise needed for specific peer review panels. In this report, we refer to the members and consultants who serve on the peer review panels as panelists.", "In general, a topic for Board peer review is assigned to one of the permanent committees by the Board\u2019s executive committee. The chair of the permanent committee and a staff office employee have primary responsibility for forming a review panel for the topic. The panel may include some or all members of the committee and often some consultants. Often the staff member solicits suggestions for panel members from other EPA staff and sources outside EPA, such as industry groups, environmental organizations, and other experts. The staff director makes the final decision on appointment of panelists in consultation with the staff member and the committee chair.", "The policies and procedures governing conflicts of interest, balanced viewpoints on panels, and public disclosures are included in a staff office document, \u201cGuidelines for Service on the Science Advisory Board.\u201d This six-page document covers the selection process and criteria for members and consultants, time limits on service, the panel selection process, and guidance on conflicts of interest and the public disclosure session at Board meetings. In addition, a November 1999 handbook prepared by the staff office for panelists includes information on how the staff evaluate conflicts of interest and provides copies of EPA ethics advisories that address conflicts of interest and other ethics requirements for federal employees.", "As a federal advisory committee, the Board must comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and related regulations. The act was passed, in part, out of concern that certain special interests had too much influence over federal agency decisionmakers. Among other things, this law requires that committees, such as the Board\u2019s peer review panels, \u201cbe fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed.\u201d The advice of such committees should reflect their independent judgment, without improper influences from special interests. The balance requirement thus recognizes that it may be necessary or desirable to include experts on the panel who represent a particular viewpoint in order to conduct an effective and thorough review of an issue, but that as a whole the panel is to be balanced. As required by the act, the Board has an approved charter, announces its meetings in the Federal Register, and provides opportunities for public comment on issues before the Board.", "The criminal financial conflict-of-interest statute is applicable to Board panelists because they are hired as \u201cspecial government employees\u201d in light of their intermittent service to the Board. With some important modifications, special government employees are subject to the ethics requirements applicable to federal employees, including the conflict-of- interest requirements. The financial conflict-of-interest statute prohibits federal employees from acting personally and substantially in any \u201cparticular matter\u201d that has a direct and predictable effect on their financial interests; those of their spouse or children; or those of organizations with which they have certain associations, including employers (see app. I). However, under an exemption in the regulations, special government employees who serve on a federal advisory committee (such as the Board) are allowed to participate in particular matters that have a direct and predictable effect on their employer\u2019s financial interests if the employer is affected as part of a discrete and identifiable class\u2014that is, is not singularly affected. This exemption is limited, however, and does not include the financial and other interests of the panelists in the particular matter, such as stock ownership in the employer. If a financial interest is not covered under this or other exemptions, waivers of the conflict-of-interest provisions are allowed upon a determination by the appointing official that the need for the special government employee\u2019s services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest.", "The staff office recognizes that the Board\u2019s peer review activities can be harmed not only by financial conflicts of interest but also by the appearance of bias. That is, some panelists may be unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice because of activities, interests, or relationships with other people, such as a spouse.  For example, a peer review panelist may be so closely aligned with a point of view or an organization that his or her ability to provide objective and independent advice is impaired or appears to be impaired. The staff office\u2019s written policies and procedures use varying terms when discussing circumstances in which a person\u2019s impartiality may be called into question, such as \u201capparent conflict of interest\u201d and \u201cperceived conflict of interest.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedures Do Not Adequately Ensure Independence and Balance", "paragraphs": ["The staff office\u2019s policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the Board\u2019s panelists are independent and that panels as a whole are balanced in their viewpoints and expertise. However, because of shortcomings in the policies and procedures, the Board does not have adequate assurance that this is actually the case. Specifically, the staff office\u2019s policies and procedures do not provide for   determining at the time a panel is being developed and convened what financial conflict-of-interest requirements, if any, the panel is subject to; routinely ensuring that potential panelists\u2019 financial disclosure forms contain sufficient information to evaluate potential conflicts of interest;   systematically requesting other information pertinent to assessing independence and overall balance of the panel, such as previous public positions that panelists have taken on the matter being reviewed, before the panel members are appointed; and   adequately training prospective panel members on the financial conflict- of-interest requirements and other issues that could raise questions about their impartiality.", "Further, while one of the goals of the staff office is to ensure that Board panels are properly balanced, it has no systematic way of doing so. These limitations are discussed in the following sections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Relevant Conflict-of- Interest Requirements Have Not Been Identified", "paragraphs": ["Individual Board peer review panels are subject to different requirements under the financial conflict-of-interest provisions depending upon the subject matter being reviewed. If the panel is reviewing a matter that is \u201cbroadly applicable,\u201d the panel is not subject to the statutory financial conflict-of-interest requirements. For the requirements to apply, the panel must be reviewing a \u201cparticular matter\u201d\u2014one involving a deliberation, decision, or action that is focused on the interest of specific people or an identifiable class of people. There are two types of particular matters: (1) particular matters of general applicability, such as those involving general regulations, policies, or standards that distinctly affect a particular industry or other class of people or entities and (2) particular matters involving specific parties, such as those involving contracts and grants that affect specific individuals or entities. The specific requirements for panelists vary depending on which type of particular matter the panel is to review. However, in many cases the line between a broadly applicable matter and a particular matter of general applicability is not clear. As shown in appendix I, the conflict-of-interest provisions are complex and subject to interpretation.", "In the past, the staff office concluded that almost all of the Board\u2019s reviews were broadly applicable and did not involve particular matters. The staff office believed, therefore, that the panelists serving on the review panels generally were not subject to the financial conflict-of-interest requirements. This view is reflected in the staff office\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Service on the Science Advisory Board,\u201d which states that the Board generally does not get involved in \u201cparticular party matters,\u201d and thus legal conflicts of interest are rare.", "While this view appears to be reasonable for panels that review matters of such broad applicability as risk assessment methodologies, the Board may review more particular matters and be subject to the conflict-of-interest requirements in more cases than it has considered. As a result of our review, the staff director has reexamined the conflict-of-interest provisions and now believes that more of the Board\u2019s reviews\u2014including the review of EPA\u2019s risk assessment of 1,3-Butadiene\u2014are likely subject to the conflict-of-interest requirements than previously thought.", "Because the staff office did not believe the 1,3-Butadiene risk assessment review was a particular matter at the time it developed and convened the panel, it did not identify potential conflicts of interest that should have been examined. For example, the staff office did not identify the manufacturers and distributors of this chemical or carefully review the information provided by the panelists to ensure that potential conflicts of interest were identified and mitigated, as appropriate. Although two panelists owned stock in companies that manufacture 1,3-Butadiene, distribute it, or both, the staff office did not obtain information from these panelists about their investments to determine whether they would need a waiver in order to participate on the panel. (See app. II for more information on the 1,3-Butadiene panel.)", "In our view, the uncertainty about which legal requirements a panel may be subject to suggests it would be better to err on the side of caution to protect the Board and its members from embarrassment or potential legal problems. Further, even when the staff office determines that a panel is to review a matter that is not subject to the financial conflict-of-interest requirements, determining whether any of the panelists have interests or relationships that could raise questions about their impartiality would help the staff office assess the interests and also help ensure that the panel is balanced as a whole. To do this, the staff office would have to start identifying the industries and companies that have an interest in the matters being examined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Financial Disclosure Forms Is Problematic", "paragraphs": ["To identify potential financial conflicts of interest, the staff office relies primarily on a confidential financial disclosure form that panelists must complete before serving on a panel. Prepared by OGE for executive branch employees, the confidential disclosure form, OGE form 450, requires information on assets and income, liabilities, and outside positions during the prior year and on existing employment agreements or arrangements, such as promises of future employment and leaves of absence. The form requests information on the sources of income and the identification of assets but does not ask for the related dollar amounts. We found that the staff office\u2019s policies and procedures do not provide for (1) routinely ensuring that forms are complete or following up on information disclosed and (2) reviewing the forms promptly to make them most useful for particular panels."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Follow-up on Financial Information Is Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["For the four panels we reviewed, some panelists did not identify all income sources or provide complete information on the confidential financial disclosure form\u2014identifying a source of income, for example, only as fees from \u201cvarious clients\u201d or excluding a primary employer entirely. According to a deputy ethics officer in EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel who reviews these forms for EPA employees, respondents often make errors in completing the confidential financial disclosure form. For example, he said that he often must speak with individuals who have completed these forms because they are not completed properly. Similarly, OGE guidance on reviewing the disclosure forms directs appropriate follow-up with individuals who prepare the forms and documentation of the responses on the forms. However, the staff office has not taken steps to routinely ensure that all of the required disclosure information is provided.", "In reviewing the disclosure forms provided by members of the four panels included in our study, we found that the information\u2014while correctly provided\u2014could raise questions or issues that may be relevant in determining potential conflicts of interest or in assessing impartiality and balance among panelists. For example, some panelists reported fees from what appear to be law firms as well as from companies, including chemical companies. In some of these cases, the reported legal and consulting work was extensive. While the staff director told us, for example, that it is relevant for the staff office to know whether a panelist has provided expert legal testimony\u2014and on behalf of whom\u2014the staff office has neither taken steps to clarify information reported on disclosure forms that suggests such activity nor asked for information on the type of work performed for an affected industry. We believe the staff office would be better able to assess panelists\u2019 impartiality and ensure that panels are properly balanced if it had an understanding of the work performed by the panelists for law firms and industry, particularly for chemical companies. Staff office officials, including the staff director, told us that from time to time they have asked some panelists for additional information, but they acknowledged that this has occurred infrequently and that they have not required this information to be noted in the panelists\u2019 records.", "A case in point involves a panelist participating in a review of EPA\u2019s draft revised guidelines for assessing the health risks of carcinogens who had identified a substantial number of consulting fees from companies and law firms, including a tobacco company and a research organization funded by the tobacco industry. (See app. III for more information on the three panels on guidelines for assessing the health risks of carcinogens.) While staff office officials said they were aware of the panelist\u2019s relationships with the tobacco industry, they acknowledged that they did not obtain information about the numerous consulting fees reported. In balancing the panel, the staff office judged this individual to be in the \u201cbroad middle\u201d \u2014as opposed to reflecting either an environmental or industry perspective\u2014on the basis of both the panelist\u2019s academic credentials and the staff\u2019s observations at previous panel meetings. While the staff office\u2019s assessment of this panelist may be accurate, it would be more credible if it were based on more complete information about the panelist\u2019s extensive industry and legal consulting work. Furthermore, when this panelist first joined the Board, the staff office\u2019s evaluation had to be performed without the benefit of personal observations.", "After reviewing the disclosure forms, the staff office does not notify the panelists whether specific items they reported on their financial disclosure forms could potentially present a conflict of interest in some cases. In contrast, EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel sends what it terms a \u201ccautionary letter\u201d to employees identifying any item or items reported on the confidential financial disclosure form that could present a conflict of interest in the event the employee was called upon to participate in a \u201cparticular matter.\u201d The deputy ethics official in EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel told us that one benefit of the cautionary letter is that it reminds employees of their responsibility to consider and identify potential conflicts of interest that may arise in the course of their work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reviews Can Be Untimely", "paragraphs": ["Compounding the reliance on the financial disclosure form to identify potential conflicts of interest, the staff office does not necessarily review the financial disclosure forms in the context of forming a specific peer review panel. This situation occurs primarily with Board members, who are required to complete the disclosure forms at the start of each fiscal year. When Board members send in their forms, the specific panels the individual members will serve on throughout the year are not yet determined. In contrast, consultants assigned to a specific peer review panel generally are required to complete the disclosure forms when they are selected for that panel. While a staff office official said that the disclosure forms of Board members may be reexamined when the member is assigned to a specific panel, this step is not taken systematically, and the staff office\u2019s policies and procedures do not require that the forms be reviewed within the context of each peer review panel.", "In addition, some Board members do not return their forms at the beginning of the fiscal year as requested but instead submit them shortly before or at the first meeting of a panel. Moreover, the staff office may review some consultants\u2019 forms too late to affect the composition of a panel. For example, on the basis of the 47 financial disclosure forms we reviewed for the four panels, we found seven instances in which panelists submitted their forms either within 2 days of the first panel meeting or after the meeting; eleven cases in which the staff office reviewed the forms after the first panel meeting; and three cases in which the staff office never reviewed the forms. This last case involved panelists who had also served on another EPA advisory committee. In such cases, the staff office relies on the previous advisory committee\u2019s conflict-of-interest review rather than reviewing the individual\u2019s disclosure forms. Moreover, we found that one of the three financial disclosure forms was not reviewed by either the other EPA advisory committee or the staff office. As a result of these various review shortcomings, the staff office could allow individuals who have conflicts of interest to serve as panelists, without taking appropriate steps to mitigate the conflicts or granting a waiver."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Relevant Information Is Not Systematically Obtained Before Appointing Panelists", "paragraphs": ["Beyond the financial disclosure form, the staff office does not systematically request certain information that is pertinent to assessing both the impartiality of the panelists and the overall balance of viewpoints represented on the panels until a selected panel is conducting its first meeting.", "The primary source of background information that the staff office has used\u2014the confidential financial disclosure form\u2014is limited in focus. While the information it elicits covering the prior year is pertinent to assessing financial conflicts of interest, it does not identify other information relevant to assessing impartiality and balancing peer review panels. That is, the confidential financial disclosure form does not request information on the panelists\u2019 backgrounds in the subject matter the panel will review, such as research conducted and previous public statements or positions on the matter being reviewed, or on the interests of the panelists\u2019 employers or clients in the matter.", "This information is not systematically requested until the panelists have been selected and are participating in the first meeting of the peer review panel\u2014the public disclosure session. At that time, the panelists are asked, but not required, to disclose to the public and the other panelists additional information regarding their backgrounds, including research conducted and previous public statements or positions on the matter being reviewed, participation in legal proceedings on the matter, interests of their employers or clients in the matter, and prior or current research grants that could be affected by the matter. Panelists are also asked to provide a general description of any other financial interest in the matter, such as having investments that might be directly affected by the matter. However, the staff\u2019s guidance on public disclosure states that panelists are not obligated to reveal information contained in their confidential disclosure form that would otherwise remain confidential.", "The staff director told us that generally the staff is already aware of the information that the panelists report at the first meeting of the panel as a result of ongoing communications between the staff and the panelists, and in some cases, information from the organization that recommended the panelists to the staff office.

Nevertheless, the staff office director acknowledged that the staff office policies and procedures do not include a requirement that the staff discuss with the panelists, in advance, the specific information the panelists are asked to provide at the first meeting of the panel. Further, the handbook for panelists does not include such discussions among the duties the staff perform to support the peer review panels. While the staff director said the office\u2019s goal was to avoid any surprises when disclosures are made at the first meeting, he acknowledged that the staff do not always know what the panelists will say.", "The public disclosure session can elicit informative, detailed statements about panelists\u2019 backgrounds not previously brought out in financial disclosure forms, resumes, or information from the organizations that nominated the panelists. Examples of disclosures made at Board meetings by panelists of the type of information that is not requested on the confidential disclosure form follow:   A panelist on the 1,3-Butadiene peer review panel reported having worked on a legal case involving 1,3-Butadiene for a manufacturer of this chemical and also having a leadership role on a major industry-funded study on 1,3-Butadiene.", "Several other 1,3-Butadiene panelists identified completed or ongoing research studies on the chemical that they had conducted, some of which were sponsored by organizations that receive funding from chemical companies such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association.", "A panelist on the revised cancer risk guidelines panel reported a prior long-term affiliation with a chemical industry organization that had commented to EPA on its revised guidelines.", "In our view, while the above disclosures may not represent activities or affiliations that would necessarily preclude any of these individuals from participating on the peer review panel, they do represent information that should be evaluated by the staff office before finalizing its selection of panelists. Because the Board\u2019s policies and procedures do not require the staff office to obtain and document such background information earlier, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the staff were aware of or considered the above information before the first panel meeting. The staff files for the panels we reviewed did not contain any information about these relationships and activities. In contrast, the policies and procedures of the National Academies provide that peer review panel selections will not be finalized until officials have reviewed and evaluated written information on potential sources of bias and conflicts of interest. The Academies send potential panelists a form requesting relevant information about organizational affiliations, financial interests, research support, government service, and public statements and positions.", "According to EPA\u2019s \u201cScience Policy Council Handbook on Peer Review,\u201d the issue of conflicts of interest should be addressed with prospective panelists before finalizing the panel membership. However, the staff office\u2019s policies and procedures do not require that potential conflicts of interest be discussed directly with each panelist. As a result, peer review panelists generally are not asked directly whether there is anything in their backgrounds that could present a conflict of interest. This omission is especially significant in light of the limitations of the disclosure forms the staff office relies on to identify conflicts of interest and assess impartiality. It is also important in that panelists may choose the extent to which they participate in the voluntary disclosure process conducted at the first panel meeting. \u201cIf there are other circumstances in your background or present connections that in your opinion might reasonably be construed as unduly affecting your judgment in matters within the assigned task of the group to which you have been appointed or which might be reasonably viewed as creating an actual or potential bias or conflict of interest or the appearance of a bias or conflict of interest, please describe them briefly.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflict-of-Interest Training Is Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["The staff office\u2019s annual training program for Board panelists that covers conflicts of interest consists primarily of a 1-hour study of ethics materials that the panelists complete independently.

Neither do the training materials clearly identify the financial conflict-of-interest requirements that the panelists are subject to, depending upon the review panel.

However, most of the information is targeted to regular government employees. In a number of cases, the requirements are different for special government employees. Panelists are left to interpret complex legal information on their own and take the initiative to call the staff office with any questions. We note that the fiscal year 2001 training materials did not include a February 2000 document prepared by OGE entitled, \u201cSummary of Ethical Requirements Applicable to Special Government Employees,\u201d which could be helpful to the panelists. While the staff office would still need to summarize the key points of this legal document, it is superior to the information currently provided to the panelists because it focuses exclusively on special government employees.", "In contrast to the materials the staff office provides to its panelists, the National Academies provide their panelists with a succinct, straightforward paper on potential conflicts of interest and bias. Similarly, Board panelists would be better informed and potentially have an increased incentive to provide timely information to the staff office if they received clear, targeted information on the conflict-of-interest requirements to which they are subject. In addition, the independent study of ethics that the staff office requires of its panelists would be enhanced by periodic briefings on conflict-of-interest issues. While the policies and procedures of the staff office state that it is to deliver briefings on conflict- of-interest issues to the panelists on a regular basis, we found that it had conducted such briefings for only 2 of its 10 committees between October 1998 and March 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Systematic Process Exists for Balancing Panels", "paragraphs": ["Although the staff office aims to ensure that the Board\u2019s panels are properly balanced, it has no systematic way of doing so.

When developing a panel, the staff director and a designated staff member review a list of potential panelists to select a panel with the proper balance of viewpoints and expertise. The selection process is not structured in some cases. However, in some cases, the staff office does use a structured process, ranking the candidates along a numeric scale of 1 to 10, according to whether their perspectives generally reflect the broad middle spectrum of opinion on the technical issue or are more aligned with industry interests or environmental interests.

As a result, members of the public not present at the meeting have limited opportunities to obtain information the panelists provided during the public disclosure session.", "In addition, our review of the minutes of the meetings of the four peer review panels we examined indicated that panelists may not provide information during the voluntary public discussion. For example, the meeting minutes for the 1,3-Butadiene panel include public disclosure comments for only 10 of the 15 panelists reported as being in attendance. Also, some panelists gave disclosures that were too vague for the public to get an accurate picture of the panelists\u2019 points of view related to the issue under review. For example, a panelist may report publishing articles relating to the subject of the panel but not elaborate on any viewpoints or positions taken in the articles, report conducting research on the matter but not identify the sources of funding for the research, or disclose public pronouncements without clarifying their relationship to the matter at hand. According to an EPA Office of General Counsel deputy ethics official, panelists make general or vague statements because they are often unsure of what to say. As a result of panelists\u2019 uncertainty, their comments may either leave the public wondering about the panelists\u2019 impartiality or be interpreted incorrectly as indicating bias.", "This same Office of General Counsel deputy ethics official has expressed concerns about the public disclosure process. The official believes that the disclosures may confuse the public more than enlighten it and has discussed these concerns with staff office officials.
