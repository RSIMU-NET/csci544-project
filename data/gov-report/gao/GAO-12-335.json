According to GAO survey results, 28 percent of projects did not achieve all objectives originally identified in the project proposal (e.g., implementing the desired number of pollution reduction practices), while many that did so still faced considerable challenges. About half such challenges were beyond staff control (e.g., bad weather or staff turnover), but the other half were challenges that generally could have been identified and mitigated before projects were proposed and selected for funding, such as gaining access to desired properties. In one state, for example, $285,000 in section 319 funds was to subsidize the cost to homeowners of repairing damaged septic systems. Once the grant was awarded, however, one homeowner signed up to participate.", "The Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) oversight and measures of effectiveness of states\u0092 programs have not consistently ensured the selection of projects likely to yield measurable water quality outcomes. EPA\u0092s 10 regional offices varied widely in their review of states\u0092 work plans, which describe projects states plan to undertake in the upcoming year, and project selection criteria, which identify eligibility parameters for receiving section 319 funds. For example, three regional offices reported reviewing annual work plans in depth and actively influencing the types of projects selected, while three others reported limited to no involvement in such reviews, instead deferring to states\u0092 judgment on project feasibility and selection. EPA, however, has not provided its 10 regions with guidance on how to oversee the state programs. Also, EPA\u0092s primary measures of program effectiveness may not fully demonstrate program achievements. Section 319 requires states to report to EPA on two measures, including reductions in key pollutants. It does not limit EPA to these two measures, but the agency has chosen to use them as barometers of success for the section 319 program. States can demonstrate their achievements in additional ways\u0097ways that may provide a more accurate picture of the overall health of targeted water bodies, such as the number and kind of living organisms in the water.", "USDA\u0092s Environmental Quality Incentives Program is the key agricultural conservation program that can complement EPA efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution, and its conservation practices have significantly reduced pollutants coming from agricultural land across the country. Notwithstanding its achievements, certain conservation practices can adversely affect water quality if not properly implemented\u0097for example, by transporting polluted runoff from nutrient-laden fields into nearby water bodies. The agency\u0092s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has procedures in place intended to ensure that its practices do not inadvertently harm water quality. During its field work, GAO identified a few instances where these procedures may not have been followed (including in watersheds where EPA\u0092s section 319 funds had been used), and therefore sought NRCS data to determine if they were isolated instances or indicative of a more prevalent issue. NRCS\u0092 national level data, however, are not sufficiently detailed to identify whether appropriate measures are always in place to mitigate potential water quality impacts. According to NRCS, such data are instead located in its field offices and are not analyzed by the agency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that EPA provide section 319 oversight guidance to its regional offices and that USDA analyze data to determine if measures were taken to mitigate water quality impacts in section 319 project areas.

The Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) reports that more than 33,000 water bodies  nationwide are impaired primarily by such pollution; that is, they do not  meet water quality standards to provide for, among other things,  propagation and protection of aquatic wildlife and human use and  recreation. Runoff from nonpoint sources, including many farms,  managed forests, and urban areas, often carries harmful pollutants such  as fertilizers, pesticides, and sediment from fields and logging roads;  metals and toxins from abandoned mines; and oils from roads and  highways. Nonpoint source pollution may also alter natural water flow  patterns, water temperatures, and ecosystems in rivers, streams, lakes,  estuaries, and oceans, to the detriment of aquatic life.", "Recognizing such issues, Congress in 1987 amended the Clean Water  Act, adding section 319 to explicitly address nonpoint source pollution  through a cooperative, grant-based program with states, which fund  projects to reduce nonpoint source pollution and restore impaired water  bodies.

Moreover, land use  activities can also produce toxic pollution. For example, pesticide use in  farming has resulted in toxic runoff, and mining has produced leaching of  heavy metals and acid mine drainage.", "Nonpoint source pollution can have long-lasting impacts. For instance, a  heavy rain can wash tons of soil from a field, and the material can either  scour a streambed or settle out and cover gravel that fish spawn in. Long  after the water itself clears, populations of fish and other aquatic life may  still not have recovered. Similarly, when trees and bushes are cut next to  stream banks, debris falling into the stream or washing into the water may  initially degrade the water, but a longer-term problem may be caused by  persistent elevated water temperatures resulting from the removal of  shade.

During these initial stages, some states and  EPA regions focused their nonpoint source programs narrowly on  demonstrations of particular pollution control technologies. In response to  EPA program guidelines issued in 1996, states upgraded their programs,  and in so doing, several states incorporated watershed-based  approaches as a significant and sometimes central organizing theme.  These states focused their pollution reduction efforts in specific  watersheds\u2014areas of land through which all the rainfall and streams flow  downhill toward a main river channel (see fig. 1).

The project manager reported that after section 319 funds  were received, project staff advertised the project to community  members and reached out to landowners near the lake. Some  landowners, however, were unwilling to have the nonprofit  organization plant willows on their properties, according to the project  manager\u2019s report. Some willow trees were ultimately planted in one of  the two areas, but the report concluded that the project\u2019s water quality  goals were not achieved and that no measurable reduction in  pollutants came from the planting.", "Securing voluntary third-party cooperation ahead of time is particularly  important with agricultural projects, whose success largely depends on  the implementation of a suite of complementary conservation practices.  Agricultural projects by their nature can be particularly challenging for  securing third-party participation to implement them in ways that  effectively reduce nonpoint source pollution. According to EPA officials  and USDA research, agricultural projects address nonpoint source  pollution best when conservation practices are implemented as part of a  suite of complementary practices. When landowners choose to implement  conservation practices without all of the proper companion practices,  however, assurance may be reduced that the practices will result in the  intended water quality benefits, according to state environmental  protection officials we spoke with.", "The need for complementary conservation practices to protect water  quality is often evident on lands where livestock graze. On such land, for  example, installing livestock exclusion fencing in isolation does not  always ensure that the negative water quality effects of grazing will be  significantly reduced unless additional practices are put in place.Livestock exclusion fencing is largely ineffective without riparian buffers,  which help prevent stream bank erosion and absorb nutrients from  manure, according to the nonpoint source coordinator for West Virginia\u2019s  Department of Environmental Protection. When riparian buffers are  absent, livestock still congregate near stream banks, altering stream  ecosystems and allowing sediment and manure to enter the water.", "Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection funded a project  that demonstrated the success of enlisting landowner cooperation to  install a suite of complementary practices to protect water quality on land  where livestock graze. For example, the department awarded $1.2 million  in section 319 funds to a project in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, in which  a conservation district installed suites of conservation practices on  several farms to keep livestock from congregating near an impaired  stream and entering it. Such practices included livestock exclusion  fencing, riparian buffers, stream crossings, and off-stream watering  facilities for livestock. In this case, conservation district staff said they  proposed this project because the landowners were willing to install all of  the complementary practices needed to keep livestock away from the  stream. Further, this project is likely to help restore the stream to such a  condition that it will soon be removed from the state\u2019s list of impaired  waters, according to the project manager.", "State nonpoint source management program officials in one state we  visited said that because section 319 is a voluntary program, they  hesitate to require participating landowners who are willing to install a  given conservation practice to also install all the complementary practices  that may be needed to ensure that water quality is protected. For  example, in Arkansas, the state\u2019s nonpoint source management program  encourages certain agricultural conservation practices to be installed  together as a suite to maximize water quality benefits, but it does not  require section 319 fund recipients to implement all these practices on  agricultural land. One state official acknowledged that this process does  not always result in implementing the conservation practices that would  produce the greatest water quality benefit and that landowners may resist  implementing the most effective conservation practices. Consequently,  less effective practices are sometimes chosen for projects to ensure  sufficient landowner participation, he said.", "Our analysis of EPA data indicated that section 319 funds may have  sometimes paid for conservation practices to be put in place without all of  the proper companion practices. Our analysis of EPA\u2019s Grants Reporting  and Tracking System data showed that when section 319 funding was  used to install livestock fencing, more than half the time, the fencing may  have been installed without all of the proper companion practices\u2014those  practices that state environmental protection officials and USDA research  show are needed to reduce nonpoint source pollution from livestock  grazing. Specifically, in projects from 2004 through 2010 where about 700  separate livestock exclusion fences were installed, the following  additional practices were installed with the fencing: about 50 stream  crossings (7 percent), 260 riparian buffers (37 percent), and 225 watering  facilities or troughs (32 percent). (The data do not reflect instances  where additional practices may have already been in place before the  fencing was installed.)", "In November 2011, EPA issued a national evaluation of the 319 program. According to  this report, projects that use indirect approaches provide funds to enable the states to  work with federal, state, local, private-sector, and watershed groups to gain cooperation  and to leverage dollars, authorities, and other resources to solve or prevent nonpoint  source pollution problems. These funds also provide critical support for state staff to  conduct project planning and selection, monitoring, and building of partnerships, which are  critical to ensure successful implementation of watershed-based plans. Environmental  Protection Agency, A National Evaluation of the Clean Water Act Section 319 Program  (Washington, D.C.: November 2011). lessons learned from funding such projects to help inform their decisions  on whether to fund similar projects in the future.", "One section 319-funded project in Arkansas had the stated purpose of  training teachers and conservation district employees to teach a  conservation education curriculum, so that they in turn could  encourage students to participate in a conservation program, thereby  developing students\u2019 appreciation and awareness of natural  resources. Although designed to teach students about nonpoint  source pollution, the project did not have a clear link to tangible  reductions in nonpoint source pollution or changes in behavior  stemming from the use of section 319 funds. According to the state\u2019s  nonpoint source program director, his staff found that while the  curriculum materials this project funded were well received by many  teachers, staff were unable to ascertain the effectiveness of the  project and whether it resulted in any behavioral change.", "A project in California aimed to implement conservation practices in a  creek that was impaired in part by sewage disposal from septic  systems. To do so, the project sought to increase community  education through several outreach initiatives, among other activities.  Project staff held workshops and community events, which about 200  people attended, and conducted follow-up surveys, which showed that  80 to 90 percent of residents had increased their understanding of  environmental conditions and watershed pollution. Nevertheless, in  the project\u2019s final report, project staff concluded that changing the  habits of residents to actually implement conservation practices\u2014 such as pumping septic systems, planting streamside vegetation, and  limiting fertilizer use\u2014was much more complicated than originally  anticipated. Despite increased levels of awareness, the report  concluded, few conservation practices were implemented.", "In West Virginia, the state nonpoint source program director told us  that the state\u2019s department of environmental protection used section  319 to fund a project to promote best management practices on oil  and gas drilling sites and access roads. The project was designed to  establish a training program for company inspectors that would help  them identify drilling sites and access roads contributing to sediment  runoff into impaired waters. The training would help company  inspectors promote the design and implementation of management  practices in these areas to reduce runoff and encourage compliance  with such practices. This project promoted positive practices, but  according to a departmental official, few management practices were  ultimately implemented. In addition, he said, the project was not  directly linked to specific water quality outcomes, such as the number  of sites and roads on which practices were to be implemented, and he  will likely not use section 319 funds to fund similar projects in the  future.", "Projects using section 319 funds to pay for staff to promote enrollment in  USDA conservation programs have also sometimes lacked approaches  and intended outcomes that were directly aligned with addressing  nonpoint source pollution. Project managers with whom we spoke said  that when such projects do not contain concrete deliverables, such as the  number and specific location of acres enrolled in conservation programs,  there is limited assurance that the most vulnerable land will be protected.  For example, Kansas awarded $225,000 in section 319 funds to a project  whose objectives were to provide dedicated assistance to USDA\u2019s  Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and eliminate delays in providing   Funding  program enrollment assistance to agricultural crop producers.was used to hire from 24 to 30 part-time staff to help interested  landowners enroll in the CRP program, complete paperwork, and enroll  acres in the program in shorter-than-typical time frames. According to the  state project manager, the project did not include a specific focus on  promoting CRP in areas of concern to nonpoint source water pollution.  She also told us that the state Department of Health and Environmental  Services has since concluded that projects such as these are not always  the most cost-effective because the number of vulnerable acres enrolled  has not been proportional to the resources invested. As a result, the  number of funded staff decreased to 8 the next time the project was  proposed, and the state project manager said that such projects may not  be funded in the future.", "Similarly, West Virginia\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection used  section 319 funds for several projects aimed, in part, at enrolling  landowners in USDA\u2019s CRP and Conservation Reserve Enhancement  Program (CREP). According to the state\u2019s nonpoint source program  director, the department has not had much success in reducing nonpoint  source pollution when section 319 funds are used to enroll land in CRP  and CREP because pieces of land contributing the largest amounts of  agricultural runoff are not always enrolled. West Virginia\u2019s nonpoint  source program director told us that as a result, he will be reluctant to use  section 319 funds on projects aiming to enroll landowners in these  programs.", "In November 2011, EPA issued a national evaluation of the 319 program  and found that states\u2019 success in controlling agricultural nonpoint source  pollution when funding these types of indirect projects has been mixed.   The report noted that on one hand these projects can help develop and  strengthen key partnerships among federal programs and are critical for  making significant progress in remediating large numbers of water bodies  impaired by nonpoint source pollution.

Many states therefore identified improved coordination  and collaboration with USDA programs as a key nonpoint source program  goal, according to EPA\u2019s report.", "Our review of some states\u2019 experiences and EPA\u2019s 2011 evaluation report  has shown that the challenges associated with third-party participation  and projects whose approaches are not clearly linked to tangible water  quality results can largely be avoided when states use more rigorous  project selection processes. For example, in 2006, Ohio\u2019s nonpoint  source management program staff examined the types of organizations  that commonly received its section 319 funding and found that more than  70 percent of funding had gone to soil and water conservation districts,  county health departments, and regional planning agencies, which  typically have little authority to address water quality problems, according  to Ohio\u2019s nonpoint source program director. Ohio\u2019s program staff found  that these organizations often used section 319 funding to pay for staff  salaries without getting a proportionate improvement in water quality from  the projects they implemented. Further, when funds were used for  implementing projects, these organizations\u2019 projects were not  implemented as anticipated in the grant application\u2014typically resulting in  substantially less water quality improvement than originally intended.", "For example, in 2004 Ohio\u2019s EPA allocated $500,000 under section 319  to one agricultural project to install 15 different complementary  conservation practices in an impaired watershed. The organization that  received the grant, however, was unable to convince farmers in the  impaired watershed to adopt the conservation practices, and after  numerous grant revisions and extensions, it implemented 3 of the 15  planned conservation practices, according to Ohio\u2019s nonpoint source  management program director. Instead, he told us, the majority of funding  was used to purchase 111 pieces of equipment for tilling fields and  handling and transporting manure, which can help reduce the amount of  nutrient runoff entering nearby water bodies. What had started as a  comprehensive approach to changing farmers\u2019 behavior and farming  practices evolved into an agricultural equipment acquisition project  because agricultural equipment was what the landowners wanted, he  explained. In addition, Ohio\u2019s program review showed that section 319  funds were being used to support payroll for 27 full-time-equivalent staff  positions in local organizations for some projects whose indirect  approaches did not contain objectives or deliverables that addressed  nonpoint source pollution problems, according to the nonpoint source  management program director. Further, the nonpoint source management  program director told us that the water quality results were not  proportionate with the investment.", "Following the 2006 review, Ohio\u2019s nonpoint source management program  changed its project selection criteria to favor grantees with authority to  implement projects on the ground or projects for which any necessary  landowner buy-in was secured in advance. Ohio EPA\u2019s application  process now requires that specific properties for proposed projects be  identified before grants are awarded and that assurances from property  owners are obtained in advance, so that conservation practices can be  implemented as planned. These programmatic changes have also  prompted Ohio\u2019s nonpoint source program to fund fewer projects that rely  on indirect approaches. Consequently, since 2007, Ohio\u2019s nonpoint  source program has funded fewer than 5 full-time-equivalent positions in  local organizations. Ohio EPA\u2019s nonpoint source program director told us  that these changes have helped the agency make significant progress in  achieving the state\u2019s water quality goal.", "Other states have changed their project selection processes along the  same lines. In its November 2011 report, EPA found that as part of 15  states\u2019 project selection processes, nonpoint source program staff  coordinate with project staff at the local level before selecting proposed   The report goes on to say that this  projects for section 319 funding. preproposal coordination helps increase local understanding of state  nonpoint source program priorities, identifies potential project partners,  gauges local receptivity to projects, and provides greater assurance of  potential project success.

For example, Colorado\u2019s nonpoint  source management program increased the rigor of its project selection  process by working with local officials to identify the highest-priority water  quality issues so that the state can better support the projects that will be  most effective in addressing them.", "The report notes that 20 states\u2019 project selection processes explicitly take into  consideration a project\u2019s feasibility for successful implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Oversight and Measures of Effectiveness of States\u2019 Programs Have Not Consistently Ensured Projects Likely to Yield Measurable Water Quality Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["EPA regional offices have varied widely in the extent of their oversight  and the amount of influence they have exerted over state nonpoint source  management programs.

Second, they review  states\u2019 annual work plans and project selection criteria, which are to  describe the activities that states\u2019 nonpoint source management programs  plan to undertake in the upcoming year to meet program goals and the  parameters for which projects are eligible to receive section 319 funds  from the state.", "Regional offices have varied in the extent of their review of states\u2019  nonpoint source management program plans, which are to ensure that  states align the goals of their programs with the highest-priority water  quality impairments. Some regional offices have encouraged states to  modify their plans, whereas other regional offices have not. For example,  regional office officials reported to us that Region 5 has encouraged all of  its states to revise their management plans within the past 5 years,  whereas Region 1 has not encouraged any of its states to update their  plans since 1999. Section 319 guidance to states indicates that they  should update their nonpoint source management plans if EPA finds that  the practices and measures proposed in such plans are not adequate to  reduce the level of nonpoint source pollution.

One primary reason for the variations in  oversight among the regional offices could be that EPA headquarters has  not issued specific implementing guidance to the 10 regional offices on  how they are to fulfill their regulatory oversight responsibilities for the 319  program.", "Regional offices have also varied in the extent of their review of each  state\u2019s annual work plans and project selection criteria. Officials from  three regional offices told us that they reviewed annual work plans in  depth and played an active role in influencing the types of projects  selected. For example, Region 4 officials reported that they helped  ensure that several states within the region targeted their section 319  funds to severely impaired watersheds and, before granting funding,  selected project applicants who were willing to implement and capable of  implementing projects. Carolina established a priority-setting system in collaboration with the  regional office, which helped state staff review and rank project  proposals. Final project selections were generally made after proposals  were ranked and reviewed by various stakeholders, including Region 4  officials. An official with another regional office told us that this kind of  process provides regional offices with the opportunity to guide states to  spend funds on certain geographic regions or to encourage  implementation of projects in watersheds that have a watershed  implementation plan and willing landowners.", "Region 4 states include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North  Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. modifications to the state programs\u2019 annual goals. Nevertheless, most of  the 10 regions reported that although they provide feedback to states on  specific project proposals before states select projects, they do not  systematically assess the merits and feasibility of specific projects. As  noted above, EPA headquarters has not issued specific guidance to the  10 regional offices, including on how to review states\u2019 plans for project  feasibility and criteria to ensure that funded projects have characteristics  that reflect the greatest likelihood of effective implementation and tangible  water quality results.", "Notwithstanding the variation in regional offices\u2019 reviews of nonpoint  source management program plans and annual work plans, regional  offices have almost always determined that states have made satisfactory  progress in achieving their program goals, which states must do to  receive section 319 funding the following year. Regional office officials  told us that it is more common for regional office staff to work with states  that are at risk for not achieving satisfactory progress than to withhold  funds. For example, according to Region 8 officials, the regional office  almost withheld its determination of satisfactory progress from Wyoming  for not having developed satisfactory watershed-based plans, but it  granted the determination instead and then worked with Wyoming state  program staff to direct future funds toward developing TMDLs with  implementation plans that would include all the elements of satisfactory  watershed-based plans. Officials from regional offices reported to us that  determinations of satisfactory progress were made according to a variety  of factors specific to each state\u2019s program, such as the number of projects  completed and reductions in pollutant loads, which states commonly  reported in nonpoint source management program reports. Officials with one regional office told us that the determination of satisfactory progress  is a fairly low bar and that they were generally reluctant to withhold this  determination because states would then not receive funds to address a  significant water quality problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Primary Measures of Effectiveness May Not Fully Demonstrate Program Goal Achievements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to requiring states to report on their progress in meeting  milestones for their nonpoint source management programs, section 319  requires states to annually report to EPA on two measures of  effectiveness resulting from implementation of their management  programs: (1) reductions in loadings of specific nonpoint source pollutants  and (2) improvement in water quality of water bodies identified on states\u2019  lists of impaired waters as requiring nonpoint source controls to meet  water quality standards. Section 319 does not limit EPA to these two  measures of effectiveness, but the agency has chosen to use these two  reporting requirements as barometers of success for the section 319  program. Specifically, EPA provides nationwide data on these two  measures to Congress to report on the progress that the section 319  program makes each year toward achieving the program\u2019s goals of (1)  eliminating remaining water quality problems and (2) preventing new  threats from creating future impairments. Reporting on the two measures  of effectiveness is statutorily required, but as described in the 2003  Federal Register guidelines and other EPA documents, states can  demonstrate the achievements of nonpoint source management  programs in additional ways\u2014ways that in many respects may provide a  more accurate picture of environmental outcomes and reflect the  achievements of some critical state activities for reducing nonpoint source  pollution, such as the number, kind, and condition of living organisms in  the water.", "For the first national performance measure of effectiveness\u2014reductions  in loadings of specific nonpoint source pollutants\u2014EPA requires states to  provide information on the amounts by which nitrogen, phosphorus, and  sediment have been reduced in water bodies where section 319 projects   According to several  targeting such pollutants have been implemented.state environmental protection officials, EPA\u2019s focus on these reductions  as one of two primary reporting requirements has inherent limitations. For  instance, it has encouraged some states to design their nonpoint source  management programs and select projects to maximize reductions in  specific pollutants, but the projects and activities associated with reducing  these pollutants do not always address the root cause of a nonpoint  source pollution problem that prevents living organisms from inhabiting  the water. One example of this limitation is the manner in which states  have used section 319 funds to mitigate the effects of channeling streams  in areas of agricultural production. Stream channeling occurs when  farmers straighten creeks and streams to maximize the amount of land  that can be farmed and make it easier to move machinery across fields  (see fig. 5). Channeling streams, however, removes vegetation along  stream banks, alters streambed configuration and water flows, and  disrupts stream food webs and other life-supporting systems, according to  EPA documents, and such effects may extend far downstream.", "Projects to mitigate the adverse effects of channeled streams may yield  large pollutant reductions, but because they do not address the  straightening of the streams, the goal of healthier water bodies\u2014as  measured by biological indicators, such as the number, kind, and  condition of living organisms in the water\u2014is not always achieved. For  example, to absorb runoff and help reduce loads of nitrogen, phosphorus,  and sediment, section 319 funds have often been used for projects that  install 20- to 120-foot-wide grass filter strips as a buffer between cropland  and adjacent water bodies. These filter strips, however, do not solve the  water quality problems caused by the loss of streamside vegetation and  altered streambed configuration, according to an engineer with Ohio\u2019s  nonpoint source management program. From 2001 to 2005, one  midwestern state used section 319 funds to install more than 40,000 feet  of grass filter strips, which were estimated to have reduced nitrogen by  more than 500,000 pounds and phosphorus by 168,000 pounds annually.  Yet none of the watersheds where the grass filter strips were installed  demonstrated any measurable improvement in stream health (since they  were installed 7 to 11 years ago), as indicated by the number, kind, and  condition of living organisms in the water, according to the engineer who  monitored the stream.", "Some state officials mentioned their concerns when this performance  measure drives project selection. For example, an official with Iowa\u2019s  Department of Natural Resources told us that focusing on this reporting  requirement has compelled his state\u2019s nonpoint source management  program to select projects that are likely to substantially reduce nitrogen,  phosphorus, and sediment, even though such reductions may not  address actual causes of stream impairment or improve the condition of  water bodies for aquatic life. In addition, an official with Michigan\u2019s  Department of Environmental Quality told us that he generally has the  flexibility to choose projects that are the most cost-efficient and effective  at addressing nonpoint source pollution. To satisfy EPA, however, he told  us he feels compelled to use section 319 funds for several projects each  year that may not be the most important in addressing nonpoint source  pollution problems but that are likely to yield large reductions in pollutants.", "In contrast, we also found limited instances in which states funded  projects (such as stream restoration) that, rather than concentrating on  reductions of specific pollutants, sought instead to address the underlying  causes of impairment. One project in Ohio in 2011 involved the  headwaters of the Big Darby River, which had been channeled more than  a century ago to help agricultural producers increase crop yields. The  channeling, however, removed streamside trees and shrubs and altered  the stream\u2019s flow, thereby increasing water temperatures and reducing  the stream\u2019s ability to support life. Furthermore, the officials said that  numerous local agricultural activities contributed nitrogen, phosphorus,  and sediment to the stream. Project staff did not focus solely on the  pollutants used by EPA as key measures; instead, their holistic design  focused on restoring the natural configuration and flow of about one mile  of the stream\u2019s headwaters. Project engineers told us that when this  restoration is completed, the stream will be able to better assimilate  pollutants, water temperature will fall, stable stream banks will reduce  erosion, and structure and habitat for living things will be restored for  approximately 75 downstream miles (see fig. 6).", "EPA research and guidelines over the past several decades acknowledge  the advantages of incorporating biological indicators (e.g., the number,  kind, and condition of living organisms) into state water quality programs  to better reflect environmental outcomes. In 2005, EPA stated that the  most direct and effective measure of the integrity of the water body is the  status of its living systems and that the use of biological information can  help states improve water quality protection. Moreover, EPA\u2019s 2003  Federal Register guidelines list demonstrable improvements in biological  or physical parameters\u2014such as increased diversity in fish or insect  populations or improved riparian areas\u2014as a key method for measuring  the progress and success of state nonpoint source programs.", "Nonetheless, despite the advantages of implementing projects that  address the varied root causes of water bodies\u2019 impairment and  associated downstream effects, EPA data show that state nonpoint  source management programs have far more often funded practices that  generally reduce pollutant loads than those more directly linked to  improving the number, kind, and condition of living organisms in water  bodies. For example, the installation of filter strips and other similar  practices have been funded more often than stream restoration projects\u2014 at least 1,000 projects compared with about 175\u2014since 2004, even  though stream restoration projects generally result in more living  organisms in the water.", "For the second national performance measure of effectiveness\u2014the  improvement in water quality of water bodies identified on state lists of  impaired waters as requiring nonpoint source controls to meet water  quality standards\u2014EPA asks states to provide information on the number  of water bodies that are removed from these lists. EPA tracks this number  to document how states\u2019 efforts are improving water quality across the  nation and to demonstrate to Congress the program\u2019s annual progress in  reducing nonpoint source pollution. Since 2000, states have removed  more than 350 water bodies from their lists of impaired waters.", "EPA\u2019s focus on this second measure may also influence state project  selection in ways that may reduce the effectiveness of their nonpoint  source management programs. According to four officials from the eight  states we visited, this focus has compelled state program staff to choose  projects for water bodies that were close to being restored and removed  from the states\u2019 303(d) lists of impaired waters, rather than solely those that  are most degraded. For example, Maryland\u2019s nonpoint source program  manager told us that the program\u2019s project selection committee targeted  projects for water bodies close to removal from the state\u2019s list of impaired  water bodies over water bodies with more serious water quality problems,  where such funding could have had a greater impact on nonpoint source  pollution. He told us that such projects are selected because EPA expects  each state to \u201cdeliver\u201d several such successes each year. According to the  official, each case has its merits. The former is more likely to result in  meeting standards for the particular water body. The latter demonstrates  incremental improvement and typically has a greater pollutant load  reduction, which benefits downstream waters like the Chesapeake Bay.", "The emphasis on this measure of effectiveness has also encouraged  some state program staff to focus on restoring impaired water bodies  even when they have determined that greater benefit could be achieved  by protecting high-quality water bodies not yet listed as impaired.  Environmental protection officials from several states we visited told us  that if EPA put a greater emphasis on protecting high-quality water  bodies, they would likely select some different projects on water bodies  that are not yet impaired but are threatened by nonpoint source pollution.  Instead of focusing solely on EPA\u2019s two performance measures, Maine\u2019s  Department of Environmental Protection requested and received  permission from EPA to fund projects that focus on preventing pollution of  lakes, streams, and coastal waters by, for example, providing training  opportunities to advance stream protection efforts. The state\u2019s nonpoint  source program\u2019s annual report for 2010 reported that such a focus is far  more cost-effective than the long-term investments needed to restore  waters once they become polluted.", "EPA\u2019s former nonpoint source pollution chief acknowledged that EPA\u2019s  emphasis on the two statutorily required national performance measures  makes it difficult to judge which states are making more progress than others  in addressing nonpoint source pollution. He said that protecting undisturbed  lakes and streams is critical for protecting aquatic life but that such projects  rarely demonstrate substantial reductions in pollutant concentrations.

This is due to the fact that EQIP-funded  practices may have distinct purposes, such as to reduce soil loss or  improve soil conditions for agriculture, which are not oriented toward  improving water quality.

These procedures include the following:", "Environmental evaluation: NRCS\u2019 National Environmental Coordinator  told us that the agency requires its field planners to perform an  environmental evaluation for every proposed conservation practice as  part of NRCS\u2019 process to comply with the National Environmental  Policy Act. The environmental evaluation helps field planners  identify existing soil and water resources on land where a  conservation practice is proposed and to analyze the effects of the  proposed practice on the same resources.

He said that significant net negative effects on water quality are rare  because landowners instead typically agree to implement other,  mitigating practices along with the proposed practice. The agency\u2019s  key method to help ensure that the potential negative effect is  mitigated is termed nutrient management planning. Nutrient  management plans describe a coordinated combination of  conservation practices that help farmers manage the amount, form,  placement, and timing of fertilizer to support crop production while  also minimizing polluted runoff. These plans are site specific and are  developed by NRCS field planners and implemented by landowners.", "Alternative mitigation measures: According to NRCS Science and  Technology officials, if landowners choose not to adopt nutrient  management plans, NRCS field staff may still work with them to  develop alternative mitigation measures\u2014that is, additional  conservation practices, often in a suite, to minimize potential adverse  effects on water quality.

The departmental official  told us that stream crossings in Washington were installed on certain  properties where livestock exclusion fencing prevented cattle from  entering the stream. The stream crossings were to be installed for  emergency purposes only, in case off-site watering facilities were  unable to function, and closed off with gates. He explained, however,  that some landowners chose not to implement additional conservation  practices, such as off-site watering facilities in places that would keep  the cattle away from the stream, and they have kept the gates  permanently open, meaning that livestock now enter certain streams more often than they did before installation of the stream crossings.A former agriculture specialist with the program echoed this concern,  stating that on land where livestock graze in eastern Washington, it is  not uncommon for NRCS conservation practices intended to protect  water quality to be implemented in such a way that actually increases  the number of livestock entering streams.", "An engineer with Ohio\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency official told  us that NRCS promoted hayland buffer strips to help reduce soil  erosion and absorb nutrient runoff as part of a NRCS water quality  focused program. The buffer strips were to be 100 to 200 feet wide,  located adjacent to a water body, and to remain in place for 3 years.  Landowners received $100 per acre each year for installing these  buffer strips. But on some properties, riparian vegetation\u2014and the  water quality protection it provides\u2014was removed so that landowners  could install hayland buffers. According to an engineer with Ohio\u2019s  Environmental Protection Agency, hayland buffers provide less overall  protection to water quality than wooded riparian vegetation, such as  that which was removed.", "To determine whether the instances we observed when meeting with  state officials were isolated examples or indicative of a more prevalent  problem, we examined EQIP data on three key parameters: (1) the  universe of conservation practices funded by NRCS field units that could  have negative water quality effects in watersheds in which Section 319  projects were funded; (2) for that universe of practices, the extent to  which nutrient management plans were in place to mitigate unintended  adverse effects on water quality; and (3) where nutrient management  plans were not in place, the extent to which alternative mitigation  practices were in place that could reliably serve that same purpose.", "Conservation practices that can affect water quality. EQIP data show that  from 2005 through 2010, of the 47,000 practices that NRCS field units  funded in watersheds where states allocated section 319 funds, nearly  8,000 were types of individual conservation practices that could facilitate  agricultural runoff or have other unintended consequences unless other  mitigating measures were implemented along with them. These 8,000  practices were funded in about 820 watersheds.", "Use of nutrient management plans.

According to NRCS officials, there are several  reasons why the data on nutrient management plans do not provide a  complete picture of water protection efforts. For example, it is possible  that some of the acres within the 820 watersheds where these practices  were funded were actually not vulnerable\u2014that is, were not close to water  bodies of concern\u2014and therefore did not require a nutrient management  plan to ensure that water quality was protected. In addition, officials told  us that nutrient management plans expire after 3 years, so nutrient  management plan contracts that expired during the time period of our  analysis that could have possibly addressed the practices with potential  adverse effects on water quality would not appear in the data.  Furthermore, landowners often adopt nutrient management practices well  beyond the length of a contract because they recognize the economical  and environmental benefits of improved nutrient use efficiency provided  by those practices, according to NRCS officials.", "Use of alternative mitigation measures. As noted above, the absence of a  nutrient management plan does not mean that an NRCS conservation  practice will adversely affect water quality, if proper alternative mitigation  measures are in place. According to NRCS officials, when a conservation  practice with a potentially negative effect is identified, and where a  nutrient management plan is not in place, conservation planners are  alerted so that they know to plan any site-specific mitigating practices to  ensure positive outcomes. However, when we examined EQIP data  provided by USDA to determine if alternative mitigation measures were  funded in the two-thirds of watersheds where nutrient management plans  had not been funded, we found the data to be too highly aggregated to  allow for a determination as to whether the conservation practices  reflected in the data were the appropriate practices that could mitigate  site-specific problem. For example, the EQIP data show that the agency  funds an average of 4 conservation practices per EQIP contract. This  summary information, however, does not shed light on the type of  practices that are being installed, whether the combination of those  practices have a water quality focus, or whether they are effective in  mitigating the potentially adverse effects on water quality of the practices  in question.", "According to NRCS officials, detailed, project-specific information, while  not available at the national level, is available in NRCS\u2019 many field offices  across the country.

EPA has  achieved some notable successes through its section 319 program and,  in recent years, has helped states target their nonpoint source pollution  reduction efforts in watersheds with the most severe water quality  problems. Now more than ever, EPA\u2019s and states\u2019 limited budgets make it  critical that the most effective projects are selected for funding. In some  cases, however, states used section 319 to fund projects that were not  effectively implemented or not clearly linked to tangible water quality  results. Our review of the experiences of some states and EPA\u2019s 2011  evaluation report has shown that such issues can potentially be avoided  when states use more rigorous project selection processes. EPA\u2019s  regional offices can constructively influence the types of projects that  states fund through the program, but they are generally not reviewing  states\u2019 plans for project feasibility or for project selection criteria that  would help ensure that funded projects have characteristics reflecting the  greatest likelihood of effective implementation and tangible water quality  results. As state programs have evolved over the last decade, some state  programs have shown that certain characteristics of proposed projects,  such as securing third-party buy-in in advance, can provide greater  assurance that these projects will achieve tangible water quality results,  although such lessons learned have not been systematically adopted by  all states.", "In addition, EPA\u2019s emphasis on two statutorily required reporting  measures as measures of effectiveness\u2014to the exclusion of other  measures\u2014may not be fully capturing information reflecting program  achievements and may, in some cases, influence state project selection  toward narrow measures of nonpoint source pollution over  comprehensive results. As a result of EPA\u2019s focus on these primary  measures, states are sometimes selecting projects targeted to meet  those measures, rather than selecting projects that could have larger  impacts on improving the health of impaired or threatened water bodies.  At present, certain EPA documents discuss the advantages of additional  performance measures that may more accurately reflect the overall health  of water bodies, such as conditions for aquatic life, but the agency does  not require states to use such measures to provide information on their  progress under the nonpoint source program. As a result, most states  report on reductions of specific pollutants, rather than on indicators of  overall health of targeted water bodies (e.g., the number, kind, and  condition of living organisms) or on protection of high-quality water bodies  that are not impaired. EPA plans to soon issue new section 319  guidelines to states that generally address program accountability, but it  is unclear whether and to what extent these new guidelines will include  measures to more accurately reflect the overall health of targeted water  bodies or demonstrate states\u2019 focus on protecting high-quality water  bodies, where appropriate.", "USDA\u2019s Environmental Quality Incentives Program has helped to  substantially reduce sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus runoff across  the country. By their nature, however, some of the conservation practices  supported by the program have the potential to inadvertently conflict with  EPA efforts to reduce nonpoint source water pollution. While NRCS  procedures strive to minimize such problems, state environmental officials  identified instances where these procedures may not always have their  intended effect. NRCS has cited highly-aggregated data to demonstrate  that a preponderance of mitigating practices\u2014an average of four  practices per project\u2014counter any possibility that such unintended effects  occur. However, the EQIP data provided by USDA lack the details  needed to assess whether these other practices mitigate the potential for  negative effects. The most meaningful data on the use and effectiveness  of mitigating practices is site-specific information that resides within  NRCS\u2019 field offices, and has been neither obtained nor analyzed by  NRCS program officials.

However, in its letter, NRCS took  issue with what it characterized as \u201cseveral inaccuracies\" that remained  after the draft report was sent to USDA for comment. Specifically, NRCS  identified two, related concerns with the draft report, stating that (1) the  message conveys that USDA soil conservation practices have unintended  negative impacts on water quality and (2) this inaccuracy appears to be  based on misinterpretation and subsequent misuse of a generalized  planning tool (Conservation Practice Physical Effects matrix), lack of  knowledge of NRCS conservation planning process, and inferences that  exceed the limitations of the data on which they are based. Regarding the  first concern, our draft report acknowledged the goals and  accomplishments of NRCS\u2019 Environmental Quality Incentives Program in  mitigating the impacts on water quality of certain agricultural practices.  We revised the language in the draft report to further discuss the  program\u2019s benefits in response to NRCS comments.

After  drawing the initial sample, we removed duplicates and excluded projects  that we learned were statewide, because such projects did not always  involve implementing conservation practices or remediation techniques.  We also excluded projects from North Dakota and South Dakota because  some incomplete projects and some that never started in these states  were listed as complete in EPA\u2019s Grants Reporting and Tracking System.  After obtaining contact information for the sampled projects, we also  excluded those projects for which knowledgeable officials were no longer  available. After making these adjustments, we estimated that the number  of projects meeting our criteria was 1,273. For those project managers  who had more than 2 projects sampled, we randomly selected 2 projects  for the survey in order to reduce respondent burden.

In addition, we examined  section 319\u2019s statutorily required reporting requirements, which EPA uses  as national measures of program effectiveness. We evaluated the water  quality benefits derived from projects that address these measures,  compared with the water quality benefits of projects that address other  EPA-approved measures of state program effectiveness, primarily by  reviewing EPA documents and interviewing state nonpoint source  program officials. We also obtained annual reports from 42 states\u2019  nonpoint source management programs and reviewed 25 of them to  determine how they reported the achievements of section 319-funded  projects during the most recent fiscal year for which the report was  available.", "To examine the extent to which key agricultural conservation programs  complement EPA\u2019s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution, we  analyzed data on USDA\u2019s conservation practices funded under the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program that have been implemented in  watersheds where states have allocated section 319 funds. We obtained  these data from the Program Contracts System, known as ProTracts,  which is used to manage Natural Resources Conservation Service  conservation program applications, cost-share contracts, and program  funds. We also examined USDA reports on the effectiveness of  conservation practices, including those produced by the Conservation  Effects Assessment Project. To assess the reliability of this database, we  performed electronic data testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious  errors. In addition, we interviewed knowledgeable agency officials and  compared summary information from the database with published reports.  On the basis of this assessment, we determined that ProTracts data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed USDA officials  in the Natural Resources Conservation Service\u2019s Office of Science and  Technology.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2010 through May  2012, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  EPA stated that our report should better align with the generally  positive finding that over 70 percent of watershed projects  accomplished all of their originally identified objectives. As EPA  suggested, we made several changes to our report to put the 70  percent figure in context. In response to the EPA comment are two  additional considerations. First, the fact that 72 percent of projects  eventually achieved their goals does not suggest that they all did so in  either a timely fashion or without significant complications. For  example, as we state in our report, almost half of the projects that  achieved their goals did so after encountering significant challenges  that prevented them from finishing on schedule, staying on budget, or  achieving the desired levels of pollution reduction. Second, we did not  intend to arbitrarily identify a specific pass/fail threshold for the  success of surveyed projects or intend to suggest that 70 percent is  an acceptable or unacceptable share of projects that achieved  originally proposed goals. Instead, for those projects that did not  achieve their originally proposed goals and for those that did so while  encountering challenges, we described the challenges that projects  most often faced\u2014and their main causes\u2014to provide information that  may assist EPA and the states in developing or modifying project  selection criteria or, through other means,  better ensure that projects  receiving section 319 funds in the future will have a high likelihood of  achieving pollution reduction and other project goals.  2.  EPA stated that we should not broadly characterize projects that use  adaptive management (i.e., projects in which some issues cannot be  identified in advance but rather need to be addressed after a project is  under way) as facing \"preventable challenges.\" EPA noted in  particular that it is not feasible for grant applicants to obtain landowner  buy-in in advance of project selection. We acknowledge the difficulty  that EPA and the states face in trying to reduce nonpoint source water  pollution and protect threatened waters using primarily voluntary  methods and that numerous unforeseen factors can affect the  success of project implementation. Our survey results showed,  however, that the chief reason why some projects did not achieve  their originally proposed goals was because third-party buy-in was not  secured in advance. Moreover, a key component of EPA\u2019s strategy  under the section 319 program is to have states lay the groundwork in  advance, using \u201cindirect\u201d projects (e.g., education and outreach  activities) to obtain local support so that direct implementation projects  can succeed. The experiences of some states, such as Ohio, have  shown that where rigorous project selection criteria have been put in  place\u2014such as requirements to secure landowner participation in  advance\u2014the quality of projects has increased over time (as  measured by the ability of project applicants to actually implement  their projects as intended), and local partners have been more  effective in meeting such requirements.  3.  EPA stated it was concerned by our statements about EPA data  indicating that section 319 funds paid for conservation practices \"to be  put in place in isolation\" and that it did not believe the analysis  supported this conclusion. The draft report had acknowledged that  EPA's Grants Reporting and Tracking System (GRTS) data do not  provide a complete picture of multi-agency efforts to implement  conservation practices. In response to EPA\u2019s comment, we revised  the report to further acknowledge that, for the properties reflected in  our analysis of GRTS data, complementary practices may have been  installed by NRCS, landowners, or others. Notwithstanding the  incompleteness or the GRTS data, however, our field work showed  that section 319-funded projects to reduce agricultural runoff were  ineffective because the proper suites of companion practices were not  always installed. We noted that environmental protection officials from  several of the states we visited told us that they had often  encountered this problem with section 319-funded projects to reduce  agricultural runoff.   4.  EPA cites a requirement in its guidelines that a watershed-based plan  be in place before funding implementation projects for impaired  waters, as adding further assurance that in selecting projects, \"water  quality problems are analyzed at a watershed scale, critical areas are  identified, and a suite of necessary practices are identified and  implemented through the plan.\"  We acknowledge the guidelines'  requirement for a watershed-based plan and its value.  Nonetheless,  despite the good intentions behind such watershed-based plans, EPA  does not have regulatory authority to compel either the  implementation of the plans or the suites of practices described within  them, particularly on agricultural land. That choice is ultimately left to  the landowners within the plans\u2019 geographic areas. Thus, while having  a watershed-based plan could help promote positive outcomes, the  plan in and of itself is no guarantee that its requirements will be  fulfilled.   5.  EPA stated that our allusion to the persistence of nonpoint source  pollution, \"particularly given more than 20 years of funding for the  Section 319 program,\" does not account for the pervasiveness,  variety, and magnitude of nonpoint source pollution nationwide  relative to the federal funding levels and scope o the section 319  program. We acknowledge the massive scope of the nation's nonpoint  source water pollution problem and that its persistence and  pervasiveness is not something that EPA alone can be expected to  solve with Section 319 funding alone. We have adjusted the text  accordingly. At the same time, we believe that the funding levels  allocated to the section 319 program are not insignificant and that the  improvements suggested in this report can enhance the program\u2019s  contributions toward alleviating the nation's nonpoint source pollution  problem."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  NRCS commented on what it referred to as \u201cseveral inaccuracies\" that  remained after the draft report was sent to USDA for comment. As  discussed in the Agency Comments section of this report, in  examining NRCS information, we concluded that the EQIP data  provided by USDA do not contain site-specific information on the  extent to which alternative mitigation measures are employed when  nutrient management plans are not used. We continue to believe, as  we state in the report, that without examining such information, neither  we nor NRCS could determine that certain practices are not having  unintended effects on water quality.    2.  NRCS commented on our finding that from 2005 to 2010 the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program funded nearly 8,000  practices that\u2014if implemented in isolation\u2014can increase nonpoint  source pollution. Specifically, in its letter, the agency stated that  \u201cNRCS does not implement practices in isolation. In fact, NRCS  analysis of its Environmental Quality Incentives Program data show  an average of four practices funded per contract.\u201d We acknowledge  that NRCS does not fund practices in isolation and have revised the  report to clarify this statement. Nonetheless, our statement is correct  in that the nearly 8,000 practices we identified have the potential to  have a negative effect on water quality if, depending on site-specific  conditions, the proper companion practices are not installed along  with them. We note in the report that NRCS generally funds multiple  practices per contract\u2014an average of 4, according to NRCS\u2019 letter\u2014 but that this figure does not shed light on the type of practices that are  being installed and whether the additional practices properly mitigate  the potentially negative effects on water quality. It was for this reason  that we recommended that NRCS analyze available information,  which may involve obtaining site-specific information from field offices,  to determine the extent to which appropriate mitigation measures are  implemented when nutrient management plans are not in use.    3.  NRCS stated that we misinterpreted the agency\u2019s use of its  conservation practice physical effects (CPPE) assessments, noting  that, \u201cThe CPPE matrix is a generalized, national tool that provides a  first approximation of potential effects for each practice\u2026  Interpretation of the effects of individual practices using the CPPE  matrix is not appropriate for assessing overall effects of site-specific  conservation plans.\u201d We acknowledge that USDA generally  implements suites of practices as part of site-specific conservation  plans and have made changes in the report to clarify this point.  Nevertheless, as NRCS\u2019 letter states, the CPPE matrix provides an  \u201capproximation of potential effects\u201d for each practice and, as such,  can give an indication of the kind of effects that can occur if site- specific conservation plans are not implemented as intended. For  instance, NRCS\u2019 letter further states, \u201cIf a potentially negative effect is  identified, then the conservation planner is alerted to this possibility so  that they know to plan any site-specific mitigating practices to ensure  positive outcomes.\u201d In our field work, we found indications that site- specific mitigating practices were not always implemented when  practices with potentially negative effects on water quality were  installed. In an effort to determine whether the instances we observed  were anecdotal or more prevalent, we then examined EQIP data but  found these data not sufficiently detailed to determine if appropriate  site-specific mitigation practices were also implemented.     4.  NRCS commented on our finding that USDA data showed that  nutrient management plans had not been funded for use on properties  in about two-thirds of the 800 watersheds, stating that \u201cthis  information is misleading and inaccurate\u2026Although nutrient  management is a frequently used approach for enhancing water  quality, it is not the only practice used for mitigating water quality  issues.\u201d We disagree that this information is misleading and  inaccurate. In meetings in July and August 2011, NRCS officials  stated that nutrient management planning was the agency\u2019s primary  method for ensuring that those practices intending to conserve one  resource (e.g., soil) do not inadvertently harm another resource (e.g.,  water). As we stated in our draft report, nutrient management plans  are the mechanism that field planners often use to ensure water  quality is protected on a property in an impaired watershed, and such  plans might direct field planners to propose one or more of the 80  conservation practices that can improve water quality, according to  NRCS officials. Our draft report also acknowledged that where  nutrient management plans are not in place, other conservation  planning procedures exist. For example, field planners might propose  alternative mitigation measures\u2014which would likely include one or  more of the 80 conservation practices that can improve water  quality\u2014without requiring a landowner to adhere to a formal nutrient  management plan. As we state in the report, because of limitations in  the precision of EQIP data, the extent could not be ascertained to  which alternative mitigation measures were in place for the roughly  two-thirds of watersheds where nutrient management plans were not  funded and where the data also showed that practices had been  funded that could potentially degrade water quality.   5.  NRCS stated that because we did not \u201cconsider practices other than  nutrient management,\u201d we \u201cunderstate the number of water quality  improving practices that are in place on the landscape.\u201d We are not  questioning the number of water quality practices funded by NRCS;  rather, it was the limitations of USDA\u2019s data that prevented us, and  NRCS, from identifying the full extent to which those water quality  improving practices were implemented where they should be. Several  state environmental protection officials we spoke with echoed this  concern, telling us that because they do not have information on  where NRCS funds practices, they do not know whether, and where,  they need to use section 319 funds to implement mitigating practices  to protect water quality or other practices to complement NRCS  efforts. The agency\u2019s summary data showing that \u201c80 percent [of  watersheds] had water quality improving practices\u201d does not mean  that such practices were always properly implemented with other  companion practices to mitigate the effects of those practices that  have the potential to degrade water quality.   6.  NRCS disagreed with our finding that soil conservation practices may  sometimes adversely affect efforts to protect water quality. In  addressing this issue above, we acknowledged that, in general, such  practices have substantial environmental benefits, but that in certain  instances, it is possible that certain conservation practices\u2014including  some designed to minimize soil erosion\u2014can negatively affect water  quality when the proper companion practices are not also implemented.   7.  NRCS provided information showing that under EQIP, the agency  rarely implements conservation practices in isolation and instead  funds \u201can average of four practices per contract.\u201d We acknowledge,  as previously stated, that NRCS rarely funds practices in isolation and  have revised the report to clarify this statement. We also acknowledge  that NRCS generally funds multiple practices per contract\u2014an  average of four, according to NRCS\u2019 letter\u2014but this number alone  does not shed light on the type of practices that are being installed  and whether the additional practices mitigate the potentially negative  effects on water quality in the watersheds we analyzed.   8.  NRCS commented on how we used information in its conservation  practice physical effects assessments, asserting that \u201cThe CPPE matrix  is simply a very rough first approximation of effects that is most often  used as a training tool \u2026 and is not the only effects assessment tool  used during site-specific conservation planning.\u201d We acknowledge, as  we have above, that the CPPE matrix is not the only tool used during  site-specific planning and that field planners generally propose \u201csite- specific mitigating practices to ensure positive outcomes,\u201d according to  NRCS\u2019 letter. Nevertheless, in our field work we found some indications  that site-specific mitigating practices were not implemented when  practices with potentially negative effects on water quality were  installed. As noted above, it is the limitations of the EQIP data available  to NRCS in illuminating whether such instances were isolated  occurrences, or indicative of a broader issue, that led us to recommend  that NRCS analyze available information, which may involve NRCS  obtaining site-specific information from field offices, to determine the  extent to which appropriate mitigation measures are implemented  where nutrient management plans are not in use, particularly in  watersheds where states are spending section 319 funds.    9.  NRCS stated that we misinterpreted the agency\u2019s CPPE matrix in  describing underground outlet systems. This information, however,  came directly from NRCS field office technical guides and other  NRCS documents. We nonetheless added information, as NRCS  suggested in its letter, to clarify that underground outlets \u201callow water  to move more quickly and thus reduce the time that natural processes  have to reduce nutrients or other agricultural chemicals.\u201d  10. NRCS stated that our example of stream crossings in Washington state  is an exception and that \u201cmiles of exclusion fencing are contracted  every year to keep livestock out of streams, and stream crossings are  appropriately utilized to help attain those water quality benefits.\u201d We  acknowledge that the example from Washington State may well be an  exception. Nevertheless, because of limitations in the availability of  data, neither we nor NRCS could determine whether examples such as  these were exceptions or more prevalent. As we stated earlier, it was  for this reason, and to ensure that complete data are available to allow  NRCS and others to assess whether the program has unintended water  quality impacts, that we recommended that NRCS analyze information  on the extent to which mitigation measures are implemented in  situations where NRCS-funded conservation practices may negatively  affect water quality (and particularly in watersheds where states are  spending section 319 funds).  11. NRCS stated that our statement that 17 percent of conservation  practices were types of individual conservation practices that could  degrade water quality was misleading and conveyed an inaccurate  message. Specifically, NRCS stated that this finding is (1) based on  misuse of the CPPE matrix, and (2) does not report the number of  practices actually installed in isolation. To respond to NRCS\u2019 first  point, as we stated above, we acknowledge that the CPPE matrix is  not the only tool used during site-specific planning, but in our field  work we found some indications that site-specific mitigating practices  were not implemented when practices with potentially negative effects  on water quality were installed. To respond to NRCS\u2019 second point,  because of limitations in the precision of EQIP data, we could not  ascertain the extent to which alternative mitigation measures were in  place for the roughly two-thirds of watersheds where nutrient  management plans were not funded and where the data also showed  that practices had been funded that could potentially degrade water  quality. Upon our request for information on alternative mitigation  measures, NRCS officials told us that such information was  documented and stored at the field level but that such information was  not catalogued and available at the headquarters level.   12. NRCS stated that we misinterpreted and misused the CPPE matrix.", "As we stated above, NRCS\u2019 letter states that the CPPE matrix  provides an \u201capproximation of potential effects\u201d for each practice and,  as such, can give an indication of the kind of effects that can occur if  site-specific conservation plans are not implemented as intended. In  our field work, we found indications that site-specific mitigating  practices were not always implemented when practices with  potentially negative effects on water quality were installed.   13. NRCS stated that we misinterpreted USDA statistics on the use of  nutrient management plans and \u201cviolated a basic tenet of statistical  analysis by inferring a conclusion that far exceeds the limitations of the  data on which it is based.\u201d We acknowledge, as we did in our draft  report, that where nutrient management plans are not in place, other  conservation planning procedures exist. Because of limitations in the  precision of EQIP data, however, the extent could not be ascertained to  which alternative mitigation measures were in place for the roughly two- thirds of watersheds where nutrient management plans were not  funded and where the data also showed that practices had been  funded that could potentially degrade water quality. Upon our request  for information on alternative mitigation measures, NRCS officials told  us that such information was documented and stored at the field level,  but that such information was not catalogued and available at the  headquarters level. Rather than drawing \u201cinferences that exceed the  limitations of the data on which they are based,\u201d as NRCS stated, we  concluded that neither we, nor NRCS, could draw such inferences  without additional information on the extent to which alternative  measures are employed\u2014or if site-specific conditions make them  unnecessary\u2014on these EQIP contracts when nutrient management  plans are not used.  14. NRCS stated, \u201cIn summary, it is clear that this assertion is based on  misinterpretation and subsequent misuse of the CPPE matrix, a lack of  knowledge of the NRCS conservation planning process, inferences that  exceed the limitations of the data, and a disregard for university and  Federal research findings.\u201d We disagree. Our draft report  acknowledged the noteworthy goals and accomplishments of EQIP in  mitigating the impacts on water quality of certain agricultural practices.  In response to the NRCS comments, we revised the language in the  draft report to further discuss the program\u2019s benefits in finalizing the  report. However, we found instances where NRCS conservation  planning process did not mitigate certain practices\u2019 effects at the  ground level, and where water quality had been impacted as a result. In  an effort to ascertain whether the instances we observed were  anecdotal or more prevalent, we examined USDA data and other  information, including the CPPE matrix, and concluded that neither we  nor NRCS could draw such inferences without additional information on  the extent to which alternative measures are employed on  Environmental Quality Incentives Program contracts when nutrient  management plans are not used. It was for this reason\u2014and to ensure  that complete data are available to allow NRCS and others to assess  whether the program has unintended water quality impacts\u2014that we  recommended that NRCS analyze available information and obtain  necessary site-specific information from field offices as necessary.  NRCS would then be in a better position to determine the extent to  which appropriate mitigation measures are implemented when nutrient  management plans are not in use (and particularly in watersheds where  states are spending section 319 funds).   15. NRCS provided additional information on EQIP\u2019s water quality benefits,  specifically requesting that we include information from published  studies on the benefits of agricultural conservation practices. The draft  report cited EQIP\u2019s contributions toward improving water quality, but we  nonetheless added language as suggested on the program\u2019s pollutant  reductions in key watersheds and on NRCS reports describing the  agency\u2019s water quality improvement efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Steve Elstein, Assistant  Director; Nathan Anderson; Elizabeth Beardsley; Mark Braza; Ellen Chu;  Emily Eischen; Mitch Karpman; Jill Lacey; Dae Park; Kiki  Theodoropolous; Jason Trentacoste; and Josh Wiener made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
