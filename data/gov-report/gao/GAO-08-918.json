In July 2007, GAO reported that continuing internal control weaknesses over IT equipment at four case study locations at VA resulted in an increased risk of theft, loss, and misappropriation of IT equipment assets. GAO's two reports included 18 recommendations to improve internal control over IT equipment. GAO was asked to perform a follow-up audit to determine (1) whether VA has made progress in implementing GAO's prior recommendations for improving internal control over IT equipment and (2) the effectiveness of VA's current internal controls to prevent theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment. GAO reviewed policies and other pertinent documentation, statistically tested IT equipment inventory controls at four geographically disparate locations, and interviewed VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA has made significant progress in addressing prior GAO recommendations to improve controls over IT equipment. Of the 18 recommendations GAO made in its two earlier reports, VA completed action on 14 recommendations, partially implemented action on 2 recommendations, and is working to address the 2 remaining open recommendations. These recommendations focused on strengthening policies and procedures to establish a framework for accountability and control of IT equipment. If effectively implemented, VA's July 2008 policy changes would address many of the control weaknesses GAO identified. Mandated early implementation of this new policy addresses user-level accountability and requirements for strengthening physical security. In addition, to determine the extent of inventory control weaknesses over its IT equipment, VA performed a departmentwide physical inventory in 2007. However, as of May 15, 2008, VA reported that it could not locate about 62,800 IT equipment items, of which 9,800 could have stored sensitive information. Because VA does not know what, if any, sensitive information resided on the equipment, potentially affected individuals could not be notified. GAO's statistical tests of IT equipment inventory controls from February through May 2008 at four locations identified continuing control weaknesses, including missing items, lack of accountability, and errors in IT equipment inventory records. Although these control weaknesses may be addressed through early implementation of the July 2008 policies, the fact that GAO identified missing items only a few months after these locations had completed their physical inventories is an indication that underlying weaknesses in accountability over IT equipment have not yet been corrected. GAO's tests identified 50 missing items, of which 34 could have stored sensitive data, but again, notifications to individuals could not be made. Further, the lack of user-level accountability and inaccurate records on status, location, and item description of IT equipment items at the four case study locations make it difficult to determine the extent to which actual theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment may have occurred. In addition, the four locations had weaknesses in controls over hard drives in the property disposal process as well as physical security weaknesses at IT storage facilities. These control weaknesses present a risk that VA could lose control over new, used, and excess IT equipment and that any sensitive personal and medical information residing on hard drives in this equipment could be compromised."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we perform a follow-up audit to  assess the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) progress in strengthening  controls over information technology (IT) equipment. Past reports of  thefts of laptop computers and data breaches raised concerns about the  adequacy of controls over VA IT equipment. In July 2004, we reported that  the six VA medical centers we audited lacked a reliable property control  database and had problems with implementation of VA inventory policies  and procedures. In July 2007, we reported that a weak overall control  environment and pervasive weaknesses in inventory control and  accountability at four locations we audited put IT equipment at risk of  theft, loss, and misappropriation, including sensitive personal and medical  information maintained on this equipment. For example, our statistical  tests of IT equipment inventory controls at the four VA case study  locations identified a total of 123 missing IT equipment items, including 53  computers that could have stored sensitive information. Our 2004 and 2007  audits found that some medical centers did not account for IT equipment  valued under $5,000 during physical inventories. Our 2004 report made 6  recommendations and our 2007 report made 12 recommendations for VA  actions to improve accountability of IT equipment inventory and reduce  the risk of disclosure of sensitive personal and medical information.", "VA\u2019s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans  in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring they receive  medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. The  department\u2019s three major components are the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and  the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). During 2007, VA employed  over 230,000 individuals and relied on an undetermined number of  contractors, volunteers, and students in carrying out its operations. VA  provided these individuals with a wide range of IT equipment, including  desktop and laptop computers, monitors and printers, personal digital  assistants, unit-level workstations, local area networking equipment, and  medical equipment capable of storing sensitive personal and medical  information. By the start of fiscal year 2008, VA had centralized its IT  function at all locations within its Office of Information and Technology  (OIT). OIT staff share responsibility for management of IT equipment  inventory with property management personnel. Accordingly, it is crucial  for the department\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology,  who serves as the Chief Information Officer (CIO), to have the cooperation  of property managers to ensure that well-established integrated processes  exist for controlling IT inventory. Given the continuing nature of IT  equipment inventory control problems and their significance, you asked us  to perform additional follow-up work to determine (1) whether VA has  made progress in implementing our prior recommendations for improving  internal control over IT equipment and (2) the effectiveness of VA\u2019s  current internal controls to prevent theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT  equipment.", "To achieve our first objective, we conducted interviews and obtained  documentation from VA property management and OIT officials on the  actions taken to address the 12 recommendations in our July 2007 report  and the 6 property-related recommendations in our July 2004 report.

In addition, we reviewed policy revisions  related to IT equipment controls based on our prior recommendations. To  achieve our second objective and determine the effectiveness of current  internal controls for preventing theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT  equipment, we used a case study approach, selecting three geographically  disparate VA health care systems (HCS) located in Dallas, Texas; Seattle,  Washington; and Boston, Massachusetts. We also selected VA  headquarters organizations as a means of assessing the overall control  environment, or \u201ctone at the top,\u201d as we did in our 2007 audit. At each of  the four case study locations, we statistically tested IT equipment  inventory control attributes for existence (meaning IT equipment items  listed in inventory records exist and can be located), user-level  accountability, and inventory record accuracy. As in our 2007 audit, at  each of our case study locations we also evaluated (1) VA\u2019s Reports of  Survey on lost and stolen items, (2) controls over computer hard drives in  the excess property disposal process, and (3) physical security controls  for IT storage facilities.

In  the 6 months following completion of the physical inventory, VA facilities  undertook efforts to locate or determine reasons for missing items. VA  was able to locate several thousand of the missing equipment items.  However, as summarized in table 3, on May 15, 2008, OIT reported that VA  was unable to locate approximately 62,800 recorded IT equipment items,  of which over 9,800 could have stored sensitive information. Because VA  does not know what, if any, sensitive information resided on the  equipment and when the equipment was lost, notifications to potentially  affected individuals could not be made in accordance with OMB  guidance. We interviewed VA officials and obtained documentation on  the VA-wide inventory; however, we did not validate the results. According  to VA, many of the missing items were old equipment and may have been  disposed of through VA\u2019s excess property program. However, because VA  facilities had not always documented IT equipment disposal for many  years, there was no way to determine whether any of the missing items  were lost or stolen. Further, during our work, we discovered that not all IT  equipment items were included in the departmentwide inventory.  Consequently, the numbers of missing items could be higher. For example,  VA\u2019s 2007 physical inventory did not include medical equipment with data  storage or processing capabilities. In addition, IT equipment items not  accounted for in the OIT equipment inventory listing (EIL) were not  subject to the 2007 physical inventory at some VA facilities. Further,  limited completeness tests we performed as part of our data reliability  procedures at case study locations identified some IT equipment items  recorded to EILs for organizations other than OIT. Prior to the  establishment of OIT, EILs were aligned organizationally and some IT  equipment assigned to other EILs had not yet been reassigned to the OIT  EIL and, therefore, were omitted from the 2007 physical inventory. We  discussed our finding with OIT officials, and they told us that they had met  in June 2008 to develop strategies for moving all IT equipment items  assigned to other EILs to the OIT EIL.", "In compliance with VA Handbook 7125, General Procedures, VA personnel  submitted Reports of Survey for IT equipment items that were not located  during the departmentwide physical inventory and subsequent follow-up  investigation.

Accordingly, our tests excluded from  the population of IT equipment thousands of items identified as missing  during VA\u2019s 2007 IT physical inventory effort. Given the new baseline, if  adequate controls had been in place by the end of this inventory process,  we would not have expected to identify missing items, blank data fields, or  inaccurate inventory records at our test locations. As previously noted, in  July 2008 VA mandated early implementation of revised policy related to  control of IT equipment. Although the early implementation of July 2008  policy changes may address IT equipment control weaknesses, this policy  was not in effect at the time of our tests. Our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that a positive control  environment provides discipline and structure as well as the climate that  influences the quality of internal control. Further, these standards require  agencies to establish physical control to secure and safeguard vulnerable  assets, such as equipment that might be vulnerable to risk of loss or  unauthorized use, including periodically counting the assets and  comparing the results to control records. However, our tests of IT  equipment inventory controls at the four case study locations, including  three VA HCS and VA headquarters, identified continuing problems with  (1) inventory control and accountability, (2) control over computer hard  drives in the excess property disposal process, and (3) physical security of  IT equipment storage locations. For example, our statistical tests at the  four locations from February through May of 2008 identified significant  numbers of missing items, several of which could have stored sensitive  personal and medical information.

Although  the estimated overall failure rates for these tests were lower than the  failure rates for the other control attributes we tested, they were  significant for the various recordkeeping attributes we tested at the four  locations.", "Accurate IT equipment inventory records are important to management  decision making because these records are used to determine the types,  quantities, and age of equipment as well as life cycle and replacement time  frames. Inaccurate information on the status of items\u2014in service, sent for  repair, turned in for disposal\u2014masks visibility of items that are not  available for use and may need to be replaced. Serial number errors, such  as typographical errors, can impair accountability. Further, inaccurate  inventory information can cause significant waste and inefficiency during  physical inventories because it may require additional time to locate and  verify the status of the items.", "Our review of the data submissions from all four test locations we visited  identified data consistency and standardization issues with recorded  names, models, and manufacturers of IT equipment. As a result,  management at facilities we tested could not tell how many items of a  certain model they had in service. Because property system data fields for  item description are free-form and do not provide for data standardization,  accurate data entry is critical to the identification of like items. For  example, North Texas HCS inventory data showed one Solar 8000  physiological monitor listed as model \u201csoalr 8000,\u201d one listed as \u201cSolar  800,\u201d 26 listed as \u201cSolar 8000,\u201d and 70 listed as \u201cSolar8000.\u201d Although some  of these differences appear to be typographical errors, when searching for  Solar 8000 equipment in the database, there is no assurance that other  variations of the item name would appear in the search results. Further,  this situation hindered the North Texas HCS staff\u2019s identification of  medical IT equipment items that store or process patient data, requiring us  to select a second sample and make an additional site visit. At the Boston  HCS, we found that Samsung monitor model number 150N was referred to  inconsistently as a \u201cMonitor\u201d 4 times, \u201cNeoware\u201d 3 times, \u201cSamsung 15  Inch\u201d 33 times, and a \u201cSamsung Monitor\u201d 58 times. VA\u2019s policy does not  address data consistency and standardization. Our Internal Control  Management and Evaluation Tool states that an agency should    establish a variety of control activities suited to information processing  systems to ensure accuracy and completeness,   consider whether edit checks are used in controlling data entry, and    consider accuracy control in relation to data entry design features.", "Although this tool is not required to be used, it is intended to provide a  systematic, organized, and structured approach for federal agency use in  assessing internal control structure.

Specifically, we found weaknesses related to (1) timeliness of data  sanitization, (2) adequacy of inventory recordkeeping for hard drives  removed from their host computers, and (3) physical security controls.  Currently, VA OIT personnel are not cleansing all hard drives in the  property disposal process because of the guidance from VA\u2019s Office of  General Counsel to preserve electronic information relevant to a class  action lawsuit filed against VA in 2007 (the litigation hold), which  heightens the need to maintain control over the hard drives in the property  disposal process. However, two case study locations had not performed  timely sanitization and disposal of hard drives prior to the effective date of  the litigation hold. Specifically, one of our HCS test locations had stored  excess hard drives for 3 to 4 years and another HCS test location indicated  some of its excess hard drives dated back to the 1980s. Two HCS locations  did not record dates that all hard drives were received. VA headquarters  organizations did not keep records on hard drives in the disposal process  prior to February 2008. In addition, adequate control over computer hard  drives in the property disposal process requires accurate and complete  recordkeeping, such as recording the hard drive serial number along with  property identification and serial numbers of the original host computer.  The ability to identify hard drives with the host computer inventory  records also provides a means to determine the type of data that may have  been stored on the hard drives. However, two of our four test locations did  not record sufficient information to identify hard drives with host  computers, and VA did not have a standard procedure to address this  issue. Moreover, although storage locations used for excess hard drives  are subject to access controls in VA Handbook 0730/1, Security and Law  Enforcement, including motion detection intrusion alarm systems and  special key (access) controls, three of our four case study locations did  not comply with these requirements. Weaknesses in the controls over hard  drives in the property disposal process create an unnecessary risk that  sensitive personal information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974  and health information accorded additional protections under the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) could be  compromised. The following discussion summarizes our findings at the  four case study locations.", "North Texas HCS. We found that the North Texas HCS had weaknesses  in controls over hard drives in the property disposal process related to  timely sanitization, inadequate recordkeeping, and lack of access controls.  According to North Texas HCS staff, they were not sanitizing data from  any hard drives in the property disposal process at the time of our site visit  because of the litigation hold related to the class action lawsuit. The North  Texas HCS also indicated that not all hard drives received for sanitization  and disposal had been logged in their tracking system. However, for those  drives that were recorded, we found that the hard drive disposal records  contained sufficient information for identifying hard drives with their  original host computers. In addition, the disposal records contained the  dates on which the hard drives were removed from their original host  computers. The North Texas HCS also maintained a file on certifications  of drives that had been cleansed. Further, we observed that one of the two  storage locations storing hard drives had inadequate physical security  because of the absence of an access control system and intrusion  detection alarm system, as required by VA Handbook 0730/1.", "Boston HCS. Our work identified recordkeeping weaknesses in the hard  drive disposal process at the Boston HCS. Specifically, we found that the  hard drive disposal records did not contain sufficient information for  identifying hard drives with their original host computers. Further, these  records did not indicate the dates on which OIT personnel removed hard  drives from their original host computers, which would impede an  assessment of timely sanitization or disposal. The Boston HCS also had a  practice of storing used hard drives in unsecured locations, such as closets  and cabinets, and indicated that it had hard drives dating back to the  1980\u2019s. The Boston HCS Information Security Officer is in the process of  establishing a centralized storage facility for computer hard drives.", "Puget Sound HCS. We identified control weaknesses in the hard drive  disposal process at the Puget Sound HCS related to a lack of timely  sanitization and disposal and inadequate recordkeeping. Although Puget  Sound HCS officials are holding drives because of the litigation hold  related to the class action lawsuit, they told us that approximately 100 of  the hard drives we observed had been in storage for approximately 3 or 4  years, and therefore are not related to the litigation hold. In addition, the  hard drive disposal records at the Puget Sound HCS did not contain  sufficient information for identifying hard drives with their original host  computers. After our site visit, Puget Sound HCS staff provided us with  revised hard drive records that include property identification numbers  and hard drive serial numbers and identify hard drives with their original  host computers. The Puget Sound HCS stored hard drives in a location  that was in full compliance with physical security requirements in VA  Handbook 0730/1.", "VA Headquarters Organizations. Weaknesses we identified in controls  involved the lack of recordkeeping prior to February 2008 and the lack of  access controls of hard drive storage facilities. We found that the current  hard drive disposal records at VA headquarters contain sufficient  information for identifying hard drives with their original host computers.  Specifically, OIT records hard drive information in a log that requires,  among other elements, the bar code and serial numbers of the original  host computer from which OIT personnel removed the hard drive and the  serial number of the hard drive. OIT also records the dates on which hard  drives are removed from original host computers. However, according to  OIT officials and our review of the hard drive records, VA headquarters did  not maintain a central record of hard drives prior to February 2008.

This  room lacked a motion detection alarm system and the type of locking  system prescribed in VA policy. North Texas HCS staff believed this room  was not subject to the security provisions of VA Handbook 0730/1 because  it was not formally designated as a storeroom or warehouse. Our  investigator also identified an IT equipment work room at the North Texas  HCS that lacked adequate physical security measures and was considered  temporary in nature. In addition, at the Boston HCS, our investigator  found that security personnel were unaware of several temporary storage  rooms that contained IT equipment. Some of these rooms were initially  established by OIT personnel as temporary storage areas, but had been in  use for several years.
