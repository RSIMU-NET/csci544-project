In recent months, federal officials have cited the continued efforts of foreign nations and criminals to target government and private sector networks; terrorist groups have expressed a desire to use cyber attacks to target the United States; and press accounts have reported attacks on the Web sites of government agencies. The ever-increasing dependence of federal agencies on computerized systems to carry out essential, everyday operations can make them vulnerable to an array of cyber-based risks. Thus it is increasingly important for the federal government to have effective information security controls in place to safeguard its systems and the information they contain. GAO was asked to provide a statement describing (1) cyber threats to federal information systems and cyber-based critical infrastructures, (2) control deficiencies at federal agencies that make these systems and infrastructures vulnerable to cyber threats, and (3) opportunities that exist for improving federal cybersecurity. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on its previously published work in this area."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cyber-based threats to federal systems and critical infrastructure are evolving and growing. These threats can be unintentional or intentional, targeted or non-targeted, and can come from a variety of sources, including criminals, terrorists, and adversarial foreign nations, as well as hackers and disgruntled employees. These potential attackers have a variety of techniques at their disposal, which can vastly enhance the reach and impact of their actions. For example, cyber attackers do not need to be physically close to their targets, their attacks can easily cross state and national borders, and cyber attackers can more easily preserve their anonymity. Further, the growing interconnectivity between information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructure presents increasing opportunities for such attacks. In addition, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing by over 200 percent from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2008. Compounding the growing number and kinds of threats, GAO--along with agencies and their inspectors general--has identified significant weaknesses in the security controls on federal information systems, resulting in pervasive vulnerabilities. These include deficiencies in the security of financial systems and information and vulnerabilities in other critical federal information systems. GAO has identified weaknesses in all major categories of information security controls at federal agencies. For example, in fiscal year 2008, weaknesses were reported in such controls at 23 of 24 major agencies. Specifically, agencies did not consistently authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access to systems; apply encryption to protect sensitive data; and log, audit, and monitor security-relevant events, among other actions. An underlying cause of these weaknesses is agencies' failure to fully or effectively implement information security programs, which entails assessing and managing risk, developing and implementing security policies and procedures, promoting security awareness and training, monitoring the adequacy of security controls, and implementing appropriate remedial actions. Multiple opportunities exist to enhance cybersecurity. In light of weaknesses in agencies' information security controls, GAO and inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations to improve security, many of which agencies are implementing. In addition, the White House and the Office of Management and Budget, collaborating with other agencies, have launched several initiatives aimed at improving aspects of federal cybersecurity. The Department of Homeland Security, which plays a key role in coordinating cybersecurity activities, also needs to fulfill its responsibilities, such as developing capabilities for protecting cyber-reliant critical infrastructures and implementing lessons learned from a major cyber simulation exercise. Finally, a panel of experts convened by GAO made several recommendations for improving the nation's cybersecurity strategy. Realizing these opportunities for improvement can help ensure that the federal government's systems, information, and critical cyber-reliant infrastructure are effectively protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the  record for today\u2019s hearing on public and private sector efforts to  prevent and disrupt terrorist cyber attacks against computer  networks.", "Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States  continue to pose a potentially devastating impact on federal systems  and operations. In February 2009, the Director of National  Intelligence testified that foreign nations and criminals had targeted  government and private sector networks to gain a competitive  advantage and potentially disrupt or destroy them, and that terrorist  groups had expressed a desire to use cyber attacks as a means to  target the United States. As recently as July 2009, press accounts  reported that a widespread and coordinated attack over the course  of several days targeted Web sites operated by major government  agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and  Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Federal Trade  Commission, causing disruptions to the public availability of  government information.

Virtually all federal operations are supported by  automated systems and electronic data, and agencies would find it  difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their missions, deliver  services to the public, and account for their resources without these  information assets. Information security is thus especially important  for federal agencies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of their information and information systems.  Conversely, ineffective information security controls can result in  significant risk to a broad array of government operations and  assets. Examples of such risks include the following:  \u25cf  Resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost  or stolen.  \u25cf  Computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to  launch attacks on other computer systems.  \u25cf  Sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, Social Security  records, medical records, intellectual property, and proprietary  business information, could be inappropriately disclosed, browsed,  or copied for purposes of identity theft, espionage, or other types of  crime.  \u25cf  Critical operations, such as those supporting critical infrastructure,  national defense, and emergency services, could be disrupted.  \u25cf  Data could be added, modified, or deleted for purposes of fraud,  subterfuge, or disruption.  \u25cf  Agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents  that result in diminished confidence in the ability of federal  organizations to conduct operations and fulfill their responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Systems and Infrastructures Face Increasing Cyber Threats", "paragraphs": ["Cyber threats to federal information systems and cyber-based  critical infrastructures are evolving and growing.

Unintentional threats can be caused by inattentive or untrained  employees, software upgrades, maintenance procedures, and  equipment failures that inadvertently disrupt systems or corrupt  data. Intentional threats include both targeted and nontargeted  attacks. A targeted attack is when a group or individual attacks a  specific system or cyber-based critical infrastructure. A nontargeted  attack occurs when the intended target of the attack is uncertain,  such as when a virus, worm, or other malicious software is released  on the Internet with no specific target.", "Government officials are concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and  adversarial foreign nations.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has  identified multiple sources of threats to our nation\u2019s critical  information systems, including foreign nations engaged in espionage  and information warfare, domestic criminals, hackers, virus writers,  and disgruntled employees and contractors working within an  organization. Table 1 summarizes those groups and types of  individuals that are considered to be key sources of cyber threats to  our nation\u2019s information systems and cyber infrastructures.", "These groups and individuals have a variety of attack techniques at  their disposal. Furthermore, as we have previously reported, the  techniques have characteristics that can vastly enhance the reach  and impact of their actions, such as the following:  \u25cf  Attackers do not need to be physically close to their targets to  perpetrate a cyber attack.  \u25cf  Technology allows actions to easily cross multiple state and national  borders.  \u25cf  Attacks can be carried out automatically, at high speed, and by  attacking a vast number of victims at the same time.  \u25cf  Attackers can more easily remain anonymous.", "The growing connectivity between information systems, the  Internet, and other infrastructures creates opportunities for  attackers to disrupt telecommunications, electrical power, and other  critical services. As government, private sector, and personal  activities continue to move to networked operations, as digital  systems add ever more capabilities, as wireless systems become  more ubiquitous, and as the design, manufacture, and service of  information technology have moved overseas, the threat will  continue to grow. Over the past year, cyber exploitation activity has  grown more sophisticated, more targeted, and more serious. For  example, the Director of National Intelligence stated that, in August  2008, the Georgian national government\u2019s Web sites were disabled  during hostilities with Russia, which hindered the government\u2019s  ability to communicate its perspective about the conflict.

To illustrate, weaknesses were reported in  such controls at 23 of 24 major agencies for fiscal year 2008. For  example, agencies did not consistently (1) identify and authenticate  users to prevent unauthorized access; (2) enforce the principle of  least privilege to ensure that authorized access was necessary and  appropriate; (3) establish sufficient boundary protection  mechanisms; (4) apply encryption to protect sensitive data on  networks and portable devices; and (5) log, audit, and monitor  security-relevant events.

While details of  these initiatives have not been made public, the Director of National  Intelligence stated that they include defensive, offensive, research  and development, and counterintelligence efforts, as well as a  project to improve public-private partnerships.  \u25cf  The Information Systems Security Line of Business: The goal of  this initiative, led by OMB, is to improve the level of information  systems security across government agencies and reduce costs by  sharing common processes and functions for managing information  systems security. Several agencies have been designated as service  providers for computer security awareness training and FISMA  reporting.   \u25cf  Federal Desktop Core Configuration: For this initiative, OMB  directed agencies that have Windows XP and/or Windows Vista  operating systems deployed to adopt the security configurations  developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  the Department of Defense, and DHS. The goal of this initiative is to  improve information security and reduce overall information  technology operating costs.   \u25cf  Einstein: This is a computer network intrusion detection system  that analyzes network flow information from participating federal  agencies. The system is to provide a high-level perspective from  which to observe potential malicious activity in computer network  traffic of participating agencies\u2019 computer networks.  \u25cf  Trusted Internet Connections Initiative: This is an effort designed  to optimize individual agency network services into a common  solution for the federal government.
