Additionally, the Office stated that because the current structure of the  LDA requires registered lobbyists to file their LD-203 reports and does not  require lobbying firms to ensure that their registered lobbyists have  complied with LD-203 filing requirements, the Office has no authority to  hold lobbying firms responsible for a registered lobbyist who fails to  comply with LD-203 requirements.

The Office  developed the LDA database to track the status of referrals and  enforcement actions it takes to bring lobbyists and lobbying firms into  compliance with the LDA. To enforce compliance, the Office has primarily  focused on sending letters to lobbyists who have potentially violated the  LDA by not filing disclosure reports as required. The letters request  lobbyists to comply with the law by promptly filing the appropriate  disclosure reports and inform lobbyists of potential civil and criminal  penalties for not complying. In addition to sending letters, a contractor  sends e-mails and calls lobbyists to inform them of their need to comply  with LDA reporting requirements.

Resolving referrals can  take anywhere from a few days to years depending on the circumstances.  During this time, the Office monitors and reviews all outstanding referrals  and uses summary reports from the database to track the overall number  of referrals that become compliant as a result of receiving an e-mail,  phone call, or noncompliance letter. In addition, more referred lobbyists  are being contacted by e-mail and phone calls, which has decreased the  number of noncompliance letters the Office sends to lobbyists.

In our last  report, the Office told us that its system collects information on contacts  made by e-mail and phone calls in the notes section of its database, but  the database does not automatically tabulate the number of e-mails and  phone calls to lobbyists, as it does for letters sent. In March 2013 as a  part of closing discussions with the Office about the findings of our last  lobbying disclosure report, as part of its enforcement efforts we urged the  Office to develop a mechanism to track e-mails and telephone contacts to  individual lobbyists.

In our first lobbying  disclosure report in September 2008, we concluded that the lobbying  community could benefit from creating an organization to  share examples of best practices of the types of records maintained to  support filings; use this information gathered over an initial period to formulate  minimum standards for recordkeeping; provide training for the lobbying community on reporting and  disclosure requirements intended to help the community comply with  the LDA; and  report annually to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the  House on opportunities to clarify existing guidance and ways to  minimize sources of potential confusion for the lobbying community.", "The continuing difficulties that some lobbyists have demonstrated in their  disclosure reports, coupled with the sustained public and congressional  attention on lobbyists and their interactions with government officials,  underscores the importance of accurate and public disclosure of such  activities. In that regard, we continue to believe that creating the type of  organization we described in our first report could still be beneficial to the  lobbying community and the public interest. The activities of such an  organization could help enhance the enforcement and compliance with  the LDA as amended by HLOGA and improve the accuracy and value of  the information reported to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Attorney General for review and  comment.

To assess whether these  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report,  we reviewed relevant documentation and spoke to officials responsible for  maintaining the data. Although registrations and reports are filed through  a single web portal, each chamber subsequently receives copies of the  data and follows different data cleaning, processing, and editing  procedures before storing the data in either individual files (in the House)  or databases (in the Senate). Currently, there is no means of reconciling  discrepancies between the two databases caused by the differences in  data processing. For example, Senate staff told us during previous  reviews that they set aside a greater proportion of registration and report  submissions than the House for manual review before entering the  information into the database. As a result, the Senate database would be  slightly less current than the House database on any given day pending  review and clearance. House staff told us during previous reviews that  they rely heavily on automated processing. They added that while they  manually review reports that do not perfectly match information on file for  a given registrant or client, they will approve and upload such reports as  originally filed by each lobbyist, even if the reports contain errors or  discrepancies (such as a variant on how a name is spelled).  Nevertheless, we do not have reasons to believe that the content of the  Senate and House systems would vary substantially. For this review, we  determined that House disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for  identifying a sample of quarterly disclosure (LD-2) reports and for  assessing whether newly filed registrants also filed required reports. We  used the House database for sampling LD-2 reports from the third and  fourth quarters of 2012 and the first and second quarters of 2013, as well  as for sampling year-end 2012 and midyear 2013 political contributions  (LD-203) reports and finally for matching quarterly registrations with filed  reports. We did not evaluate the Offices of the Secretary of the Senate or  the Clerk of the House, both of which have key roles in the lobbying  disclosure process. However, we did consult with officials from each  office and they provided us with general background information at our  request.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 104 LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2012 and  the first and second quarters of 2013. We excluded reports with no  lobbying activity or with income less than $5,000 from our sampling  frame. We drew our sample from 65,489 activity reports filed for the third  and fourth quarters of 2012 and the first and second quarters of 2013  available in the public House database, as of our final download date for  each quarter. One LD-2 report was removed from the sample because we  could not contact the firm and it appears the firm has gone out of  business. We treated this report as a nonrespondent for the purposes of  analysis and adjusted our sampling weights accordingly for analysis.  Another LD-2 report was excluded because the lobbyist amended the LD- 2 to reflect no lobbying activity after being notified of the review. This  report was treated as out of scope.", "We adjusted for three comparisons to account for the three pairwise tests for each item  examined. may also be related to the nature of our sample, which was relatively  small and was designed only for cross-sectional analysis.", "Our sample is based on a stratified random selection and is only one of a  large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval. This interval would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples that we could have drawn. The percentage  estimates for 2013 have a 95 percent confidence interval of within plus- or-minus 10.1 percentage points or less of the estimate itself, unless  otherwise noted. For 2010 through 2012, the percentage estimates have  a 95 percent confidence interval with a maximum of 11 percentage points. the amount of income reported for lobbying activities,  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities,  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report,  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and  the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity.", "After reviewing the survey results for completeness, we conducted  interviews with the lobbyists and lobbying firms to review documentation  they reported as having on their online survey for selected elements of  their LD-2 reports.", "Prior to each interview, we conducted an open source search to identify  lobbyists on each report who may have held a covered official position.  We reviewed the lobbyists\u2019 previous work histories by searching lobbying  firms\u2019 websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Legistorm, and Google.  Prior to 2008, lobbyists were only required to disclose covered official  positions held within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the client.  HLOGA amended that time frame to require disclosure of positions held  20 years before the date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client.  Lobbyist are required to disclose previously held covered official positions  either on the client registration (LD-1) or on the first LD-2 report when the  lobbyist is added as \u201cnew.\u201d Consequently, those who held covered official  positions may have disclosed the information on the LD-1 or a LD-2  report filed prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample.", "Therefore, where we found evidence that a lobbyist previously held a  covered official position and it was not disclosed on the LD-2 report under  review, we then conducted an additional reviewed the publicly available  Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House database. This was done  to determine whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the covered official  position on a prior report or LD-1. Finally, if a lobbyist appeared to hold a  covered position that was not disclosed, we asked for an explanation at  the interview with the lobbying firm to ensure that our research was  accurate. In previous reports, we reported the lower bound of a 90- percent confidence interval to provide a minimum estimate of omitted  covered positions and omitted contributions with a 95 percent confidence  level. We did so to account for the possibility that our searches may have  failed to identify all possible omitted covered positions and contributions.  As we have developed our methodology over time, we are more confident  in the comprehensiveness of our searches for these items. Accordingly,  this report presents the estimated percentages for omitted contributions  and omitted covered positions rather than the minimum estimates. As a  result, percentage estimates for these items will differ slightly from the  minimum percentage estimates presented in prior reports  In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether year-end 2012 or midyear 2013 LD-203 reports had been filed  for each firm and lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random  sample. Although this review represents a random selection of lobbyists  and firms, it is not a direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or  lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the  likelihood that LD-203 reports were appropriately filed for the population  of firms or lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for registrants to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the third and fourth quarters of 2012  and the first and second quarters of 2013, we used data filed with the  Clerk of the House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding  disclosure reports. Using an electronic matching algorithm that includes  strict and loose text matching procedures, we identified matching  disclosure reports for 2,925, or 96 percent, of the 3,034 newly filed  registrations. We began by standardizing client and registrant names in  both the report and registration files (including removing punctuation and  standardizing words and abbreviations, such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cCO\u201d).  We then matched reports and registrations using the House identification  number (which is linked to a unique registrant-client pair), as well as the  names of the registrant and client. For reports we could not match by  identification number and standardized name, we also attempted to  match reports and registrations by client and registrant name, allowing for  variations in the names to accommodate minor misspellings or typos. For  these cases, we used professional judgment to determine whether cases  with typos were sufficiently similar to consider as matches. We could not  readily identify matches in the report database for the remaining  registrations using electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 31,482 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 of the 10,227 reports with political  contributions. The second contains 80 of the 21,255 reports listing no  contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year-end 2012  filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2013 filing period. The  samples allow us to generalize estimates in this report to either the  population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports without  contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus  9.5 percentage points or less. Although our sample of LD-203 reports was  not designed to detect differences over time, we conducted tests of  significance for changes from 2010 to 2013 and found no statistically  significant differences after adjusting for multiple comparisons. While the  results provide some confidence that apparent fluctuations in our results  across years are likely attributable to sampling error, the inability to detect  significant differences may also be related to the nature of our sample,  which was relatively small and designed only for cross-sectional analysis.  We analyzed the contents of the LD-203 reports and compared them to  contribution data found in the publicly available Federal Elections  Commission\u2019s (FEC) political contribution database. We interviewed FEC  staff responsible for administering the database and determined that the  data reliability is suitable for confirming whether a FEC-reportable  disclosure listed in the FEC database had been reported on an LD-203  report.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions reporting on the LD-203  reports with information in the FEC database. The verification process  required text and pattern matching procedures, and we used professional  judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the same  individual filing an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC  database and not on the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or  organizations to explain why the contributions were not listed on the LD- 203 report or to provide documentation of those contributions. As with  covered positions on LD-2 disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that  our review identified all cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were  inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report. We did not  estimate the percentage of other non-FEC political contributions that were  omitted because they tend to constitute a small minority of all listed  contributions and cannot be verified against an external source.", "To identify challenges to compliance, we used a web-based survey and  obtained the views from 92 different lobbying firms included in our sample  on any challenges to compliance. The number of different lobbying firms  total 92 and is less than our sample of 102 reports because some  lobbying firms had more than 1 LD-2 report included in our sample. We  calculated our responses based on the number of different lobbying firms  that we contacted rather than the number of interviews. Prior to our  calculations, we removed the duplicate lobbying firms based on the most  recent date of their responses. For those cases with the same response  date, we kept the cases with the smallest assigned case identification  number. To obtain their views, we asked them to rate their ease with  complying with the LD-2 disclosure requirements using a scale of \u201cvery  easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat difficult,\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d In  addition, using the same scale we asked them to rate the ease of  understanding the terms associated with LD-2 reporting requirements.", "To describe the resources and authorities available to the Office and its  efforts to improve its LDA enforcement, we interviewed officials from the  Office and obtained updated information on the capabilities of the system  they established to track and report compliance trends and referrals, and  other practices established to focus resources on enforcement of the  LDA.
