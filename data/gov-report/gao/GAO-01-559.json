DOD established a 3-month carryover standard for most working capital fund activity groups, although it has not done the analysis necessary to support the 3-month standard. Without a validation process, neither DOD nor congressional decisionmakers can be sure that the 3-month standard is providing activity groups with reasonable amounts of carryover to ensure a smooth transition from one fiscal year to the next or whether the carryover is excessive. In addition, carryover information currently reported under the 3-month standard is not comparable between services and is misleading to DOD and congressional decisionmakers. Specifically, results can differ markedly because the military services use different methods to calculate the number of months of carryover. Further complicating the congressional budget review of carryovers is that some activity groups have underestimated their budgeted carryover year after year, thereby providing decisionmakers with misleading year-end carryover information and resulting in more funding being provided than was intended. GAO also reviewed the potential financial impact of reducing the amount of fiscal year-end carryover permitted by DOD policy. GAO's analysis showed that if a 30-day, 60-day or 75-day carryover policy had been in effect during the fiscal year 2001 budget review process, the amount of budgeted customer orders could have been reduced by about $2.9 billion, $1.6 billion, or $1.0 billion, respectively."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Section 1051 of the National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398) requires that we review the working capital fund activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) to (1) identify any potential changes in current management processes or policies that, if made, would result in a more efficient operation and (2) evaluate various aspects of the DOD policy that allow Defense Working Capital Fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next.

The congressional defense committees recognize that these industrial activities need some carryover to ensure a smooth flow of work during the transition from one fiscal year to the next. However, past congressional defense committee reports raised concerns that the level of carryover may be more than is needed for this purpose. Excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations are subject to reductions by DOD and the congressional defense committees during the budget review process. To the extent that carryover is high, the Congress may redirect the funds gained from such reductions to other priority initiatives.", "This report assesses the working capital fund policies and practices related to carryover.

A working capital fund is intended to (1) generate sufficient revenue to cover the full costs of its operations and (2) operate on a break-even basis over time\u2014that is, not make a profit nor incur a loss. Customers use appropriated funds, primarily Operations and Maintenance appropriations, to finance orders placed with the working capital fund. DOD estimates that in fiscal year 2001, the Defense Working Capital Fund\u2014which consists of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense-wide, and Defense Commissary Agency working capital funds\u2014will have revenue of about $74.3 billion.", "The Defense Working Capital Fund finances the operations of two fundamentally different types of support organizations: stock fund activities, which provide spare parts and other items to military units and other customers, and industrial activities, which provide depot maintenance, research and development, and other services to their customers.

Carryover consists of both the unfinished portion of work started but not yet completed, as well as requested work that has not yet commenced. To manage carryover, DOD converts the dollar amount of carryover to months. This is done to put the magnitude of the carryover in proper perspective. For example, if an activity group performs $100 million of work in a year and had $100 million in carryover at year-end, it would have 12 months of carryover. However, if another activity group performs $400 million of work in a year and had $100 million in carryover at year-end, this group would have 3 months of carryover.", "The congressional defense committees and DOD have acknowledged that some carryover is necessary at fiscal year-end if working capital funds are to operate in an efficient and effective manner. For example, if customers do not receive new appropriations at the beginning of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary to ensure that the working capital fund activities have enough work to ensure a smooth transition between fiscal years. Too little carryover could result in some personnel not having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the other hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing that work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent years.

However, because the activity groups perform different types of work and have different business practices, the use of the same carryover standard for all activity groups is likely not appropriate.", "Military service officials and activity group managers also questioned the use of a uniform standard. For example, because the Army\u2019s ordnance activity group is involved in the manufacture and assembly of munitions and weapon systems and requires a long lead time to obtain material, Army officials believe that group\u2019s carryover standard should be more than 3 months. Similarly, much of the work that customers request from Navy research and development activities is actually accomplished by contractors. Consequently, Navy research and development activity group managers believe they should be able to subtract work that is to be accomplished by contractors from their reported carryover balances or, if they must include this work in their totals, to have a longer carryover period.", "A 1987 DOD carryover study also raised questions about the use of a uniform carryover standard. This study defined the optimum level of carryover as \u201cthe minimum amount of work needed in order to ensure that there is no interruption of the average work cycle.\u201d As part of its 1987 carryover study, DOD asked the military departments to provide information on their working capital fund activity groups. Specifically, for each activity group they were to provide (1) information on the types of services provided and (2) data on the average time between commencement and completion of projects. Data developed for Army, Air Force, and DOD-wide activity groups showed that (1) the minimal carryover level varied significantly from one activity group to another and (2) in some instances the minimal carryover level was considerably less than 3 months. However, the study noted that its analysis did not consider either administrative or material lead times and acknowledged that both of these factors could have a significant impact on carryover requirements.", "When we discussed the 3-month carryover standard with officials of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), they acknowledged that they do not have an analytical basis for it.

They also said that only in unusual situations should an activity group need more than 3 months of carryover.

However, in 1996, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) directed a joint Defense review of carryover because the military services had expressed concerns about (1) the methodology used to compute months of carryover and (2) the reductions that were being made to customer budgets to help ensure that activity groups did not exceed the 3-month carryover standard.", "Based on the work of the joint study group, DOD decided to retain the 3-month carryover standard for all working capital fund activity groups except Air Force contract depot maintenance. For Air Force contract depot maintenance, it set a 4.5-month carryover standard because of the additional administrative functions associated with awarding contracts. Furthermore, based on the joint study group\u2019s work and concerns expressed by the Navy, DOD also approved several policy changes that had the effect of increasing the carryover standard for all working capital fund activities. Specifically, under the policy implemented after the 1996 study, certain categories of orders, such as those from non-DOD customers, and contractual obligations, such as Army arsenals\u2019 contracts with private sector firms for the fabrication of tool kits, can be excluded from the carryover balance that is used to determine whether the carryover standard has been exceeded.", "These policy changes were documented in an August 2, 1996, DOD decision paper that provided the following formula for calculating the number of months of carryover (see figure 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Differences Distort Carryover Data and Can Affect Congressional Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The impact of DOD\u2019s 1996 decision to exclude contract obligations and certain categories of orders from reported carryover varied significantly among the services.

This problem, in turn, is due to the fact that DOD has not provided clear guidance on whether (1) the revenue used in the carryover formula should be reduced when adjustments are made for contract obligations and (2) material requisitions submitted to DOD supply activities should be considered contract obligations.

DOD\u2019s formula for calculating months of carryover is based on the ratio of adjusted orders carried over to revenue. The formula specifies that carryover should be reduced by the amount of contractual obligations. However, the policy does not address whether downward adjustments for the revenue associated with these contractual services should also be made. Unless this is done, the number of months will be understated.", "The Army and Navy reduced their carryover balances by the amount of contractual obligations, but they did not reduce the revenue associated with these contractual services. On the other hand, the Air Force depot maintenance activity group in effect did reduce the revenue associated with contractual obligations because (1) it segregates its contract operations\u2019 carryover and revenue from its in-house operations\u2019 carryover and revenue and (2) DOD has established separate carryover standards for the Air Force in-house and contract depot maintenance operations.", "The Air Force depot maintenance activity group\u2019s approach ensures that data on in-house operations is not distorted by data on contract operations. On the other hand, the Army and Navy\u2019s approach allows activity groups to reduce their reported months of carryover by simply increasing the amount of work contracted out. Our work showed that the months of carryover reported by the Army and Navy activity groups would more accurately reflect the actual backlog of DOD in-house work if adjustments for contractual obligations affected both contract carryover and contract revenue.

However, the Air Force depot maintenance activity group, which had about $448 million of material on requisition as of September 30, 2000, did not make any such adjustments. Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials informed us that outstanding material requisitions were not intended to be included as contractual obligations for carryover purposes.

We also requested and reviewed documentation and/or analysis that supported the rationale for the 3-month carryover standard. In addition, we obtained and analyzed DOD studies, including the 1996 carryover study and budget documents that discussed DOD\u2019s carryover policy and the need for a 3-month period. We did not determine how much carryover individual activity groups would need in order to ensure a smooth flow of work at the end of the fiscal year.", "To determine if the services were calculating carryover in a consistent manner and, if not, the reasons for any differences, we obtained and analyzed the services\u2019 calculations for the (1) fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2000 reported year-end actual carryover balances and (2) fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001 budgeted year-end carryover balances. We met with officials from the Army, Navy, and Air Force to discuss the methodology they used to calculate carryover. We obtained (1) explanations about why the services made adjustments in calculating the dollar amount of carryover balances as well as the number of months of carryover and (2) determined the impact of those adjustments on the carryover figures.", "To determine if the military services\u2019 budgeted and reported actual carryover amounts exceeded the 3-month standard at fiscal year-end, we obtained and analyzed (1) budgeted year-end carryover data for fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001 and (2) reported actual year-end carryover data for fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2000.

We also met with (1) headquarters officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Army, Navy, and Air Force and (2) Army, Navy, and Air Force officials at individual working capital fund activity groups and activities to obtain their views on what the impact on their operation would be if the carryover policy were reduced from 3 months to 30 days.", "However, because (1) DOD has not performed the analysis necessary to validate its existing 3-month carryover standard and (2) the actual impact would depend on a number of unknown factors, such as the amount and type of work requested by customers and the timing of the requests, it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the operational impact of reducing the carryover levels.", "In performing our work, we obtained carryover information on the following Defense Working Capital Fund activity groups: (1) Air Force depot maintenance (in-house and contract), (2) Army depot maintenance, (3) Army ordnance, (4) Naval aviation depots, (5) Naval shipyards, and (6) Naval research and development.
