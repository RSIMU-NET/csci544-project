At the Department of Energy (DOE), a major focus in the last few years has been on improving the cost-effectiveness of the nuclear weapons complex cleanup. Similarly, at the Department of Defense (DOD) cleanup costs have been an issue, but the cleanup effort is part of a larger effort to control the cost of environmental compliance now, while minimizing contamination and associated costs in the future. At DOD, environmental compliance-related activities have overtaken cleanup as the major annual cost.", "As our work over the last several years has shown, both departments face monumental tasks in addressing the legacy of environmental problems created by many decades of nuclear weapons production and military operations. Although DOE and DOD have made some progress, major obstacles remain, and the two departments estimate that the total cost of cleaning up their facilities could run as much as $389 billion\u2014about $39 billion for DOD and as much as $350 billion for DOE.", "Over the last several years, we have reviewed many aspects of each department\u2019s cleanup effort. With regard to DOE\u2019s cleanup effort, our testimony today will address (1) how administration of basic laws governing cleanup of the weapons complex affect costs, (2) suggested ways to reduce DOE\u2019s costs, (3) issues the Congress should consider regarding DOE\u2019s initiative to privatize portions of its cleanup effort, and (4) how excess carryover balances could be used to fund DOE\u2019s cleanup effort. With respect to DOD\u2019s cleanup program, we will address (1) DOD\u2019s use of relative risk as a major factor in ranking individual cleanup sites and (2) how DOD prioritizes, plans, and budgets for its environmental compliance program.", "Concerning the DOE cleanup, in summary, we have found the following:", "Changes in how the basic laws governing the cleanup of the weapons complex are administered can potentially reduce cleanup costs. For example, DOE has usually assumed that all of its facilities will be cleaned up so that their use would be unrestricted; however, many facilities are so contaminated that unrestricted use is unlikely. In our August 1994 report on the impact of incorporating land use planning decisions into cleanup decision-making, we found that incorporating more realistic land use assumptions into the selection process for a cleanup remedy under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), could result in significant cost savings\u2014from $200 million to $600 million annually, according to DOE.In July 1995, we reported (1) that while removing radioactive and hazardous materials through a process known as deactivation can save money\u2014almost $458 million for the projects we could evaluate\u2014DOE did not have a consistent method for determining the relative savings among projects and (2) that without a more consistent method, DOE could select the wrong priority for projects it intends to deactivate. More recently, we have been examining how DOE could speed the environmental restoration of its sites. While our work is not complete, we have found that significant potential exists to use a less restrictive process to plan the remediation of sites, at a significant cost savings.", "As part of its initiatives to reduce the cost of the cleanup, DOE is now proposing to privatize portions of the cleanup, most notably, the vitrification of high-level waste in the tanks at its Hanford facility. While we have not evaluated DOE\u2019s privatization proposal, we have conducted numerous reviews of DOE\u2019s management of the cleanup and of the Hanford tank farms. Key among the major issues that the Congress should consider in evaluating DOE\u2019s privatization proposal are (1) has DOE demonstrated that privatizing the cleanup of the tank farms will reduce the overall life cycle costs of the program to the taxpayer, (2) has DOE adequately defined what liability the government should assume and what liability should be borne by the private firm, and (3) has DOE determined who will oversee the private firm for compliance with environmental, nuclear, and health and safety regulations?", "The Department\u2019s excess carryover balances could be used to help fund its cleanup efforts. At the end of fiscal year 1995, DOE\u2019s environmental programs had almost $1.8 billion in these balances. Through prior and ongoing work, we have found that in formulating a budget request, DOE officials do not use a standard, effective approach for identifying excess carryover balances that could be used to reduce DOE\u2019s budget request. Instead, DOE makes broad estimates of the potentially excess balances in its programs. As a result, DOE cannot be sure it has reduced its balances to the minimum needed to operate its programs.", "Turning to DOD, in summary, our work shows the following:", "DOD has begun efforts to categorize cleanups within and among facilities based on their relative risk. Our past and ongoing work for this Committee indicates that these efforts are a step in the right direction. About 70 percent of the estimated 10,000 DOD sites believed to need cleanup have been evaluated, but over half of all evaluated sites still are considered high priority without any further ranking within that group. Consequently, some lesser priority sites may exist within the broader high relative risk category. Finally, efforts to rank cleanup sites across geographic and organizational boundaries are still in their infancy.", "DOD does not have sufficient data to manage its environmental compliance programs, with far less oversight data for compliance activities than for cleanup activities. For example, even though the Congress receives annual reports with installation level data for planned and actual cleanup expenditures, DOD\u2019s process for compliance data cannot now provide a similar degree of detail. In 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) established a working group to develop procedures to ensure that necessary data, such as amounts budgeted and spent, can be obtained and reported in detail. It is too soon to fully evaluate DOD\u2019s plans to improve oversight of the compliance program, but we are concerned some initial changes may make it harder to distinguish among DOD\u2019s highest priorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Through its Environmental Management (EM) program, DOE is responsible for environmental restoration, waste management, and facility transition and management at 15 major contaminated facilities and more than 100 small facilities in 34 states and territories. These facilities encompass a wide range of environmental problems, including more than 7,000 locations where radioactive or hazardous materials were released into the environment; almost 200 tanks that contain high-level radioactive waste from nuclear weapons production, some of which have leaked or could explode; and 7,000 production facilities that are now idled and in need of deactivation, decontamination, and decommissioning.", "For decades, DOD has operated industrial facilities that generated, stored, or disposed of hazardous wastes. The types of hazardous wastes and contaminants that require cleanup at the majority of DOD\u2019s installations are also found at most private industrial operations. The primary contaminants are petroleum-related products such as fuels, solvents, corrosives, and paint strippers and thinners. Contamination has usually resulted from improper disposal, leaks, or spills. Some unique military substances, such as nerve agents and unexploded ordnance, are also found at DOD\u2019s installations.", "In 1984, the Congress established the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) to evaluate and clean up contamination resulting from DOD\u2019s past activities. DERP\u2019s primary goal is to protect human health and the environment from risks posed by contaminated sites. Since 1984, DOD has identified approximately 20,000 potentially contaminated sites (10,000 of which it believes contaminated) at over 1,700 installations, and approximately 3,200 potentially contaminated sites at about 2,200 formerly used DOD installations in the United States.", "In cleaning up its sites, DOD and DOE must comply with two major federal environmental laws\u2014the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), and CERCLA\u2014as well as with state environmental laws and regulations. RCRA regulates the management of facilities that treat, store, and dispose of hazardous wastes and the cleanup of hazardous wastes released from such facilities. CERCLA governs the cleanup of inactive waste sites\u2014that is, sites where disposal is no longer occurring. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for administering both acts, but EPA may authorize state agencies to implement all or part of its RCRA responsibility. To implement its responsibilities under these acts, DOE has entered into interagency compliance agreements with EPA and the states. These agreements identify activities\u2014generally called milestones\u2014and schedules for achieving compliance, many of which are legally binding and enforceable. Both departments are also involved in complying with other laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Federal Facility Compliance Act.", "Cleaning up these department\u2019s sites is an enormous task, that, in the case of DOE, is likely to span multiple generations. Over the last several years, the total estimated cost of the DOE cleanup has risen from about $100 billion in 1988 to $230 billion, with a high end estimate of $350 billion. DOD currently estimates its total costs, from its inception, at almost $39 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Issues Could Affect the Cost of Cleaning Up the Weapons Complex", "paragraphs": ["The huge cost of cleaning up the weapons complex has been a matter of growing concern, especially to the Subcommittee on Military Procurement. We have reported repeatedly on many issues that have and will affect the cost of the cleanup, including the need for a national, risk-based strategy to set realistic priorities; the need for DOE to more effectively address the complex technical problems that it faces in cleaning up its most vexing problems, such as the high-level tank wastes at Hanford; and the need for effective contractor management. At your request, we would like to address several issues of specific interest to the Subcommittee. These issues include how legislation can affect cleanup costs, ways to reduce cleanup costs, DOE\u2019s privatization initiative, and how excess carryover balances could be used to fund DOE\u2019s cleanup efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Legislation Is Administered Can Affect Cleanup Costs", "paragraphs": ["Our August 1994 report on the impact of incorporating land use planning decisions into cleanup decision-making stated that incorporating more realistic land use assumptions into the selection process for a cleanup remedy under CERCLA could result in significant cost savings\u2014from $200 million to $600 million annually, according to DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for EM. Our report noted that DOE and EPA had been assuming that all of DOE\u2019s facilities would be cleaned up so that they could be used for unrestricted use. Consequently, the most stringent environmental requirements were imposed on every cleanup project. However, we found that because CERCLA does not specifically address using alternative land uses, such as industrial parks, EPA\u2019s policy had been to assume residential use in its decisions\u2014potentially the most costly cleanup requirement.", "Since our report was issued, DOE has begun to work with local stakeholder groups and develop land use plans for its sites. Additionally, in May 1995, EPA issued a directive indicating that cleanup decision-making should reflect \u201creasonably anticipated future land use\u201d and that this could lead to more expedited, cost-effective cleanups. The practical effect of this directive is not clear. For example, CERCLA states that cleanup alternatives that permanently treat contaminants are preferred. Since some land uses may rely on institutional controls, such as deed restrictions and fencing, to prevent access to the contaminated area, it is not clear whether EPA will be able to consider these types of controls a permanent solution. As we noted in our report, if the Congress agrees that land use planning should be used in cleanup decisions, it could amend CERCLA to provide EPA with more specific direction.", "DOE\u2019s facilities are subject to the cleanup actions and procedures specified by EPA under CERCLA as well as to RCRA-related requirements for corrective action established by EPA or a state regulatory agency. The need to coordinate the requirements of RCRA and CERCLA has created the potential for delays and increased costs. For example, our December 1994 report stated that officials at DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site were preparing additional documents to meet CERCLA\u2019s requirements, at a cost of about $33,000, for a facility that had been cleaned up and closed in 1990 under RCRA. DOE officials acknowledged that DOE would not be conducting any additional cleanup or disclosing any new information in preparing the required documents. Such problems could continue, since much cleanup work remains to be done, and additional DOE facilities have come under CERCLA regulation.", "DOE and EPA have recognized the potential impact of this duplication. DOE has developed an approach where it attempts to avoid duplication by specifying a lead regulator (either EPA or the state) for each cleanup project. Similarly, EPA is developing guidance on designating a lead regulator which it expects to issue in the summer of 1996. While this approach might solve the problem, it will depend on the cooperation of DOE and the EPA regions and states that oversee DOE\u2019s facilities. Absent such cooperation, problems with duplication between RCRA and CERCLA could continue to affect the cost of the cleanup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific Opportunities Exist to Reduce Cleanup Costs", "paragraphs": ["In July 1995, we issued a report to the Subcommittee on Military Procurement examining DOE\u2019s approach for estimating the savings it could achieve through the deactivation of surplus facilities. We found that deactivation\u2014removing radioactive and hazardous materials from unused buildings\u2014can save money. In estimating the net savings that DOE could realize for the 11 projects for which sufficient data were available for analysis, we found that the projects could yield a net savings of $458 million over their expected life. Despite the significant savings that some deactivation projects can generate, DOE did not have a consistent method for determining the relative savings among projects, and without a more consistent method, DOE could select the wrong priority for projects it intends to deactivate. We recommended that DOE develop a more reliable method for estimating savings and use this method to set priorities for deactivation projects. DOE agreed with our recommendations and said it would develop guidance on estimating savings and use the guidance to determine facility deactivation priorities.", "Currently, we are examining for you how DOE could use a process known as \u201cremoval actions\u201d to speed the environmental restoration of its sites. A removal action shortens or eliminates some of the planning steps, such as the remedial investigation and feasibility study, normally used for full-scale remedial actions under CERCLA. Although removal actions are sometimes used to respond to emergencies or other urgent circumstances, they can also be used in more routine situations at federal facilities. Removal actions have been used for a variety of cleanups, including treating ground and surface water and excavating contaminated soil.

Rather than constructing and operating its own facilities to treat the tank waste, DOE is considering having a company or a consortium of companies finance, design, build, and operate pretreatment and treatment facilities and deliver the finished product\u2014in this case, vitrified waste encased in stainless steel containers\u2014to DOE for a fee. DOE expects this approach to save billions of dollars because the potential for innovation in the marketplace could lead to greater efficiencies and improved performance. A request for proposals to design the first phase of this effort was issued in February 1996, and DOE expects to award competing contracts in August 1996.", "It is important to recognize that for all practical purposes, DOE\u2019s activities are already privatized. Specifically, DOE primarily relies on management and operating contractors to conduct its programs at its major sites. Under this concept, the government assumes most of the risk for the operations, while the contractor is paid on a cost-plus-award-fee basis. What sets DOE\u2019s privatization initiative apart from its traditional approach is DOE\u2019s attempt to shift responsibility for financing and much of the risk onto the private contractor.", "Although we have not evaluated DOE\u2019s privatization initiative, we have conducted numerous reviews of DOE\u2019s management of the cleanup and of the Hanford tank farms. You asked us to identify issues that the Congress should consider in evaluating DOE\u2019s privatization proposal. While there are many issues to consider, we believe three are the most critical:", "Has DOE demonstrated that privatizing the cleanup of the tank farms will reduce the overall life cycle costs to the taxpayer? As our work has demonstrated, considerable uncertainty exists about the contents of the tanks and the effectiveness of many of the technologies needed to be successful. It is possible that the \u201crisk premium\u201d demanded by a private entity to cover these uncertainties could exceed the efficiency gains that might be realized by privatization.", "Has DOE adequately defined what liability the government should assume and what liability should be borne by the private firms? According to our past work, DOE has not used a consistent approach to indemnify its cleanup contractors, and some contractors have received more favorable treatment than others. Again, given the substantial risk involved, the issue of indemnification bears close scrutiny to ensure that the government does not assume so much of the risk that the effort becomes privatized in name only.", "Has DOE determined who will oversee the private firm for compliance with environmental, nuclear, and health and safety regulations? The facilities to treat Hanford\u2019s high level waste will involve hazardous, radioactive materials potentially dangerous to workers and the public. This will require the coordination and cooperation of many agencies, including EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the state of Washington, and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Large Carryover Balances Continue to Be an Issue", "paragraphs": ["In addition to making the cleanup more cost effective, an additional way to provide funds for DOE\u2019s cleanup is through the use of excess carryover balances of uncosted obligations and unobligated balances. Over the last several years, the Congress has reduced DOE\u2019s request for new obligational authority and recommended that DOE use balances remaining from prior years\u2019 obligational authority that are carried over into the new fiscal year. DOE\u2019s EM program had about $1.8 billion in such carryover balances at the end of fiscal year 1996. While DOE needs some carryover balances to pay for program commitments made in prior years that have not been completed, the Department\u2019s large and persistent carryover balances have raised concern in the Congress, and especially in the Subcommittee on Military Procurement, about whether DOE\u2019s carryover balances exceed the minimum needed to support its programs.", "Over the last several years, we have consistently found that DOE had hundreds of millions of dollars in carryover balances that were not needed for their identified purpose, were not tied to specific needs, or were in excess of expected needs. For example, last year, we identified $46.2 million reserved for 15 environmental management projects at the Savannah River Site that were no longer needed because of cost underruns, reductions in the projects\u2019 scope, or cancellation of projects. These persistent findings led us to review whether DOE had an effective approach for identifying carryover balances that exceed its program requirements and may be available to reduce its budget request and whether DOE\u2019s process could be improved.", "We found that in formulating a budget request, DOE officials do not use a standard, effective approach for identifying excess carryover balances that could be used to reduce DOE\u2019s budget request. Instead, DOE makes broad estimates of the potentially excess balances in its programs. For example, EM proposed the use of $300 million in carryover balances for its fiscal year 1996 budget. According to EM officials, that amount was not based on any detailed analysis, and only after it was proposed did the program identify where the available balances might be found. As a result, DOE cannot be sure it has reduced its balances to the minimum needed to operate its programs.

We reported also that DOD\u2019s cleanup had proceeded slowly and that relatively few hazardous waste sites had been cleaned up. Citing congressional concerns and our report, DOD began to implement a risk-based prioritization system.", "In May 1994, an inter-military service working group developed procedures to prioritize cleanups on the basis of relative risk. Historically, priorities for cleanup were established at the field level using a variety of methods and factors\u2014often by DOD and regulatory personnel\u2014as part of negotiated legal agreements that included study and cleanup milestones. However, the legal agreements did not always ensure that sites posing the greatest risk to human health and the environment were cleaned up first.", "In the summer of 1994, DOD issued guidance to implement the relative risk model to place sites in the DERP into high, medium, and low groups. Assignment to a relative risk group considered (1) site contamination (What chemical concentrations are there?), (2) paths that the materials could travel (Is the contamination moving or will it move?), and (3) potential contacts that the contaminants could have with people, animals, or plants (Are there humans or sensitive environments nearby that could be adversely affected?).", "DOD expected to complete relative risk evaluations by July 1995 for the estimated 10,000 sites requiring cleanup. However, as of February 1996, evaluations had been done for 7,450 of the sites.

As shown in figure 1, the remaining 17 percent of expenditures is for sites ranked medium, low, or not evaluated. Generally, no further risk distinctions are made among the high risk sites, except for a Navy and Marine Corps effort to prioritize sites in EPA Regions 9 and 10.
