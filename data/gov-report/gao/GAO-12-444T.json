The Secretary of Defense accelerated the timeline for DOD auditability, setting a 2014 deadline for audit readiness of the Statement of Budgetary Resources, and DOD has issued a plan for meeting that date, which GAO is in the process of reviewing. The plan emphasizes the importance of leadership, including senior leaders and field commanders, to achieving DOD\u0092s goals, and it links accountability to performance appraisals.

Together, the provisions of the BCA  would reduce deficits over the 2012-2021 decade by $2.1 trillion\u2014largely  through reductions in discretionary spending. Both the Financial Report  and GAO\u2019s simulations assume these reductions occur, and that the  savings as a share of GDP continue beyond the decade. Even with the  reductions from the BCA, the government continues to face a significant  structural imbalance between revenues and spending, driven on the  spending side largely by rising health care costs and the aging of the U.S.  population. We have already begun to see the impact of this structural  imbalance\u2014Social Security is now in a negative cash flow position. The  growing gap between revenues and spending that is built into the current  structure of the budget leads to continued growth in debt held by the  public as a share of GDP; this is not sustainable. Changing this path will  not be easy, and it will likely require difficult decisions affecting both  federal spending and revenue. While delay increases the size of the  changes that must be made, it is also important to recognize current  economic conditions. Addressing the long-term fiscal imbalance is made  more difficult by the need to balance achieving the goals of sustaining  economic growth in the near term, while producing a plan to change the  federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal path."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "paragraphs": ["In closing, even though progress has been made in improving federal  financial management activities and practices, much work remains given  the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges and the need for the  Congress, the administration, and federal managers to have reliable,  useful, and timely financial and performance information to effectively  meet these challenges. Sound decisions on the current and future  direction of vital federal government programs and policies are more  difficult without reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance  information. DOD, in particular, faces many difficult challenges in this  area. We are encouraged by DOD\u2019s efforts toward addressing its long- standing financial management weaknesses and its efforts to achieve  auditability. However, sustained and diligent DOD top management  oversight toward achieving financial management capabilities, including  audit readiness, will be critical going forward. Moreover, in addition to  annual financial statements that can pass the scrutiny of a financial audit,  the civilian CFO Act agencies must continue to strive toward routinely  producing reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance data to  help guide decision makers on a day-to-day basis. Federal entities\u2019  improvement of financial management systems will be essential to  achieve this goal for their agency and the government as a whole.", "The last economic recession and the federal government\u2019s actions to  stabilize financial markets continued to significantly affect the federal  government\u2019s financial condition. Continued focus and attention is needed  to ensure (1) that sufficient internal controls and transparency are  established and maintained for all financial stabilization efforts; and (2)  that all related financial transactions are reported on time, accurately, and  completely. In addition, the federal government will face the challenge of  determining the most expeditious manner in which to bring closure to its  financial stabilization initiatives while optimizing its investment returns.", "Further, of utmost concern are the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal  challenges that result from large and growing structural deficits that are  driven on the spending side primarily by rising health care costs and  known demographic trends. This unsustainable path must be addressed  by policymakers.", "Finally, I want to emphasize the value of sustained congressional interest  in federal financial management issues, as demonstrated by this  Subcommittee\u2019s leadership.
