Further, a database analysis by GAO revealed data reliability problems, including duplicative and contradictory data. In addition, major Postal Service departments do not use the database as a consolidated data source for managing postal facilities. The Postal Service has attempted to improve the database, but many problems remain. To address the challenge of maintaining its facilities, the Postal Service has begun assessing the condition of the facilities but has neither determined the extent of its maintenance projects nor strategically prioritized the projects. A Postal Service inspection of 651 randomly selected postal facilities revealed that two-thirds were in less than \"acceptable\" condition, but the Postal Service had not documented the full extent of its maintenance projects backlog. After the inspection, the Postal Service initiated a program to assess the condition of all of its facilities--a necessary first step to improving their condition. In addition, the Postal Service lacks the data needed to implement leading federal practices, such as considering a facility's importance and value when prioritizing its maintenance projects. Due to funding constraints, the Postal Service currently focuses exclusively on emergency and urgent repairs--at the expense of a less costly preventive maintenance approach. To address the challenge of aligning access to postal retail services with customer needs, the Postal Service has expanded access in underserved areas but has done less to address overserved areas. Leading federal practices identify criteria for \"rightsizing\" facility networks--such as considering facilities' importance and utilization--but the Postal Service does not consider these criteria. GAO's analysis shows wide variation in the number of postal retail facilities among comparable counties, and a number of facilities GAO visited appeared to merit consideration for closure based on one or more of the federal criteria. If the Postal Service begins collecting data that reflects criteria based on leading federal practices, it may be able to close facilities and adjust access to retail services according to customer needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With about 34,000 owned and leased facilities, the U.S. Postal Service is  the third-largest landholding entity in the federal government. Most of its  facilities provide retail services, such as mail and package delivery,  consistent with its mission to make postal services accessible to everyone  in the country. Other facilities house the Postal Service\u2019s mail processing,  mail delivery, vehicle maintenance, and administrative functions. This  expansive facility network is costly to operate and poses significant  property management challenges. Changes in mail volumes, increasing  employee compensation and benefits costs, a more competitive  marketplace, and legislative reforms enacted in December 2006 have  necessitated that the Postal Service increase its efficiency and cut costs.  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, enacted in December  2006, provided tools and mechanisms that can be used to establish an  efficient, flexible, and financially sound Postal Service, but also introduced  a rate cap for many postal services. Traditionally, the Postal Service set  rates based on costs, but now an annual limitation will be placed on  percentage changes in rates for market-dominant (as opposed to  competitive) products, linked to the change in the Consumer Price  Index\u2014All Urban Customers.", "Real property management is a challenge not only for the Postal Service  but also for other federal agencies. In 2004, an executive order established  the Federal Real Property Council (Federal Council)\u2014an interagency  group of federal landholding agencies\u2014to collect and disseminate  information on leading practices for managing federal facilities. One such  leading federal practice requires federal agencies bound by the executive  order to establish a current and reliable inventory of their facilities.  Furthermore, these agencies are required to capture and report  performance-related data about their facilities in four areas: (1)  importance to achieving the agency\u2019s mission, (2) utilization rate (extent  to which the facility is fully utilized), (3) physical condition, and (4) annual  operating costs. These data, termed \u201cfacility management performance  measures,\u201d are used to measure an agency\u2019s performance in managing its  facilities. Although not bound by the executive order, the Postal Service  has voluntarily assigned a representative to the Federal Council and  adopted some leading federal practices. Additional information on the  executive order and the Federal Council is available in appendix I.", "Previous analyses by GAO and others have identified a number of key  challenges to managing federal facilities, including a lack of reliable and  useful data on facilities, facilities in disrepair, and facility networks that  are not properly aligned with customer needs. You requested that we  analyze these challenges as they apply to the Postal Service. Accordingly,  this report addresses the Postal Service\u2019s efforts to (1) capture and  maintain accurate facility data, (2) adequately maintain the condition of  postal facilities, and (3) align access to retail services with its customer  needs. This report identifies the Postal Service\u2019s goals and actions for  managing each of these challenges and assesses the Postal Service\u2019s  progress in overcoming the challenges and, as applicable, its  implementation of leading federal practices.", "To accomplish our objectives, we visited 58 postal facilities, interviewed  postal officials to learn about postal facility management, reviewed  relevant postal documents, and assessed the Postal Service\u2019s  implementation of relevant leading federal practices for managing its  facilities. The observations derived from our site visits cannot be  generalized to the population of postal facilities nationwide. We chose the  facilities we visited to achieve balance with regard to geographic location,  area demographic trends, facility type, revenue, and physical condition.  Our work also included the following:    To assess the Postal Service\u2019s progress in overcoming the challenge of  capturing and maintaining accurate data on its facilities, we analyzed the  Postal Service\u2019s Facility Database (FDB) and assessed the reliability of the  data it contained on two dates\u2014October 5, 2006 and July 7, 2007. To  assess FDB data, we interviewed postal officials to obtain an  understanding of the data, the structure of the database, the sources of the  data, and known database issues and limitations; reviewed related Postal  Service documents and reports by the Postal Service\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General (Postal OIG); and electronically tested the database for  completeness, obvious errors, and inconsistencies. In addition, we  attempted to verify selected facility data as of October 5, 2006, during our  visits to 58 postal facilities. Our assessment of FDB data as of July 7,  2007\u2014our second assessment\u2014was designed, in part, to determine the  impact of the Postal Service\u2019s efforts to improve FDB.", "To assess the Postal Service\u2019s progress in overcoming the challenge of  maintaining its facilities in adequate condition, we analyzed maintenance  data nationwide and attempted to validate maintenance data at the 58  facilities that we visited.", "To assess the Postal Service\u2019s progress in overcoming the challenge of  aligning access to its retail services with customer needs, we assessed the  extent to which the number of retail postal facilities varies among counties  with similar attributes. To do so, we first identified the number and  location of Postal Service retail facilities at the county level. Then, we  statistically compared the number of postal retail facilities in each county,  given the county\u2019s population, land area, and degree of urbanization, with  the number of retail facilities in comparable counties. The variation in the  number of postal retail facilities was determined by subtracting the  number of retail facilities in a county with the number of facilities in  comparable counties, as determined by the statistical comparison.  However, we excluded counties without an urban center of at least 10,000  people from the output of our analysis because the Postal Service may  need to maintain more postal retail facilities in these counties to fulfill its  mission of providing universal access to postal services. Our statistical  analysis explains almost 80 percent of the variation in the number of retail  postal facilities among the counties.", "We conducted our work from July 2006 through December 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Postal Service 2006 annual  report indicates that its facilities are valued at approximately $21 billion.  In addition, according to the Postal Service, it paid approximately $860  million for capital projects and maintenance repairs in fiscal year 2006.  About three-fourths of postal facilities are leased, and in fiscal year 2006,  the Postal Service paid over $1 billion to lease these facilities. The Postal  Service is responsible for maintaining all of its owned facilities and many  of its leased facilities, but maintenance responsibilities vary with the  specific lease and can change when a lease is renegotiated.", "Employees at postal retail facilities provide services related to First-Class  Mail, Insured and Registered Mail, Parcel Post, Priority Mail, and other  services, such as post office box rentals and money-order purchases. Some  retail facilities also provide space for other functions, such as receiving  and sorting mail for delivery. Retail facilities\u2014whether owned or leased\u2014 fall into one of three categories: (1) main post offices, where local  postmasters oversee retail operations in the geographic area; (2) postal  stations located within a municipality\u2019s corporate limits; and (3) postal  branches located outside a municipality\u2019s corporate limits. According to  Postal Service data, main post offices account for almost 75 percent of all  retail facilities, but in large communities there may be more stations and  branches. The Postal Service also operates nonretail facilities, such as mail  processing facilities, vehicle maintenance facilities, and administrative  offices. Figure 1 provides information on the different types of postal  facilities.", "Besides the retail facilities it owns or leases, the Postal Service reported in  its 2006 annual report that it operates about 3,950 privately owned and  operated facilities, known as either \u201ccontract postal units\u201d or \u201ccommunity  post offices,\u201d which provide retail postal services. Contract postal units  are operated by nonpostal employees in privately operated businesses,  such as convenience stores, grocery stores, greeting card stores, and  pharmacies. Community post offices are contract postal units that are  located in small communities and function as main post offices. The Postal  Service reported that there were 3,014 contract postal units and 937  community post offices throughout the nation. The Postal Service has no  responsibility for maintaining these privately operated retail facilities.", "Responsibility for managing postal facilities is distributed across the  Postal Service.", "Three Postal Service departments in headquarters share responsibility for  managing data on postal facilities\u2014(1) Delivery and Retail, (2) Facilities,  and (3) Intelligent Mail and Address Quality. Each of these departments  tracks different data on postal facilities depending on its needs. Delivery  and Retail manages FDB, which was developed to consolidate information  on all postal facilities. Facilities manages the Facility Management System,  which is used to manage facility acquisitions and capital and expense  projects. Intelligent Mail and Address Quality administers the Address  Management System, which contains the addresses of about 160 million  delivery locations nationwide, including postal facilities.

The Postal Service responded by issuing a plan to  \u201ctransform\u201d its operations\u2014the 2002 Transformation Plan. Specific  strategies outlined in the plan called for the Postal Service to align its  retail network with customer needs by promoting alternative access to  retail services and closing \u201clow-value, redundant\u201d postal retail facilities in  overserved areas. To obtain information needed to align access to retail  services with customer needs, the Postal Service indicated that it would  establish a national facility database and develop a criteria-based  methodology to determine which facilities to close. The criteria were to  include factors, such as a facility\u2019s proximity to other postal facilities, the  number of households and delivery points in a community, and indicators  of retail productivity. In 2004, we reported that the Postal Service had not  yet developed criteria for making changes to its retail facility network,  including facility closures and consolidations. The Postal Service updated  its Transformation Plan in 2005 for fiscal years 2006 through 2010,  indicating that it intended to reduce its long-term facility repair costs by  doing more focused, routine facility assessments and preventive  maintenance.", "The postal reform legislation enacted in December 2006 provided  additional opportunities to address the challenges the Postal Service faces  in adapting to an increasingly competitive environment. The act provides  tools and mechanisms to help control costs, including the costs of aligning  its facility network with its customer needs. The act also requires the  Postal Service to develop a plan by June 2008 to \u201crationalize\u201d its network  of facilities, remove excess capacity from the network, and identify  anticipated cost savings and other benefits associated with network  rationalization.

However, based on our analysis of selected data fields, FDB data  problems make it unreliable as a centralized source of aggregate facility  data even after performing data-cleaning techniques on the raw data.  Specifically, our assessment revealed the following nationwide problems  with the data\u2019s reliability as of October 5, 2006:    145 facility entries were exact duplicates of another facility entry (all data  fields were the same);   1,931 facility entries had multiple retail facilities listed at the same address  (e.g., a main post office and a station were listed with the same address);   1,288 facility entries had different amounts of square footage listed for the    892 facility entries had conflicting information on whether the facility is    1,216 facility entries had conflicting data on the amount of the facility\u2019s    509 facility entries listed as having staffed more retail windows than  reportedly exist at the facility.", "The Lubbock (Texas) Main Post Office illustrates several of the data  reliability problems we found.

Except for information on the annual rent\u2014which the Postal  Service considers sensitive\u2014table 1 displays these FDB fields for the  Lubbock Main Post Office.", "We discussed several specific examples of the data reliability problems we  found with postal officials who, after researching multiple data sources,  provided explanations for the specific examples we found. For example,  with respect to the Lubbock Main Post Office, postal officials said that the  first entry in table 1 is correct while the other three entries actually  represent other postal facilities at different locations in Lubbock. In  addition, using another data source, they told us that entry 2 is actually a  carrier annex; entry 3 is a warehouse; and entry 4 is a postal vending  machine. Using other data sources, the Postal Service officials also  provided explanations for other specific problems we identified. However,  without additional site visits, we cannot determine whether the  explanations provided were accurate.", "We also identified incorrect FDB information for 24 of the 58 postal  facilities we visited. For example, during our sites visits, we found that  information on vacant leasable square footage, which the Postal Service  asks local employees to document, was inaccurate in FDB. At least six of  the facilities we visited had vacant space that local employees said could  be leased, but these facilities were not listed as having vacant, leasable  space in FDB. These facilities and their vacant space are shown in figure 3.  Postal officials acknowledged our examples and noted there are few  incentives for local officials to report facilities\u2019 vacant, leasable space in  FDB.", "Postal officials acknowledged that the Postal Service has not analyzed the  reliability of FDB data but expressed confidence that the problems we  found affect a small percentage of the Postal Service\u2019s facilities. While we  cannot definitively determine the overall magnitude of FDB\u2019s data  reliability problems, the cumulative effect of the problems we found could  significantly distort the reporting of aggregate facility statistics. For  example, conflicting ownership data in FDB, as illustrated for the Lubbock  facility in table 1, could cause the Postal Service\u2019s annual rent obligation in  FDB to vary by as much as $82 million, or more than 8 percent of the  Postal Service\u2019s reported rent obligation for fiscal year 2006. Inaccurate  ownership data are of particular concern because the Postal Service used  FDB for its aggregate ownership statistics in its 2006 annual report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Postal Officials Do Not Rely Exclusively on FDB for Reporting on the Postal Service\u2019s Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Although the Postal Service developed FDB over 5 years ago to provide a  consolidated source of facility data, the Postal Service continues to  operate and use various facility data sources. Furthermore, while postal  officials acknowledged that postal staff did not use FDB initially because  the data were not reliable, our analysis demonstrates that FDB is still not  sufficiently reliable for use as a consolidated data source for postal  facilities. The Postal Service indicated that several major Postal Service  departments do not use FDB for aggregate facility information, partly  because of concerns about its reliability. Thus, as shown in figure 4,  instead of exclusively relying on FDB for facility information in its 2006  annual report, the Postal Service used multiple sources of data, including  its Address Management System, for quantifying its retail and delivery  facilities by type.", "We found that FDB\u2019s data reliability problems were caused by (1) errors in  the systems that feed into FDB, (2) problems with how the systems are  linked to form an FDB facility entry, and (3) errors in inputting FDB data.  First, as stated earlier, some information is fed directly from both the  Address Management and Facility Management systems into FDB, causing  errors in either system to automatically feed into FDB. While we did not  fully evaluate the Address Management System\u2014the Postal Service\u2019s  database for all delivery points in the country\u2014we found errors in the  Address Management System data that the Postal Service used in its 2006  annual report. Specifically, we found instances of (1) duplicate entries for  the same facility; (2) multiple facilities with the same function (e.g., main  post office) listed at the same address; and (3) contractor and Postal  Service-operated facilities listed at the same address. During our site visits,  we also found that the address contained in the Address Management  System and fed into FDB for the O\u2019Hare Terminal 2 Finance Station in  Chicago, Illinois, was incorrect. In addition to containing errors, in  December 2006, the Postal OIG reported that the Address Management  System was incomplete because it did not contain information on all  postal facilities. During our site visits, we also found errors that were fed  directly into FDB from the Facility Management System. For example, the  square footage in FDB for the Colleyville Main Post Office in Texas was  incorrect because it did not reflect the sale of a significant portion of land  that occurred 3 years prior to the entry. Postal Service officials  acknowledge that errors in the Address Management and Facility  Management systems feed directly into FDB.", "Second, many of the FDB errors we found resulted when facility entries in  the Address Management and Facility Management Systems were  incorrectly linked to create an FDB facility entry. FDB facility entries are  created by linking facility entries in the Address Management and Facility  Management Systems. However, these systems do not use the same  convention for naming facilities, and therefore, they cannot be linked  automatically to create an FDB facility entry. Instead, according to Postal  Service officials, postal employees must manually link facility entries in  the two systems. In some instances, the manual process resulted in linkage  errors which, according to postal officials, caused some of the duplicate  facility entries and contradictory information in FDB that we identified.  For example, the Cumberland Main Post Office in Maryland, which we  visited, had four entries in FDB\u2014one for the Main Post Office and the  other three for other postal facilities in Cumberland that were incorrectly  linked to the main post office\u2019s address. The Postal Service corrected the  FDB entry for this facility when we brought this problem to the Postal  Service\u2019s attention, but the problem remains at other locations. For  example, the Lubbock Main Post Office, which was discussed previously  (see table 1), was incorrectly linked to multiple facility entries within the  Facility Management System. The error occurred because FDB lacks  internal controls, such as edit checks, to prohibit postal staff from linking  an FDB facility to multiple facility entries in the Facility Management  System. According to Postal Service officials, there were 762 facilities in  FDB as of September 2007 that were mistakenly linked to multiple Facility  Management System facility entries.", "Third, we found that some of the errors in FDB were caused by local  employees entering incorrect information directly into FDB. Although  information on a facility\u2019s address, size, and ownership is fed  automatically into FDB from the Address Management and Facility  Management Systems, other data are entered manually into FDB by local  postal employees. For example, local employees enter the number of retail  windows (e.g., sales areas) at each facility and the number of those  windows that are typically staffed. Our analysis revealed that local  officials make numerous mistakes entering this and other information into  FDB. For example, 509 retail postal facilities are listed in FDB as staffing  more retail windows than reportedly exist at the facility. Implementing an  edit check in FDB would eliminate this type of reporting error. As shown  in figure 3, FDB data on vacant, leasable space entered by local employees  are also often in error."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Postal Service Has Taken Actions to Improve FDB Data, but Problems Remain", "paragraphs": ["While postal officials are aware of errors in FDB and have taken several  actions to improve the quality of the data, these actions have not yet  corrected all of the problems we identified. First, in response to a 2006  recommendation by the Postal OIG, the Postal Service has started  requiring local employees to validate and correct FDB data periodically for  their facilities. While this validation process could, in our view, help  identify and correct some of the errors we found, the Postal Service\u2019s  validation completed in February 2007 was not entirely successful for a  number of reasons. Specifically, mistakes that could have been corrected  locally were often not corrected. For example, the retail postal facility  data available as of May 2007, that had been validated by a postal  employee on February 7, 2007, indicated the facility staffed twice as many  retail windows as exist at the facility. We discussed this data discrepancy  with Postal Service officials, and they corrected the facility\u2019s FDB entry.  While this specific discrepancy was corrected, our assessment of FDB  data as of July 7, 2007, identified 354 instances of this problem. However,  even if local employees corrected these and other inaccuracies, problems  would remain because local employees cannot correct errors in FDB fed  directly from other systems, such as Facility Management System data on  square footage and ownership status. Errors of this type can only be  corrected by personnel administrating the Facility Management or Address  Management Systems.", "Second, to avoid manual linking errors and to improve the accuracy of the  linkage used to create FDB facility entries, postal officials are planning to  automatically link the Address Management and Facility Management  Systems\u2019 facility entries. According to the Postal Service, Address  Management System administrators must first apply the standard facility  naming convention used by the Facility Management System and thus  create a unique identifier for linking facility entries in the Address  Management and Facility Management Systems. Automation could help  reduce the frequency of future linking mistakes, but the Postal Service  must correct existing errors before automating the process. Postal officials  had expected to begin correcting existing errors in October 2006; however,  as of September 2007, the effort has not yet begun.", "Finally, the Postal Service responded to a Postal OIG recommendation  for improving the quality and completeness of data entered into FDB by  completing field training sessions for FDB users and issuing a new FDB  user\u2019s guide in 2007.

Postal Service officials said none of the Postal Service\u2019s  facility databases, including FDB, were designed for these purposes. In  addition, they noted the Postal Service is not bound by the executive order  on federal real property asset management and, consequently, is not  required to adopt leading federal practices, such as the implementation of  performance measures.

While there is some evidence that many  postal facilities are in less than acceptable condition, the magnitude of the  challenge is unknown. To learn more about the condition of all its  facilities, the Postal Service has started implementing self-assessments  conducted by local employees for small facilities and more intensive  assessments for larger facilities. Numerous Postal Service officials told us  that insufficient funding has caused the Postal Service to focus solely on  urgent repairs\u2014instead of routine, preventive maintenance\u2014which could  lead to more costly repairs over time.

Postal officials also said several years of underfunding have caused postal  facilities to deteriorate and many are in need of repairs. Evidence  supporting the officials\u2019 statements includes a 2005 assessment conducted  by a contractor of 651 randomly selected owned and leased postal  facilities. According to this assessment, two-thirds of the facilities were in  less than \u201cacceptable\u201d condition, including 22 percent that were in \u201cpoor\u201d  condition. However, the Postal Service will not know the magnitude of  the deterioration or the extent of its maintenance backlog until it fully  assesses the condition of all its facilities.", "In 2007, to begin assessing the condition of its facilities, the Postal Service  requested local employees to conduct self-assessments of their facilities.  Local employees responded to the request by assessing over 29,000  facilities and identifying 73,500 maintenance needs estimated to cost $236  million. While these assessments provide additional information on the  condition of postal facilities, they are not comprehensive because  thousands of facilities were not assessed and the local employees are not  formally trained to conduct facility assessments.", "Over the next 3 years, the Postal Service plans to conduct a more  comprehensive, three-part program to assess the condition of all its  facilities. The first part of the program involves facilities that are less than  6,500 square feet.

The second part of the program involves facilities with  6,500 to 100,000 square feet of interior space. For these facilities, the  Postal Service plans to conduct more detailed condition assessments once  every 3 years using contract building inspectors beginning in the summer  of 2007. According to Postal Service officials, the Postal Service  established the 6,500-square-foot threshold because the most complicated,  important facilities are generally larger.

In addition, according to the Postal OIG, insufficient  funding for repairs and maintenance may be hampering the Postal  Service\u2019s ability to adopt a preventive maintenance approach. A 2000  Postal OIG report described the Dallas Downtown Station in Texas as  deteriorated and attributed its deterioration to deferred maintenance that  \u201cincreased the risk of injury to Postal Service employees and customers,  and has compromised Postal Service property and the safety and security  of the mail.\u201d The Postal OIG recommended immediate evacuation of the  facility until needed repairs could be made. When we visited the Dallas  Downtown Station in 2007, the Postal Service had repaired the facility at a  cost of $12 million. The Postal Service may have avoided some of those  costs if it had done more preventive maintenance. Other facilities we  visited had not yet been repaired\u2014including facilities with chronically  leaking roofs and visible interior and exterior damage.

This approach is  consistent with a recommendation made by the National Research Council  of the National Academies in 1990 that suggested federal agencies  regularly assess the condition of their facilities and do preventive  maintenance to avoid costly future repairs. A reactive maintenance  approach is ultimately more expensive, partly because it shortens the  useful life of equipment and facilities and necessitates, among other  things, more costly future repairs.

The Postal Service\u2019s three-part assessment  program will provide data on the condition of its facilities, but the Postal  Service will not be able to prioritize repairs strategically since it does not  capture data on its facilities\u2019 importance, utilization rate, and annual  operating costs to inform its maintenance decisions. For example, a Postal  Service official who is responsible for managing maintenance throughout a  large geographic area told us that he cannot consider a facility\u2019s  importance to the Postal Service\u2019s mission when prioritizing maintenance  projects because the Postal Service does not capture this information.", "Furthermore, the Postal Service does not currently know the replacement  value of its facilities\u2014essential information for evaluating a facility\u2019s  overall condition.

The consequences of not considering a  facility\u2019s importance, utilization rate, and annual operating costs were  evident at the Downtown Fort Worth Station in Texas, which we visited.  The Postal Service spent about $1 million to repair it in fiscal year 2006  even though the station remains in deteriorating condition, is largely  vacant, and does not appear critical to the Postal Service\u2019s mission since  the remaining retail and carrier functions could be housed elsewhere in a  smaller facility.

Thus, in its 2006 annual report, the Postal  Service indicated it had contracts with almost 4,000 private operators to  provide access to postal retail services. While contract postal units are  not always located in underserved areas, our analysis shows that their  presence increased access to postal services in hundreds of counties  nationwide. Without contract postal units, these counties would have had  fewer retail facilities than the average for counties of comparable  population, land area, and degree of urbanization.

The Postal Service places a  facility on emergency suspension when, among other reasons, severe  maintenance problems create health or safety risks to employees and  customers that require the Postal Service to vacate the facility. Other  reasons for an emergency suspension include the retirement or resignation  of a community\u2019s sole postal employee; a building owner\u2019s decision not to  renew the Postal Service\u2019s lease; or a forced evacuation due to fire, flood,  or other natural disaster. When a postal retail facility is placed on  emergency suspension, the district has 90 days to decide whether to  reopen, close, or consolidate the facility. However, the actual closure can  take years. Specifically, 44 of the 159 facilities under emergency  suspension that were slated for closure as of May 2007 have had their  operations suspended for more than 5 years. In addition, it is not clear  what criteria local managers apply when deciding whether to reopen or  close a facility that is on emergency suspension. We visited one of these  stations, the McKeesport Central Station in Pennsylvania, which had been  on emergency suspension for over a year following a partial roof collapse  in December 2005 (see fig. 11). The local postmaster told us the Postal  Service planned to reopen the station once the landlord repaired the roof,  even though the sole employee assigned to the station has been  reassigned, customers have not complained about the lack of service, the  station had low revenue, and the station is located approximately 1 mile  from the McKeesport Main Post Office.", "In locations where demand for postal services is low (as measured by low  revenue), the Postal Service sometimes chooses to reduce operating costs  by reducing the staffing to just one postal employee\u2014an approach that  could place postal employees at risk unless the Postal Service installs  needed security upgrades.

The sole  employee at another postal station we visited in Indiana complained in a  2001 letter to her supervisor about the lack of postal-identified security  measures, such as security cameras, at her facility. Six years later, no  actions have been taken to install additional security measures, such as a  video-monitoring system or a pull-down gate to help secure the front  register when the employee goes to other areas of the station.

To implement this goal, in 2002, the Postal  Service lifted a moratorium on closing retail postal facilities but has not  (1) provided a definition for \u201credundant, low-value\u201d retail facilities; (2)  established a goal for their reduction; or (3) identified unneeded facilities  for possible closure, including those with low revenue. According to  Postal Service officials, pursuing retail facility reductions is difficult  because of legal restrictions on and political pressures against closing  retail facilities. For example, legal restrictions preclude the Postal Service  from closing a small post office solely because it is operating at a deficit.  To close a post office, the Postal Service is required to, among other  things, formally announce its intention to close the facility, analyze the  impact of the closure on the community, and solicit comments from the  community.", "While the Postal Service closes some retail facilities placed on emergency  suspension, its reliance on other factors, such as the loss of a lease or  severe maintenance problems, to drive decisions about closing retail  facilities is inconsistent with leading federal practices which call for a  targeted, criteria-based approach to closure decisions.

While considering these criteria  is essential for rightsizing a facility network, the Postal Service cannot  consider them because it does not capture the data needed to do so.  During our review, we visited a number of postal facilities that appeared to  merit consideration for closure based on one or more of these criteria.  Furthermore, none of these facilities housed carriers or mail processing  functions and each had low sales and was located near other retail  facilities. Our site visits included the following types of facilities in urban  locations:    Facilities that contribute little to the Postal Service\u2019s mission of  providing universal access to postal services. For example, Station C in  downtown Dallas, Texas, provides access to postal services only for the  people that work in the secured federal building, and the station is located  just 1 half-mile from another retail facility in downtown Dallas.  Consequently, Station C\u2019s annual retail sales of about $282,000 in fiscal  year 2007 ranked among the lowest in the Dallas District.", "Facilities in poor condition. We observed maintenance issues at a  number of postal stations that do not appear critical to the Postal Service\u2019s  mission based on their low revenue and proximity to other retail facilities.  For example, the Postal Service recently renewed the lease for the  Wilkinsburg Station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, even though the facility\u2019s  fa\u00e7ade is starting to pull loose from the building, the roof has numerous  leaks, and sewage backs up throughout the facility\u2019s plumbing system.

To date, FDB has failed to serve as a reliable system for  inventorying postal facilities or for measuring their performance, and its  weaknesses are so great that it cannot be reliably used for basic facility  management purposes, such as the Postal Service\u2019s annual reporting.  While efforts are under way to improve FDB, it remains unreliable and  unusable for measuring performance. Instead of solving the Postal  Service\u2019s problem of having multiple, overlapping databases, FDB appears  to have compounded the problem by adding an additional data source to  those already available.", "Postal officials with responsibility for facility maintenance at the national,  area, district, and local levels said that the Postal Service has underfunded  its maintenance for years and suspects that this underfunding has resulted  in deteriorating facilities and a large maintenance backlog. However, the  Postal Service does not know the extent of the problem because it has not  comprehensively tracked and analyzed data on the condition of its  facilities. This situation may be changing because the Postal Service has  recognized the importance of compiling data for facility maintenance and  has initiated a comprehensive facility assessment. Conducting a  comprehensive facility assessment is a necessary first step toward  improving the condition of postal facilities, but it will initially add tens of  thousands of new maintenance projects to the Postal Service\u2019s  maintenance backlog.

In locations where new services are  needed, the Postal Service is developing alternative access options to  avoid new facility costs, but it has not identified or closed unnecessary  postal retail facilities. Moreover, although the Postal Service has set a goal  of shifting 40 percent of its retail sales to alternative access options, it has  not set any similar targets for reducing its vast network of post offices,  stations, and branches. Instead, it relies on emergency suspensions and  staffing reductions to curtail operations at some facilities. However, this  approach does not conform to leading federal practices because the  closures are not linked to the facilities\u2019 performance. In addition, the  staffing reductions potentially place the remaining postal employees at  risk. The expected increase in the use of alternative access options,  combined with financial necessity, suggests the need to consider  additional closures of brick-and-mortar postal facilities.

Prior to our visits, we identified potential data reliability  problems and, during our visits, documented information related to the  existence and causes of those problems. In addition, we corroborated our  observations on FDB reliability issues through interviews with and  documentation obtained from postal officials in the Delivery and Retail  department. To determine the reasons for the data reliability issues in  FDB, we interviewed Postal Service personnel in the Delivery and Retail  department responsible for managing the facilities data, local postal  officials, and postal officials from the Postal OIG. We also reviewed key  Postal Service documents related to the facilities data, including the FDB  user\u2019s guide, the Postal Service\u2019s 2002 and 2006 Transformation Plans, and  reports issued by the Postal OIG and GAO. Our analysis was based  principally on the FDB data as of October 5, 2006, but we also analyzed  FDB data obtained on July 7, 2007, in part, to assess the impact of the  Postal Service\u2019s efforts to improve FDB since October 6, 2006. To identify  examples of leading federal practices related to our objectives, we  reviewed Executive Order 13327: Federal Real Property Asset  Management, related documentation from the Federal Council, and  previous GAO reports. We also interviewed a Federal Council official and  attended a Federal Real Property Association conference in 2006 that  focused on the implementation of the executive order.", "To assess the Postal Service\u2019s progress in overcoming the challenge of  maintaining its facilities in adequate condition, we analyzed data drawn  from the Postal Service\u2019s maintenance tracking system (the Facility Single  Source Provider) as of March 7, 2007. We assessed the reliability of the  data by (1) interviewing knowledgeable Postal Service officials and (2)  validating the accuracy of the data at the facilities we visited. We also  observed conditions at the 58 facilities we visited and interviewed local  postal officials. Additionally, we analyzed key Postal Service documents  related to facility maintenance, including the Postal Service\u2019s Strategic  Transformation Plan for 2006 through 2010, presentations related to its  facility assessment effort, and an audit report issued by the Postal OIG.", "To assess the Postal Service\u2019s progress in overcoming the challenge of  aligning access to retail services with customer needs, we assessed the  variance in access to retail postal facilities among similar counties using  an ordinary-least squares regression model. We designed the model to  predict the number of postal retail facilities (main post offices, stations,  branches, and contract units) in each U.S. county based on each county\u2019s  population (in 2000), land area (in square miles), and degree of  urbanization (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau). First, we determined  the number of retail facilities in each county by conducting a unique  address analysis, which counted only one retail facility at each address  within FDB to avoid counting the same retail facilities more than once.  The regression coefficients from the regression model are presented in  table 2.", "The R-squared statistic, an indicator of model fit or explanatory power,  was 0.79. This means the model explains 79 percent of the variation in the  number of post offices between counties. We performed various model  specification and diagnostic tests to determine the appropriateness of our  model specifications (e.g., interaction effects and degree of urbanization  as dummy variables), as well as to determine the existence and influence  of outliers. We identified two potential outliers, but did not eliminate them  from our analysis because they did not materially affect our results.", "To determine the variation in the number of postal retail facilities between  counties, we examined the residuals from the ordinary-least squares  regression model. The residuals consist of the difference between the  actual number of postal retail facilities and the number predicted by the  model. The number predicted by the model can be considered the average  number of facilities offering postal retail services in counties of similar  population, land area, and degree of urbanization because the model, in  deriving the estimates, considers these factors across all 3,213 counties in  the United States and Puerto Rico. We then rank ordered the counties on  the difference between the actual and the predicted number of postal  retail facilities from low to high (i.e., from fewer than predicted to more  than predicted). For the map in figure 7, we considered the top 10 percent  of counties in this rank order as having more post offices than comparably  sized and populated counties and the bottom 10 percent of counties as  having fewer post offices than comparable counties. We limited this  portion of our analysis to counties with an urban center of at least 10,000  people\u2014defined as metropolitan and micropolitan areas\u2014because the  Postal Service may need to maintain more postal retail facilities in these  areas to fulfill its mission of providing universal access to postal services.  We interviewed postal officials at the facility, district, area, and  headquarters levels about how retail facilities are aligned with customer  needs and obtained documentation relating to alternative service options  and emergency suspensions that resulted in facility closures. We also  reviewed key Postal Service documents, including the policies and  procedures for closing postal facilities, federal regulations governing  postal facility closures, the Postal Service\u2019s 2002 and 2005 Transformation  Plans, audit reports issued by the Postal OIG, and previous GAO reports.", "We conducted our work from July 2006 through December 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Postal Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Postal Service\u2019s letter dated  November 19, 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The Postal Service stated that FDB is a repository of facility  information and that it was never intended to be a single, consolidated  source for information on facilities. The agency\u2019s September 2006 FDB  briefing to us appears to dispute this point. At that time, postal officials  indicated that the agency had intended to create \u201cone source of  information for tracking all aspects of our  facilities\u201d to address,  among other matters, the high cost of maintaining inaccurate and  redundant databases. Notwithstanding our prior understanding, we  clarified our report, indicating that FDB was intended to be a  \u201cconsolidated\u201d source for accurate facility data\u2014not a \u201csingle,\u201d  consolidated data source.  2.  The Postal Service questioned a statement in our report which  indicated that several internal (postal) organizations \u201cdo not use FDB  for aggregate facility information, partly because of concerns about its  reliability.\u201d More specifically, the agency inquired whether we had  drawn this conclusion on the basis of the various data sources used to  compile the Postal Service\u2019s 2006 annual report. While the variety of  data sources used in the annual report\u2014none of which were  exclusively FDB\u2014is illustrative of our point, our statement was  principally based on interviews with numerous officials throughout the  Postal Service\u2019s major departments.  3.  The Postal Service correctly noted that, after researching multiple data  sources, its staff was able to provide explanations for specific  examples of data reliability issues\u2014including reasons for identified  mistakes\u2014that we brought to their attention. Although these  explanations appeared plausible, as discussed in our report, without  additional site visits, we cannot determine whether their explanations  were accurate. Most importantly, however, regardless of whether the  identified mistakes could be explained using other data sources\u2014the  fact remains that FDB contains errors that need to be corrected if it is  to retained and used as a reliable source of agency data.  4.  The Postal Service indicated that it would benefit tremendously if we  shared information on all of the specific examples of data reliability  issues we used in this report. We appreciate the Postal Service\u2019s desire  to improve the reliability and usefulness of FDB and, therefore,  suggest that the Postal Service replicate our statistical analyses on  current data by, among other standard analytical methods, sorting its  current FDB data according to each facility\u2019s name, address, and type  in order to identify duplicate facility entries. If needed, we could also  meet to further discuss our analytical methods for analyzing the Postal  Service\u2019s data.  5.  As discussed in the body of this report, we continue to believe that  measuring and tracking performance in such areas as a facility\u2019s  importance, utilization, condition, and operating costs are critical to  effective facility management. Nevertheless, because we also  recognize that the Postal Service\u2019s business and mission are unique, we  revised these recommendations to emphasize that the Postal Service  should develop performance measures that may better meet its  needs\u2014as long as the measures are consistent with the spirit of those  developed by the Federal Council.  6.  The Postal Service disagreed with our statement that it focuses \u201csolely  on urgent repairs at the expense of routine, preventive maintenance.\u201d  While we removed \u201csolely\u201d from the applicable sentence in this report,  this statement was based on evidence obtained during interviews with  numerous postal employees involved with facility maintenance at the  national, area, and local levels. All of these individuals stated that  resource constraints have forced the Postal Service to focus on urgent  repairs and to defer routine or preventive maintenance projects.  Furthermore, the interviewees\u2019 comments were consistent with  findings in a prior Postal OIG review which found that insufficient  budgeting for repairs and maintenance may be hampering the Postal  Service\u2019s ability to proactively manage its maintenance.  7.  As discussed in the body of this report, we agree that developing  criteria for identifying unneeded retail facilities is difficult and that  such criteria cannot be uniformly applied to the universe of all postal  retail facilities. As a result, we clarified our recommendation to  indicate that the results of a criteria-based approach would \u201cassist\u201d in  identifying candidate retail facilities for closure. Furthermore,  although the Postal Service does not currently envision developing  such a criteria-based approach as part of its congressionally required  facility plan, we continue to believe that doing so would provide an  excellent opportunity for the agency to begin pursuing its 2002 goal of  identifying and closing redundant, low value retail facilities.  8.  We are not intending to imply that in order to be viable, a facility must  meet minimum revenue thresholds established for the Postal Service\u2019s  Automated Postal Centers. As discussed in our report, this threshold  was $198,000 in fiscal year 2007. We included information on this  threshold simply as context for the amount of revenue generated by  some of the postal retail facilities we visited\u2014all of which were in  urban areas. While we agree that the threshold the Postal Service  applied to the deployment of automated postal centers is not  necessarily applicable to its retail facilities, the Postal Service has not  established criteria based on revenue or any other criteria for  analyzing the performance of its retail facilities. The absence of such  action is among the reasons we are recommending that the Postal  Service institute a proactive, criteria-based approach to help identify  and close unneeded retail facilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Kathleen Turner, Assistant  Director; Michael Armes; Richard Bakewell; Keith Cunningham; Bess  Eisenstadt; Kathy Gilhooly; Brandon Haller; Anne Izod; Dorothy Yee  Leggett; Josh Ormond; and Minette Richardson made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
