Of those beneficiaries who were eligible,  about 186,000 (59 percent) transferred their prescriptions from a retail  pharmacy to mail order for medications covered for the pilot. DOD did not  have data on the number of eligible pilot beneficiaries who transferred  their prescriptions from a retail pharmacy to an MTF pharmacy.  Beneficiaries who did not participate in the pilot did so for reasons such  as obtaining an override, which is an approval to refill a prescription for a  covered medication at a network retail pharmacy when not available  through mail order.", "ESI reports these numbers at the end of each month to DOD and updates them as  prescriptions are processed for the pilot.

Particularly in light of the absence of a systematic evaluation of the pilot  and its implications for the full expansion, such monitoring is important in  identifying and addressing problems that may occur as beneficiaries  transition their covered medications from retail to mail order or MTF  pharmacies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To be able to identify and address problems that may occur and thus help  ensure a smooth transition, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  require the Defense Health Agency ensure that planning documents for  the expansion include specific requirements to continuously monitor  affected beneficiaries, including whether  covered medications are available and filled in a timely and accurate  manner through mail order and across MTF pharmacies; and beneficiaries are satisfied with the transition to mail order and MTF  pharmacies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our audit  findings and conclusions, as well as our recommendation that planning  documents for the expansion should include requirements to monitor  affected beneficiaries, including the availability of covered medications,  the timeliness and accuracy of prescriptions filled, and the satisfaction of  beneficiaries with mail order and MTF pharmacies. DOD\u2019s comments are  reprinted in Appendix II.", "DOD commented that the experience and lessons learned from the pilot  were included in developing the pharmacy contract requirements to  expand the program. Subsequent to sending the draft report to DOD for  comment, the pharmacy contract was modified on September 3, 2015 to  include requirements for the expansion. Upon our review of the modified  contract, we found that the requirements related to the expansion did not  require the separate monitoring of the timeliness and accuracy of  prescriptions filled for beneficiaries directly affected by the expansion who  are transitioning from retail to mail order. We maintain that DOD would  benefit from monitoring performance separately for these affected  beneficiaries. This population, which takes maintenance medications for  chronic conditions, may represent a different profile of prescriptions than  for all mail-order beneficiaries. Therefore, this population may experience  timeliness and accuracy differently than do all mail-order beneficiaries.  Without monitoring performance data separately, it may not be clear to  what extent any issues identified through DOD\u2019s monitoring efforts may  be different for this population, especially during the initial transition from  retail to mail order.", "DOD also commented that after the expansion occurs beneficiary  satisfaction with mail order will continue to be measured as it was done  previously through a survey of all TRICARE mail-order pharmacy users.  However, as we reported, the results of this survey of all TRICARE mail- order pharmacy users may not represent well the satisfaction of sub- populations, such as affected beneficiaries. Also, as we reported, DOD  officials who monitor this satisfaction survey said they do not recommend  generalizing the survey results for multiple reasons, such as being unable  to determine representativeness of the survey respondents. We maintain  that DOD should separately survey the satisfaction of affected  beneficiaries with mail order given that this population may have different  characteristics than those of all mail-order beneficiaries generally, and  those differences may be associated with satisfaction. Without assessing  the satisfaction of affected beneficiaries, DOD will not know whether  these beneficiaries faced any difficulties in obtaining their covered  medications, which is important to know during transitions of care.", "Finally, DOD commented, that there is no indication based on workload  data, that affected beneficiaries will choose to use MTF pharmacies once  the expansion occurs. In addition, DOD commented that MTF pharmacies  will continue to individually monitor their own performance and beneficiary  satisfaction according to individual performance standards. However, as  we discuss in the report, DOD officials told us that the workload model  does not specifically track pilot beneficiaries\u2019 use of MTF pharmacies to  predict how the expansion could affect MTF pharmacies\u2019 workload. Given  that there are 416,000 additional beneficiaries expected to be affected by  the expansion and that their use of MTF pharmacies could be different  than the use for all TRICARE beneficiaries generally, we maintain that  DOD would benefit from systematically monitoring affected beneficiaries,  including across MTF pharmacies. Without doing so, DOD will not know if  affected beneficiaries encountered difficulties in obtaining covered  medications.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and other interested parties.

The $120 million estimate represented projected cost  savings from the transfer of prescriptions for brand maintenance  medications from retail pharmacies to either TRICARE\u2019s mail-order  pharmacy program or a military treatment facility (MTF) pharmacy. The  $123 million estimate represented cost savings from the transfer of  prescriptions for covered brand maintenance medications (hereafter  referred to as covered medications) from retail pharmacies to TRICARE\u2019s  mail-order program for the period February 15, 2014 through   February 28, 2015.", "DOD\u2019s projected cost savings for the pilot. DOD officials told us that  they made some assumptions about the transfer of prescriptions for  brand maintenance medications from retail pharmacies to mail order or  MTF pharmacies in calculating the projected cost savings of $120 million  for a calendar year. DOD assumed that cost savings would be the same if  they repriced these retail prescriptions to reflect the cost at mail order or  at MTF pharmacies because the average cost of a brand maintenance  medication was about the same at both, based on a model that DOD  developed. For the purposes of calculating projected cost savings, DOD officials told us that they assumed that 100 percent of the retail  prescriptions would transfer to mail order, but told us the projected cost  savings would have been about the same if they assumed that less than  100 percent of retail prescriptions were transferred to mail order (e.g., if  90 percent were transferred to mail order and 10 percent were transferred  to MTF pharmacies).", "To develop the projected cost savings of $120 million, DOD officials  explained that they used data from the fourth quarter of 2012 to determine that  approximately 800,000 prescriptions for brand maintenance  medications were filled by beneficiaries aged 65 years and older at  retail pharmacies, determined the retail cost for each of these prescriptions, typically  filled for a 30-day supply, including ingredient cost, dispensing fees  and administrative fees,  converted the retail cost of these prescriptions from a 30-day supply  to the cost for a 90-day supply (e.g., the ingredient cost for a 30-day  supply at a retail pharmacy of $10 would have been $30 for a 90-day  supply at a retail pharmacy), determined what the cost would have been for these prescriptions if  they had been filled through mail order, typically filled for a 90-day  supply,  calculated the difference in the copayment that a beneficiary paid at a  retail pharmacy to the copayment for mail order,  calculated the total cost savings for filling these 800,000 prescriptions  at mail order instead of at retail pharmacies: retail cost less mail-order  cost and copayment difference. Any manufacturer refunds for brand  maintenance medications filled through retail pharmacies also were  taken into account. This yielded a savings of about $40 million per  quarter.", "DOD officials explained that after accounting for factors such as  beneficiaries using the courtesy refills at retail and receiving waivers to  not participate in the pilot, they assumed that about 75 percent of the   $40 million quarterly savings would be achieved. Therefore, they  projected that the pilot would save about $30 million per quarter, or   $120 million for a calendar year.", "Express Scripts Inc.\u2019s estimate of cost savings for the first year of  the pilot.

Any manufacturer refunds   for brand maintenance medications filled through retail pharmacies  were also taken into account. This resulted in a savings of about   $132 million.  subtracted an administrative fee DOD pays ESI to transfer each  prescription from retail pharmacy to mail order through its call center.  According to a DOD official, the administrative fee to transfer  prescriptions from retail pharmacies to mail order is an initial  discretionary cost that DOD chose to incur to ensure a smooth  transition for beneficiaries. After subtracting the $9 million  administrative fee related to the transfer of prescriptions through ESI\u2019s  call center, the net cost savings for the pilot through mail order was  $123 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Debra A.
