Since the implementation of optimal manning, the Navy reduced crew sizes, which decreased the associated personnel costs for most ship classes, even as crews were partially restored. However, increased maintenance costs offset the reductions in personnel costs, as shown below. Navy officials attributed maintenance cost increases to reduced crews, longer deployments, and other factors.

The Navy continues to use an outdated standard workweek that may overstate the amount of sailor time available for productive work. Although the Navy has updated some of its manpower factors, its instruction does not require reassessing factors to ensure they remain valid or require measuring workload while ships are in port. Current and analytically based manpower requirements are essential to ensuring that crews can maintain readiness and prevent overwork that can affect safety, morale, and retention. Until the Navy makes needed changes to its factors and instruction used in determining manpower requirements, its ships may not have the right number and skill mix of sailors to maintain readiness and prevent overworking its sailors.", "Moving forward, the Navy will likely face manning challenges as it seeks to increase the size of its fleet. The fleet is projected to grow from its current 274 ships to as many as 355 ships, but the Navy has not determined how many personnel will need to be added to man those ships. In addition, as the Navy has gained experience operating its new ship classes, their crew sizes have grown and may continue to do so.

The optimal manning initiative, introduced as a pilot  program on a cruiser and destroyer in 2001 and implemented fleet-wide  on other surface and amphibious ships beginning in 2003, was intended  to improve efficiency. Initially, optimal manning levels were often derived  by changing watchstanding requirements. As an example, the number  of watchstanders required to serve as battle station phone operators and  stretcher bearers was reduced, and, as a result, 10 positions were  removed from ships with these positions. Other watchstations were  consolidated or eliminated. Between 2003 and 2007, the Navy transferred  some administrative workload from ship to shore personnel, which further  reduced the size of ship crews. This corresponding effort, known as Pay  and Personnel Ashore, had the effect of moving two-thirds of the  personnel specialist positions responsible for these administrative  functions from ship crews to shore support units. To further drive down  ship crew sizes, the Navy changed workload assumptions and the  equation used to determine manpower requirements in 2002. For  example, it increased the Navy standard workweek from 67 to 70  productive hours per sailor, which further reduced shipboard manning by  up to 4 percent.

The  center recommended increasing the allowance from 15 percent to 30  percent of the total preventive maintenance man hours on a ship, and the Navy began implementing this change in 2013. Navy manpower officials  found that, over the years, changes to regulations, instructions, and basic  safety requirements had increased the time it takes for sailors to perform  duties associated with this allowance. In addition, the Office of the Chief  of Naval Operations directed Navy manpower officials to update the  productivity allowance, which accounts for delays arising from fatigue and  work interruptions, among other factors. They increased the allowance  from a range between 2 and 8 percent of productive work requirements to  a range between 2 and 20 percent for selected ship classes. This  change to the productivity allowance accounts for a new measure of  mental fatigue associated with monitoring technology.

In 2002, the Navy changed the portion of the  standard workweek allocated for sailors to perform productive work,  which is used, in part, to determine manpower requirements and calculate  the size of the crew. By increasing the time allotted for productive work  in a standard workweek, the Navy reduced the number of personnel on its  surface and amphibious ships. In 2010, we found that the Navy had  adjusted the workweek without sufficient analysis, and we recommended  that it reassess the standard workweek to assure that the Navy was  appropriately sizing ship crews. The Department of Defense (DOD)  agreed with our recommendation. In 2014, the Navy conducted a study of  the standard workweek and identified significant issues that could  negatively affect a crew\u2019s capabilities to accomplish tasks and maintain  the material readiness of ships, as well as crew safety issues that might  result if crews sleep less to accommodate unaccounted for workload.", "The Navy study found that sailors were on duty 108 hours a week,  exceeding their weekly on-duty allocation of 81 hours. This on-duty time  included 90 hours of productive work\u201420 hours per week more than the  70 hours that is allotted in the standard workweek. This, in turn, reduced  the time available for rest and resulted in sailors spending less time  sleeping than was allotted, a situation that the study noted could  encourage a poor safety culture.

Navy manpower  calculations do not include on-the-job training, and it is not accounted for  in the 7 hours allocated for training in the standard workweek. Navy  officials and crew members we interviewed told us that sailors often arrive  to their assigned ship without adequate skills and experience. Crew  members in 10 of the 12 crew interviews we conducted told us that more  experienced sailors routinely provide on-the-job training for less  experienced sailors, so the time doing this must come out of sleep,  personal time, or other allotted work time. In addition, Navy officials said  that the time allocated for administrative and other duties should be  greater, because it does not account for all of a sailor\u2019s collateral duties.  Similarly, the 2014 Navy study concluded, among other things, that the  Navy lacked support for the time needed for some workweek  components, and recommended that they be better supported by  documentation.", "However, as of February 2017, the Navy had not taken action to validate  the standard workweek, as we and its own study had recommended.  Navy officials said that they had not taken any action in response to the  2014 study\u2019s recommendations because the study\u2019s narrow scope of  three ships limited its applicability across the fleet. OPNAV Instruction  1000.16L specifies the total time available to accomplish the required  workload, which is a key element in the calculation of manpower  requirements. According to the Navy instruction, the process for  determining the manpower necessary to perform the required workload is  to be based on a validated and justifiable technique; that is, it should be  analytically based. Without an analytically based standard workweek that  accounts for all of the work that a sailor is expected to do, the Navy runs  the risk of negatively affecting the condition of the ship, overworking  sailors, and adversely affecting morale, retention, and safety.", "The Navy instruction does not require the factors used to develop ship  manpower requirements to be reassessed periodically or when conditions  change. The effect of this absence is that inaccurate factors can persist  in developing manpower requirements. Factors and allowances are used  to calculate manpower requirements; thus, if these factors are inaccurate,  the resulting manpower requirement will be inaccurate. Our prior work  found that the changes the Navy made to several of these factors in 2002  were not substantiated with analysis. As a result, the Navy was using  these unsubstantiated factors for at least a decade without reassessment,  leading it to underestimate its manpower requirement and underman its  ships, and the Navy found that reductions in crew sizes over the optimal  manning period adversely affected ship condition. Prior to recent  reassessments of the make ready / put away allowance and productivity  allowance, some factors had not been reassessed and updated in  decades\u2014even though there had been changes to how the Navy trains,  operates, and uses technology that affected the validity of these factors.  Navy officials told us that part of the reason they had not reassessed the  factors until directed to do so is that the relevant Navy instruction does  not require that they be reassessed periodically or when conditions  change, and they explained that having up-to-date factors would be  useful to ensure that sailor workload could be accurately captured. If  there was a requirement to reassess these factors, then the  unsubstantiated changes made to them in 2002 may have been corrected  sooner and some of the negative effects of the resulting undermanned  crews could have been curtailed or avoided. Additionally, a reassessment  requirement could prevent inaccurate factors like the standard workweek  from continuing to be used across the fleet. The Navy estimated in 2017  that if it were to revert to the analytically based standard workweek in  effect before 2002, more than 1,200 additional sailors would be required  across the surface fleet.", "A memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness states that, when developing strategic manpower plans,  manpower officials shall assess how changes to roles, missions, and  management strategies will affect workloads and require a change to the  manpower, and that manpower officials shall be consulted concerning  manpower adjustments, including changes to missions, priorities, and  technologies. DOD Directive 1100.4 states that it is DOD policy that new  policy shall be evaluated before implementing to decide its effect on  manpower and personnel performance. The directive further states that  existing policies, procedures, and structures shall be periodically  evaluated to ensure efficient and effective use of manpower resources.  Unless the OPNAV instruction used by the Navy to develop its manpower  requirements requires that the factors be reassessed periodically or when  conditions change, the Navy manpower requirements model will not  reflect changes in training, technology, or regulations that occur over time  and that affect sailor workload. Requiring that these factors be  reassessed periodically or when conditions change would help ensure  that they are accurate and current, and result in more accurate manpower  requirements.

We recommended that the Navy include the relative magnitude of in-port  and at-sea workload in its assessment of the underlying assumptions and  standards it uses to calculate manpower requirements, and DOD agreed  with this recommendation.", "During our current review, we found that in-port workload is still not  captured in the process and is a persistent problem for crews, who must  complete this workload with fewer sailors than when at sea, and whose  time is also in demand for addressing other in-port priorities. The Navy  has not measured in-port workload and therefore cannot determine the  manpower requirements needed to execute this workload. Navy  operational capability documents describe the in-port period as the time  for the crew to accomplish required maintenance; take maximum  advantage of training; and be provided the maximum opportunity for rest,  leave, and liberty. Officers and enlisted personnel from all 12 of the crew  interviews we conducted told us that sailors were overworked in port.  Sailors consistently said that there were fewer crew members in port than  during deployment, because sailors were attending training and taking  leave, or because the Navy was prioritizing the manning of ships on  deployment over ships in port. For example, one ship department had 5  crew members while in port compared with 10 to 12 crew members  during deployment, so workload had to be redistributed among the  remaining sailors. In addition, sailors from a supply department said that  their workloads on the ship were the same when in-port and when on  deployment, but there were fewer sailors available in port to execute the  workloads. As in our 2010 review, crew members cited Anti-Terrorism  Force Protection watchstanding requirements as creating additional  training and work demands on them, and added that standing these  watches in port comes at the expense of their other work. Both officers  and enlisted personnel told us that ship crews are stressed and  overburdened during in-port periods because they must stand watch and  cover the workload of multiple sailors. Crew members told us that when  they returned from deployment, this additional workload placed a strain  on them and their families, affecting crew member morale.", "During the course of our review, in December 2016, Navy manpower  officials began a study on the nature and amount of in-port workload; they  are scheduled to complete this study in July 2017.

The Navy\u2019s commands responsible for manning, equipping,  and training the surface fleet have cited the lack of personnel available to  be distributed to ships as their primary challenge. Unfilled positions on  ship crews and in shore support positions result in workload that must be  redistributed among the remaining crew and also represent skills and  abilities that are absent from a crew, exacerbating the risks associated  with smaller authorized crews. Officials said that it is not uncommon for  billets to remain unfilled for 6 months or more and that shore commands  are more likely to experience such \u201cgapped billets\u201d for even longer  periods.", "A 2014 Naval Audit Service report examined critical gapped billets, based  on a concern that shortfalls among senior enlisted personnel made it  impossible to meet shipboard manning requirements. The report found  that the Navy has taken actions to reduce gapped billets, but the issue  persists. As a result, gapped billets continue to exist, sailors may be  required to work longer hours to make up for gapped billets, and junior  sailors may not be receiving needed supervision. The report concluded,  among other things, that unless the Navy increases enlisted personnel,  recurring gaps will not be corrected.", "Given the continued demand for ships to support combatant  commanders, the Navy plans to increase its fleet from 274 ships (as of  March 7, 2017) to 308 ships by 2021. As of March 2017, the Navy had an end strength of 323,197 active-duty personnel. According to the Navy,  this number is expected to remain largely flat through 2021, even though  an increasing number of ships are entering the fleet. Navy officials have  expressed concern about the growing gap between end strength and ship  numbers, and said that the Navy would have to increase its end strength  in order to adequately man its ships. Figure 9 shows the Navy\u2019s projected  end strength and fleet size.", "The Navy has also identified the need for an even larger fleet, which  would add to personnel needs and costs. Specifically, the Navy released  an updated Force Structure Assessment in late 2016 that called for a  355-ship fleet to meet global threats\u2014a 15 percent increase from the  previous 308-ship goal and a 30 percent increase from the size of its  current fleet. In a February 2017 report, the Congressional Research  Service estimated the additional shipbuilding costs that would be needed  over a 30-year period based on the Force Structure Assessment, but  added that these additional shipbuilding funds are only part of what would  be needed to achieve and maintain a 355-ship fleet instead of 308-ship  fleet. According to DOD, operating and support costs\u2014which include  personnel and maintenance costs\u2014have traditionally constituted about  70 percent of a ship\u2019s total life-cycle costs. Our analysis has shown that  personnel costs were the largest share of total operating and support  costs for surface ship classes between fiscal years 2000 to 2015 (see  app. VIII for total ship operating and support costs).", "The underlying cause for this apparent ship\u2013personnel mismatch is that  the Navy is seeking to grow its fleet but is not fully assessing the  personnel implications of the growth. Navy officials told us that it mans its  ships and all other positions within its approved end strength, but has not  determined the number or cost of personnel needed to man the  increasing number of ships or made concrete plans for adding the needed  personnel. The personnel needs will be significant. The Congressional  Research Service estimated that about 15,000 additional sailors and  aviation personnel might be needed to man the 47 additional ships above  the previous 308-ship plan. Plans to grow the fleet further to 355  ships\u2014and our findings that manpower validation processes are based  on questionable assumptions that likely understate personnel needs\u2014 could further exacerbate the mismatch. However, the Navy has not fully  assessed whether the service will need increased end strength and, if so,  how much. Navy officials told us that if overall Navy end strength is not  increased, the billets would likely have to be taken from other  organizations as new ships are delivered, potentially continuing to  perpetuate the gapped billets challenge.", "Our prior work has shown that identifying needed resources and  investments is a key characteristic that helps to establish a  comprehensive, results-oriented management framework to guide  implementation of plans and strategies. This activity includes identifying  what a strategy will cost and the sources and types of resources and  investments associated with the strategy. According to Navy officials, in  order to compensate for the lack of distributable personnel who would be  needed to fill all manpower requirements within the current end strength,  they currently prioritize which positions to fill and which to keep unfilled in  order to maintain a permissible level of risk and readiness in the surface  fleet. As the Navy continues to update ship manpower requirements  based on recent changes to the factors and allowances used to calculate  them, these requirements are likely to increase. Already-strained  manpower resources will be even more stressed as the Navy  commissions increasing numbers of ships without a commensurate  increase in personnel.

However,  crew sizes on most new ship classes have grown over time as anticipated  workload reductions from new technologies have not materialized and the  Navy gains more experience operating the new ships. These  technologies include networks that integrate ship systems to allow for  remote monitoring, redesigned propulsion systems on some ships, and  extensive use of automation to relieve crews of some manual work;  however, some of these technologies are still not fully developed, tested,  or fielded and remain immature. As a result, crew sizes have grown to  allow sailors to do this manual work.", "For example, crew sizes for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Zumwalt- class destroyer (DDG 1000), and San Antonio\u2013class Amphibious  Transport Dock (LPD 17) have increased since these ships entered  service, as shown in table 2, and LCS and DDG 1000 have reached the  upper limits for crew size as laid out in their acquisition strategies. Navy  officials acknowledged that LCS and DDG 1000 crew sizes have grown  due to the inadequacy of the original manpower assumptions coupled  with additional mission requirements to support ship operations. The new  Ford-class aircraft carrier (CVN 78) has not yet entered service, and its  crew size so far remains within the Navy\u2019s targets\u2014currently 663 sailors  below that of legacy Nimitz-class carriers. However, some planned  features of the ship that were expected to reduce workload have been  canceled, and delays in developing and testing some of the new  technologies on the ship create unknowns about their ability to enable a  smaller crew. See appendixes III, IV, V, and VI for specific information on  each new ship class.", "The LCS program illustrates how crew size can grow over time as the  Navy gains operational experience with the ship class and its new  technology. The Navy originally designed and built these ships to  accommodate a total crew size of 75, but gradually increased the ships\u2019  crews as it gained more experience operating them, and has since had to  redesign the ships to accommodate 98 sailors\u2014a 31 percent increase. As  of March 2017, three of the Navy\u2019s nine LCS ships have been deployed  overseas. Automation and the use of condition-based maintenance have  not decreased workload as they were intended to do, and the unreliability  of shipboard systems has led to major equipment failures and  unanticipated corrective maintenance. Officers and enlisted crew  members told us that the LCS\u2019s minimally sized crews are challenged to  complete their workload. In 2014, we found that the LCS program had a  number of manning challenges and that without validating the crew size  and composition for all LCS crews and without accounting for the full  scope and distribution of work performed by sailors across all ship  departments, the Navy risked that crew fatigue would exceed Navy  standards and could negatively affect crew members\u2019 performance as  well as morale, retention, safety, and ultimately the operational readiness  of the ship class.", "In response to LCS manning and other challenges, the Navy conducted a  program review in 2016 and announced changes to the ships\u2019 crewing  and other operational concepts that are now being implemented across  the program. LCS officials told us that some of the program changes are  meant to alleviate the heavy workload of LCS sailors. Specifically, the  Navy has formed LCS maintenance execution teams to assist with heavy  in-port workload, build organic expertise, decrease dependence on  maintenance contractors, and serve as a pool of qualified sailors who can  fill in for unplanned losses in LCS crews. Officials responsible for  implementing program changes told us that they are in the process of  determining the composition of LCS integrated crews, and are using all  available inputs and information to determine the best mix of sailors.  However, Navy manpower officials have yet to validate these changes to  the LCS crewing concept, and delays in LCS mission module  development and testing do not allow for them to validate needed crew  size and composition since the modules are immature.", "Navy officials told us they validate manpower requirements for new ship  classes after testing is complete and the first ship of the class has been  deployed. Most new ship classes have unvalidated manpower  requirements due to lack of operational experience or system immaturity.  Table 3 summarizes the status of manpower requirement validation for  new ship classes with reduced crews.", "As noted above, crew sizes on three of the Navy\u2019s four new ship classes  have grown partly because the technologies in use have not led to the  expected reductions in workload. In the case of LCS and LPD 17, the lack  of physical space limits the ability of the crews to grow further without  significant redesign of ship interiors. The DDG 1000 crew has reached its  upper crew size target, but program officials have said that the ship could  accommodate additional sailors as the ship gains more operational  experience\u2014if it is determined that they are necessary. CVN 78 crews  may also grow until technologies meant to reduce workload and crew  sizes mature. Until technologies on new ships are mature and  demonstrate their ability to decrease workload, crew sizes on new ships  may continue to grow, placing further pressure on the Navy\u2019s resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["During the optimal manning period of the early 2000s, the Navy made  changes to its manpower requirements process that were intended to  drive down crew sizes and thus save on personnel costs. However, these  changes were not substantiated with analysis. The result was that with  fewer sailors operating and maintaining surface ships, the material  condition of the ships declined, and this effect ultimately contributed to  increased overall operating and support costs. The Navy has reassessed  and reversed some of the changes it made during the optimal manning  period, but it continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect  the actual time sailors spend working, and the Navy still does not account  for in-port workload\u2014both of which may be leading to sailors being  overworked and creating a readiness and safety risk. In addition, the  Navy\u2019s guidance does not require that the factors used to calculate  manpower requirements be reassessed periodically or when conditions  change to ensure that these factors remain valid and crews are  appropriately sized. A requirement to reassess these factors would help  ensure that they stay current and analytically based, and would provide  the Navy a sound basis for its manpower requirements. Looking to the  future, the Navy plans to grow its fleet as much as 30 percent but has not  determined how many personnel will be needed to man the larger fleet or  what these personnel will cost. As the number of ships increases\u2014and if  crew sizes continue to grow on new ship classes\u2014the Navy will be  challenged to distribute its sailors across the fleet without an increase in  personnel.

However, as we found in 2015, these  approaches can also contribute to higher maintenance costs over the  long term. Specifically, we found that ships homeported overseas incur  higher operating and support costs than U.S.-homeported ships, and that  some of these ships have had consistently deferred maintenance that  resulted in long-term degraded material condition and increased  maintenance costs. Our 2015 analysis also showed that homeporting  ships overseas provides additional time in a forward area of operations  and additional deployed under way time compared to ships homeported  in the United States, but that the additional time provided was primarily  because training and maintenance periods are shorter than those  provided for U.S.-homeported ships.
