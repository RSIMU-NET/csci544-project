GAO found that VHA's suicide prevention media outreach activities declined in recent years due to leadership turnover and reorganization. For example, the amount of suicide prevention content developed by VHA's contractor for social media decreased in fiscal years 2017 and the first 10 months of 2018 after increasing in each of the 4 prior years.", "VHA officials reported not having leadership available for a period of time to make decisions about the suicide prevention media outreach campaign.

VHA\u2019s first such  contract began in 2010; however, the Federal Acquisition Regulation only  requires federal agencies to maintain contract documentation for a period  of 6 years after the last payment.

Specifically, suicide is  associated with risk factors that exist at the individual level (such as a  history of mental illness or substance abuse, or stressful life events, such  as divorce or the death of a loved one), community level (such as barriers  to health care), or societal level (such as the way suicide is portrayed in  the media and stigma associated with seeking help for mental illness).  According to VA, veterans may possess risk factors related to their  military service, such as a service-related injury or a difficult transition to  civilian life. CDC reports that protective factors\u2014influences that help  protect against the risk for suicide\u2014include effective coping and problem- solving skills, strong and supportive relationships with friends and family,  availability of health care, and connectedness to social institutions such  as school and community.", "VA\u2019s 2018 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention identifies four focus  areas: (1) healthy and empowered veterans, families, and communities;  (2) clinical and community preventative services; (3) treatment and  support services; and (4) surveillance, research, and evaluation.

VHA officials estimated that  they would spend a total of $1.5 million on suicide prevention paid  media for fiscal year 2018 and indicated that the remaining funds  would be de-obligated from the contract at the end of the fiscal  year and not used for suicide prevention media outreach. VHA  officials indicated that the reason they did not spend the remaining  funds on suicide prevention paid media in fiscal year 2018 was  that the approval of the paid media plan was delayed due to  changes in leadership and organizational realignment of the  suicide prevention program. As a result, VHA officials said they  limited the paid media outreach in fiscal year 2018 to activities that  were already in place, including 25 keyword search  advertisements, and 20 billboards and 8 radio advertisements in  selected cities across the United States.", "In prior fiscal years, VHA conducted a variety of digital and out-of- home suicide prevention paid media.

VHA filled the role temporarily with a 6-month detail from another  agency from October 2017 through March 2018 and then hired this  individual as the permanent director on April 30, 2018. VHA officials that  worked on the campaign told us they did not have leadership available to  make decisions about the suicide prevention campaign during this time.  For example, VHA officials said they did not have a kick-off meeting  between VHA leadership and VHA\u2019s contractor at the beginning of fiscal  year 2018\u2014a requirement of the contract\u2014because there was no  leadership available to participate in this meeting.", "The officials also reported that suicide prevention leadership was not  available for weekly meetings to discuss suicide prevention outreach  activities, even after the suicide prevention program obtained an acting  director on detail from another agency. VHA staff said that at that time,  they focused their suicide prevention media outreach efforts on areas that  did not require leadership input, such as updating the VCL website. The  absence of leadership available to provide direction and make decisions  on the suicide prevention media outreach campaign is inconsistent with  federal internal control standards for control environment, which require  agencies to assign responsibilities to achieve its objectives. If a key role  is vacant, management needs to determine by whom and how those  responsibilities will be fulfilled in order to meet its objectives.", "Officials that worked on the campaign told us they shifted their focus  away from the suicide prevention media outreach campaign toward the  mental health outreach campaign due to reorganization of the offices  responsible for suicide prevention activities in 2017. Specifically, under  the new organization, and in the absence of suicide prevention program  leadership, the officials began reporting directly to mental health program  leadership and became more focused on the mental health outreach  aspects of the contract. Following the reorganization, officials that  worked on the campaign did not have a clear line of reporting to the  suicide prevention program. This is also inconsistent with federal internal  control standards for control environment, which require agencies to  establish an organizational structure and assign responsibilities, such as  establishing lines of reporting necessary information to management.", "VHA officials told us that one of the highest priorities for the suicide  prevention program since the beginning of fiscal year 2018 was to  establish a national strategy for preventing veteran suicides. The national  strategy, issued in June 2018, includes suicide prevention outreach as  one of the strategy\u2019s 14 goals. The national strategy also emphasizes  VHA\u2019s plans to shift to a public health approach to suicide prevention  outreach. The public health approach focuses less on raising awareness  of the VCL and more on reaching veterans before the point of crisis.  VHA officials told us they have been trying to shift to a public health  approach since 2016. Some of the campaign themes and messages have  reflected this shift; for example, the \u201cBe There\u201d campaign theme that was  adopted in fiscal year 2016\u2014and has remained the theme since\u2014 emphasizes the message that everyone has a role in helping veterans in  crisis feel less alone and connecting them to resources. However, VHA  officials told us in May 2018 that they were just beginning to  conceptualize what the suicide prevention outreach campaign should look  like moving forward. Leadership officials also said that while they were  developing the national strategy, they delegated the responsibility for  implementing the suicide prevention outreach campaign to other officials  working on the campaign.", "The decline in VHA\u2019s suicide prevention media outreach activities over  the past 2 fiscal years is inconsistent with VA\u2019s strategic goals, which  identify suicide prevention as the agency\u2019s top clinical priority for fiscal  years 2018 through 2024.

Doing so would  help VHA evaluate whether the campaign has been effective in raising  awareness of VHA\u2019s suicide prevention resources. Further, creating  targets for these additional metrics need not be arbitrary, because VHA  could use information about how its metrics performed in the past to  develop reasonable and meaningful targets for future performance.
