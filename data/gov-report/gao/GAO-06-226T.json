In establishing OIOS in 1994, the General Assembly passed a resolution stating that OIOS should exercise operational independence in carrying out its oversight responsibilities and that the Secretary-General should take into account the independence of the office in preparing its budget. The Secretariat's budget office--over which OIOS has oversight authority--exercises control over OIOS's regular budget, which may result in conflicts of interest and infringe on OIOS's independence. In addition, UN budgeting processes make it difficult for OIOS to reallocate its regular budget resources among OIOS locations worldwide or among its three oversight divisions--internal audit; investigations; and monitoring, evaluation, and consulting services--to meet changing priorities. OIOS officials provided us with several examples of work funded through the regular budget that they were unable to undertake due to resource constraints. In addition, OIOS does not have a mechanism in place to identify or justify OIOS-wide staffing needs, except for peacekeeping oversight services. OIOS also lacks control over its extrabudgetary resources, which comprise 62 percent of its overall budget in fiscal biennium 2004-2005. The UN funds and programs that OIOS oversees maintain control over some of these resources since OIOS negotiates its terms of work and payment for services with the managers of the programs it intends to examine. If the entity does not agree to an OIOS examination or does not provide sufficient funding for OIOS to carry out its work, OIOS cannot adequately perform its oversight responsibilities. The United Nations has made progress in improving the clarity of its procurement manual but has yet to fully address previously identified concerns affecting the lack of openness and professionalism of its procurement system. Specifically, concerns remain relating to an independent bid protest system, staff training and professional certification, and ethics regulations. In 2002, the United Nations revised its procurement manual, which now provides staff with clearer guidance on UN procurement regulations and policies, including more detailed step-by-step instructions of the procurement process than it had when we reported in 1999. However, the Secretariat has yet to enhance the openness of the procurement system by heeding a 1994 recommendation by outside experts that it establish an independent bid protest process. At present, vendors cannot file complaints with an independent official or office if they believe that the UN Procurement Service has not handled their bids appropriately. As a result, senior UN officials may not be made aware of problems in the procurement process. In addition, the United Nations has not fully addressed longstanding concerns affecting the professional qualifications of its procurement workforce. The Procurement Service is developing a new training curriculum and a professional certification program. It has trained some procurement staff as instructors but has yet to complete training curricula. In addition, the United Nations still needs to develop the individual training profiles necessary to determine the extent of its training requirements. A June 2005 report by an independent contractor indicated that most headquarters procurement officers and procurement assistants do not possess professional procurement certifications. According to the contractor, the level of certification was low in comparison to other organizations. Further, the United Nations has yet to adopt several internal proposals to clarify UN ethics regulations for procurement staff and vendors, such as a code of conduct."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss internal oversight and  procurement in the United Nations (UN).

OIOS  was established to assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling internal  oversight responsibilities over UN resources and staff. The stated mission  of OIOS is \u201cto provide internal oversight for the United Nations that adds  value to the organization through independent, professional, and timely  internal audit, monitoring, inspection, evaluation, management consulting,  and investigation activities and to be an agent of change that promotes  responsible administration of resources, a culture of accountability and  transparency, and improved program performance.\u201d The office is headed  by an Under Secretary-General who is appointed by the Secretary-General  for a 5-year fixed term with no possibility of renewal. The Under  Secretary-General may be removed by the Secretary-General only for  cause and with General Assembly approval. OIOS\u2019s authority spans all UN  activities under the Secretary-General, namely the UN Secretariat in New  York, Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna; the five regional commissions for  Africa, Asia and the Pacific, West Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the  Caribbean; peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations in various  parts of the world; and numerous UN funds and programs, such as the  United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), United Nations Human  Settlements Program (UN-HABITAT), and the Office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).", "The UN Procurement Service is located within the UN Secretariat\u2019s  Department of Management, at the UN headquarters in New York City. As  of August 2005, the Procurement Service had a staff of 71 personnel that  included 21 procurement officers, 5 associate procurement officers, and 24  procurement assistants. The Procurement Service manages procurement  for the UN Secretariat headquarters and procures air services and items  costing more than $200,000 for the Secretariat\u2019s peacekeeping and other  field missions. While it also provides procurement guidance and support to  UN personnel who procure goods and services in the Secretariat\u2019s  peacekeeping and other field missions, it does not directly supervise  them. Overall Secretariat procurement spending tripled between 1994 and  2004 as the number of UN peacekeepers in the field increased.", "Past reviews of the UN\u2019s procurement system have identified problems in  each of the six commonly identified characteristics that define an effective  procurement system. In 1999, we found that the United Nations had yet to  fully address these problems. The United Nations has retained a consulting  firm to assess the Procurement Service\u2019s financial and internal controls,  following the decision of a former procurement official to plead guilty to  federal charges involving his receipt of funds from firms seeking UN  contracts.

A General Assembly  resolution in the creation of OIOS stated that the new internal oversight  body shall exercise operational independence and that the Secretary- General, when preparing the budget proposal for OIOS, should take into  account the independence of the office. OIOS receives its funding from  two sources, the UN\u2019s regular budget and funds from the assessed  peacekeeping budget and voluntary contributions from funds and  programs subject to OIOS\u2019s oversight\u2014known as extrabudgetary  resources. UN rules and regulations preclude the movement of funds  between the regular budget and extrabudgetary resources. From 1996-1997  through 2004-2005, the number of staff funded by the regular budget has  been relatively flat while the number funded by extrabudgetary resources  has increased steadily. During that same period, OIOS\u2019s regular budget  increased from about $15 million to about $24 million; its extrabudgetary  resources grew from about $7 million to about $40 million. OIOS officials  stated that the increase in extrabudgetary resources has been largely due  to growth in oversight for UN peacekeeping (see fig. 1).", "The Secretariat\u2019s budget office\u2014over which OIOS has oversight  authority\u2014exercises control over OIOS\u2019s regular budget, which infringes  on the office\u2019s independence. In developing the biennium budget, the  Under Secretary-General of OIOS sends its biennial budget request to the  Secretariat\u2019s budget office for review. While OIOS can negotiate with the  budget office on suggested changes to its budget proposal, it has limited  recourse regarding the budget office\u2019s decisions. This process limits  OIOS\u2019s ability to independently request from the General Assembly the  resources it has determined it needs to provide effective oversight and  also poses a conflict of interest.", "UN budgeting processes make it difficult for OIOS to reallocate its regular  budget resources among OIOS locations worldwide or among its three  divisions\u2014internal audit; investigations; and monitoring, evaluation, and  consulting services\u2014to meet changing priorities.

This change was approved only after repeated requests by  OIOS over a number of years. In addition, although OIOS officials stated  that they routinely identify high-risk and high-priority audits and  investigations after the biennial budget has been determined, it is difficult  to mobilize the resources required to carry out the work.", "OIOS officials have stated that the office is under resourced, but they do  not have a mechanism in place to determine appropriate staffing levels or  to justify budget requests, except for peacekeeping oversight services.  Officials provided us with several examples of work funded through the  regular budget that they were unable to undertake due to resource  constraints. For example, although the Board of Auditors recommended  on several occasions that OIOS develop the capacity to perform more  information technology audits, OIOS officials said that they lack the  financial and human resources to do so. We found that OIOS does not  have a mechanism in place to determine its overall staffing requirements,  which would help justify requests for additional resources. On the other  hand, for peacekeeping audit services, OIOS has a metric\u2014endorsed by  the General Assembly\u2014that provides one professional auditor per $100  million annual peacekeeping budget. Although OIOS has succeeded in  justifying increases for peacekeeping oversight services consistent with  the large increase in the peacekeeping budget since 1994, it has been  difficult to support staff increases in oversight areas that lack a  comparable metric."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIOS Lacks Control Over Extrabudgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["OIOS lacks control over the extrabudgetary resources funded by UN funds  and programs. OIOS\u2019s reliance on extrabudgetary resources has been  steadily increasing over the years\u2014from 30 percent in fiscal biennium  1996-1997 to 62 percent in the last fiscal biennium, 2004-2005 (see fig. 1).  According to OIOS officials, the growth in the office\u2019s budget is primarily  due to extrabudgetary resources for audits and investigations of  peacekeeping. OIOS is dependent on UN funds and programs and other  UN entities for resources, access, and reimbursement for the services it  provides. Heads of these entities have the right to approve or deny funding  for oversight work proposed by OIOS. By denying OIOS funding, UN  entities could avoid OIOS audits, and high-risk areas could potentially be  excluded from adequate examination. For example, we have previously  testified that the UN Office of the Iraq Program refused to fund an OIOS  risk assessment of its program management division.", "UN funds and programs limit OIOS\u2019s ability to independently set its work  priorities in that they exercise the power to decide and negotiate whether  to fund OIOS oversight activities and at what level. OIOS officials stated  that because of OIOS\u2019s budgetary structure, some high-priority work has  not been undertaken. For example, according to a senior OIOS official, the  office has not been able to adequately oversee the extrabudgetary  activities of many entities, particularly those based in Geneva. In addition,  the office also has not been able to oversee the UN Framework  Convention on Climate Change or the UN Convention to Combat  Desertification. OIOS reports that if funding is not forthcoming, OIOS may  have no choice but to discontinue auditing certain extrabudgetary  activities as of January 2006. In addition, in some cases, the fund and  program managers have disputed the fees OIOS charges for its services.  For example, 40 percent of the $2 million billed by OIOS after it completed  its work are currently in dispute, and since 2001, less than half of the  entities have paid OIOS in full for investigative services it has provided.

We reported in 1999 that such a process is an important aspect of  an open procurement system. A process that allows complaints to be  adjudicated by an independent office could promote the openness and  integrity of the process and help alert senior UN officials to the failure of  procurement staff to comply with stated procedures.", "The current UN bid protest process is not independent of the Procurement  Service.

In 1998, OIOS  reported that the majority of the 20 professional headquarters  procurement staff had procurement-related experience and were qualified.  However, OIOS also stated that field procurement staff had limited  procurement-related experience. In addition, OIOS reported that field-level  procurement practices were at high risk due to continuing problems in  training peacekeeping procurement staff in the field. In 1999, we reported  that the UN Secretariat procurement training program did not constitute a  comprehensive curriculum to provide a continuum of basic to advanced  skills for the development of procurement officers.", "The UN Procurement Service has acknowledged that more needs to be  done to train and certify procurement staff. It has developed basic and  advanced training curricula and provided training to staff at headquarters  and in the field during 2004 and 2005. However, although the training  curriculum covers several key topics in procurement, it does not provide  in-depth or comprehensive coverage of some topics. For example, the  training material does not include in-depth information on procurement  negotiation, which is of particular importance in light of UN plans to  renovate its headquarters complex.

It  recommended that the Procurement Service seek a larger budget.
