Although there are limitations to measuring the effects of the APTC using currently available data, surveys GAO identified estimated that the uninsured rate declined significantly among households with incomes eligible for the APTC. For example, one survey found that the rate of uninsured among individuals with household incomes that make them financially eligible for the APTC fell 5.2 percentage points between September 2013 and September 2014.This expansion in health insurance coverage is likely partially a result of the APTC having reduced the cost of health insurance premiums for those eligible. Among those eligible for the APTC who the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially reported selected a plan through a federally facilitated exchange or one of two state-based exchanges, the APTC reduced premiums by 76 percent, on average. As of January 2015, data were not yet available on the extent to which the APTC reduced 2015 premiums, although studies have found that, on average, premiums (before applying the APTC) changed only modestly from 2014 to 2015, though some areas saw significant increases or decreases.", "Most nonelderly adults had access to affordable health benefits plans\u2014as defined by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)\u2014but some may face challenges maintaining coverage. Most nonelderly adults had access to affordable plans through their employer, Medicaid, the exchanges, or other sources as of March 2014, although about 16 percent of nonelderly adults remained uninsured.

For those with incomes too high to qualify for the APTC, the affordability of health insurance coverage available in the individual exchanges in 2014 varied by age, household size, income, and location. For example, a 60-year-old with an income of 450 percent of the federal poverty level would have had to spend more than 8 percent of their household income for the lowest-cost plan in 84 percent of all health insurance rating areas in the United States, but a 27-year-old had access to an affordable plan in all but one.

However, results from an early  survey and experts we interviewed suggested that the APTC may have  been less effective in expanding health insurance coverage for individuals  financially eligible for a smaller APTC amount and ineligible for cost- sharing reduction subsidies than for individuals eligible for a larger APTC  amount as well as for cost-sharing reduction subsidies.", "As of January 2015, data were not available on the extent to which the  APTC reduced 2015 premiums for enrollees.

First, experts explained that the maximum amount of  the credit is targeted to very small employers, most of which do not offer  health insurance, and experts told us the size of the credit is not large  enough to be an incentive to employers to offer or maintain insurance.  The maximum amount of the small employer tax credit is available to for- profit employers with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees that pay  an average of $25,400 or less in wages. Such an employer could be  eligible for a credit worth up to 50 percent of the employer contributions to  premiums in 2014.

Second, the limited availability of the credit\u2014employers can claim it for  only two consecutive years after 2013\u2014further detracts from any potential  incentive for small employers that do not offer coverage to begin offering  coverage. Experts we interviewed told us that employers are reluctant to  provide a benefit to employees that would be at risk of being taken away  later when the credit is no longer available. Finally, experts told us that  the complexity of applying for the credit outweighed its benefit. According  to tax preparers and other stakeholders we interviewed for this and our  previous report, the complexity of the paperwork required to claim the  credit was significant, and small employers likely did not view the credit  as a sufficient incentive to begin offering health insurance, given the time  required to claim it.", "The trend in low take-up of the small employer tax credit is likely to  continue given the low enrollment in SHOPs, and thus it is unlikely that its  effects on coverage will change in the near future.

However, the effects of the APTC and the affordability  of health insurance in 2014 and beyond is uncertain for several reasons.  First, complete data on the number of people who claimed the APTC in  2014 and the amount of the APTC claimed are not yet available because  of the limited data reported from most state-based exchanges as well as  the lag time during which enrollees file taxes and IRS completes  reconciliation. Second, insurers will likely adjust premiums in exchange  plans as more data become available about enrollees in the exchanges,  including how the health profiles of exchange enrollees compares to that  of enrollees previously purchasing individual insurance or ESI. Thus,  trends for premiums in exchange plans may not stabilize for several  years, although PPACA established certain requirements intended to  reduce variation. Third, health insurance premiums are in large part  driven by the underlying costs of health care. While the rate of growth of  health care costs has slowed in recent years, there is no guarantee that  such a trend will continue.

Some experts stated that such a shift could encourage some employers  to discontinue offering health insurance. In particular, experts told us that  employers most likely to discontinue are those that employ a low-wage  workforce. These employers face less competition in attracting lower-paid  workers than higher-paid workers, so they have less incentive to offer  health insurance coverage to attract workers. Employers with more than  50 full-time equivalent employees that do not provide health insurance  coverage would be subject to the tax penalty on employers if any of their  employees obtain health insurance coverage through the exchanges with  assistance from the advance premium tax credit (APTC). One expert  commented that employers that cease offering health insurance may also  choose to compensate employees for the loss of health insurance by  increasing wages. Alternatively, one expert told us that employers that  choose to continue offering health insurance might adjust employees\u2019  compensation packages to account for an increase in the employer  contribution to health insurance premiums.
