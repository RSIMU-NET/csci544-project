Since their inception, 178 initiatives have been proposed by the participating laboratories and test centers but only 4--or 2 percent--were implemented under the pilot programs. Participants proposed initiatives covering a variety of areas, including business-like practices, partnerships, and human capital innovations. The pilot programs were not effective because DOD lacked an effective implementation process and proposed human capital initiatives were not consistent with statutory provisions. First, DOD did not provide standardized guidance on proposal requirements, coordinate proposals, or clarify decision-making authority for proposal review and approval. Furthermore, DOD did not designate a strong focal point to provide assistance and advice to participants and advocate process improvements. The lack of a strong focal point exacerbated other process gaps. Second, DOD attorneys advised that the pilot programs did not provide authority to make most of the proposed human capital changes. Implementation of the new 2003 pilot program faces several challenges. First, DOD has not addressed implementation problems. For example, clear guidance is still lacking and decision-making authority is still unclear. Second, the 2003 pilot program provides no change in authority concerning human capital initiatives. Finally, laboratories and test centers may be reluctant to participate. Many participants in the earlier pilots told us they were discouraged by their experience and consequently unwilling to repeat it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade a number of studies have raised concerns that  dwindling budgets and an aging workforce have contributed to serious  shortfalls in the infrastructure and capabilities of Department of Defense  (DOD) laboratories and test centers.

In fiscal year 2003,  the Congress extended the 1999 and 2000 pilot programs until 2005 and  enacted a new pilot program that runs until 2006. However, congressional  concerns about pilot program implementation have been growing.  Consequently, the Senate Committee on Armed Services directed us to  review the implementation of the 1999 and 2000 pilot programs.

To help conduct and manage this research, DOD has a diverse network  of 80 in-house laboratories and 26 test centers. Their missions range  from basic scientific research to direct technical support to operational  commands. The management, operations, and funding for these disparate  laboratories and test centers also vary among the services.", "Over the past decade, several organizations, panels, and commissions  have identified significant personnel and resource problems facing the  laboratories and test centers. For example, several studies found that  the laboratories needed more flexibility in personnel rules governing the  scientific workforce in order to attract and retain staff. Similarly, several  recent studies identified problems with declines in investment and  infrastructure, resulting in outdated facilities and technical equipment.", "To help the laboratories and test centers with these problems, the  Congress enacted legislation in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 establishing  pilot programs for laboratories and test centers to propose innovative  partnerships, business-like practices, and human capital initiatives. The  1999 pilot program focused on partnerships and business-like practices,  while the 2000 program focused more on human capital initiatives.  Together, the two pilot programs authorized the Secretary of Defense to  provide one laboratory and one test center in each service the authority to    explore innovative methods for partnering with universities and private  sector entities to conduct defense research and development;    attract a workforce balance between permanent and temporary personnel  and with an appropriate skill and experience level;    develop or expand innovative methods of operation that provide more  defense research for the dollar; and    waive any restrictions on these methods that are not required by law.", "A total of 10 laboratories and test centers from all 3 services participated  in the pilot programs. They are listed in appendix I.", "Both programs were authorized for 3 years. The 1999 pilot expired in  March 2002; the 2000 pilot, in March 2003. For both programs, DOD  was required to submit preliminary and final reports to the Congress  on program activities. The preliminary report for the 1999 program was  submitted in July 1999. However, as of the date of this report, the three  other reports have not been submitted.", "In fiscal year 2003, the Congress authorized another 3-year pilot program  and extended the 1999 and 2000 pilot programs until 2005. Under the new  2003 pilot program, the Secretary of Defense is to provide one laboratory  and one test center in each service the authority to    use innovative personnel management methods to ensure that the  participants can employ and retain an appropriately balanced workforce,  and effectively shape the workforce to fulfill the organization mission;    develop or expand innovative methods of using cooperative agreements  with private sector and educational organizations to promote the  technological industrial base for critical defense technologies and  facilitate the training of a future scientific and technical workforce; and    waive any restrictions not required by law.", "As of May 2003, DOD had not identified any participants for the 2003 pilot  program.", "The 2003 legislation also requires DOD to issue three reports, including  a January 2003 report on its experience with the 1999 and 2000 pilot  programs, barriers to implementation of these programs, and proposed  solutions to overcome these barriers.

Furthermore, the laboratories and test centers focused  on different types of initiatives. The laboratories more often proposed  human capital initiatives, while the test centers overwhelmingly focused  on business and partnership initiatives. Laboratory officials told us that  they are especially concerned about attracting top-quality scientists to  replace a retiring workforce. Test center officials told us that they are  focused on modernizing their infrastructure and developing new methods  of sharing the cost of operations.", "Proposals for business-like practices included many initiatives to  streamline or improve local operations. Some initiatives focused on  expanding the use of innovative techniques such as other transactions  or cooperative agreements. Several other proposals sought the authority  to reinvest fees or revenues into facilities revitalization. For example, one  Navy laboratory proposed imposing a surcharge for its services and using  that revenue to fund capital investments, and an Air Force laboratory  proposed using facility construction as a valid in-kind contribution under  cooperative agreements.", "Partnership proposals included initiatives such as collaborative research  agreements with Arnold Engineering Development Center and the  University of Tennessee Space Institute to create a formal business bond  to pursue research in laser-induced surface improvement technology and  university flight research.", "The Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center proposed a limited liability company.  Under this concept, industry, academia, and government would form a  profit-making company to conduct research and testing at the installation.  The test center proposed using its share of the profits to reinvest in the  infrastructure at Aberdeen.", "Several human capital initiatives focused on recruiting and retention  flexibilities as well as additional voluntary separation incentives.  These proposals included initiatives to streamline hiring of experts  and consultants; accelerate promotions for scientists and engineers;  provide retention bonuses for key scientists; and hire students directly  after graduation.

In contrast, 74 percent were blocked or dropped during the  review process or remain on hold awaiting resolution.", "The four implemented initiatives were    donating laboratory equipment directly to local schools,    waiving top-level certification of certain service agreements with    streamlining cooperative agreements to facilitate collaborative work  agreements with outside activities, and    granting temporary relief from some mandatory personnel placement  reviews.", "Officials at the laboratories that proposed these initiatives told us that they  were considered minor changes with little impact on the larger problems  facing the laboratories.", "Twelve times as many initiatives\u201424 percent\u2014were implemented  using different authorities than the pilot programs. For example, several  laboratories requested the authority to appoint retired military members  to civilian positions without having to wait the required 180 days. This  requirement was waived using a different authority than the pilot  programs. Another human capital initiative\u2014to appoint senior scientists  from private industry\u2014was authorized by subsequent legislation. In the  business/partnership category, the 46th Test Group at Holloman Air Force  Base used other authorities to negotiate a complex leasing arrangement  with industry to install a radar test facility at White Sands Missile Range.

Proposals often lacked  specificity and detail. Many were broadly conceptual or generic in nature  and lacked a detailed business case that linked their contribution to  overall objectives for the pilot programs. For example, a proposal to  permit scientists to serve in a leadership role in professional societies  failed to include details of the problems encountered, and the potential to  improve operations. Similarly, several proposals for direct hire authority  failed to include a business case to explain what specific needs this  authority would address or how it would address them. Lack of specificity  and business case detail led to the failure of many initiatives to win  approval. DOD attorneys told us that many proposals were so vague that it  was impossible to determine whether or not the proposed initiatives could  meet legal requirements.", "At a department level, DOD also did not coordinate or prioritize proposals,  thereby precluding decisions on how best to pursue common interests  and issues such as direct hiring authority or forming partnerships with  universities. Instead, each participant submitted proposals individually,  and thus multiple independent proposals were often submitted for the  same or similar issues. DOD attorneys pointed out that it would have  been more effective to group proposals by common theme and prioritize  them.

Stakeholders included military and  civilian leaders, attorneys, and human capital and personnel staff at  several levels: the local installation where participating laboratories and  test centers were housed; the individual service; and OSD. The roles  and decision-making authority of the various stakeholders were  never negotiated and clarified. As a result, many players at multiple  organizational levels had\u2014and took\u2014an opportunity to say \u201cno\u201d to a  particular proposal, but it remained unclear who had the authority to  say \u201cyes.\u201d", "For example, some participants believed that the pilot program legislation  gave the director of a participating laboratory or test center the authority  to approve a proposed initiative. OSD officials, however, believed that the  proposed initiatives had to be approved at higher levels. The role of the  services was also unclear. Some laboratory and test center directors  initially sent proposals directly to OSD\u2019s Directorate of Defense Research  and Engineering (DDR&E), bypassing their service headquarters. Others  sent proposals to their service headquarters for approval before  submitting the proposals to DDR&E. Eventually, however, each of the  service headquarters decided to become more heavily involved in the  approval process and provide service-level responses to proposals.  These service-level responses often came into play after proposals had  been sent directly to DDR&E for approval, further complicating the  approval process.", "Within OSD, both DDR&E and Personnel and Readiness (P&R) had  substantial stakes in the human capital proposals\u2014DDR&E because it  is charged with oversight and management of defense laboratories and  P&R because it has the authority within DOD for human capital issues.  However, DDR&E and P&R never agreed on a process for approving  proposals. In addition, for the past year P&R\u2019s attention has been focused  primarily on developing DOD\u2019s proposed new civilian human capital  management system, the National Security Personnel System (NSPS),  which the Secretary of Defense recently submitted to the Congress. DOD  officials believe that, if enacted, NSPS will provide flexibility to make  necessary human capital changes. The Undersecretary of Defense P&R  directed that implementation of new personnel initiatives be placed on  hold during the development of NSPS so that the existing system could be  studied to identify needs and best practices.

Several officials agreed that a strong  focal point would be helpful. For example, DOD attorneys stated that the  laboratories or someone acting as their focal point needed to define the  issues they wanted to resolve. The attorneys noted that a focal point  could have more successfully drawn upon their expertise and experience  with addressing legal challenges in other innovative programs  (e.g., demonstration projects).

Over  time, the Office of Personnel Management has added implementing rules  and regulations to the framework.

Rather, the  office advised that the pilot programs\u2019 authorities allow only for changes  that could already be accomplished under existing DOD regulations. In  other words, the pilot programs did not provide any new or additional  authority to waive existing personnel rules and regulations grounded in  title 5.
