GAO surveyed Corps officials on all 87 flood control projects identified by the Corps as budgeted for construction in any fiscal year from 2004 to 2012, selected 8 for further review covering each Corps division, reviewed project documents and Corps communication guidance, and interviewed Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) flood control projects budgeted for construction from fiscal years 2004 to 2012 experienced cost increases, including inflation. Specifically, 59 of 87 flood control projects during this period experienced increases from their original authorized cost to their current estimated project cost or their total expenditures at closeout, according to information provided by Corps officials. However, according to a Corps official, as of September 2013, no projects had cost increases that exceeded their maximum allowable cost as defined by law. Various factors other than inflation contributed to cost increases among the 8 projects GAO selected for further review. Factors included design changes, less than optimal federal funding, underestimated costs, and contract cost changes. For example, 6 of the 8 projects had design changes due to unforeseen site conditions and changes in design criteria following Hurricane Katrina. According to Corps officials, receiving less than optimal federal funding increased the costs of 3 of the 8 projects GAO reviewed. Corps officials also said that receiving less than optimal federal funding meant that 2 projects had to break up their work into smaller segments, and 1 project had to extend its completion schedule. The Corps has some efforts under way intended to better manage costs.", "The extent to which the Corps communicated with and provided updated information to nonfederal sponsors varied among the 8 projects GAO selected for further review. Specifically, Corps officials and sponsors told GAO that the Corps usually communicated Corps policy changes affecting projects by telephone or email as soon as they occurred. In addition, the Corps' communication with the sponsors on project scope and design changes was generally effective among the projects, according to Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors with whom GAO spoke. However, some sponsors told GAO the Corps was less timely in providing updated cost information. For example, a representative of one sponsor told GAO that the sponsor had not received the required quarterly cost report on a regular basis.", "The Corps has guidance regarding communication between the Corps and its nonfederal sponsors. Specifically, Corps guidance directs project delivery teams to develop a project management plan that includes a communications plan. However, GAO found that 3 of the 8 projects GAO reviewed did not have a communications plan as called for by guidance. Because the communications plan provides a framework for the Corps and nonfederal sponsors to establish a communications strategy and determine the needs of the project delivery team, without such a plan, the Corps may be missing opportunities to assess their communication needs. Developing such a plan may help Corps or sponsor staff understand the team's communications needs when they join the project delivery team; for projects where there is significant turnover, understanding the team's needs is especially important."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Corps take steps to ensure compliance with its guidance calling for communications plans.

Flood control  projects require congressional authorization and appropriations. The  Corps also typically receives funds from each project\u2019s nonfederal  sponsor, which may be a state, tribal, county, or local government or  agency. When Congress approves a flood control project for construction,  it authorizes a total cost for the project based on cost estimates prepared  by the Corps, and this authorized cost provides the basis for the project\u2019s  maximum allowable cost.

We also  interviewed officials at Corps headquarters and its cost engineering  center of expertise. The Corps identified 87 new or ongoing flood control  projects that were budgeted for construction in any fiscal year from 2004  to 2012, and we surveyed Corps officials associated with the projects to  obtain project cost estimates at key milestones, the current total project  cost or total expenditures at project closeout, and the primary reasons for  cost increases. We received responses from Corps officials for all 87  projects, for a 100 percent response rate. From those 87 projects, we  selected a non-probability sample of 8 projects that were budgeted for  construction in any fiscal year from 2009 to 2012 for further review. This  sample included 1 project randomly selected from each of 7 divisions  and 1 project judgmentally selected from the New Orleans District that  also met our selection criteria. The 8 projects were the Brays Bayou  project in Texas, the Little Calumet River project in Indiana, the Larose to  Golden Meadow project in Louisiana, the Monarch-Chesterfield project in  Missouri, the Muddy River project in Massachusetts, the Napa River  project in California, the Roanoke River Upper Basin project in Virginia,  and the Turkey Creek Basin project in Kansas and Missouri.

Located within the Department of  Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities.  Through its Civil Works program, the Corps plans, designs, constructs,  operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources projects for  purposes such as flood control, navigation, and environmental  restoration. The Civil Works program is organized into 3 tiers: a national  headquarters in Washington, D.C.; 8 regional divisions that were  established generally according to watershed boundaries; and 38 districts  nationwide (see fig. 1).", "Corps headquarters primarily develops policies and provides oversight.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the  President, establishes the policy direction for the Civil Works program.  The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, oversees the Corps\u2019 civil works  operations and reports on civil works matters to the Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works. The eight divisions, commanded by military  officers, coordinate civil works projects in the districts within their  respective geographic areas. Corps districts, also commanded by military  officers, are responsible for planning, engineering, constructing, and  managing projects in their districts. Districts are also responsible for  coordinating with the nonfederal sponsors, which may be state, tribal,  county, or local governments or agencies. Each project has a project  delivery team of civilian employees that manages the project over its life  cycle. The team is led by a project manager and comprises members  from the planning, engineering, construction, operations, and real estate  functions.", "In addition, the Civil Works program maintains a number of centers of  expertise to assist Corps division and district offices. One of these  centers is the Cost Engineering and Agency Technical Review Mandatory  Center of Expertise located in Walla Walla, Washington, which provides  technical support and assistance to the districts on cost engineering  issues, such as developing cost estimates and performing mandatory  agency technical reviews of cost estimates included in all decision  documents.", "The Corps\u2019 Civil Works program receives funding annually through the  Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act or an omnibus  appropriations act. These acts have typically appropriated a sum to each  civil works appropriation account, including investigations, construction,  and operation and maintenance, to fund projects related to the nation\u2019s  water resources. The funds appropriated to the Corps are \u201cno year\u201d  funds, which means that they remain available to the Corps until spent.

However, beginning with the fiscal year 2006 Energy and  Water Development Appropriations Act, Congress limited the use of the  Corps\u2019 continuing contract authority. In response, the Corps developed  new continuing contract clauses that limited the government\u2019s obligations  to only the funds available at a specific time for the contracts, as opposed  to any anticipated future funding, and required the contractor to stop work  when the available funds were exhausted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Developing Flood Control Projects", "paragraphs": ["The major steps in developing a flood control project are shown in   figure 2.", "Usually, the Corps becomes involved in flood control projects when a  local community perceives or experiences a flooding problem that is  beyond its ability to solve and contacts the Corps for assistance. If the  Corps does not have the statutory authority required for studying the  problem, the Corps must obtain authorization from Congress before  proceeding. Studies have been authorized through legislation, typically a  Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), or, in some circumstances,  through a committee resolution. Next, the Corps must receive an  appropriation to study the project, which it seeks through its annual  budget request to Congress.", "After receiving authorization and an appropriation, studies are conducted  in two phases: reconnaissance and feasibility. A Corps district office  conducts a reconnaissance study at full federal expense to determine if  the problem warrants federal participation in a feasibility study and how  the problem could be addressed. During this phase, the Corps also  assesses the level of interest and support from nonfederal entities that  may become sponsors. If the Corps determines that further study is  warranted, the district office typically seeks agreement from the local  sponsor to share costs for a feasibility study. The target for completion of  the reconnaissance phase is 6 to 12 months from initial obligation of  federal funds to a signed feasibility cost-sharing agreement.", "Cost sharing for feasibility studies for flood control projects is 50 percent  federal and 50 percent nonfederal. The cost of a feasibility study is  established through negotiation of the project management plan, which is  an agreement between the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor that  defines project objectives and project-specific quality control procedures.  The purpose of the feasibility study is to further investigate the problem  and make recommendations on whether the project is worth pursuing and  how the problem should be addressed. Corps guidance states that typical  feasibility studies should be completed in 18 to 36 months. According to  the Corps, the district office conducts the study and the needed  environmental studies and documents the results in a feasibility report  that includes a total project cost estimate based on the recommended  plan. The Chief of Engineers reviews the report and decides whether to  sign a final decision document, known as the Chief\u2019s Report,  recommending the project for construction. The Chief of Engineers  transmits the Chief\u2019s Report and the supporting documentation to  Congress through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and  the Office of Management and Budget. Congress may authorize the  project\u2019s construction in a WRDA or other legislation. When Congress  approves a flood control project for construction, it typically authorizes a  total cost for the project based on estimates prepared by the Corps.", "Most projects are authorized during the preconstruction engineering and  design phase. This phase usually overlaps with the feasibility phase. The  purpose of the preconstruction engineering and design phase is to  complete any additional planning studies and all of the detailed, technical  studies and designs needed to begin construction of the project. Once the  project has been authorized for construction and funds have been  appropriated, the district enters into a cost-sharing agreement with the  local sponsor. The degree of cost sharing required can vary by project  but, since the passage of WRDA 1986, construction costs of flood control  projects can be shared under a formula of 65 percent federal and 35  percent nonfederal. The Corps seeks funds to construct the project  through the annual budget process. After Congress appropriates funds,  the construction phase can begin. Construction is generally managed by  the Corps but performed by private contractors. During construction,  Congress may enact scope or cost changes.", "A flood control project can take many years to complete.

In addition, according to survey responses, 13 of  the 59 projects did not have 902 limits because the project (1) was  authorized before WRDA 1986, (2) had no authorized cost, or (3) had a  not-to-exceed limit, to which the 902 limit does not apply.

A  Corps flood control project can receive an increase in its authorized cost  in one of two ways. First, the Corps can submit a post-authorization  change report with a new total project cost estimate to Congress. Based  on this report, Congress can then reauthorize the project at a higher cost  in legislation, such as a WRDA. Second, Congress can also reauthorize a  project without having received a post-authorization change report from  the Corps. In either case, if the project\u2019s actual costs reach its 902 limit  before congressional action, construction must stop until the project gets  a new authorization that increases the project\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Contributed to Cost Increases on Eight Projects", "paragraphs": ["Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors from the eight projects selected  for further review identified various factors other than inflation that  contributed to cost increases on all eight of the projects. Some of these  projects were impacted by more than one factor. Appendix III contains  detailed information on the eight projects. The factors identified were as  follows:", "Design changes. Design changes due primarily to unforeseen site  conditions and changes in design criteria following Hurricane Katrina  contributed to increased costs on six of the projects we reviewed.  Specifically, on four projects, design changes occurred due to  unforeseen site conditions. Corps officials on the Turkey Creek project  said that a tunnel that could not be accessed prior to construction was  found to be in such poor condition that it had to have major  rehabilitation work performed. Work to fix the deteriorated tunnel cost  $10 million more than had originally been estimated. Corps officials  on the Little Calumet project said during construction they  encountered a former landfill along one portion of the river that had  not been discovered during the preconstruction site investigation. This  condition did not provide a usable foundation for a levee, so the  design had to be changed to convert the section from a levee to a  sheet pile wall. These changes increased costs by approximately  $645,000, according to a post-authorization change report dated  March 2012. On the Napa River project, after the initial designs were  completed in 1997, a vineyard was planted next to an area that had  previously been identified as a flowage easement. The Corps had to  analyze various alternatives and decided to build a levee encircling  the vineyard. Building this additional levee cost $200,000, but it was  able to serve as a disposal area for some of the material excavated  from the project. Finally, on the Roanoke River project, the sponsor  said that the Corps spent several years redesigning portions of the  project following the discovery of areas contaminated with hazardous  waste. Several sections of the project relating to river channels had to  be dropped as a result of the redesign.", "Other projects we reviewed had to have portions redesigned because  the Corps changed its design criteria following Hurricane Katrina.  Specifically, the Corps updated its guidance on the design of I-walls  used as flood barriers. On projects that were either in the design  stage or under construction, but with unconstructed features, officials  had to determine whether their designs met the new criteria. For  example, on two projects we reviewed, portions of the project had to  be redesigned to comply with the new criteria. Corps officials on the  Little Calumet project said that costs increased significantly because  the new criteria required the redesign of three sections of the project.  However, officials were unable to specify by how much costs  increased. According to a Corps official, detailed cost estimates of the  preliminary designs were not prepared. The official added that cost  estimates used during planning were initial estimates and did not  provide a reliable basis with which to compare the cost of the  redesigned sections. Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors of the  Larose to Golden Meadow project said the changes in design criteria  could significantly increase the costs to construct elements of the  project. Corps officials said they are in the process of preparing a  post-authorization change report and, therefore, could not provide an  estimate of the increases at the time of our report. Corps officials  expect the report to be completed in 2014.", "Less than optimal federal funding. According to Corps guidance, the  Corps is to include project funding in its budget submission at a level  that a project can use effectively and efficiently in a given fiscal year,  which we refer to in this report as optimal federal funding. Receiving  less than optimal federal funding increased the costs of three of the  eight projects we reviewed, according to Corps officials. Officials for  two projects\u2014Napa River and Turkey Creek\u2014said their projects  received less than optimal federal funding, so they had to break up  the work into smaller segments than initially planned. Officials added  that doing so was more costly because it required contractors to  mobilize and demobilize their construction equipment and crews more  frequently. A Corps official on the Turkey Creek project said that the  cost of issuing additional contracts could be quantified but that the  Corps does not specifically track these types of costs. The official said  that contracts have typically been issued in lump sums, so  mobilization and demobilization costs have not been explicitly broken  out. In addition, on the Napa River project, a Corps document cited  two instances when modifications were required for ongoing  construction contracts due to a lack of funding, which lengthened the  construction schedule and increased costs by about $12 million.  Similarly, Corps officials on the Larose to Golden Meadow project said  that, over the last several years, the project schedule had been  pushed back because the project had not been receiving optimal  federal funding. The officials added that over the 41 years that the  project has been under construction, they had not consistently  received enough funding, which had resulted in a longer completion  schedule and increased costs. Although the officials could not quantify  by how much, they said costs generally increased due to inflation and  higher material prices. For example, officials said that the cost of steel  sheet piling increased from $3.25 per square foot in 1963 to an  average $40.00 per square foot from 2006 to 2011.", "Underestimated costs. Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors of four  projects said that costs increased on their projects due to differences  between early Corps cost estimates and those developed later during  project design. For example, Corps officials on the Larose to Golden  Meadow project said that on one of the pumping plants, they initially  estimated a construction cost of $800,000. But after additional  analysis and geotechnical borings, and in order to handle the actual  site conditions, they redesigned the project features, which raised the  cost to $10.7 million. On the Muddy River project, nonfederal  sponsors said that the Corps\u2019 early cost estimates were too low  because the Corps used national averages that were lower than what  actual costs would be in the New England corridor where the project  was located. As a result, sponsors said that they developed their own  estimates for budgeting purposes of $78.5 million. However, a Corps  official said that the Corps adjusted for regional differences for cost  estimates prepared during the project. On the Brays Bayou project,  the nonfederal sponsor said that differences between the authorized  cost and the cost included in the initial project partnership agreement  resulted from the Corps\u2019 low estimates of land acquisition and  associated costs, pipeline costs, utilities, and bridge adjustments.  However, Corps officials attribute all cost increases since project  authorization to the change from a diversion element to a downstream  channel structure. Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors on the  Roanoke River project agreed that the project\u2019s original cost  estimates, which were used for authorization, were not realistic. Corps  officials said that the feasibility study conducted in the mid-1980s was  not done to the same level of detail as more recent studies. As a  result, the cost estimates developed in the feasibility study were not  as accurate as they could have been.", "Corps officials said they have taken actions to improve cost estimates.  For example, in 2007, the Corps established a cost engineering  center of expertise where, according to a Corps official, cost estimates  in decision documents supporting congressional authorization are  reviewed for accuracy and, in 2008, the Corps updated its cost- estimating guidance. Additional guidance issued in draft in 2009  further directs project delivery teams to perform a cost and schedule  risk analysis for all decision documents for projects requiring  congressional authorization with a total project cost estimate  exceeding $40 million, whereby specific cost risk analysis methods  are to be used to develop contingency. According to a Corps official,  performing a cost and schedule risk analysis allows the project  delivery team to identify high-risk areas that could impact a project\u2019s  cost or schedule, as well as areas for early mitigation efforts.", "Changes in contract costs. Corps officials said that differences  between contract estimates and actual contract awards can lead to  cost increases. On the Muddy River project, the Corps awarded a  contract for the first phase of the project that was $8 million higher  than the Corps\u2019 original estimate. A Corps official on the project  explained that the cost estimates used by contractors in submitting  bids for the project may have been based on a different set of  assumptions regarding such factors as the future cost of materials  and fuel. The Corps official added that this multiyear contract did not  have an escalation clause for increases in fuel or materials, so the  contractors likely made different assumptions to reduce their risk. In  addition, costs could be affected by contract modifications. For  example, on the Monarch-Chesterfield project, a Corps official said  that several modifications during construction accounted for increased  costs of approximately $1.2 million. Some of these modifications  included additional engineering support for a specialized railroad  closure structure, further design of a pump station, plan changes to  locate a fiber optic cable, and design changes to better accommodate  storm sewers.", "Natural events. Natural events, including flooding and hurricanes,  caused damage to two projects\u2014Turkey Creek and Larose to Golden  Meadow. Repairing the damage added to project costs. For example,  a Corps official on the Turkey Creek project said that, during the  construction of the tunnel, the bypass pipe system used to divert the  flow of Turkey Creek was repeatedly washed out due to flooding and  had to be replaced, which increased the total project cost by  approximately $3.5 to $4 million.", "Continuing contracts. Corps officials said that the policy change  limiting the use of continuing contracts increased costs on one  project. Corps officials on the Roanoke River project said that, as a  result of breaking the one contract into smaller contracts, costs  increased due to the loss of economies of scale. However, Corps  officials said they could not indicate by how much costs increased  because costs were not calculated for contracting scenarios that did  not occur.", "Additional analysis. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works required Corps officials on the Monarch-Chesterfield project to  analyze the probability of the project causing measurable flood  damages outside the protected area. The additional analysis delayed  the start of construction for almost 7 years, and the measures to  address flooding caused by the project added $13 million to the cost  of the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Has Some Efforts Under Way Intended to Better Manage Project Costs", "paragraphs": ["In a memorandum dated February 20, 2013, the Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works expressed concerns that civil works projects,  once authorized, did not appear to be managed for completion within  approved cost estimates and also identified a need for a systematic  approach to monitor and manage project cost increases, given continued  fiscal constraints. The memorandum stated that, without controls to  closely track and minimize cost increases on a year-to-year basis, more  projects would be in jeopardy of needing statutory increases in their 902  limits. Because of these and other concerns, the Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works requested information from the Corps that  included a proposed plan to manage and control costs in the future. In  response, in 2013, the Corps formed the Project Cost Management  Working Group, which identified several actions intended to better  manage costs, such as requiring formal high-level approval of changes  above appropriate thresholds and using formal processes and industry  best practices to reduce overall cost and project duration. A Corps official  said that the Corps developed an interim measure to identify projects that  have exceeded their authorized project cost and reasons for the cost  increase. However, the official said that this interim measure focuses on  those projects eligible for inclusion in the fiscal year 2015 budget  submission and projects in the fiscal year 2013 work plan. The official  said that determining how to integrate the interim measure into the  existing budget and execution processes is planned for fiscal year 2014."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which the Corps Communicated With and Provided Updated Information to Nonfederal Sponsors Varied", "paragraphs": ["For the eight projects we selected for further review, the extent to which  the Corps communicated with and provided updated information to  nonfederal sponsors varied.

Corps officials and nonfederal  sponsors for these projects told us that Corps district officials usually  notified the sponsors by telephone or e-mail as soon as the policy  changes were issued. In some instances, Corps officials also held  meetings to discuss the policy changes with the sponsors. For  example, Corps officials from one project told us they contacted the  sponsor directly to communicate the discontinuation of the use of  continuing contracts. The Corps was ready to award the continuing  contract but instead had to issue smaller contracts, resulting in time  delays and increased costs. A representative of one sponsor also  described instances when he learned about a policy change  unexpectedly. For example, the sponsor told us that the Corps notified  him by telephone about a policy change regarding the use of  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to construct  the project\u2019s recreational features. Initially, Corps district officials and  the sponsor expected to receive ARRA funding for the construction of  the recreational features. Subsequently, Corps headquarters decided  to not allow the use of ARRA funds for these features. However,  based on the expectation that they would receive ARRA funding, the  Corps district office had already started the competitive bidding  process for construction of the recreational features when the sponsor  learned of the decision made by Corps headquarters. As a result, the  Corps district office had to delay the bidding process, and the sponsor  had to find alternative funding sources for the recreational features.", "Scope and design changes. Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors  from six of the eight projects told us they had experienced scope or  design changes on their projects. According to Corps officials and  sponsors of these projects, communication regarding project scope or  design changes was generally effective. For example, Corps officials  from one project told us they conferred with the sponsor on design  changes and regularly communicated with the sponsor through  meetings and telephone calls. The sponsor for this project told us that  Corps officials had quickly communicated any design changes. In  another example, Corps officials on the project stated that design  changes were continually communicated to the sponsor at weekly  meetings. When there were design disagreements between the Corps  and the sponsor, the officials said that Corps engineering staff met  with the sponsor to reach an acceptable solution.", "Cost changes. Under Corps guidance, the project partnership  agreement between the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor is to  require the Corps to provide a quarterly cost report to the sponsor.  The report is to include such items as updated projections of project  costs, the amount of the sponsor\u2019s required contribution for the next  fiscal year, and the total financial obligations of the Corps and the  sponsor for any additional work incurred. However, sponsors for two  projects told us the Corps was less timely in providing updated cost  information. Specifically, a representative of a sponsor of one project  told us that the sponsor had not received these reports on a regular  basis and, at times, the Corps provided the report several months  after the fiscal reporting period had closed. And another sponsor told  us, in many instances, the Corps gave the sponsor a week to provide  their share of the funding for cost increases, but the sponsor wanted  the Corps to notify them of cost changes as soon as they occurred.", "Corps officials from two projects told us they also used informal  methods to communicate cost changes to sponsors. For example,  Corps officials from one project told us they immediately notified the  sponsor by telephone or in writing if there were new costs during the  design and construction of the project. Officials from another project  said if the sponsor had questions regarding cost changes, the sponsor  would request a meeting. Sponsors from two projects also described  informal means of receiving information from the Corps regarding cost  changes. Specifically, a sponsor from one project told us the Corps  immediately notified the sponsor about potential cost changes via  telephone or e-mail, and the changes were discussed at weekly  meetings. The sponsor of the other project requested to receive cost  change reports before they were officially approved by the Corps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communications Plans Called for by Guidance Were Not Always Developed, and Corps Officials and Nonfederal Sponsors Suggested Ways to Improve Communication", "paragraphs": ["Corps guidance directs project delivery teams to develop a  communications plan for their projects, but three of the eight projects we  selected for further review did not have a communications plan.

The communications plan  provides a framework for the Corps and nonfederal sponsors to establish  a communications strategy and determine the needs of the project  delivery team\u2014specifically, who needs what information, when they will  need it, how it will be given to them, and by whom. According to Corps  guidance, the communications plan may include such items as methods  for (1) evaluating the effectiveness of the project\u2019s communication  strategy and (2) accessing information between scheduled  communications. Communications plan templates are available on the  agency\u2019s internal website for use by the project delivery teams, according  to Corps headquarters officials. Each project delivery team also has the  flexibility to develop a communications plan that meets the specific needs  of the individual project and its sponsors.", "We found that three of the eight projects we selected for further review  had not developed a communications plan. A Corps official from one of  the projects told us a plan was not developed as the district office and  nonfederal sponsors handled their communications through an ad hoc  communications group operating during the project\u2019s construction phase.  A Corps official from the second project told us the project management  plan was drafted in 1990, and the agency did not call for a  communications plan at the time. However, according to a headquarters  official, ongoing projects should have developed a communications plan  after the Corps\u2019 guidance regarding communications plans was issued in  2009. The project manager for the third project was unsure why a plan  had not been developed since he had only recently been assigned to the  project. The sponsors of the three projects without a communications plan  agreed that a communications plan would be beneficial. Specifically, one  sponsor noted that communication with the Corps was \u201cexcellent,\u201d but  added that communication responsibilities are substantial and should be  formally acknowledged, and another sponsor indicated a communications  plan would have been helpful when a new project manager was assigned.", "The Corps\u2019 regulation on managing its business processes recognizes  the importance of project management plans in facilitating and  maintaining effective communication with nonfederal sponsors throughout  a project\u2019s duration.

Most of the Corps officials we spoke  with recognized that sponsors\u2019 needs vary. For example, Corps  officials told us some sponsors had worked with the Corps before and  had a better understanding of the Corps\u2019 processes. Other sponsors  had not partnered with the Corps previously and were unfamiliar with  the federal appropriations process and budget cycle, among other  things. In these cases, Corps officials told us they had to spend more  time educating the sponsor about the agency and its processes. In  addition, Corps officials and sponsors told us the high turnover of  project managers during the life of a project presents a challenge in  terms of communication. For example, one project we reviewed has  had 12 different project managers since 2004. One sponsor from  another project told us that communications with the Corps became  less frequent after a new project manager started. Corps officials from  one project told us the terms of communication with sponsors are set  out in the project\u2019s communications plan, and it is useful to have this  information in writing when project managers change. In addition,  another sponsor suggested face-to-face meetings between the Corps  and sponsors prior to the start of a project and whenever new officials  join the project.", "Communicate more frequently. Some Corps officials and nonfederal  sponsors told us that more frequent communication would enhance  overall communication. For example, one sponsor stated that more  proactive communication by the Corps would have helped the  sponsor learn sooner that the Corps had overspent on the project\u2019s  design. The sponsor became aware of the Corps\u2019 overspending when  reviewing a financial report from the agency. Another sponsor stated  that, with more frequent communication, they would expect their input  on project decisions to increase and that more frequent  communication would help the Corps\u2019 understanding of the project  area. Corps officials from another project said that more frequent  communication with sponsors would prevent \u201csurprises.\u201d Further, a  Corps official and sponsors we spoke with said projects benefit from  frequent, face-to-face communication at the start of a project and  throughout the project.", "Provide more information. Nonfederal sponsors and Corps officials  suggested communication could improve if the Corps provided more  information about the project. For example, Corps officials and a  sponsor from one project said that, in addition to the quarterly cost  reports, the Corps sends letters to the sponsors explaining the  reasons for any cost increases. Corps officials from another project  said that sponsors liked to periodically receive by e-mail a one-page  summary that includes updates on the project\u2019s status and costs. A  sponsor told us the Corps should respond when sponsors provide  input or ask for information. For example, the sponsor told us the  Corps sent a letter asking the sponsor to pay its share of a cost but  did not provide a description of the cost. However, the sponsor said it  cannot just pay what the Corps asks. Instead, it needs documentation  of how local money is spent.", "Corps guidance on communications plans includes many of the  suggestions made by Corps officials and sponsors.

For  purposes of this report, a flood control project refers to a project with  structural features such as levees, floodwalls, channels, dams, and  reservoirs that is constructed for the purpose of managing the risk of  flooding along rivers and coastal areas. Our work focused on flood control  projects budgeted for construction in any fiscal year from 2004 to 2012  because these projects had gone through the Corps\u2019 project development  processes and had project cost estimates developed by the Corps at key  milestones.", "To determine the extent to which cost increases occurred and the primary  factors that contributed to differences between estimated and actual  costs, we reviewed relevant provisions of the laws, regulations, policies,  and procedures governing the Corps\u2019 process for developing flood control  projects and generating cost estimates. We also interviewed officials at  Corps headquarters and its cost engineering center of expertise located  in Walla Walla, Washington. The Corps identified 87 new or ongoing flood  control projects that were budgeted for construction in any fiscal year  from 2004 to 2012. We surveyed Corps officials associated with the  projects to obtain project cost estimates at key milestones, the current  total project cost or total expenditures at project closeout, if applicable,  and the primary factors that contributed to cost increases, among other  things. Because this was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of information  available to respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing  them can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took  steps in developing the questionnaire and collecting and analyzing the  data to minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, social science  survey specialists designed the questionnaire in collaboration with GAO  staff who had subject matter expertise. Then, we pretested the draft  questionnaire with a number of Corps officials to ensure that the  questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to understand. We  received responses from Corps officials for all 87 projects, for a 100  percent response rate. For the 87 projects, we compared the project\u2019s  original authorized cost and its current total project cost or total  expenditures at project closeout, if applicable. Twenty projects did not  have an authorized cost or total expenditures at project closeout, or they  were undergoing reevaluation and did not have a current total project  cost, so we could not compare costs for those projects. We were unable  to quantify the difference between the original authorized cost and the  current total project cost or total expenditures at project closeout for each  of the 67 projects we could compare because we determined that the  survey data were not reliable for that purpose. Specifically, Corps  guidance provided differing definitions of total project cost, and it was  unclear from the survey data whether all respondents had used the same  definition.", "From the 87 projects, we selected a non-probability sample of 8 projects  that were budgeted for construction in any fiscal year from 2009 to 2012  for further review, including 1 project randomly selected from each of 7  divisions and 1 project judgmentally selected from the New Orleans  District that met our selection criteria of projects budgeted for construction  in any fiscal year from 2009 to 2012.

Funds to initiate  preconstruction engineering and design were appropriated in fiscal year  1986. A general design memorandum, dated May 1989 and approved in  January 1990, was the basis for design and construction of the project.  The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1990,  reauthorized the project for $29 million. The project started receiving  construction funds in 1990, and a local cooperation agreement was  signed in June 1990. A supplement to the local cooperation agreement  was signed in January 1993 to reimburse the sponsor for flood proofing  the hospital. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act,  2004, increased the authorized total cost to $61.7 million. In 2005, the  first construction contract was awarded for work on the flood control  features. The project was physically completed in October 2011.

Major  flooding occurred again in 1998, so the Corps conducted a general  reevaluation from 1999 to 2003 to determine whether any modifications  needed to be made based on information from the 1998 flood. Based on  the findings of the general reevaluation, the project expanded  significantly, and costs increased to $73 million. The Consolidated  Appropriations Resolution, 2003, modified the project to authorize  construction substantially in accordance with recommendations in a final  Chief\u2019s Report if a favorable report was completed by December 31,  2003, at a total project cost of $73,380,000. The act also gave the Corps  the authority to give the sponsor credit for its share of the costs of  construction work completed before the project cooperation agreement  was signed if the work was integral to the project.
