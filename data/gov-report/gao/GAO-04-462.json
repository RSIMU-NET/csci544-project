This led to several reforms, some of which allegedly may have caused some buyers to forgo home inspections, confusing that service with appraisals. Advocates of mandating home inspections claim that FHA will benefit from fewer foreclosures, and buyers will benefit by avoiding homes with costly problems. GAO was asked to assess (1) how many recent FHA homebuyers got home inspections and what were the perceived benefits, (2) whether homebuyers understand the differences between appraisals and home inspections, (3) whether inspections are associated with loan performance, and (4) the implications of mandating home inspections."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From its survey of recent homebuyers, GAO estimates 86 percent of those using FHA-insured mortgages in 2002 got home inspections. These buyers frequently reported the inspections to be positive and beneficial, but occasionally said the inspections had drawbacks, mainly related to their cost and quality. Home inspections do not appear to be associated with loan performance; other factors, such as borrowers' credit scores, are stronger predictors of how FHA-insured loans perform. Because of this, and because mandating inspections for all homebuyers could pose serious resource challenges for FHA, the marginal benefit of requiring inspections is questionable. One of the reasons often cited for getting a home inspection was to ensure there were no serious problems with the house. Homebuyers reported that two-thirds of inspections uncovered problems with homes. As a result, they benefited by being able to renegotiate their purchases. Buyers also reported inspections were worth as much or more than they cost and increased their confidence in their decisions to buy homes. Inspections are a more in-depth review of property condition than FHA appraisals, take longer, and more often give buyers the option to back out of a purchase. GAO estimates 36 percent of FHA homebuyers understand the differences between FHA's mandatory home appraisal and its recommended home inspection. For most of the remaining buyers, GAO was not able to determine definitively the extent to which they understood the differences. Finally, FHA officials believe mandating home inspections would be difficult to enforce because the agency lacks the human capital and other resources to do so effectively. FHA also might see its pool of higher risk borrowers grow, as some buyers go elsewhere for non-FHA financing options available to lower income buyers. Benefits experienced by survey respondents might carry over to all homebuyers, but a mandatory inspection could put them at a disadvantage in highly competitive markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every year, nearly one million people buy homes\u2014many for the first  time\u2014using mortgages that the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures.   FHA does not require prospective homeowners to protect their interests by,  for example, getting a home inspection before committing to buying a  house; however, there are requirements, such as getting an appraisal, to  protect the interests of FHA and the lenders who make the loans FHA  insures.  Appraisals do this by confirming the home\u2019s market value so that  the lender and FHA know they are not lending or insuring more than the  home is worth.", "FHA requires that appraisers conduct a limited review of a home\u2019s physical  condition.  In the 1990s, FHA dealt with a series of problems resulting from  owners being unaware of costly problems appraisers identified in the  homes they bought with FHA-insured mortgages.  This led FHA to  emphasize the importance of getting a home inspection by requiring  borrowers to read and sign a form explaining the benefits of inspections.   Because borrowers might not get this information until they apply for  mortgages (after signing purchase contracts), and because getting an  inspection usually requires making a purchase offer contingent on it,  prospective buyers may have made their decisions about inspections  before they get this information.  FHA also began notifying buyers (just  prior to closing on their homes) of any defects documented in the  appraisers\u2019 physical condition reviews.", "Because the property condition elements of the FHA appraisal might  appear to be quite similar to a home inspection, some in the home  inspection industry expressed concern that buyers were now confusing  inspections and appraisals and, in some cases, forgoing home inspections  because they mistakenly understood them to be the same thing.  Home  inspection advocates claimed that increasing the number of buyers who get  home inspections would benefit FHA by reducing foreclosures resulting  from costly property condition problems an inspection could have helped  the buyer avoid.  Assessing the validity of the industry\u2019s claims, however,  proved difficult because no one knew with certainty how many buyers get  home inspections and to what extent the buyers and FHA benefit from  them.", "To better assess whether more, or possibly all, buyers using FHA-insured  mortgages should get home inspections, you asked us to develop some of  the information necessary to make such a judgment.  As agreed with your  offices, this report answers four questions:  (1) how many recent  homebuyers got home inspections and what do they report as the primary  benefits and drawbacks of the inspections, (2) to what extent and by what  means do recent homebuyers understand the differences between  appraisals and home inspections, (3) to what extent is getting a home  inspection associated with the performance of FHA-insured loans, and (4)  what would be the implications for FHA, homebuyers, and others if home  inspections were made mandatory for FHA-insured mortgages.", "We surveyed a representative sample of recent homebuyers (those who  purchased homes in 2002 using FHA-insured financing) to determine (1)  how many got home inspections; (2) what they report as the benefits and  drawbacks of inspections; and (3) the extent to which they understand the  differences between appraisals and inspections.  The response rate for this  survey was 56 percent.  To assess the association home inspections may  have with loan performance, we reviewed a random sample of FHA loan  files from loans insured in fiscal years 1996 through 1999 to determine  whether the file indicated the homebuyer had sought a home inspection;  we then used an econometric model to analyze the association that home  inspections and other information about properties and borrowers, such as  credit scores, might have with the loans\u2019 performance.  To determine the  implications of making home inspections mandatory, we interviewed  officials at FHA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal National  Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation (Freddie Mac); we also consulted with industry association  officials representing home inspectors, appraisers, realtors, and lenders.", "Appendixes II and III provide detailed information on the scope and  methodology for our homebuyer survey and loan performance file review.

Private lenders, not FHA,  make the loans to borrowers.  FHA insures the lender against losses it may  incur when a borrower defaults on his or her mortgage and the lender has  to foreclose on the home.  FHA provides this insurance through programs  supported by its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (the fund).  It deposits  into the fund the mortgage insurance premiums it collects from borrowers  (when they initially get their loans and then as part of each monthly  mortgage payment), as well as proceeds from the sale of foreclosed  properties.  FHA draws on the fund to reimburse lenders for their losses on  foreclosed properties.", "FHA provides this insurance so that lenders will make mortgage loans with  more lenient underwriting standards than \u201cconventional\u201d financing.  FHA  does this to open homeownership opportunities to households unable to  meet the requirements of the private market for mortgages and mortgage  insurance.  For example, FHA insurance allows borrowers to make low  down payments and finance closing costs as part of their loan rather than  pay cash for those expenses.  As a result, FHA plays a particularly  important role among certain groups of potential homeowners, particularly  first time buyers, minorities, and lower-income households.  In fiscal year  2002, for instance, 72 percent of FHA-insured purchase mortgages went to  first-time buyers.", "FHA relies on lenders to underwrite the loans it insures.  This means  lenders accept mortgage applications, obtain borrowers\u2019 employment  verifications and credit histories, and perform other tasks in the loan  underwriting process, including ordering an appraisal on the property the  borrower wants to purchase.  FHA appraisals estimate the fair market  value of the home to (1) protect the lender from loaning more than the  home is probably worth (for FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance purposes) and (2)  minimize FHA\u2019s losses when it has to sell foreclosed properties.  According  to FHA, the bulk of an appraiser\u2019s time is spent estimating the property  value.  However, the appraiser must also spend some time performing and  documenting a limited review of the property\u2019s condition to ensure it meets  the agency\u2019s minimum property requirements.  For example, the appraisal  might address the condition of the roof and the operation of certain  mechanical systems, such as the furnace.", "Consumers are responsible for protecting their own interests in the  homebuying process.  FHA and lenders expect buyers will gather the  information they need to make informed decisions about home purchases.", "FHA encourages buyers to protect their interests by getting a home  inspection before finalizing a contract to purchase a house, but does not  require them to do so.", "Homebuyers, particularly those purchasing their first homes, can face a  daunting array of steps, requirements, and new terminology as they  navigate the homebuying process\u2014many of which they encounter before  they might apply for a FHA-insured mortgage.  For example, prior to  searching for a home, a buyer may choose to work with a lender to obtain  pre-approval for a mortgage, which would involve verifying employment  history and checking credit, similar to what lenders require during  underwriting.  During their search, buyers may begin working with a real  estate agent, looking at numerous homes for sale, and acquainting  themselves with important information they may need to make a purchase  offer, such as the need for an inspection of a particular home they may  want to buy.  After offering to purchase a specific home, a buyer may have  to consider counteroffers from the seller, get a home inspection if they  have insisted on one, and consider the results of the inspection before  finalizing the purchase contract.", "In figure 1, we illustrate some of the more common steps in the  homebuying process.  As we illustrate, buyers can be well on the road to  homeownership before they encounter the FHA requirements affecting  them.", "FHA requires lenders to provide a disclosure statement to all FHA-insured  mortgage applicants, which we also show in figure 1.  This statement  emphasizes it is the borrower\u2019s responsibility to protect his or her interest,  and one way of doing that is by getting a home inspection.", "As FHA\u2019s advisory describes, a home inspection provides detailed  information about the overall condition of the home.  Inspections generally  consist of a visual examination of a home\u2019s readily accessible systems and  components, such as the electrical system and the plumbing, and result in a  report to the buyer describing what the inspector observed.  However,  because some states regulate various aspects of home inspections and  others do not, the actual content of any given buyer\u2019s home inspection may  vary depending on the state in which the buyer lives and the extent to  which individual inspectors may be able to do more (or less) than the state  prescribes.", "FHA requires that lenders provide this advisory because it has contractual  relationships with them and can insist that they do so.  FHA does not,  however, have contractual relationships with or oversight authority over  various other parties who deal with potential buyers earlier in the  homebuying process, such as real estate agents.  Consequently, while  borrowers may have seen and read the advisory prior to applying for their  mortgage (e.g., because a realtor provided it), the point at which FHA  requires they see it is no later than the point at which they apply for their  mortgage.  Because getting a home inspection usually requires that a  purchase offer is contingent on the seller allowing the inspection, buyers  have chosen to get (or to forgo) a home inspection before FHA requires  that they read and sign a document explaining the importance of the  inspection and how it differs from the FHA appraisal.", "Home inspections and the limited property condition review FHA  appraisers conduct can address or speak about the condition of many of  the same parts in the home.   Table 1 shows a side-by-side comparison of  the various components that may be part of a typical home inspection and where an FHA appraiser would perform a limited property condition  review in those same areas.", "Despite their apparent overlap in addressing many of the same parts of a  house, home inspections and FHA appraisals differ substantially in terms  of their purpose and timing, the type and focus of each, the depth of  examination of the home, and the recourse available to the buyer.

Certain features  of the loan, such as the loan-to-value ratio, interest rate (fixed or  adjustable) and term (15 or 30 years) can also help predict loan  performance.  For example, lower loan-to-value ratios are often associated  with better loan performance because the borrowers have more equity in  their properties than those with higher ratios.  Greater equity in the home  gives a borrower more incentive to sell rather than fall behind on mortgage  payments and face foreclosure.  Similarly, house price appreciation is  predictive of loan performance because it gives borrowers more equity in  their homes and greater incentives to sell rather than default.", "To consider home inspections in conjunction with the factors known to be  predictive of loan performance, we reviewed a stratified random sample of  260 FHA paper loan files for evidence the borrower got a home inspection.

That is, the difference between the two is too small to rule out  that it occurs by chance rather than because of some difference that we  might otherwise link to the home inspections.

Recent GAO work has  demonstrated various problems FHA and its partners have experienced in  regulating appraisals.  For example, FHA officials acknowledge that they  have lacked sufficient resources to evaluate the quality of many FHA  appraisals and that its procedures for monitoring appraisals were  inadequate and inefficient.  Consequently, according to FHA, its  sanctioning of appraisers was inconsistent.  To address these problems,  FHA restructured its enforcement efforts to focus more on individual  appraisers rather than the content or quality of the appraisals themselves.   According to FHA, it did so in order to adopt a risk-based, more  manageable approach to its oversight responsibilities that allows it to  target only those appraisers whom various indicators show may have a  pattern of poor performance.  For example, FHA now tracks foreclosure  rates by appraiser\u2014that is, it links individual loans for which it has paid  claims to the person who did the appraisal in support of the loan when it  was originated.  FHA does this in order to identify those who may be performing fraudulent, inflated appraisals, which can increase the  likelihood of foreclosure.", "FHA officials told us they doubt FHA\u2019s ability to effectively ensure the  quality of home inspections given the agency\u2019s history of struggling to do  this with appraisals (prior to turning its focus to the appraisers).

For  example, FHA officials told us that they do not have enough people with  the right skills to conduct basic enforcement activities, such as quality  control reviews of home inspections or investigating complaints.  They also  indicated an effective enforcement system would require an infrastructure  for approving inspectors to perform FHA-sanctioned inspections and  tracking inspectors\u2019 compliance with standards.  Being able to track  performance is particularly important to FHA officials because lessons  learned from the appraisal industry taught them the necessity of having in  place at the outset an effective system to monitor performance so FHA can  act quickly against poorly performing or fraudulent inspectors.", "FHA might be able to reduce the resource demands of a home inspection  requirement by relying on those states that have existing regulatory efforts.   FHA officials indicated that they would likely defer to state standards in  those states that regulate the home inspection industry.  However, FHA  officials say they would need to evaluate each state\u2019s standards and  enforcement efforts to ensure they meet any minimum standard FHA sets.   The extent to which relying on existing state regulatory structures would  help FHA is unclear.  GAO has reported that in situations where the federal  and state governments have overlapping regulatory programs, states might  curtail their efforts in response to new federal regulations.  This  phenomenon, which some term \u201cprogrammatic displacement,\u201d could make  it necessary for FHA to provide resources to these states to induce or  require them to maintain the level of effort they had been putting into  oversight of the home inspection industry.  In those states currently  without home inspection regulations, the resource implications for FHA  would almost certainly be greater.  FHA officials expect that in these states  the agency would face a choice between finding a way to conduct the  enforcement itself or, possibly, paying the states to do so.

These equations were expressed as a function of interest and  unemployment rates, the borrower\u2019s equity (computed using a home\u2019s sales  price and current and contract interest rates as well as a loan\u2019s duration),  the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, the loan\u2019s size, the geographic location of the  home, and the number of years that the loan had been active.  The results  of the logistic regressions were used to estimate the probabilities of a loan  being foreclosed or prepaid in each year.  Details concerning the estimation  of these regressions are contained in appendix II of our 2001 report, as are  tables of coefficients for the independent variables."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Data GAO\u2019s Model Uses to Estimate Foreclosures and Prepayments", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that data contained in FHA\u2019s information systems were reliable,  we compared seven elements of the paper loan file to the electronic file to  determine if they matched.  These data elements included the address of  the property, the closing date, loan amount, appraised market value, sales  price, interest rate, and whether the loan\u2019s interest rate was fixed or  variable.  We selected these elements because of their importance in  ensuring that our model (to predict loan performance) is using accurate  data.  Specifically, we assessed a random sample of 30 files for data  reliability and found no significant or material errors; we also reviewed  several years\u2019 worth of FHA financial statements audits and found no  known or suspected problems with the relevant FHA information systems.
