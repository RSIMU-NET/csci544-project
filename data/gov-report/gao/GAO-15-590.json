GAO's analysis of publicly reported federal procurement data shows that federal use of the FSS program has declined from $31.8 billion in 2010 to $25.7 billion in 2014\u2014a 19 percent inflation-adjusted decrease.

Transactions conducted through the FSS program represent significant  spending: in 2014, GSA reported total program sales of $33.1 billion.  Orders placed through the FSS program generally must follow  competitive procedures laid out in the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), though agencies can award noncompetitive orders under certain  circumstances. In 2011, the FAR was revised to enhance competition for  orders placed under FSS contracts. Specifically, agencies now must  either give all contractors under the relevant schedule an opportunity to  submit a quote or take steps to reasonably ensure that the government  receives at least three quotes for orders valued over $150,000.

We  identified the three agencies that made the most use of the GSA  schedules based on obligations reported in FPDS-NG: the Department of  Defense (DOD), GSA, and the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). We further identified the components of these agencies  that obligated the most money through FSS: the Department of the Army  (Army) at DOD, the Federal Acquisition Service at GSA, and the Centers  for Medicaid and Medicare Services and National Institutes of Health  (NIH) at HHS. We selected orders to obtain a mix of products and  services purchased off a variety of schedules, including the most  frequently used schedules. Because different ordering procedures for  competition apply depending on the dollar value of orders, we chose our  sample based on four competition categories, with 15 orders selected in  each category: (1) noncompetitive awards above $150,000, which is  generally the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT); (2) competitive  awards above the SAT coded as the government having only received  one or two quotes; (3) competitive awards above the SAT coded as the  government having received three or more quotes; and (4) competitive  awards below the SAT regardless of number of quotes reported.", "For each of the 60 orders in our sample, we reviewed contract file  documentation to assess whether required ordering procedures were  followed, the facts and circumstances of competition decisions, whether  discounts were sought, and how prices were assessed in making best  value determinations.

For example, the justification for a $360,000  Army noncompetitive order for a proprietary closed-circuit television  security system used the format for justifications for open market  procurements rather than for FSS orders and therefore did not use the  correct FAR citation and included a fair and reasonable price  determination instead of a best value determination. Further, officials  confirmed it was never made publicly available as required.

Open market items are goods  and services that are not on the schedule.

Due to a lack of training on procedures for open market items,  contracting officials assumed that every item offered was an FSS  item.", "For a $388,000 order for firing range bleacher enclosures, the Army  did not assess prices for $114,000 of open market items because the  Army accepted a lump sum quote with no breakdown of the FSS and  open market components. The Army did not require the vendor to  provide sufficient information to identify which items were and were  not on the schedule so could not have known that they were  purchasing open market items.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management needs to identify appropriate knowledge and skills needed  for various jobs, and provide needed training, as part of a commitment to  competence. Internal control activities\u2014such as policies and  procedures\u2014also help ensure that management directives are carried  out.", "Further, the government is at risk of paying more than it should when  contracting officers do not ensure they are paying the prices established  by GSA. In a $150,000 HHS order to conduct a disease study abroad, the  vendor offered and the government accepted labor rates that were not on  the vendor\u2019s FSS contract. The vendor told us that the solicitation did not  mention use of FSS, so its quote was not based on its FSS contract.  Seven months after the order was awarded, the vendor noticed the work  was issued under FSS and requested that HHS use the labor rates  established in its FSS contract, which were less expensive than the rates  offered previously.", "In many of the orders we reviewed, contracting officers largely depended  on GSA\u2019s previous determination that the prices on the vendor\u2019s schedule  contract were fair and reasonable, as is described in the FAR. In one  instance\u2014a $13.9 million Army award for testing a weapon system\u2014 contracting officials compared the one quote received to the vendor\u2019s  schedule and noticed that the vendor did not use its schedule pricing. The  contracting official asked the vendor to revise and resubmit its quote  using schedule prices.", "We also found instances where contracting officials conducted additional  price analysis beyond comparing offered prices to the schedule prices to  ensure they were getting the best value. Some contracting officials stated  that they conducted additional price analysis because they obtained only  one quote and did not have the benefit of multiple competitive quotes for  comparison. For example:  In a $408,000 GSA order for a docking system, the contracting officer  compared the quote to the schedule and found an item\u2019s price was  $7,500 greater than the listed schedule price. The contracting officer  requested and was granted an adjustment to the price to reflect the  lower schedule price. After receiving only one quote, the contracting  officer conducted additional price analysis of the vendor\u2019s quote by  requesting historical pricing information from previous government  contracts, and confirmed that the vendor\u2019s quote was in line with its  historical pricing.", "In a $1.1 million noncompetitive order for office furniture and  installation services, GSA contracting officials compared the vendor\u2019s  rates against its FSS contract, and identified inclusion of work not  listed in the solicitation. At the request of GSA, the vendor corrected  this error. To determine whether the vendor\u2019s prices were fair and  reasonable, the contracting officers conducted additional price  analysis by comparing prices from other FSS vendors for similar or  same products as the bidding vendor.", "When only one offer is received for competitive solicitations, DOD  generally requires additional steps to establish that the prices of supplies  and services are fair and reasonable. In 2014, DOD established a new  requirement for contracting officers to make their own price  reasonableness determination for all FSS orders which DOD officials told  us was intended to encourage contracting officers to seek better prices.  DOD ordering activities may no longer rely only on GSA\u2019s price  reasonableness determinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Has Started to Take Steps to Increase Information Available on Prices Paid", "paragraphs": ["Currently, ordering agencies generally do not have insight into prices  previously paid by other federal agencies for a similar product or service  under similar terms and conditions. This limits the government\u2019s ability to  fully leverage its buying power. To address this problem, some agencies  have tools that provide pricing data for items they purchased previously.  For example, an Army contracting officer used the Federal Logistics  Information System as a source of information for prices previously paid.  However, this information is limited to certain agencies. Without greater  insights into past purchasing, agencies risk paying higher prices and  missing opportunities to obtain discounts.", "GSA does not have access to prices being paid for schedule orders  because vendors do not currently report this information. Currently,  contracting officers must ensure that FSS contracts require vendors to  submit quarterly reports to GSA providing their FSS sales totals and the  associated fee that GSA is owed. In addition, the price reductions clause  requires vendors to provide the government the same price reductions  given to their most favored customer. In place of the quarterly reports and  the price reductions clause, GSA is proposing revisions to its regulations  that will include clauses that would require vendors to provide data on the  prices paid at the order level and plans to have agencies use this data to  compare prices for similar goods and services. GSA anticipates that the  data on prices paid would reduce the risk of agencies paying higher  prices; reduce price variation for similar products and services on FSS;  and allow agencies to conduct meaningful price analysis and more  effectively validate fair and reasonable pricing. For FSS vehicles, the new  data reporting requirement would be introduced in phases, beginning with  a pilot for select products and commoditized services. GSA officials told  us that creating comparable data for services will be challenging and is  part of their longer-term initiative. In April 2015, at a public meeting to  discuss the proposed regulation change, industry and some government  representatives expressed significant concerns about the feasibility of  GSA\u2019s proposal and the impact of it on both vendors and the  government\u2019s ability to manage risk.

At the individual order level,  some contracting officers are using effective strategies to increase  competition or seek discounted prices. However, the extent of issues we  found as a result of contracting staff that are not aware of the  requirements\u2014from errors in justifications for noncompetitive orders on  the schedule, to discounts not being sought when required, to open  market items purchased without assessing prices\u2014suggests that more  guidance and training are necessary to ensure proper use of the program.  When contracting officers do not seek discounts for FSS orders, the  government may be missing opportunities for cost savings. When  contracting officers do not evaluate prices for open market items, the  government cannot be sure that items are being purchased at a fair and  reasonable price. Further, the high percentage of obligations on orders for  which HHS received only one or two quotes suggests more attention is  needed to ensure that that the practice of narrowing the pool of vendors  at HHS is not limiting the agency\u2019s ability to receive the full benefits of  competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure contracting officers follow ordering procedures when  using FSS, and to enhance internal controls, we recommend that the  Secretaries of DOD and HHS and the Administrator of GSA take the  following three actions:  Issue guidance emphasizing the requirement to seek discounts and  outlining effective strategies for negotiating discounts when using the  FSS program;  Issue guidance reminding contracting officials of the procedures they  must follow with respect to purchasing open market items through the  FSS program, including the requirement to perform a separate  determination that the prices of these items are fair and reasonable;  and", "Assess existing training programs to determine whether they are  adequate to ensure that contracting officials are aware of the ordering  procedures of the FSS program, including requirements to 1) properly  prepare justifications for noncompetitive awards, 2) seek discounts,  and 3) assess prices for open market items included in FSS orders.", "To help foster competition for FSS orders consistent with the FAR, we  recommend that the Secretary of HHS take the following action:", "Assess reasons that may be contributing to the high percentage of  orders with one or two quotes\u2014including the practice of narrowing the  pool of potential vendors\u2014and if necessary, depending on the results  of the assessment, provide guidance to help ensure contracting  officials are taking reasonable steps to obtain three or more quotes  above the SAT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, GSA and HHS.

We  adjusted all obligations for inflation using the Gross Domestic Product  price index and reported all data in fiscal year 2014 dollars. We included  orders off contracts coded as \u201cFSS\u201d and blanket purchase agreement  orders coded as FSS blanket purchase agreements to identify those that  were awarded through FSS. We compared FPDS-NG\u2019s data on FSS  obligations to a list of FSS contracts, including contract numbers, from the  General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) eLibrary. In addition, we  compared FPDS-NG data to contract file documentation for a  nongeneralizable sample of orders and, based on this comparison,  determined that the FPDS-NG data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "We analyzed data on total federal contracting obligations as well as  obligations awarded under the FSS program. Additionally, we reviewed  the obligations awarded under the FSS program to assess the obligations  on products compared with obligations on services. We did not  independently assess whether orders were correctly coded as either  product or service obligations. We also analyzed the product and service  obligations to determine which product and service categories accounted  for the most obligations in fiscal year 2014. We used GSA\u2019s list of FSS  schedules and contracts as of April 2014 to determine the corresponding  schedule for each contract where possible. However, we were not able to  match all orders and calls to a particular schedule. Within each of the  three schedules that received the highest overall obligations in 2010  through 2014, we used FPDS-NG data to analyze the overall number of  vendors on the schedule, as well as how many vendors received at least  one award in the 5-year period and how many vendors received  80 percent of obligations. To assess the extent of competition for FSS  orders, we analyzed FPDS-NG data using the field titled \u201cFair  Opportunity/Limited Sources\u201d to categorize obligations by competition  status. Competitive orders include those coded in FPDS-NG under  \u201ccompetitive set aside\u201d or \u201cfair opportunity given\u201d; and noncompetitive  orders include those coded under \u201curgency\u201d, \u201conly one source \u2013 other\u201d,  and \u201cfollow-on action following competitive initial action\u201d. In addition, we  categorized as noncompetitive orders coded under \u201cminimum guarantee\u201d,  \u201cother statutory authority\u201d, and \u201csole source\u201d.", "To assess the factors influencing competition and the extent to which  agencies examined prices to be paid for FSS orders, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 60 FSS orders under GSA schedules  awarded in fiscal year 2013, the most recent complete year of data when  we began our review. In order to allow comparability and price analysis  across our sample, we did not include orders under schedules awarded  by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which primarily offer medical and  health-related items. We also excluded blanket purchase agreements,  which do not obligate funding, and the calls upon them, which do not  follow the same ordering procedures as FSS orders. Using FPDS-NG  data, we identified the three agencies with the highest obligations on FSS  orders under GSA schedule contracts in fiscal year 2013: the Department  of Defense (DOD), GSA, and the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). We further identified the components within each of  these departments with the highest fiscal year 2013 obligations through  FSS orders: the Army at the DOD, the Federal Acquisition Service at  GSA, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) at HHS. Together, the Centers for  Medicaid and Medicare Services and NIH obligated approximately the  same amount as the Army or the Federal Acquisition Service in fiscal  year 2013, so we included both and selected an equal number of orders  at each. For logistical convenience and to obtain a variety of products and  services in our sample, within the Army, we selected orders at Army  Material Command and National Guard Bureau, which are two of the  largest Army users of the FSS program.", "To assess the ordering practices for different types of orders, we selected  orders from four categories based on competition status and dollar value,  using coding in FPDS-NG. The four competition categories are: (1) orders  above $150,000, which is generally the simplified acquisition threshold  (SAT), that were competed and for which three or more quotes were  received; (2) those above the SAT that were competed and for which one  or two quotes were received; (3) those above the SAT that were  noncompetitive; and (4) competed orders below the SAT. We did not  include awards coded as noncompetitive with values below the SAT  because many of the requirements for noncompetitive awards do not  apply below the SAT, particularly the requirement for a justification and  approval document. We then selected our nongeneralizable sample of  60 contracts by using a combination of cluster and convenience sampling  to select 20 orders from each of the three agencies\u2014with 5 orders in  each of the four competition categories. To do so, in each category, we  selected the two largest orders, using the \u201cbase and all options\u201d field in  FPDS-NG, and three orders from the middle of the dollar value range by  dividing the list of orders into thirds and selecting from the middle third.  We selected orders to obtain a mix of product and service categories  purchased off a variety of schedules and to include the most heavily used  schedules, measured by number of orders and dollars obligated.", "When reviews of contract files revealed miscodings, we included the  order under review in the appropriate category. However, our initial  selection included five awards that were blanket purchase agreement  calls, but not coded as such in FPDS-NG, and one that was a requisition  for which there was no contract file to review. We replaced these six  awards with new selections. While we selected 15 orders coded as  belonging to each competition category, upon review of contract file  documentation, our sample included totals as show in table 2.", "To assess factors influencing competition for FSS orders, we reviewed  contract file documentation for the 60 selected orders and, in some  cases, interviewed contracting officials. We reviewed documentation  including acquisition plans, market research, award decision and price  negotiation memorandums and, where relevant, limited source  justification documentation. We also reviewed relevant sections of  Federal Acquisition Regulation, Department of Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Department of Health and Human  Services Acquisition Regulation, General Services Acquisition Regulation,  FSS program guidance, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government to establish criteria for whether agencies took required steps  to achieve competition. We also interviewed contracting officials and  vendors to obtain perspectives on the degree of competition for the  orders, and whether officials had sufficient familiarity with FSS program  requirements and procedures to carry out their duties.", "To determine the extent to which agencies examined prices to be paid for  FSS orders, we reviewed contract file documentation for the 60 selected  FSS orders, specifically: best value determinations, independent  government cost estimates, and award decision memorandums to assess  how best value determinations were made. In five cases, where the items  were readily available on the open market, we compared the FSS prices  paid to the cost of the items on the open market. For all 60 orders, we  obtained the GSA schedules that were in effect at the time of award.  When documentation allowed us to do so, we calculated the schedule  price and compared the established schedule prices to the prices paid for  the goods and services in our sample. Additionally, we reviewed  documentation on discounts sought and received and, as necessary,  interviewed contracting officials and vendors to determine whether the  government sought discounts as required by Federal Acquisition  Regulation for orders above the SAT. Finally, we interviewed officials at  DOD about its new requirement for contracting officers to independently  determine price reasonableness for items purchased on the schedule,  and at GSA about efforts to obtain new data on prices paid for items  purchased on the schedule.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
