DOD also determined the list's purpose is to support export control decisions and in October 2008, issued an instruction that (1) recognized the list's usefulness for other DOD programs and activities and (2) outlined the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for updating and maintaining the list. However, in 2011, DOD cut funding for the program from $4 million in prior years to about $1.5 million and ceased MCTL content updates. Subsequently, DOD removed the public version of the list from the Internet, and officials posted a disclaimer for the restricted version noting that the list should only be used for informational purposes as it had not been updated. Similarly, the compendium of emerging technologies is outdated and two sections have not been updated since 1999. Program officials from the Militarily Critical Technologies Program have devised a plan to improve how MCTL content will be updated in the future, including relying on contributions from the user community, but implementation of the plan has been limited due to funding constraints. However, program officials have yet to get input from users to agree to this approach and would still require additional funding to implement it.", "The MCTL is not used to inform export decisions--its original purpose. Export control officials from DOD and the Departments of Commerce and State reiterated their longstanding concern that the MCTL is outdated and too broad to meet export control needs. DOD officials who provide input on the criticality of technologies as part of export license determinations and reviews of foreign acquisition of U.S. companies told us that they do not rely on the MCTL to inform their decision making despite DOD guidance to do so. Instead, they consult their own network of experts, which they consider to be a more reliable source to get current technology information. Other DOD programs to protect critical technologies need a technical reference such as the MCTL and have integrated the list to help inform decision making. For example, the MCTL has been fully integrated into DOD's anti-tamper critical technology tool, which is designed to facilitate analysis and decision making to protect the most valuable military assets from tampering when exported or lost in military missions. Also, to inform its analysis of industrial espionage activities such as foreign targeting of U.S. technologies, the Defense Security Service relies on the MCTL to identify overlap and connections between different technology categories. With the suspension of MCTL updates, these programs are seeking alternatives, and in one case, developing their own technical reference which could result in inefficient use of resources.

There have been increasing attempts by foreign entities to  obtain illegal or unauthorized access to U.S. sensitive or classified  information and technology, such as information systems, lasers, optics,  and sensor technologies, which are among the most targeted  technologies by foreign entities, according to the Defense Security  Service (DSS). Identifying which technologies are critical to U.S. interests  helps counter the threats of unauthorized access to U.S. technologies  which are at risk of exploitation when exported, stolen, or lost or damaged  during combat or routine missions. Failure to do so, accurately and  consistently, could significantly enhance the military capability of a  potential adversary and may result in insufficient protection of those  systems, thereby increasing U.S. national security and economic risks.", "To help minimize these risks, DOD invests resources to develop and  maintain the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL). The Export  Administration Act of 1979 established the MCTL and required DOD to  identify technologies possessed by the U.S. and which, if exported, would  permit a significant advance in the military system of another country.  Since then, the list has expanded to capture technology capabilities  developed worldwide. In 2006, we reported on several challenges facing  the MCTL including that it was significantly out of date and not meeting  users\u2019 requirements. At that time, we made a number of  recommendations to improve the utility of the list and subsequently  included the identification of critical technologies as a key component of a  GAO high risk area on protecting technologies that are critical to U.S.  national security interests. This high risk area includes eight separate  programs at DOD and the Departments of Commerce, State, and the  Treasury, that each have roles in protecting critical technologies. We also  reported that DOD program managers faced difficulties in identifying  critical technologies, increasing the risk that some technologies may not  be identified and resulting in, for example, inadequate anti-tamper  protection that deters or delays exploitation of critical technologies.

Under the Export Administration  Act, which governs exports of dual-use items, DOD has primary  responsibility for developing the MCTL, which has broadened to a  compendium of worldwide science and technology capabilities\u2014existing  or under development\u2014that could significantly enhance or degrade U.S.  military capabilities now or in the future. First published in 1980, the  MCTL\u2019s original purpose was to inform export licensing determinations  and was to be integrated with expediency into the Commerce Control  List,and technologies subject to export controls. The MCTL itself is not an  export control list. Rather, according to DOD, it is the department\u2019s  recommendation for the criteria, parameters, and operating conditions  that constitute militarily critical capabilities for defense and dual-use items  that should be controlled. This knowledge can be used to limit a potential  adversary\u2019s access to technologies that would enable a significant military  advantage.   which is maintained by the Secretary of Commerce and lists goods  A range of DOD components, other federal agencies, and non- government entities need to know what is militarily critical to facilitate  decision making in efforts to minimize or prevent the compromise of U.S.  technological or military advantage. Knowledge about which technologies  are critical and warrant protection from illegal or unauthorized access is  needed for, among other things: export controls and licensing decisions for dual-use and arms exports,  which fall under the purview of the Departments of Commerce and  State, respectively;  consideration of anti-tamper protection of critical technologies on  defense systems, which is primarily coordinated by anti-tamper  officials and acquisition program offices within the military services;  review of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms that are involved in the  development or manufacture of defense technologies, which is  coordinated with several federal agencies;  counterproliferation and counterintelligence programs and activities  performed by DOD entities such as DSS to protect against industrial  espionage; and determinations about the public release of technical or scientific  information.", "To meet the range of information requirements and enhance knowledge  of what is militarily critical, the Militarily Critical Technologies Program  within DOD oversees periodic assessment of dual-use and military  technologies.

Based on users\u2019 requirements provided at that time, DOD  determined that the MCTL\u2019s purpose is to serve export control decisions.  However, the department also recognized that the MCTL had expanded  to serve other purposes such as counterintelligence and weapon system  program protection, among other things. In addition, to allow users to  more easily access the list content, DOD added a search engine  capability to improve navigation and initiated efforts to convert the MCTL  into a dynamic database to enable users to conduct advanced analytical  queries such as identifying interdependencies across multiple technology  types. In fiscal year 2007, the program\u2019s budget was doubled to $4  million, which program officials said was the appropriate funding level at  the time to update and maintain the MCTL. To address concerns about  the currency of the list, DOD began updating the MCTL to ensure that  each technology section had been updated at least once since our 2006  report.", "As part of these efforts to revamp the MCTL, DOD issued an instruction,  in 2008, that clarifies MCTL implementation by outlining roles and  responsibilities for informing the list\u2019s content, specifying procedures for  updating and maintaining the list, and designating the purposes for which  certain DOD components are to use the MCTL. Among other things, the  instruction:  specified that it is DOD policy that the MCTL serve as a technical  reference to inform the development and implementation of  technology security policies on international transfers of defense- related goods, services, and technologies; directed DTSA to consult the MCTL when developing DOD export  control proposals, processing export license requests, and making  technology transfer decisions;  specified that DOD components are to use the MCTL in making  decisions about what information can be shared with foreign entities  and provide subject matter expertise in identifying and assessing  technologies for the MCTL;  required the development of a methodology\u2014based on objective  criteria that produce logical and repeatable results\u2014for determining  whether a given technology is militarily critical; and accelerated the frequency of technology section updates from every 4  years to every 2 years to keep pace with technology development.", "DOD also planned to migrate its emerging technologies list to the MCTL  rather than maintaining two separate lists.", "According to program officials, the findings from our previous report  served as a roadmap for corrective action and informed the development  of a new concept of operations, drafted in 2010, which aims to implement  the MCTL program requirements outlined in the 2008 DOD instruction.

DOD provided $1.49 million for  the program in fiscal year 2012, which program officials say is not  sufficient to support the work needed to meet the DOD requirement to  update each technology section every 2 years. In light of expected  funding decreases that began in fiscal year 2012, officials decided not to  invest resources in updating MCTL sections and instead dedicated  resources to complete archiving of research material for section updates  that were underway. In the past 6 years, each section has been updated  at least once; however, the Militarily Critical Technologies Program has  not fully met its goal to update each section at least every 2 years in  accordance with the 2008 DOD instruction.

While funding was not reduced until fiscal  year 2012, none of the sections were updated in 2011 and only one  section\u2014space systems\u2014was updated in 2012 to support DOD\u2019s report  to Congress on the risks associated with moving certain satellite  components from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List.  Four sections were updated after 2009; however, none of these updates  have been validated, published, or made available to users, according to  officials. Technology areas that advance rapidly, such as information  security and information systems, have only been fully updated once in  the past 6 years. These two sections, along with sections on electronics;  biological; and position, navigation, and timing technologies, have been  prioritized for updates once resources become available given the  increasingly dated content in the MCTL, the technologies\u2019 impact on  national security, and the rate at which these technologies are being  produced.", "In light of the risks associated with using outdated content to support  technology protection decisions, in March 2011 program officials removed  access to the public version of the list from the DOD website that hosted  the list.

Instead, Commerce relies  on the technical and policy expertise of its staff and that of DOD, State,  and the Department of Energy to inform decisions on export licenses and  revisions to the Commerce Control List. Commerce officials reiterated  longstanding concerns that the MCTL is too broad to be useful in  reviewing individual export license applications. As early as 1982, soon  after the MCTL was established, we reported that Commerce found the  MCTL lacked the specificity needed to inform licensing decisions.2006, GAO again reported that Commerce officials were not using the list  because the content is too broad and is not current.

Under  the Export Administration Act, the MCTL is to be sufficiently specific to  guide export licensing decisions. However, DTSA, Commerce, and State  officials agreed that the MCTL lacks the specificity needed to inform such  decision making. In addition to export controls decisions, DTSA provides  input on behalf of DOD on decisions related to proposed foreign  acquisitions of U.S. companies to determine whether the transaction  involves technologies critical to U.S. interests. In its assessments of  militarily critical technologies for export controls or other purposes, DTSA  relies on its resident experts\u2014which includes 50 engineers, who are  considered to have unique knowledge of military and dual-use systems  and capabilities\u2014because these experts regularly consult with industry to  bolster their knowledge of new capabilities and technologies and  frequently seek the military services\u2019 perspectives on the exportability of  military and dual-use items.

According to DTSA officials, its network of experts has a greater  understanding of the technologies that DTSA reviews than can be  obtained from the MCTL because DTSA\u2019s network of experts can provide  up-to-date information about a rapidly-developing technology that is not  easily captured in a reference publication.", "While DTSA officials do not directly consult the MCTL, DTSA has  convened its own technical working groups, that, in the past, have  enlisted experts from the MCTL technology working groups to provide  assistance in developing and evaluating proposed changes to the  Wassenaar Arrangement\u2014a multilateral export control regime with 41  member countries that focuses on controlling the spread of certain  conventional arms and sensitive dual-use items.that disbanding the technology working groups has not adversely affected  DTSA\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities, since DTSA has its own in- house technology working groups, which draw from the same pool of  expertise as the MCTL technology working groups.", "An official from the Militarily Critical Technologies Program cautioned that  using DTSA\u2019s informal approach to determine critical technologies  impedes DOD\u2019s ability to maintain a record of these decisions for future  analysis and decision making and does not ensure the use of objective  criteria to produce repeatable results.

While these programs have  different missions, they refer to the MCTL and have integrated this  technical reference into their processes.

For example,", "DOD\u2019s Anti-Tamper Executive Agent integrated the MCTL into its  critical technology tool, which was developed to provide greater  consistency across DOD programs in identifying critical technologies  and determining whether anti-tamper solutions should be applied.  Using this tool, DOD acquisition program managers draw on the  MCTL in determining which technologies are critical to their weapon  systems and need anti-tamper protection to deter or delay exploitation  of critical technologies. While DOD anti-tamper officials had a  generally favorable view of the premise of the MCTL, they expressed  concerns about the currency of the list as well as delays in publishing  updated content, noting that in some instances, the content had  become outdated by the time the information was published. Similar  to Commerce officials, DOD anti-tamper officials noted that greater  specificity in describing critical parameters is needed for the MCTL to  be fully useful; however, this would require that the list be produced  as a classified reference. The critical technologies tool is intended to  be widely used across DOD and is also used by the defense industry,  which plays a role in the initial identification of critical technologies  and associated protective measures. Recently, DOD anti-tamper  officials met with industry representatives to discuss a range of issues  including the impact of suspending MCTL updates. Given the  suspension of MCTL technology assessments and updates, the list  may no longer be a viable reference for assisting in anti-tamper  decisions. As the MCTL content ages, the list may increasingly lose  relevance to ongoing acquisition programs. The absence of updates  for technologies that advance rapidly, such as microelectronics, could  render the related MCTL technology section unreliable. While a  replacement for the MCTL has not yet been identified, a Navy anti- tamper official noted that export control lists such as the Commerce  Control List or U.S. Munitions List would need to be bolstered with  additional information to provide the utility that the MCTL provides in  program protection efforts to be considered as potential alternatives.  Currently, however, as part of the President\u2019s export control reform  initiative, efforts are underway to restructure the U.S. Munitions List  and Commerce Control List in order to create a single positive control  list, which would describe items using objective criteria, such as  qualities to be measured\u2014accuracy, speed, and wavelength\u2014as well  as units of measure\u2014such as hertz and horsepower.

DSS had previously relied on the compendium of emerging  technologies for its analysis, but found it to be outdated and too broad  for its purposes. Despite the aging content and lack of updates, DSS  first reported using the MCTL in its 2011 report on foreign targeting of  U.S. technologies. DSS officials consider the MCTL to be a standard  reference that is recognized by the broader community involved in  identifying and protecting critical technologies. Unlike other users,  DSS does not require specificity in the MCTL, but uses the broader  descriptions of the technology areas. Given the lack of MCTL  updates, DSS officials considered adopting other references they had  identified within DOD, Commerce, and State.

Gaining an understanding of users\u2019 information requirements  on what is militarily critical is an important first step as DOD builds a case  for future program funding for the MCTL or other approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that there are widespread requirements to know what is  militarily critical, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the  following two actions:  1.  determine the best approach to meeting users\u2019 needs for a technical  reference, whether it be MCTL, other alternatives being used, or some  combination thereof; and  2.  ensure that resources are coordinated and efficiently devoted to  sustain the approach chosen.", "If DOD determines that the MCTL is not the optimal solution for aiding  programs\u2019 efforts to identify militarily critical technologies, we also  recommend that the Secretary of Defense seek necessary relief from  DOD\u2019s current responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of this report to DOD, Commerce, and State for their  review and comment.

We also reviewed various DOD policy documents such as DOD  Instruction 3020.46, The Militarily Critical Technologies List, which was  issued in 2008. We interviewed officials from the Militarily Critical  Technologies Program and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) about  initiatives or actions taken to address MCTL shortcomings and obtained  program funding data. Using program documentation and reviews of  MCTL content available on the IDA and Defense Technology Information  Center websites, we assessed DOD\u2019s efforts to update MCTL technology  sections in accordance with requirements set forth in DOD policy. We  also interviewed officials within DOD and the Departments of Commerce,  State, and Treasury to obtain their perspectives on the MCTL. We  compared DOD\u2019s efforts to enhance the MCTL with criteria in Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government specifically that agency  management should ensure there are adequate means of obtaining  information from external stakeholders who may have a significant impact  on the agency achieving its goals.", "To determine the extent to which programs use the MCTL as a resource  to identify critical technologies, we interviewed officials from DOD,  Commerce, State, and Treasury. These officials represent programs that  we have previously identified as central to the identification and protection  of critical technologies. (See appendix II for a description of these  programs.) Within DOD, we discussed use of the MCTL with officials from  various offices including the Anti-Tamper Executive Agent, Defense  Security Cooperation Agency, Defense Security Service, Defense  Technology Security Administration, Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Systems Engineering, and the U.S. Navy Anti-Tamper  Technical Authority. We also interviewed representatives from a defense  contractor and a federally funded research and development center about  their use of the MCTL. We also reviewed applicable statutory provisions  such as the Export Administration Act of 1979 to identify the purposes for  which the MCTL was established. To assess the degree to which the  MCTL has been integrated in various DOD program activities and  initiatives, we interviewed DOD officials and reviewed department and  military service-level guidance and policy documents regarding the use of  the MCTL to inform export control and other policy decisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 through January  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
