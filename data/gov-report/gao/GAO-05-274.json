DOD is expected to rely increasingly on contractors to carry out its mission. In recent reports, DOD has identified inadequate surveillance on service contracts. This report examines how DOD manages service contract surveillance. It looks at the extent of DOD's surveillance on a selection of service contracts, reasons why insufficient surveillance occurred, and efforts to improve surveillance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Surveillance varied on the 90 contracts we reviewed. Surveillance was insufficient on 26 of the contracts we reviewed but was sufficient on 64 contracts. Fifteen had no surveillance because no personnel were assigned such responsibilities; the other 11 had assigned personnel but could not provide evidence of surveillance due to incomplete documentation. Also, some surveillance personnel did not receive required training before beginning their assignments. According to DOD officials, insufficient surveillance occurred because surveillance is not as important to contracting officials as awarding contracts and therefore, does not receive the priority needed to ensure that surveillance occurs. The Army, unlike the Air Force and Navy organizations we visited, does not require surveillance personnel to be assigned responsibility prior to contract award. We also found that surveillance personnel involved in our review were not evaluated on how well they perform their surveillance duties. Further, surveillance was usually a part-time responsibility and some personnel felt that they did not have enough time in a normal workday to perform their surveillance duties. DOD has taken steps to implement provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 intended to improve the general management and oversight of service contract procurement and, in October 2004, DOD issued a policy that emphasized the proper use of other agencies' contracts. However, these efforts did little to improve service contract surveillance. On a more specific item, DOD did issue guidance that now requires appointment of surveillance personnel during the early planning phases of cost-reimbursable and time and materials service contracts. At the military service level, in April 2004, the Army revised its acquisition instructions and began requiring surveillance on some professional support service contracts; but, the revision did not apply to those contracts awarded before the enactment date that were still in effect."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is the federal government\u2019s largest  purchaser of contractor provided services and its spending on those  services has increased significantly over the past few years. Spending for  services has increased about 66 percent since fiscal year 1999 and this  trend is expected to continue as DOD increasingly relies more on  contractors to carry out aspects of its mission. In fiscal year 2003, DOD  spent over $118 billion on services\u2013about 57 percent of its procurement  dollars.", "Because of the increasing use of contractors and the large expenditures  involved, quality assurance surveillance\u2014oversight of the services being  performed by the contractor\u2014is important to provide assurance that  contractors are providing timely and quality services and to help mitigate  any contractor performance problems. Surveillance is not a one-step  process. It begins with properly training personnel for assignment of  surveillance responsibilities and involves ongoing surveillance actions  throughout the performance period of the contract to ensure the  government receives the services it contracted for in a timely manner.  Surveillance includes creating an official record documenting that the  contractor\u2019s performance was acceptable or unacceptable.", "Because of past problems with inadequate surveillance identified by DOD,  GAO reports determining that contract management and oversight has not  always been adequate, and DOD\u2019s increasing reliance on service  contracts, our overall review objective was to determine how DOD  manages service contract surveillance. To address this issue we  (1) examined the extent surveillance was performed on a selection of  service contracts, (2) identified reasons for why insufficient surveillance  occurred, and (3) identified recent efforts to help improve surveillance.", "To conduct our work, we met with representatives of the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military services to discuss how  contract surveillance is carried out across DOD and what efforts are being  made to improve surveillance. We also selected and reviewed 90 service  contracts and their associated surveillance records. The 90 contracts had a  total value of about $385.7 million at the time of contract award, but that  value has increased significantly over time. These contracts were awarded  primarily at three military commands within the military departments:  (1) the Army Contracting Agency\u2013North Region (ACA-North) at Fort  Monroe, Virginia; (2) the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) at the  Navy Ship Yard, Washington, D.C.; and (3) the Air Force Materiel  Command (AFMC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Each of  these organizations spends significant funding for services within their  respective military department. Although our results are not projectable  across all of DOD\u2019s service contracts, they are illustrative of the challenges  involved in conducting surveillance for services.  We contacted  contracting officers, surveillance personnel, and procurement  management officials associated with each of the selected contracts to  obtain information about surveillance. We did not include research and  development contracts or construction contracts in the contracts selected  because the surveillance process typically differs for these types of  contracts. A more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is in  appendix I. We conducted our review from January 2004 to February 2005  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the federal government classify procurements as either the  purchase of goods or services. DOD procures many types of services  ranging from research and development efforts on major weapon systems  to operating military installations.  Service contracts, because they involve  the contractor providing a service rather than a good, by nature require  different approaches in describing requirements and overseeing contractor  performance than the purchases of goods.  DOD spends more of its  procurement funds on services than it does on goods. Moreover, DOD  spends significantly more than any other federal agency on services. DOD  spending on services has been increasing significantly over the last several  years\u2014about 66 percent since fiscal year 1999\u2014to a level of $118 billion in  fiscal year 2003 (see fig. 1).", "Surveillance and documentation that it occurred are required by the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Moreover, documentation is  necessary to help ensure accountability over the surveillance process.  Surveillance involves government oversight of contractors with the  purpose of ensuring that the contractor (the service provider) performs  the requirements of the contract and the government (the service receiver  or customer) receives the service as intended. Surveillance begins with  trained personnel being nominated for and assigned surveillance  responsibilities, and then conducting surveillance actions throughout the  performance period of the contract to ensure the government receives the  services required by the contract.", "While surveillance is required by the DFARS, specific methods are not  prescribed. DOD organizations use various methods to conduct  surveillance, ranging from formal written assessments (monthly, semi- annually, or annually) of contractor performance prepared by DOD  surveillance personnel to more informal observations or inspections of  contractor performance by surveillance personnel. The methods used  generally relate to the dollar value of the contract and the risk associated  with the service being provided.", "Proper documentation of surveillance is required. Proper documentation  is not only stressed in the DFARS but also in other DOD guidance that  requires performance-based service contracts,\u2014which DOD is requiring  to be used more often in the acquisition of services\u2014to have a surveillance  plan. Surveillance of contractor performance should be documented as it  is conducted. DOD guidance maintains that this documentation  constitutes an official record and the surveillance personnel assessing  performance are to use a checklist to record their observations of the  contractor\u2019s performance. The guidance also concludes that all  performance should be documented whether it is acceptable or not.", "Surveillance personnel are usually not considered part of DOD\u2019s  acquisition workforce. Instead, surveillance personnel represent the DOD  functional organization receiving the service and are usually assigned  surveillance as an ancillary responsibility in addition to their primary job.  For example, if a DOD weapon system program office (a functional  organization) has a need to contract for professional support services, the  program office would assist the contracting officer by defining contract  requirements and methods of contractor performance and by nominating  an official to serve as the surveillance personnel. Surveillance personnel  are likely to be full-time employees of the DOD organization needing the  service and are generally knowledgeable about the aspects of the service  to be provided by the contractor. This knowledge is useful in assessing  contractor performance. However, it is the contracting officer\u2019s  responsibility to assign surveillance personnel and to ensure that  surveillance is conducted on the contract. The surveillance personnel act  as a liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor. If less than  adequate contractor performance is noted by the surveillance personnel,  they notify the contracting officer as a first step toward corrective action.  Appendix II shows in more detail the roles of contracting officers and  surveillance personnel.", "Congressional concern over the management of DOD\u2019s growing services  procurement led Congress to include provisions in section 801 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 designed to  improve management and oversight of services procurement and reinforce  compliance with all applicable statutes, regulations, directives, and other  requirements, regardless of whether the services were procured through  DOD contracts or those of another agency. We have previously reported  on section 801, but at that time DOD had not completely determined how  to implement specifics of the legislation. In our prior report, we stated  that DOD and the military departments had a management structure and a  process in place for reviewing individual acquisitions valued at  $500 million or more, but the approach did not provide a departmentwide  assessment of how spending for services could be more effective.", "In October 2004, to help reinforce the requirements of section 801, DOD  issued a policy designed to emphasize the proper use of other agencies\u2019  contracts. DOD spends  billions of dollars every year using other agencies\u2019  contracts and is the largest purchaser of services from GSA\u2019s multiple  award schedules program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sufficiency of Service Contract Surveillance Varied", "paragraphs": ["The use of surveillance varied on the 90 contracts we reviewed.  While 26  of the 90 DOD contracts we reviewed had insufficient surveillance, 64  contracts had sufficient, documented surveillance that in some instances  was extensive. More specifically, 25 of the 26 contracts with insufficient  surveillance were contracts for services that DOD obtained by using GSA  contracts available under its multiple award schedules program. In  addition, 13 surveillance personnel had not completed required training  prior to being assigned surveillance responsibilities. Our review also found  that 64 contracts had sufficient, documented surveillance and in some of  these instances, surveillance was extensive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surveillance Personnel Not Always Assigned and Surveillance Documentation Insufficient", "paragraphs": ["For the 90 DOD service contracts we reviewed, 26 of the contracts  (29 percent) had insufficient surveillance in that they lacked assigned  surveillance personnel or complete documentation of surveillance. Of  these 26 contracts, 15 contracts had no surveillance personnel assigned.  Additionally, 11 of the 26 contracts had insufficient documentation to  show if surveillance was occurring. Table 1 summarizes our findings for  the 90 contracts and shows that there were more instances of insufficient  surveillance related to the Army contracts compared to the Navy. All of  the Air Force contracts we reviewed had surveillance. (See app. III for a  more detailed summary of the 90 contracts.)", "Our further analyses of the 90 contracts found only one common  characteristic as to whether surveillance was affected by other contractual  factors. Specifically, we found that of the 45 interagency contracts we  reviewed where DOD awarded them using GSA\u2019s multiple award  schedules program, 25 had insufficient surveillance. GAO has recently  identified issues with DOD\u2019s use of interagency contracts in general and  reported that they were not being effectively managed.", "We also found that the contract award amount was not always a good  indication of the total value of the services that needed to be surveilled.  While the award amount of the 90 contracts we reviewed was  $385.7 million in fiscal year 2003, the amount of funds obligated on about  one-half of these contracts had grown to about $1.5 billion as of November  2004. We found that for some of the 15 contracts without surveillance  personnel assigned, the contract amounts have more than tripled over the  course of the contract. For example, one Army contract for educational  services was awarded for $271,690 but had increased to $900,125.", "We did not find that the sufficiency of surveillance was related to other  factors, including type of service contract (fixed price or cost- reimbursable), type of services being procured, use of performance-based  contract methods, or dollar value at award. For some of the contracts  without sufficient documentation of surveillance, we asked the personnel  how the government\u2019s interests were being protected. They told us they  were conducting surveillance, but they had not been keeping documented  records to verify surveillance had taken place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surveillance Personnel Training Not Always Completed Prior to Surveillance Beginning", "paragraphs": ["Surveillance training, despite DOD regulations requiring such training, was  not always completed prior to personnel being assigned surveillance  responsibilities. Such training explains their responsibilities and identifies  methods of conducting surveillance. On the contracts we reviewed,  13 surveillance personnel had not received the required training. Without  timely training, surveillance personnel may not know how to perform their  duties. We found examples of this late training at each of the commands  we visited including 10 instances at AFMC, 2 instances at NAVSEA, and 1  instance at ACA-North. In some cases, surveillance personnel had not  completed training until several months after assignment to a contract.

The 64 contracts included  20 that were awarded using GSA\u2019s multiple award schedules program.  The amount of surveillance varied depending on the type of service being  provided. In some instances, the surveillance was a very detailed, rigorous  process. For example, one Navy contract we reviewed involved critical  submarine hull repair. The surveillance on the services was extensive and  involved Navy personnel and an independent specialist using live video to  observe all the repairs in real time. For lower risk contracts, such as one  involving maintenance of an Army recruiting internet site, surveillance  was significantly less formal because the contractor and surveillance  personnel actually shared office space and had daily interaction.", "If surveillance is done properly, it has the potential to identify poor  contractor performance and mitigate problems on a contract. For  example, on one of the contracts we reviewed, AFMC was having  problems with a custodial contract worth approximately $3 million. The  surveillance personnel assigned to the job followed the surveillance plan  and documented observations and customer complaints that the  contractor was not meeting some of the contract requirements for a few  consecutive months. In each instance, the contractor was asked to re- perform the tasks that were deemed unacceptable and the surveillance  personnel informed the contracting officer of the issues. As the problems  continued, the contracting officer involved the contractor\u2019s corporate  headquarters and arranged a meeting to resolve the underlying problems.  Two main problems were identified. Some tasks the government expected  to be performed were not in the contract, and the contractor was  providing poor service on other tasks. Both of these problems were  remedied and surveillance showed the contractor subsequently received  high ratings. Another example where surveillance caught insufficient  performance was on a NAVSEA contract worth approximately $14 million.  The surveillance on this contract was structured so that the government  would rate each contractor employee\u2019s performance. Two contract  employees were not performing as required and the corporate  headquarters subsequently replaced both of them within in a few months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFMC and NAVSEA Practices Help Provide Sufficient Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["NAVSEA and AFMC have policies that help ensure that surveillance begins  as soon as possible on contracts.

In contrast, the Army and ACA-North have no policy  requiring surveillance personnel be assigned at or before contract award.  Of the 26 contracts we identified as having insufficient surveillance, 16  were Army contracts, including 9 ACA-North contracts. The Air Force  requires a team be created prior to the award of service contracts.

Contracting officials told us that their primary  objective is to get the necessary contracts awarded in order to support the  functional office (the service customer) and that delaying a contract award  because of delays in the assignment or training of surveillance personnel  does not normally occur. It is the assignment of surveillance personnel  that is usually delayed until after contract award because contracting  officers cannot assign them until they are nominated by the functional  office.
