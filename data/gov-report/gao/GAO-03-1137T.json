In the last 2 years, laws have been passed that will require a more extensive use of biometric technologies in the federal government.

Biometric technologies vary in complexity, capabilities, and performance and can be used to verify or establish a person's identity. Leading biometric technologies include facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina recognition, signature recognition, and speaker recognition. Biometric technologies have been used in federal applications such as access control, criminal identification, and border security. However, it is important to bear in mind that effective security cannot be achieved by relying on technology alone. Technology and people must work together as part of an overall security process. Weaknesses in any of these areas diminishes the effectiveness of the security process. The security process needs to account for limitations in biometric technology. For example, some people cannot enroll in a biometrics system. Similarly, errors sometimes occur during matching operations. Procedures need to be developed to handle these situations. Exception processing that is not as good as biometric-based primary processing could also be exploited as a security hole. We have found that three key considerations need to be addressed before a decision is made to design, develop, and implement biometrics into a security system: (1) decisions must be made on how the technology will be used; (2) a detailed cost-benefit analysis must be conducted to determine that the benefits gained from a system outweigh the costs; and (3) a trade-off analysis must be conducted between the increased security, which the use of biometrics would provide, and the effect on areas such as privacy and convenience. Security concerns need to be balanced with practical cost and operational considerations as well as political and economic interests. A risk management approach can help federal agencies identify and address security concerns. As federal agencies consider the development of security systems with biometrics, they need to define what the high-level goals of this system will be and develop the concept of operations that will embody the people, process, and technologies required to achieve these goals. With these answers, the proper role of biometric technologies in security can be determined. If these details are not resolved, the estimated cost and performance of the resulting system will be at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the use of  smart cards and biometrics in the federal government.

For  example, members of a community routinely recognize one another by  how they look or how their voices sound\u2014by something they are.  Automated teller machines (ATM) recognize customers from their  presentation of a bank card\u2014something they have\u2014and their entering a  personal identification number (PIN)\u2014something they know.

The distinctive features are located and one or more  samples are extracted, encoded, and stored as a reference template for  future comparisons. Depending on the technology, the biometric sample  may be collected as an image, a recording, or a record of related dynamic  measurements. How biometric systems extract features and encode and  store information in the template is based on the system vendor\u2019s  proprietary algorithms. Template size varies depending on the vendor and  the technology. Templates can be stored remotely in a central database or  within a biometric reader device itself; their small size also allows for  storage on smart cards or tokens.", "Minute changes in positioning, distance, pressure, environment, and other  factors influence the generation of a template, making each template likely  to be unique, each time an individual\u2019s biometric data are captured and a  new template is generated. Consequently, depending on the biometric  system, a person may need to present biometric data several times in  order to enroll. Either the reference template may then represent an  amalgam of the captured data or several enrollment templates may be  stored. The quality of the template or templates is critical in the overall  success of the biometric application. Because biometric features can  change over time, people may have to reenroll to update their reference  template. Some technologies can update the reference template during  matching operations.", "The enrollment process also depends on the quality of the identifier the  enrollee presents.

Therefore, biometric systems can be configured to make a  match or no-match decision, based on a predefined number, referred to as  a threshold, that establishes the acceptable degree of similarity between  the trial template and the enrolled reference template. After the  comparison, a score representing the degree of similarity is generated, and  this score is compared to the threshold to make a match or no-match  decision.

For example, an individual\u2019s biometric data may have changed  as a result of aging or injury. If biometric systems were perfect, both error  rates would be zero. However, because biometric systems cannot identify  individuals with 100 percent accuracy, a trade-off exists between the two.", "False match and nonmatch rates are inversely related; they must therefore  always be assessed in tandem, and acceptable risk levels must be balanced  with the disadvantages of inconvenience. For example, in access control,  perfect security would require denying access to everyone. Conversely,  granting access to everyone would result in denying access to no one.  Obviously, neither extreme is reasonable, and biometric systems must  operate somewhere between the two.", "For most applications, how much risk one is willing to tolerate is the  overriding factor, which translates into determining the acceptable FMR.  The greater the risk entailed by a false match, the lower the tolerable FMR.  For example, an application that controlled access to a secure area would  require that the FMR be set low, which would result in a high FNMR.  However, an application that controlled access to a bank\u2019s ATM might  have to sacrifice some degree of security and set a higher FMR (and hence  a lower FNMR) to avoid the risk of irritating legitimate customers by  wrongly rejecting them. As figure 3 shows, selecting a lower FMR  increases the FNMR. Perfect security would require setting the FMR to 0,  in which case the FNMR would be 1. At the other extreme, setting the  FNMR to 0 would result in an FMR of 1.", "Vendors often use equal error rate (EER), an additional metric derived  from FMR and FNMR, to describe the accuracy of their biometric systems.  EER refers to the point at which FMR equals FNMR. Setting a system\u2019s  threshold at its EER will result in the probability that a person is falsely  matched equaling the probability that a person is falsely not matched.  However, this statistic tends to oversimplify the balance between FMR and  FNMR, because in few real-world applications is the need for security  identical to the need for convenience.", "FTER is a biometric system\u2019s third critical accuracy metric. FTER  measures the probability that a person will be unable to enroll. Failure to  enroll (FTE) may stem from an insufficiently distinctive biometric sample  or from a system design that makes it difficult to provide consistent  biometric data. The fingerprints of people who work extensively at manual  labor are often too worn to be captured.

In doing so, the advantages and benefits of these countermeasures must  also be weighed against their disadvantages and costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protection, Detection, and Reaction Are Integral Security Concepts", "paragraphs": ["Countermeasures identified through the risk management process support  the three integral concepts of a holistic security program: protection,  detection, and reaction. Protection provides countermeasures such as  policies, procedures, and technical controls to defend against attacks on  the assets being protected. Detection monitors for potential breakdowns  in protective mechanisms that could result in security breaches. Reaction,  which requires human involvement, responds to detected breaches to  thwart attacks before damage can be done. Because absolute protection is  impossible to achieve, a security program that does not incorporate  detection and reaction is incomplete.", "Biometrics can support the protection component of a security program. It  is important to realize that deploying them will not automatically eliminate  all security risks. Technology is not a solution in isolation. Effective  security also entails having a well-trained staff to follow and enforce  policies and procedures. Weaknesses in the security process or failures by  people to operate the technology or implement the security process can  diminish the effectiveness of technology.", "Furthermore, there is a need for the security process to account for  limitations in technology. Biometrics can help ensure that people can only  enroll into a security system once and to ensure that a person presenting  himself before the security system is the same person that enrolled into  the system. However, biometrics cannot necessarily link a person to his or  her true identity. While biometrics would make it more difficult for people  to establish multiple identities, if the one identity a person claimed were  not his or her true identity, then the person would be linked to the false  identity in the biometric system. The quality of the identifier presented  during the enrollment process is key to the integrity of a biometrics  system.", "Procedures for exception processing would also need to be carefully  planned. As we described, not all people can enroll in a biometrics system.  Similarly, false matches and false nonmatches will also sometimes occur.  Procedures need to be developed to handle these situations. Exception  processing that is not as good as biometric-based primary processing  could be exploited as a security hole."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deciding to Use Biometric Technology", "paragraphs": ["A decision to use biometrics in a security solution should also consider the  benefits and costs of the system and the potential effects on convenience  and privacy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weighing Costs and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Best practices for information technology investment dictate that prior to  making any significant project investment, the benefit and cost  information of the system should be analyzed and assessed in detail. A  business case should be developed that identifies the organizational needs  for the project and a clear statement of high-level system goals should be  developed. The high-level goals should address the system\u2019s expected  outcomes such as the binding of a biometric feature to an identity or the  identification of undesirable individuals on a watch list. Certain  performance parameters should also be specified such as the time  required to verify a person\u2019s identity or the maximum population that the  system must handle.", "Once the system parameters are developed, a cost estimate can be  developed. Not only must the costs of the technology be considered, but  also the costs of the effects on people and processes. Both initial costs and  recurring costs need to be estimated. Initial costs need to account for the  engineering efforts to design, develop, test, and implement the system;  training of personnel; hardware and software costs; network  infrastructure improvements; and additional facilities required to enroll  people into the biometric system. Recurring cost elements include  program management costs, hardware and software maintenance,  hardware replacement costs, training of personnel, additional personnel to  enroll or verify the identities of people in the biometric system, and  possibly the issuance of token cards for the storage of biometrics.", "Weighed against these costs are the security benefits that accrue from the  system. Analyzing this cost-benefit trade-off is crucial when choosing  specific biometrics-based solutions. The consequences of performance  issues\u2014for example, accuracy problems, and their effect on processes and  people\u2014are also important in selecting a biometrics solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects on Privacy and Convenience", "paragraphs": ["The Privacy Act of 1974 limits federal agencies\u2019 collection, use, and  disclosure of personal information, such as fingerprints and photographs.  Accordingly, the Privacy Act generally covers federal agency use of  personal biometric information. However, the act includes exemptions for  law enforcement and national security purposes. Representatives of civil  liberties groups and privacy experts have expressed concerns regarding  (1) the adequacy of protections for security, data sharing, identity theft,  and other identified uses of biometric data and (2) secondary uses and  \u201cfunction creep.\u201d These concerns relate to the adequacy of protections  under current law for large-scale data handling in a biometric system.  Besides information security, concern was voiced about an absence of  clear criteria for governing data sharing. The broad exemptions of the  Privacy Act, for example, provide no guidance on the extent of the  appropriate uses law enforcement may make of biometric information.  Because there is no general agreement on the appropriate balance of  security and privacy to build into a system using biometrics, further policy  decisions are required. The range of unresolved policy issues suggests that  questions surrounding the use of biometric technology center as much on  management policies as on technical issues.", "Finally, consideration must be given to the convenience and ease of using  biometrics and their effect on the ability of the agency to complete its  mission. For example, some people find biometric technologies difficult, if  not impossible, to use. Still others resist biometrics because they believe  them to be intrusive, inherently offensive, or just uncomfortable to use.  Lack of cooperation or even resistance to using biometrics can affect a  system\u2019s performance and widespread adoption.", "Furthermore, if the processes to use biometrics are lengthy or erroneous,  they could negatively affect the ability of the assets being protected to  operate and fulfill its mission. For example, last year, we found that there  are significant challenges in using biometrics for border security. The use  of biometric technologies could potentially impact the length of the  inspection process. Any lengthening in the process of obtaining travel  documents or entering the United States could affect travelers  significantly. Delays inconvenience travelers and could result in fewer  visits to the United States or lost business to the nation. Further studies  could help determine whether the increased security from biometrics  could result in fewer visits to the United States or lost business to the  nation, potentially adversely affecting the American economy and, in  particular, the border communities. These communities depend on trade  with Canada and Mexico, which totaled $653 billion in 2000.", "In conclusion, biometric technologies are available today that can be used  in security systems to help protect assets. However, it is important to bear  in mind that effective security cannot be achieved by relying on  technology alone. Technology and people must work together as part of an  overall security process. As we have pointed out, weaknesses in any of  these areas diminishes the effectiveness of the security process. We have  found that three key considerations need to be addressed before a  decision is made to design, develop, and implement biometrics into a  security system:  1.  Decisions must be made on how the technology will be used.  2.  A detailed cost-benefit analysis must be conducted to determine that  the benefits gained from a system outweigh the costs.  3.  A trade-off analysis must be conducted between the increased  security, which the use of biometrics would provide, and the effect on  areas such as privacy and convenience.", "Security concerns need to be balanced with practical cost and operational  considerations as well as political and economic interests. A risk  management approach can help federal agencies identify and address  security concerns. As federal agencies consider the development of  security systems with biometrics, they need to define what the high-level  goals of this system would be and develop the concept of operations that  will embody the people, process, and technologies required to achieve  these goals. With these answers, the proper role of biometric technologies  in security can be determined. If these details are not resolved, the  estimated cost and performance of the resulting system will be at risk.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
