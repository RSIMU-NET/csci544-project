Security enhancements include additional security personnel, facility upgrades, and equipment and technology. Planned enhancements include the installation of permanent security barriers to protect against vehicle bombs. Public access and aesthetic considerations are integral to the design and approval of security enhancements on the National Mall. Federal agencies must coordinate with reviewing organizations, such as the National Capital Planning Commission, and consider aesthetics, historic preservation, urban design, urban planning, and environmental effects when implementing security enhancements. Although federal agencies reported that the review process can be time-consuming, review organizations noted that early and frequent consultation with them helps to ensure a smoother, more efficient, and expeditious review process. GAO's survey of about 300 visitors to the National Mall, and reports from federal agencies, indicate that visitors value access to and the appearance of the National Mall and generally find the current level of security enhancements acceptable. GAO's survey results also suggest that visitors regard access and aesthetics as important priorities when adding security enhancements to the National Mall. Federal agencies on the National Mall reported using five of the six key practices identified by GAO--allocating resources using risk management, leveraging technology, information-sharing and coordination, performance management and testing, and strategic management of human capital--in implementing physical security enhancements. However, none of the federal agencies on the National Mall reported using the key practice of aligning assets to mission in implementing security measures because they believe they do not have excess or underutilized facilities or consider the practice applicable to property under their jurisdiction. Agencies identified balancing ongoing mission priorities with the need for security as a common challenge in using key practices to implement physical security enhancements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, increased attention has  been given to protecting our nation\u2019s key assets, whose destruction could  result not only in the loss of life, but in the loss of irreplaceable items from  American history and of structures that have come to symbolize America  worldwide.

The L\u2019Enfant Plan of 1791 envisioned the National  Mall as a grand avenue beginning at the U.S. Capitol and extending west to  the current site of the Washington Monument. The McMillan Commission  Plan of 1901-1902 extended the National Mall further west and south to the  future sites of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. Multiple geographic  definitions of the National Mall exist. For example, the narrowest definition  of the National Mall encompasses the area between 1st and 14th Streets and  Constitution and Independence Avenues. Broader definitions of the  National Mall extend its boundaries to include the grounds of the  Washington Monument and the grounds of the Lincoln and Jefferson  Memorials, while other definitions also include the U.S. Capitol, the White  House, the Ellipse, and West Potomac Park.

In addition, they noted  that the height of the barriers will be adjusted in certain locations to  achieve a better appearance and scale, improve pedestrian movement and  accessibility, and provide space for visitors to sit on the barriers  themselves. Similarly, the physical security enhancements to the  Washington Monument that were under construction during our review  were designed to ensure consistency in the historical landscaping of the  grounds and in the spaces for visitors\u2019 recreation. Although the Park  Service developed alternative design proposals, including the one depicted  in the figure below (right), the selected design includes a regrading of the  Monument grounds and the construction of retaining walls that are  intended to disappear into the landscape (see fig. 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Organizations Work with National Mall Agencies to Design and Review Security Enhancements", "paragraphs": ["Several organizations work with the agencies that have facilities on the  National Mall to ensure that security enhancements reflect access and  aesthetic concerns.

In addition, because security  enhancements may affect the historic character of properties on the  National Mall, federal agencies are required to follow the NHPA\u2019s Section  106 review process. This process has federal agencies consider the effects  of their actions on historic property and address \u201cadverse effects\u201d that  could diminish the integrity of the property. Federal agencies are  responsible for initiating the review process and for consulting with the  SHPO on measures to deal with any adverse effects.

NCPC must give approval before a security  enhancement project can be implemented. CFA officials told us they focus  on visual appearance and on how security enhancements can be physically  integrated into the urban environment. Although agencies must submit  security designs to CFA, the commission plays an advisory role in  reviewing security projects and cannot enforce agencies to implement its  recommendations.

Of particular concern, officials of these agencies noted the   seeming overlap in consultations and reviews of projects required among  the review organizations. For example, Park Service officials told us that in  submitting a security proposal, one review organization might request a  particular change to the design, and another organization might request an  entirely different change. Sometimes, consensus on the design of a security  project had been reached at the staff level within a review organization, but  the commissioners within that organization then had different ideas about  the project\u2019s design. For example, designs for security enhancements for  the eastern portion of the Lincoln Memorial have gone before the CFA\u2019s  commissioners several times for their review. Furthermore, some agency  officials noted that the commissioners from CFA and NCPC might disagree  on a particular security design. According to officials from the Park  Service, there is currently no guidance available to assist agencies in  moving forward on proposals that receive contradictory direction. These  officials suggested that in such cases, commissioners, rather than staff,  from both review organizations should consult with one another to resolve  their differences and provide guidance to the agency on moving forward.  While CFA officials acknowledged that there is no formal process for  resolving disagreements between commissions, they noted several options  for reconciling such differences. For example, in some cases, agencies may  be able to circulate revised drawings to the commissions in between formal  meetings, or the commissions might delegate approval authority to the staff  level, pending modifications. Finally, the public can comment on security  proposals affecting the National Mall. As a result of competing stakeholder  interests, it can take months or even years to go through the review  process.", "The perimeter security designs for the Washington Monument illustrate the  effects multiple stakeholders can have on a proposed security project\u2019s  design and schedule. Officials from the Park Service told us that a  preliminary design for the Washington Monument was selected in  December 2001. The design consisted primarily of landscape barriers that  would provide perimeter security and an underground visitor screening  facility. The Park Service submitted its design to CFA at this time, and,  according to both parties, CFA approved the vehicular barrier portion of  the design with only minor changes. In addition, Park Service officials  told us that they submitted the security design to NCPC in January 2002  and received final approval for the perimeter security portion of the design  in June 2003. Park Service officials noted the approval process for the  Washington Monument design was relatively quick. However, the design for  the underground screening facility did not receive final approval from CFA  and received only preliminary approval from NCPC before the  underground screening facility project was canceled. According to CFA  officials, the screening facility as planned would have drastically changed  how visitors accessed the Monument, and it was not an effective security  proposal. CFA officials told us they proposed a number of alternatives for  this portion of the project, but the Park Service rejected them. According to  CFA officials, they have not recently discussed this project with the Park  Service. Park Service officials told us that the concept for the underground  screening facility was abandoned because of significant resistance from a  number of stakeholders and because Congress never approved funding for  the measure. Park Service officials told us the temporary screening facility  that was in place before the Washington Monument was under construction  will be put back until a permanent screening facility is designed.", "Review organizations also identified challenges in the review process for  implementing security enhancements on the National Mall. Review  organizations said they have concerns about their budgets and staff  resources. Officials from these organizations told us that the number of   security projects submitted for their review has greatly increased since the  September 11 terrorist attacks. However, officials noted that they have not  received additional funding or staff to respond to the increase in proposals.  In addition, officials from CFA and NCPC noted that some agencies do not  always justify the need for a particular security enhancement or identify  the threat that the agency is trying to protect against. Officials from CFA  noted that this type of information is helpful in developing a design that  meets the needs of both the agency and the review organization.  Furthermore, officials from CFA also noted that when applicants come to  them after a project already has been designed, the applicant is often  reluctant to make any changes or consider alternative approaches because  of the time and money already invested. Finally, both federal agencies and  the review organizations noted that the limited number of security designs  available to secure facilities in an urban environment presents a challenge  in implementing security enhancements. Park Service officials noted that  the technology available for perimeter security consists primarily of vehicle  barrier systems (e.g., bollards, walls, and strengthened street furniture).  However, these officials noted that the review organizations often do not  approve security designs that exclusively consist of bollards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Mall Agencies and Review Organizations Identified Steps That Can Make the Review Process More Efficient", "paragraphs": ["Several agency officials, along with the review organizations, stated that  early and frequent consultation helps to ensure a smoother, more efficient  review process. Both the agencies and the review organizations noted that  informal consultations between all parties should continue throughout the  design of the security project. Informal consultations can begin before  \u201cputting pen to paper\u201d and should occur during the project\u2019s preliminary  design phase. According to these officials, security proposals, in particular,  benefit from these early consultations because of their importance and  sensitivity. Both the review organizations and the federal agencies  identified the following additional actions that could lead to a more  efficient review process:  Consult early and frequently with all relevant stakeholders: Consulting  with all of the review organizations that play a role in the design and  approval of security enhancements at the same time not only facilitates  a more efficient review process, but doing so can also improve relations  between agencies and review organizations over time. In addition,  consulting with all stakeholders allows for the expression of everyone\u2019s  views and concerns up front. Moreover, consultation with the staff and,  in some cases with the commissioners of the review organizations,  allows them to react informally to a proposed design, thereby giving  agencies the opportunity to incorporate their opinions into the proposal.  Officials from NCPC told us that their commissioners and CFA\u2019s  commissioners might disagree on a design proposal because they are  providing a first reaction to a design that was not previously discussed  during informal consultations. In such cases, agencies may have to go  back through the review process to meet everyone\u2019s needs, which can  take several additional months or even years, in addition to costing the  agency financial and staff resources. However, officials from the review  organizations noted that disagreements between the two commissions  occur infrequently, perhaps once a year. According to the Park Service,  disagreements between the two commissions seem to occur more often  with security projects that include some of our nation\u2019s memorials. For  example, Park Service officials noted that they have received different  direction from the two commissions on the Washington Monument,  Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial security projects.", "In considering a design for its perimeter security projects, the  Smithsonian consulted with all of the review organizations before  developing a concept design. The parties discussed different design  options, and the Smithsonian was able to incorporate the review  organizations\u2019 comments and suggestions into its proposal. According  to CFA, the Smithsonian also selected a designer that considered the  needs of the agency and the balance between security and access and  urban design. Smithsonian officials believe that the success of their  efforts hinged on bringing to the table experts from their offices of  Protection Services; Historic Preservation; and Engineering, Design,  and Construction who were willing to engage in dialogue and answer  questions from the review organizations. As a result, the Smithsonian  received favorable reviews of their preliminary design for security  enhancements from all of the stakeholders.

In particular,  some officials stressed the importance of taking time to develop a  security solution built on the opinions and consensus of all  stakeholders. According to these officials, this approach will ultimately  result in stronger working relationships and a design solution that takes  both security and urban design issues into consideration.", "Officials from CFA told us that the Departments of Energy and  Education developed successful security designs because they  consulted early and were open to considering alternative proposals.  For  example, according to CFA, Energy\u2019s ideas for security designs at one of  its Washington, D.C., facilities were not appropriate for an urban  environment. However, through consultations with the review  organizations, Energy was able to design a better security project that  will be less costly than the one it originally designed. Similarly,  Education developed a proposal for renovating its plaza but did not  incorporate any security enhancements into the design. However,  because Education consulted with the review organizations before  going too far in the design process, it was able to incorporate security  features into the design. As a result, Education avoided later costly  revisions to the project.", "Consult urban planning documents such as NCPC\u2019s submission  guidelines and Urban Design and Security Plan: Agencies submitting  project proposals to NCPC for review and approval are required to  follow NCPC\u2019s submission guidelines. The guidelines include NCPC\u2019s  requirements for various phases of project proposals as well as NCPC\u2019s  environmental and historic preservation procedures. The submission  guidelines also outline suggestions for coordinating stages of the review  process. For example, agencies can initiate the NEPA and NHPA review  processes simultaneously and plan their public participation, analysis,  and review so as to meet the purposes and requirements of both statutes  in a timely and efficient manner. The Security Plan provides a  framework for planning, designing, and implementing security  enhancements and focuses exclusively on incorporating perimeter  security measures into existing streetscape or landscape features.

For  example, Park Service officials told us they used the plan to develop  concept designs for the Washington Monument as well as the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. Similarly, the Smithsonian developed plans  to replace planter pots, industrial-looking vehicle barriers, and other  temporary security measures with custom-designed elements,  including benches, light poles, urns, and bollards, that complement the  historic surroundings of the National Mall (see fig. 6).

Finally, officials from one agency noted that a lack of reliable,  quantitative risk assessment data and little consistency in interpreting  information and intelligence obtained from various sources create a  challenge in using key practices to implement security measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The security of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure remains a heightened  concern in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. On the  National Mall, federal agencies are in the early stages of designing and  implementing permanent perimeter security barriers to protect their  facilities and the visiting public. In doing so, agencies have coordinated  with a number of review organizations that consider the impact of  proposed security designs on the urban environment and the symbolic  nature of the National Mall, its icons, and its museums. Multiple  stakeholder viewpoints on the design of security enhancements present a  challenge for an efficient review process. In some cases, agencies involved  stakeholders after investing time and resources in a particular security  design. As a result, these agencies sometimes had to go through multiple  iterations of the review process, which can strain the already limited  financial and staff resources of all stakeholders.", "As agencies continue developing security proposals for their facilities on  the National Mall, several steps, such as early and frequent consultation  with all stakeholders, can result in a more efficient review process.  Specifically, consultation in the preliminary design phase allows for the  consideration of multiple viewpoints and alternative design solutions,  thereby mitigating the potential for later costly and time-consuming  revisions. Such early consultation could also expedite the implementation  of security enhancements to protect facilities and visitors on the National  Mall.", "Key practices, such as allocating resources using risk management,  coordinating protection efforts with other stakeholders, and aligning assets  to mission, have clear implications for the facility protection area. As we  have recently recommended, it is important that agencies give attention to  these practices and consider them collectively as a framework for guiding  their ongoing efforts in implementing security measures on the National  Mall and in their overall facility protection areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to the Smithsonian, Interior, USDA,  and National Gallery for their review and comment.

At that time, we will send copies of this report to other  interested congressional committees; the Secretaries of Agriculture, the  Interior, and Smithsonian; and the Director of the National Gallery. We will  also make copies available to others upon request.

We also interviewed officials of the National Park Service  (Park Service), U.S. Park Police, Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian),  National Gallery of Art (National Gallery), Department of Agriculture  (USDA), U.S. Botanic Garden (USBG), U.S. Capitol Police, National Capital  Planning Commission, U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Advisory Council for  Historic Preservation, District of Columbia\u2019s Historic Preservation Office,  Department of Homeland Security, and National Coalition to Save Our Mall.", "While multiple geographic definitions of the National Mall exist, we defined  the area of the National Mall, for purposes of our report, as extending from  the foot of the U.S. Capitol grounds west to the Washington Monument and  proceeding farther west and southeast to include the Lincoln and Jefferson  Memorials. It also includes the area between Constitution and  Independence Avenues between 1st and 14th Streets. We did not include the  White House or the U.S. Capitol Building because security enhancements  for these buildings fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Secret Service and  the U.S. Capitol Police, respectively.", "In addition, for our first objective, we reviewed federal appropriations law  and accompanying legislative materials, budget reports, and federal  agencies\u2019 and entities\u2019 budget submissions related to physical security  enhancements on the National Mall; we also received information about  obligations and costs associated with physical security enhancements on  the National Mall since the terrorist attacks of September 11. Agencies on  the National Mall provided us with obligation data only for their facilities  located on the National Mall, where possible. In some cases, obligations  incurred for facilities on the National Mall could not be separated from  obligations incurred for an agency\u2019s facilities located adjacent to the  National Mall. To assess the reliability of the obligation and cost data  received by these agencies, we developed a template for agencies on the  National Mall to obtain consistency in the data provided by each of the  agencies; interviewed knowledgeable agency officials to clarify any  questions; provided the agencies with a spreadsheet we developed that  organized obligations for security enhancements by fiscal year to make  sure that we accurately used the data provided and asked agencies to  identify the source of the obligations incurred; and further clarified any  discrepancies in these data. From this assessment, we determined that  these data are sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report.", "For our second objective, we also reviewed the law, planning and review  criteria, reports, and documentation related to specific proposals for  physical security enhancements on the National Mall. In addition, we  conducted a 3-minute intercept survey of visitors to the National Mall to  determine (1) the extent to which visitors to the National Mall feel that  security measures on the National Mall affect access to sites on the  National Mall and the appearance of the National Mall; (2) the extent to  which visitors to the National Mall feel that additional security measures  are needed; (3) the priority that National Mall visitors would assign access  to the National Mall and the appearance of the National Mall, in the event  that additional security measures are added; and (4) whether security  measures affect the likelihood that National Mall visitors will return.", "To develop the questions for the 3-minute survey, we identified the key  information necessary to gain a general understanding of (1) how visitors  to the National Mall assess the effects of security measures on access to  and the appearance of the National Mall and (2) the priority that visitors  assign to the National Mall\u2019s accessibility and appearance. After initially  developing, reviewing, and modifying the survey questions, we conducted a  total of nine pretests\u2014four cognitive pretests with GAO employees who  were not associated with this review and five with visitors to the National  Mall.", "We provided GAO employee pretest participants (internal participants)  with an overview of the engagement and the intercept survey methodology  to be utilized. Subsequently, we showed internal participants the map of the  National Mall and then asked them to respond to the survey questions.  Upon completion of the survey, we asked for specific comments on each  question and encouraged participants to share their thoughts and ideas  regarding the structure of the survey and the extent to which the questions  seemed clear and easy to answer.", "The five external pretests were conducted by GAO team members on the  National Mall, near the Smithsonian Metro Station. Following the intercept  survey protocol, our interviewers approached respondents asking if they  would like to answer a short survey on physical security measures on the  National Mall area. Five out of 15 potential respondents approached  participated in the survey. Nonrespondents consisted of those unwilling to  participate, those who had not yet seen anything on the National Mall  because they had just arrived, and those unable to speak the English  language. Respondents were first shown the map of the National Mall and  then were asked to respond to the survey questions. Interviewers noted  questions, comments, and any lack of clarity to the questions on the part of  external pretest respondents. The final changes to the survey were made  on the basis of the combined observations from the pretests with GAO  employees and pretests with visitors to the National Mall.", "The population for the survey was National Mall visitors. We chose survey  sites to cover the geographic range of the National Mall and conducted  interviews between 1:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on Monday, October 18;  Monday, October 25; Tuesday, October 26; Friday, November 5; and Sunday,  November 7, 2004. We chose to interview National Mall visitors during  these hours for two reasons: (1) to make it more likely that visitors stopped  for the survey had been on the National Mall long enough to visit one or  more sites on the National Mall and (2) to reduce the chances of surveying  government employees on the National Mall during their lunch break.", "We identified 300 as the target size for our sample, on the basis of balancing  the advantages and costs associated with a larger sample size, considering  that a sample of this size allows for some analysis of subgroups but is small  enough to limit survey costs. We stratified the sample by choosing survey  sites to cover the geographic range of the National Mall. To avoid any bias  by gender, ethnicity, or other individual differences, we systematically  approached the fifth person who passed by a particular landmark (e.g., a  park bench, tree, or light pole); first, from the time interviewing  commenced and, thereafter, immediately following the completion of an  interview.", "In counting potential respondents, we excluded several types of individuals  as out of scope. Specifically, we excluded persons who did not speak  English, who appeared to be younger than 18 years old, who were  exercising on the National Mall, who were talking on a cell phone, who  were leading a group of people on the National Mall, or who had just  arrived on the National Mall and had not yet visited any sites. Of 667  National Mall visitors approached and asked to complete the survey, 537  were found to be in scope. Of these 537 visitors, 229 declined to complete  the survey, yielding a 57 percent response rate.", "Although we took measures to avoid sample bias, our survey sample is a  nonprobability sample. Results from nonprobability samples cannot be  used to make inferences about a population because in a nonprobability  sample, some elements of the population being studied have no chance or  an unknown chance of being selected as part of the sample.", "GAO employees conducted the interviews. A GAO employee showed  respondents a map of the National Mall, asked the survey questions, and  marked responses on the survey. The survey first asked respondents to  specify which sites and what types of security measures they had seen in  their visit to the National Mall. To help with site identification, the map that  the respondents received clearly labeled the museums and monuments.  The survey then posed a series of questions about the effects of the security  measures on access to National Mall sites and the appearance of the  National Mall, the extent to which additional security is needed on the  National Mall, and the priority respondents would assign to the  accessibility and appearance of National Mall sites, in the event that further  security measures are added. The survey concluded by asking whether the  security measures affect respondents\u2019 likelihood of returning to visit the  National Mall.", "For our third objective, we also reviewed and analyzed GAO and other  governmental reports on the protection of federal facilities and homeland  security. We also developed a structured interview guide with questions  about the key practices for implementing security enhancements and sent  the guide to the Smithsonian, Park Service, USDA, and National Gallery. We  then incorporated their responses into the report without independent  verification.", "We conducted our review from August 2004 through May 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Federal agency officials provided much of the data and other information  used in this report.
