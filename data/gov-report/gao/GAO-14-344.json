In addition, FISMA, which is included in  the E-Government Act of 2002, addresses the protection of personal  information in the context of securing federal agency information and  information systems. Beyond these laws, OMB and NIST have issued  guidance for assisting agencies with implementing federal privacy laws.  According to the Privacy Act, each agency that maintains a system of  records shall, among other things, maintain in its records only such  information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to  accomplish a required purpose of the agency. Additionally, when an  agency establishes or makes changes to a system of records, it must  notify the public through a system of records notice in the Federal  Register. The notice should include items such as the categories of data  collected, the categories of individuals about whom information is  collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and procedures that  individuals can use to review and correct personally identifiable  information. According to OMB guidance, system of records notices  should also be up to date.", "The E-Government Act requires that agencies conduct privacy impact  assessments (PIA) for systems or collections containing personal  information. In addition, agencies must ensure the review of the PIA and,  if practicable, make the PIA publicly available through the agency\u2019s  website, publication in the Federal Register, or other means. OMB  guidance elaborates on the PIA process by stating, for example, that  agencies are required to conduct PIAs when a system change creates  new privacy risks (e.g., changing the way in which personal information is  being used). According to OMB, the PIA requirement does not apply to all  systems. For example, no assessment is required when the information  collected relates to internal government operations, the information has  been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a PIA, or when  privacy issues are unchanged.", "The Privacy Act states that agencies must establish rules of conduct for  persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance  of any systems of records, and establish appropriate administrative,  technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and  confidentiality of records. According to NIST, privacy controls are the  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within  organizations to protect and ensure the proper handling of PII.  Accountability and commitment to the protection of individual privacy  includes the appointment of a senior agency official for privacy, as  required by OMB.

One agency appropriately issued  system of records notices, two agencies posted notices that were no  longer current, and three agencies did not issue any notices for  systems requiring them. Of the two agencies with out-of-date system  of records notices, one agency is determining which information  systems contain information that will require system of records  notices. Consequently, an official from this agency stated that the  agency needed to update its 2005 notice. Similarly, an official from the  other agency stated that the agency\u2019s system of records notices will  be updated when the agency moves to a new location in fiscal year  2014. Among the three agencies that did not issue system of records  notices, officials at two agencies did not believe that they were  responsible for issuing the notices. While one of the agencies did not  maintain PII in its system, the agency maintained paper files with PII  that was covered by the Privacy Act and thus was responsible for  issuing a system of records notice. An official from the second agency  believed that other agencies were responsible for completing system  of records notices on its behalf. An official from the third agency  stated that the agency would revisit system of records notices as part  of the reauthorization process for its systems.", "Conduct privacy impact assessments: Most of the selected small  agencies did not consistently conduct privacy impact assessments for  all systems containing personally identifiable information. Two  agencies conducted privacy impact assessments for systems  containing PII. Three agencies did not complete any assessments.  The sixth agency was not required to perform an assessment  because it did not maintain any systems containing personally  identifiable information.", "Regarding the three agencies that did not complete PIAs, officials  offered a variety of reasons for why they were not conducted. An  official from one of the three agencies originally stated they did not  maintain any information systems containing personal information  related to employees or members of the public. However, we  determined that this agency\u2019s general support system stored e-mail  addresses for members of the general public, and therefore a privacy  impact assessment should have been completed. An official from the  second agency stated they will determine whether the systems  containing PII would need a privacy impact assessment. The third  agency did not conduct privacy impact assessments because officials  inappropriately believed that a waiver from OMB relieved them from  the requirement of preparing privacy impact assessments. However,  no waivers exist for conducting privacy impact assessments, and  OMB does not issue such waivers.", "Assign senior official for privacy: Most of the six selected small  agencies assigned a senior agency official for privacy who is  responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and  regulations regarding the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and  disposal of personally identifiable information by programs and  information systems. Specifically, five of the six agencies had  assigned an agency official with overall agency-wide responsibility for  information privacy issues, while one agency had not. One of the  agencies designated a Chief Privacy Officer, while officials from three  other agencies stated that other employees or officers, specifically the  Chief Operating Officer, the General Counsel, or the Chief Information  Officer, were designated to perform the duties of a privacy officer.

He further  commented that large agencies, unlike small agencies, have dedicated IT  staff and that there should not be a \u201cone size fits all\u201d set of requirements  for all federal agencies. However, while smaller federal agencies may not  have dedicated IT staff, we believe federal agencies, large or small,  should perform an assessment of their risks and implement appropriate  safeguards to reduce risk to an acceptable level. He also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The Acting Commissioner for the International Boundary Commission,  United States and Canada, provided comments via e-mail on June 5,  2014. The Acting Commissioner stated that he disagreed with our  statement that all computer equipment within the agencies reviewed  contained classified or sensitive information. However, our report does  not state this; rather, it discusses the selected agencies\u2019 actions to  implement federal information security and privacy requirements. We  believe our characterization of the weaknesses identified is accurate as of  the time of our review.", "The Deputy Chief Risk Officer for the Federal Retirement Thrift  Investment Board and the audit liaisons for the Office of Personnel  Management and National Capital Planning Commission responded via  e-mail that these agencies did not have any comments on the draft report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the  heads of the six agencies we reviewed.

We  selected these six agencies by creating a list of all small, micro, and  independent regulatory agencies using definitions from OMB Circular A- 11, CyberScope, the Paperwork Reduction Act, USA.gov, and Office of  Personnel Management information. We used OMB\u2019s definition of small  agencies as agencies with fewer than 6,000 employees and micro  agencies as agencies having fewer than 100 employees. We excluded  the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act, agencies  that are part of the Executive Office of the President, agencies from the  intelligence community, and agencies whose financial statements are  audited annually by GAO.", "We selected the agencies by organizing the list of small agencies into five  primary areas: (1) boards, commissions, and corporations reporting  through CyberScope; (2) boards, commissions, and corporations not  reporting through CyberScope; (3) independent regulatory agencies; (4)  memorial, arts, foundations, and administrative agencies reporting  through CyberScope; and (5) memorial, arts, foundations, and  administrative agencies not reporting through CyberScope. Using a  randomly generated number, we selected one agency from each area.  The five resulting agencies were the (1) Federal Trade Commission; (2)  International Boundary Commission, United States and Canada; (3)  James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation; (4) National Capital  Planning Commission; and (5) National Endowment for the Humanities.  We selected the sixth agency, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment  Board, because it had experienced a significant data breach involving  personally identifiable information. Due to the sensitive nature of the  information discussed, throughout the report we do not refer to the six  agencies by name.", "To identify agency, OMB, and National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) responsibilities for agency information security and  privacy, we reviewed and analyzed the provisions of the E-Government  Act of 2002, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, and the Privacy Act of 1974. At each of the six agencies, we  interviewed senior information security program and privacy staff,  observed controls, and conducted technical reviews to gain an  understanding of the agency, the information technology environment,  and the information security and privacy programs.", "To evaluate agencies\u2019 implementation of their information security  responsibilities, we reviewed and analyzed agency documentation and  compared it to provisions in FISMA and NIST guidance. We reviewed  information security policies and procedures, information technology  security-related audit reports, CyberScope data (where available), and  inspector general reports for work conducted in fiscal years 2011, 2012,  and 2013. To evaluate the privacy programs at each agency, we  assessed whether the six agencies had established plans for privacy  protections and conducted impact assessments for systems containing  personally identifiable information, as required by the E-Government Act.  We assessed whether the six agencies had issued system of records  notices for each system containing personally identifiable information, as  called for by the Privacy Act. We reviewed OMB memorandum M-03-22  and NIST Special Publication 800-122 to select privacy elements required  of federal agencies. We then reviewed and analyzed documents from the  selected agencies, including privacy policies and procedures, to  determine whether they adhered to the requirements set forth in OMB  and NIST guidance. We also interviewed agency officials to determine  what assistance they had requested and received from OMB and areas  where it would have been beneficial to receive additional assistance.  Because of the small number of agencies reviewed, our findings are not  representative of any population of small agencies and our results only  apply to the six selected agencies and to their selected systems.", "To determine the extent to which DHS and OMB are overseeing and  assisting small agencies in implementing information security program  requirements, we reviewed OMB\u2019s guidance to determine the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s responsibilities. We reviewed and analyzed  DHS\u2019s and OMB\u2019s policies, procedures, and plans related to security to  determine the level of guidance DHS provided to small federal agencies.  We reviewed DHS\u2019s and OMB\u2019s fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013  guidance for agency reporting on FISMA and compared it to FISMA  requirements. Additionally, we reviewed the six agencies\u2019 fiscal years  2011 and 2012 FISMA data submissions to determine the extent to which  DHS uses data to assist agencies in effectively implementing information  security program requirements. We interviewed DHS officials in the Office  of Cybersecurity and Communications, U.S. Computer Emergency  Readiness Team (US-CERT), Federal Network Resilience Division, and  other DHS entities. We reviewed and analyzed documentation that  supported agency assistance requests, technical alerts, after-action  reports, and other available documentation to determine the extent to  which US-CERT tracks and provides assistance to small agencies. We  conducted interviews with OMB officials based on the documentation and  information provided. We did not evaluate the implementation of DHS\u2019s  FISMA-related responsibilities assigned to it by OMB.", "To evaluate the extent to which DHS and OMB are overseeing and  assisting small agencies in implementing privacy laws and policies, we  reviewed OMB-issued guidance on Privacy Impact Assessments and  each selected agency\u2019s privacy notices. Additionally, we reviewed DHS\u2019s  privacy guidance. We met with DHS and OMB officials to determine the  actions taken to provide assistance and oversight to federal agencies.", "To determine the reliability and accuracy of the data, we obtained and  analyzed data from each agency that addressed the security and privacy  internal controls of the systems used to collect the data. Specifically, we  analyzed data regarding access controls, incident reporting, security  awareness training, change management, and remediation of  weaknesses. In addition, we interviewed agency officials responsible for  the collection and reporting of the data. Based on these procedures, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2013 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
