Specifically, the Privacy Office has made significant progress by establishing a compliance framework for conducting PIAs, which are required by the E-Gov Act. The framework includes formal written guidance, training sessions, and a process for identifying affected systems. The framework has contributed to an increase in the quality and number of PIAs issued as well as the identification of many more affected systems. The resultant workload is likely to prove difficult to process in a timely manner. Designating privacy officers in certain DHS components could help speed processing of PIAs, but DHS has not yet taken action to make these designations. The Privacy Office has also taken actions to integrate privacy considerations into the DHS decision-making process by establishing an advisory committee, holding public workshops, and participating in policy development. However, limited progress has been made in updating public notices required by the Privacy Act for systems of records that were in existence prior to the creation of DHS. These notices should identify, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, and the intended uses of the data. Until the notices are brought up-to-date, the department cannot assure the public that the notices reflect current uses and protections of personal information. Further, the Privacy Office has generally not been timely in issuing public reports. For example, a report on the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange program--a pilot project for law enforcement sharing of public records data--was not issued until long after the program had been terminated. Late issuance of reports has a number of negative consequences, including a potential reduction in the reports' value and erosion of the office's credibility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the first  statutorily required senior privacy official at any federal agency.

Canada\u2019s Privacy Commissioner, for example,  reports to the Canadian House of Commons and Senate and has the power  to summon witnesses and subpoena documents. In contrast, the DHS  privacy officer position was established by the Homeland Security Act as  an internal component of DHS. As a part of the DHS organizational  structure, the Chief Privacy Officer has the ability to serve as a consultant  on privacy issues to other departmental entities that may not have  adequate expertise on privacy issues.", "The office is divided into two major functional groups addressing Freedom  of Information Act (FOIA) and privacy responsibilities, respectively.  Within each functional group, major responsibilities are divided among  senior staff assigned to oversee key areas, including international privacy  policy, departmental disclosure and FOIA, privacy technology, and privacy  compliance operations. There are also component-level and program-level  privacy officers at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S.  Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program,  and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019  collection, disclosure, and use of personally identifiable information that is  maintained in their systems of records. The act defines a record as any  item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is  maintained by an agency and contains that individual\u2019s name or other  personal identifier, such as a Social Security number. It defines \u201csystem-of- records\u201d as a group of records under the control of any agency from which  information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual  identifier. The Privacy Act requires agencies to notify the public, via a  notice in the Federal Register, when they create or modify a system-of- records.

For example, in  the conference report for the DHS appropriations act for fiscal year 2005,  Congress directed the Privacy Office to report on DHS\u2019s use of data mining  technologies. Congress asked for a follow-up report on data mining in the  conference report for the fiscal year 2007 DHS appropriations bill. The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 also required  the Chief Privacy Officer to submit a report to Congress on the privacy and  civil liberties impact of the DHS-maintained Automatic Selectee and  No-Fly lists, which contain names of potential airline passengers who are  to be selected for secondary screening or not allowed to board aircraft.

Although based on OMB\u2019s guidance, the Privacy Office\u2019s  guidance goes further in several areas. For example, the guidance does not  exempt national security systems and also clarifies that systems in the  pilot testing phase are not exempt. The DHS guidance also provides more  detailed instructions than OMB\u2019s guidance on the level of detail to be  provided. For example, the DHS guidance requires a discussion of a  system\u2019s data retention period, procedures for allowing individual access,  redress, correction of information, and technologies used in the system,  such as biometrics or RFID.", "The Privacy Office has taken steps to continually improve its PIA  guidance. Initially released in February 2004, the guidance has been  updated twice, in July 2005 and March 2006. These updates have increased  the emphasis on describing the privacy analysis that should take place in  making system design decisions that affect privacy. For example,  regarding data retention, the latest guidance requires program officials to  explain why the personal information in question is needed for the  specified retention period. Based on feedback from DHS components, the  Privacy Office plans to update the guidance again in 2007 to clarify  questions on data mining and the use of commercial data. To accompany  its written guidance, the Privacy Office has also developed a PIA template  and a number of training sessions to further assist DHS personnel.", "In addition to written guidance and training, the office developed a  procedure, called a privacy threshold analysis (PTA), for identifying which  DHS systems contain personally identifiable information and which  require PIAs. The privacy threshold analysis is a brief assessment that  requires system owners to answer six basic questions on the nature of  their systems and whether the systems contain personally identifiable  information. System owners complete the privacy threshold analysis  document and submit it to the Privacy Office for an official determination  as to whether a PIA is required. As of January 2006, all DHS systems have  been required to perform privacy threshold analyses.", "Our analysis of published DHS PIAs shows significant quality  improvements in those completed recently compared with those from 2 or  3 years ago. Overall, there is a greater emphasis on analysis of system  development decisions that impact privacy, because the guidance now  requires that such analysis be performed and described. For example, the  most recent PIAs include separate privacy impact analyses for several  major topics, including planned uses of the system and information, plans  for data retention, and the extent to which the information is to be shared  outside of DHS. This contrasts to the earliest PIAs published by the  Privacy Office, which do not include any of these analyses.", "The emphasis on analysis should allow the public to more easily  understand a system and its impact on privacy. Further, our analysis found  that use of the template has resulted in a more standardized structure,  format, and content, making the PIAs more easily understandable to the  general reader.", "In addition to its positive impact on DHS, the Privacy Office\u2019s framework  has been recognized by others outside of DHS. For example, the  Department of Justice has adopted the DHS Privacy Office\u2019s guidance and  template with only minor modifications. Further, privacy advocacy groups  have commended the Privacy Office for developing the guidance and  associated training sessions, citing this as one of the office\u2019s most  significant achievements. Figure 2 illustrates the steps in the development  process as established by the Privacy Office\u2019s guidance.", "In addition to written guidance, the Privacy Office has also taken steps to  integrate PIA development into the department\u2019s established operational  processes. For example, the Privacy Office coordinated with the Office of  the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to include the privacy threshold  analysis requirement as part of OCIO\u2019s effort to compile an inventory of  major information systems required by the Federal Information Security  Management Act. Through this coordination, the Privacy Office was able  to get the PTA requirement incorporated into the software application that  DHS uses to track agency compliance with the Federal Information  Security Management Act. The Privacy Office also coordinated with OCIO  to include submission of a privacy threshold analysis as a requirement  within the larger certification and accreditation process. The process  requires IT system owners to evaluate security controls to ensure that  security risks have been properly identified and mitigated. The actions  they have taken are then scored, and systems must receive a certain  minimum score in order to be certified and accredited. The inclusion of  the PTA as part of the systems inventory and in the certification and  accreditation process has enabled the Privacy Office to better identify  systems containing personally identifiable information that may require a  PIA.", "Further, the Privacy Office is using the OMB Exhibit 300 budget process  as an additional opportunity to ensure that systems containing personal  information are identified and that PIAs are conducted when needed. OMB  requires agencies to submit an Exhibit 300 Capital Asset Plan and Business  Case for their major information technology systems in order to receive  funding. The Exhibit 300 template asks whether a system has a PIA and if  it is publicly available. Because the Privacy Office gives final departmental  approval for all such assessments, it is able to use the Exhibit 300 process  to ensure the assessments are completed. According to Privacy Office  officials, the threat of losing funds has helped to encourage components to  conduct PIAs. Integration of the PIA requirement into these management  processes is beneficial in that it provides an opportunity to address  privacy considerations during systems development, as envisioned by  OMB\u2019s guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Privacy Office Is Taking Steps to Streamline PIA Review and Approval", "paragraphs": ["Because of concerns expressed by component officials that the Privacy  Office\u2019s review process took a long time and was difficult to understand,  the office has made efforts to improve the process and make it more  transparent to DHS components.

The  review process is intended to take 5 to 6 weeks, with each stage intended  to take 1 week. Figure 3 illustrates the stages of the review process.", "Through efforts such as the compliance framework, the Privacy Office has  steadily increased the number of PIAs it has approved and published each  year. As shown in figure 4, PIA output by the Privacy Office has more  than doubled since 2004. According to Privacy Office officials, the increase  in output was aided by the development and implementation of the  Privacy Office\u2019s structured guidance and review process. In addition,  Privacy Office officials stated that as DHS components gain more  experience, the output should continue to increase.", "Because the Privacy Office has focused departmental attention on the  development and review process and established a structured framework  for identifying systems that need PIAs, the number of identified DHS  systems requiring a PIA has increased dramatically. According to its  annual Federal Information Security Management Act reports, DHS  identified 46 systems as requiring a PIA in fiscal year 2005 and 143 systems  in fiscal year 2006. Based on the privacy threshold analysis process, the  Privacy Office estimates that 188 systems will require a PIA in fiscal year  2007.", "Considering that only 25 were published in fiscal year 2006, it will likely be  very difficult for DHS to expeditiously develop and issue PIAs for all of  these systems because developing and approving them can be a lengthy  process. According to estimates by Privacy Office officials, it takes  approximately six months to develop and approve a PIA, but the office is  working to reduce this time.", "The Privacy Office is examining several potential changes to the  development process that would allow it to process an increased number  of PIAs. One such option is to allow DHS components to quickly amend  preexisting PIAs. An amendment would only need to contain information  on changes to the system and would allow for quicker development and  review. The Privacy Office is also considering developing standardized  PIAs for commonly-used types of systems or uses. For example, such an  assessment may be developed for local area networks. Systems intended  to collect or use information outside what is specified in the standardized  PIA would need approval from the Privacy Office.", "Of potential help in dealing with an increasing PIA workload is the  establishment of full-time privacy officers within key DHS components.  Components with a designated privacy officer have generally produced  more PIAs than components without privacy officers. Of the eleven DHS  components that have published PIAs, only three have designated privacy  officers. Yet these three components account for 57 percent of all  published DHS PIAs. Designating privacy officers in key DHS  components, such as Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Coast  Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, could help in drafting PIAs that could be  processed by the Privacy Office more expeditiously. Components such as  these have a high volume of programs that interface directly with the  public. Although the Privacy Office has also recommended that such  privacy officers be designated, the department has not yet appointed  privacy officers in any of these components.

DHS and State have proposed the creation of a special  identification card that would serve as an alternative to a traditional  passport for use by U.S. citizens who cross land borders or travel by sea  between the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, or Bermuda.  The card is to use a technology called vicinity RFID to transmit  information on travelers to CBP officers at land and sea ports of entry.  Advocacy groups have raised concerns about the proposed use of vicinity  RFID because of privacy and security risks due primarily to the ability to  read information from these cards from distances of up to 20 feet. The  Privacy Office was consulted on the choice of identification technology for  the cards. According to the DHS Policy Office, Privacy Office input led to a  decision not to store or transmit personally identifiable information on the  RFID chip on the card. Instead, DHS is planning on transmitting a  randomly generated identifier for individuals, which is to be used by DHS  to retrieve information about the individual from a centralized database.", "REAL ID Act of 2005  Among other things, the REAL ID Act requires DHS, in consultation with  the Department of Transportation and the states, to issue regulations that  set minimum standards for state-issued REAL ID drivers\u2019 licenses and  identification cards to be accepted for official purposes after May 11, 2008.  Advocacy groups have raised a number of privacy concerns about REAL  ID, chiefly that it creates a de facto national ID that could be used in the  future for privacy-infringing purposes and that it puts individuals at  increased risk of identity theft. The DHS Policy Office reported that it  included Privacy Office officials, as well as officials from the Office of  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, in developing its implementing rule for  REAL ID. The Privacy Office\u2019s participation in REAL ID also served to  address its requirement to evaluate legislative and regulatory proposals  concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by  the federal government. According to its November 2006 annual report,  the Privacy Office championed the need for privacy protections regarding  the collection and use of the personal information that will be stored on  the REAL ID drivers\u2019 licenses. Further, the office reported that it funded a  contract to examine the creation of a state federation to implement the  information sharing required by the act in a privacy-sensitive manner.", "As we have previously reported, DHS has used personal information  obtained from commercial data providers for immigration, fraud  detection, and border screening programs but, like other agencies, does  not have policies in place concerning its uses of these data. Accordingly,  we recommended that DHS, as well as other agencies, develop such  policies. In response to the concerns raised in our report and by privacy  advocacy groups, Privacy Office officials said they were drafting a  departmentwide policy on the use of commercial data. Once drafted by the  Privacy Office, this policy is to undergo a departmental review process  (including review by the Policy Office, General Counsel, and Office of the  Secretary), followed by a review by OMB prior to adoption.", "These examples demonstrate specific involvement of the Privacy Office in  major DHS initiatives. However, Privacy Office input is only one factor  that DHS officials consider in formulating decisions about major  programs, and Privacy Office participation does not guarantee that privacy  concerns will be fully addressed. For example, our previous work has  highlighted problems in implementing privacy protections in specific DHS  programs, including Secure Flight and the ADVISE program.

These notices must  describe the nature of a system-of-records and the information it  maintains. Additionally, OMB has issued various guidance documents for  implementing the Privacy Act. OMB Circular A-130, for example, outlines  agency responsibilities for maintaining records on individuals and directs  government agencies to conduct biennial reviews of each system-of- records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system-of- records.", "The Privacy Office has taken steps to establish a departmental process for  complying with the Privacy Act. It issued a management directive that  outlines its own responsibilities as well as those of component-level  officials. Under this policy, the Privacy Office is to act as the department\u2019s  representative for matters relating to the Privacy Act. The Privacy Office is  to issue and revise, as needed, departmental regulations implementing the  Privacy Act and approve all system-of-records notices before they are  published in the Federal Register. DHS components are responsible for  drafting system-of-records notices and submitting them to the Privacy  Office for review and approval. The management directive was in addition  to system-of-records notice guidance published by the Privacy Office in  August 2005. The guidance discusses the requirements of the Privacy Act  and provides instructions on how to prepare system-of-records notices by  listing key elements and explaining how they must be addressed. The  guidance also lists common routine uses and provides standard language  that DHS components may incorporate into their notices. As of February  2007, the Privacy Office had approved and published 56 system-of-records  notices, including updates and revisions as well as new documents.", "In establishing Privacy Act processes, the Privacy Office has also begun to  integrate the system-of-records notice and PIA development processes.  The Privacy Office now generally requires that system-of-records notices  submitted to it for approval be accompanied by PIAs. This is not an  absolute requirement, because the need to conduct PIAs, as stipulated by  the E-Gov Act, is not based on the same concept of a \u201csystem-of-records\u201d  used by the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, the Privacy Office\u2019s intention is to  ensure that, when the requirements do coincide, a system\u2019s PIA is aligned  closely with the related system-of-records notice.", "However, the Privacy Office has not yet established a process for  conducting a biennial review of system-of-records notices, as required by  OMB.

Because it focused its  initial efforts on PIAs and gave priority to DHS systems of records that  were not covered by preexisting notices, the office did not give the same  priority to performing a comprehensive review of existing notices.  According to Privacy Office officials, the office is encouraging DHS  components to update legacy system-of-records notices and is developing  new guidance intended to be more closely integrated with its PIA  guidance. However, no significant reduction has yet been made in the  number of legacy system-of-records notices that need to be updated.", "By not reviewing notices biennially, the department is not in compliance  with OMB direction. Further, by not keeping its notices up-to-date, DHS  hinders the public\u2019s ability to understand the nature of DHS systems-of- records notices and how their personal information is being used and  protected.

Congress has also required that the Privacy Office report on  specific departmental activities and programs, including data mining and  passenger prescreening programs. In addition, the first Chief Privacy  Officer initiated several investigations and prepared reports on them to  address requirements to report on complaints of privacy violations and to  assure that technologies sustain and do not erode privacy protections.", "In addition to satisfying mandates, the issuance of timely public reports  helps in adhering to the fair information practices, which the Privacy  Office has pledged to support.

The Privacy Office\u2019s first annual report, issued in February 2005, covered  14 months from April 2003 through June 2004. A second annual report, for  the next 12 months, was never issued. Instead, information about that  period was combined with information about the next 12-month period,  and a single report was issued in November 2006 covering the office\u2019s  activities from July 2004 through July 2006. While this report generally  addressed the content specified by the Homeland Security Act, it did not  include the required description of complaints of privacy violations.", "Other reports produced by the Privacy Office have not met mandated  deadlines or have been issued long after privacy concerns had been  addressed. For example, although Congress required a report on the  privacy and civil liberties effects of the No-Fly and Automatic Selectee  Lists by June 2005, the report was not issued until April 2006, nearly a  year late. In addition, although required by December 2005, the Privacy  Office\u2019s report on DHS data mining activities was not provided to  Congress until July 2006 and was not made available to the public on the  Privacy Office Web site until November 2006.", "In addition, the first Chief Privacy Officer initiated four investigations of  specific programs and produced reports on these reviews. Although two of  the four reports were issued in a relatively timely fashion, the other two  reports were issued long after privacy concerns had been raised and  addressed. For example, a report on the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism  Information Exchange (MATRIX) program, initiated in response to a  complaint by the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in May 2004,  was not issued until two and a half years later, long after the program had  been terminated. As another example, although drafts of the  recommendations contained in the Secure Flight report were shared with  TSA staff as early as summer 2005, the report was not released until  December 2006, nearly a year and a half later. Table 1 summarizes DHS  Privacy Office reports issued to date, including both statutorily required as  well as self-initiated reports.", "According to Privacy Office officials, there are a number of factors  contributing to the delayed release of its reports, including time required  to consult with affected DHS components as well as the departmental  clearance process, which includes the Policy Office, the Office of General  Counsel, and the Office of the Secretary. After that, drafts must be sent to  OMB for further review. In addition, the Privacy Office did not establish  schedules for completing these reports that took into account the time  needed for coordination with components or departmental and OMB  review.", "Regarding the omission of complaints of privacy violations in the latest  annual report, Privacy Office officials noted that the report cites previous  reports on Secure Flight and the MATRIX program, which were initiated in  response to alleged privacy violations, and that during the time period in  question there were no additional complaints of privacy violations.  However, the report itself provides no specific statements about the status  of privacy complaints; it does not state that there were no privacy  complaints received.", "Late issuance of reports has a number of negative consequences beyond  noncompliance with mandated deadlines. First, the value these reports are  intended to provide is reduced when the information contained is no  longer timely or relevant. In addition, since these reports serve as a critical  window into the operations of the Privacy Office and on DHS programs  that make use of personal information, not issuing them in a timely fashion  diminishes the office\u2019s credibility and can raise questions about the extent  to which the office is receiving executive-level attention. For example,  delays in releasing the most recent annual report led a number of privacy  advocates to question whether the Privacy Office had adequate authority  and executive-level support. Congress also voiced this concern in passing  the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, which  states that none of the funds made available in the act may be used by any  person other than the Privacy Officer to \u201calter, direct that changes be  made to, delay, or prohibit the transmission to Congress\u201d of its annual  report. In addition, on January 5, 2007, legislation was introduced entitled  Privacy Officer with Enhanced Rights Act of 2007. This bill, among other  things, would provide the Privacy Officer with the authority to report  directly to Congress without prior comment or amendment by either OMB  officials or DHS officials who are outside the Privacy Office.
