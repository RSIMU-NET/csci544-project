CMS is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs and leading efforts to reduce improper payments of claims for medical treatment, services, and equipment. Improper payments are overpayments or underpayments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount; they may be due to errors, such as the inadvertent submission of duplicate claims for the same service, or misconduct, such as fraud or abuse. The Department of Health and Human Services reported about $70 billion in improper payments in the Medicare and Medicaid programs in fiscal year 2010. Operating within the Department of Health and Human Services, CMS conducts reviews to prevent improper payments before claims are paid and to detect claims that were paid in error. These activities are predominantly carried out by contractors who, along with CMS personnel, use various information technology solutions to consolidate and analyze data to help identify the improper payment of claims. For example, these program integrity analysts may use software tools to access data about claims and then use those data to identify patterns of unusual activities by matching services with patients' diagnoses. In 2006, CMS initiated activities to centralize and make more accessible the data needed to conduct these analyses and to improve the analytical tools available to its own and contractor analysts. At the Subcommittee's request, we have been reviewing two of these initiatives--the Integrated Data Repository (IDR), which is intended to provide a single source of data related to Medicare and Medicaid claims, and the One Program Integrity (One PI) system, a Web-based portal and suite of analytical software tools used to extract data from IDR and enable complex analyses of these data. According to CMS officials responsible for developing and implementing IDR and One PI, the agency had spent approximately $161 million on these initiatives by the end of fiscal year 2010. This testimony, in conjunction with a report that we are releasing today, summarizes the results of our study--which specifically assessed the extent to which IDR and One PI have been developed and implemented and CMS's progress toward achieving its goals and objectives for using these systems to detect fraud, waste, and abuse."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, CMS initiated the One PI program with the intention of developing and implementing a portal and software tools that would enable access to and analysis of claims, provider, and beneficiary data from a centralized source. The agency's goal for One PI was to support the needs of a broad program integrity user community, including agency program integrity personnel and contractors who analyze Medicare claims data, along with state agencies that monitor Medicaid claims. To achieve its goal, agency officials planned to implement a tool set that would provide a single source of information to enable consistent, reliable, and timely analyses and improve the agency's ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse. These tools were to be used to gather data from IDR about beneficiaries, providers, and procedures and, combined with other data, find billing aberrancies or outliers. For example, an analyst could use software tools to identify potentially fraudulent trends in ambulance services by gathering the data about claims for ambulance services and medical treatments, and then use other software to determine associations between the two types of services. If the analyst found claims for ambulance travel costs but no corresponding claims for medical treatment, it might indicate that further investigation could prove that the billings for those services were fraudulent. According to agency program planning documentation, the One PI system was also to be developed incrementally to provide access to IDR data, analytical tools, and portal functionality. CMS planned to implement the One PI portal and two analytical tools for use by program integrity analysts on a widespread basis by the end of fiscal year 2009. The agency engaged contractors to develop the system. While CMS has shown some progress toward meeting the programs' goals of providing a centralized data repository and enhanced analytical capabilities for detecting improper payments due to fraud, waste, and abuse, the current implementation of IDR and One PI does not position the agency to identify, measure, and track financial benefits realized from reductions in improper payments as a result of the implementation of either system. For example, program officials stated that they had developed estimates of financial benefits expected to be realized through the use of IDR. The most recent projection of total financial benefits was reported to be $187 million, based on estimates of the amount of improper payments the agency expected to recover as a result of analyzing data provided by IDR. With estimated life-cycle program costs of $90 million through fiscal year 2018, the resulting net benefit expected from implementing IDR was projected to be $97 million.

For more than a decade, the  agency and its contractors have used automated software tools to  analyze data from various sources to detect patterns of unusual activities  or financial transactions that indicate payments could have been made for  fraudulent charges or improper payments. For example, to identify  unusual billing patterns and support investigations and prosecutions of  cases, analysts and investigators access information about key actions  taken to process claims as they are filed and the specific details about  claims already paid. This would include information on claims as they are  billed, adjusted, and paid or denied; check numbers on payments of  claims; and other specific information that could help establish provider  intent.", "CMS uses many different means to store and manipulate data and, since  the establishment of the agency\u2019s program integrity initiatives in the  1990s, has built multiple, disparate databases and analytical software  tools to meet the individual and unique needs of various programs within  the agency. In addition, data on Medicaid claims are stored by the states  in multiple systems and databases, and are not readily available to CMS.  According to agency program documentation, these geographically  distributed, regional approaches to data storage result in duplicate data  and limit the agency\u2019s ability to conduct analyses of data on a nationwide  basis. As a result, CMS has been working for most of the past decade to  consolidate its databases and analytical tools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Initiative to Develop a Centralized Source of Medicare and Medicaid Data", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, CMS officials expanded the scope of a 3-year-old data  modernization strategy to not only modernize data storage technology,  but also to integrate Medicare and Medicaid data into a centralized  repository so that CMS and its partners could access the data from a  single source. They called the expanded program IDR.", "According to program officials, the agency\u2019s vision was for IDR to become  the single repository for CMS\u2019s data and enable data analysis within and  across programs. Specifically, this repository was to establish the  infrastructure for storing data related to Medicaid and Medicare Parts A,  B, and D claims processing, as well as a variety of other agency  functions, such as program management, research, analytics, and  business intelligence.", "CMS envisioned an incremental approach to incorporating data into IDR.  Specifically, it intended to incorporate data related to paid claims for all  Medicare Part D data by the end of fiscal year 2006, and for Medicare  Parts A and B data by the end of fiscal year 2007. The agency also  planned to begin to incrementally add all Medicaid data for the 50 states  in fiscal year 2009 and to complete this effort by the end of fiscal year  2012.", "Initial program plans and schedules also included the incorporation of  additional data from legacy CMS claims-processing systems that store  and process data related to the entry, correction, and adjustment of  claims as they are being processed, along with detailed financial data  related to paid claims. According to program officials, these data, called  \u201cshared systems\u201d data, are needed to support the agency\u2019s plans to  incorporate tools to conduct predictive analysis of claims as they are  being processed, helping to prevent improper payments. Shared systems  data, such as check numbers and amounts related to claims that have  been paid, are also needed by law enforcement agencies to help with  fraud investigations.

According to program officials, the integration of these data into IDR  established a centralized source of data previously accessed from  multiple disparate system files.", "However, although the agency has been incorporating data from various  sources since 2006, IDR does not yet include all the data that were  planned to be incorporated by the end of 2010 and that are needed to  support enhanced program integrity initiatives. Specifically, although initial  program integrity requirements included the incorporation of the shared  systems data by July 2008, these data have not yet been added to IDR.  As such, analysts are not able to access certain data from IDR that would  help them identify and prevent payment of fraudulent claims. According to  IDR program officials, the shared systems data were not incorporated as  planned because funding for the development of the software and  acquisition of the hardware needed to meet this requirement was not  approved until the summer of 2010. Since then, IDR program officials  have developed project plans and identified user requirements, and told  us that they plan to incorporate shared systems data by November 2011.", "In addition, IDR does not yet include the Medicaid data that are critical to  analysts\u2019 ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in this program. While  program officials initially planned to incorporate 20 states\u2019 Medicaid data  into IDR by the end of fiscal year 2010, the agency had not incorporated  any of these data into the repository as of May 25, 2011. Program officials  told us that the original plans and schedules for obtaining Medicaid data  did not account for the lack of funding for states to provide Medicaid data  to CMS, or the variations in the types and formats of data stored in  disparate state Medicaid systems. Consequently, the officials were not  able to collect the data from the states as easily as they expected and did  not complete this activity as originally planned.", "In December 2009, CMS initiated another agencywide program intended  to, among other things, identify ways to collect Medicaid data from the  many disparate state systems and incorporate the data into a single data  store. As envisioned by CMS, this program, the Medicaid and Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program Business Information and Solutions (MACBIS)  program, is to include activities in addition to providing expedited access  to current data from state Medicaid programs. According to agency  planning documentation, as a result of efforts to be initiated under the  MACBIS program, CMS expects to incorporate Medicaid data for all 50  states into IDR by the end of fiscal year 2014. This enterprisewide  initiative is expected to cost about $400 million through fiscal year 2016.", "However, program officials have not defined plans and reliable schedules  for incorporating the additional data into IDR that are needed to support  the agency\u2019s program integrity goals. Yet, doing so is essential to  ensuring that CMS does not repeat mistakes of the past that stand to  jeopardize the overall success of its current efforts. In this regard, more  than a decade ago, we reported on the agency\u2019s efforts to replace  multiple claims processing systems with a single, unified system. Among  other things, that system was intended to provide an integrated database  to help the agency in identifying fraud and abuse. However, as the  system was being developed, we reported repeatedly that the agency  was not applying effective investment management practices to its  planning and management of the project. Further, we reported that the  agency had no assurance that the project would be cost-effective,  delivered within estimated timeframes, or even improve the processing of  Medicare claims. Lacking these vital project management elements, CMS  subsequently halted that troubled initiative without delivering the intended  system\u2014after investing more than $80 million over 3-and-a-half years.", "Until the agency defines plans and reliable schedules for incorporating  the additional data into IDR, it cannot ensure that current development,  implementation, and deployment efforts will provide the data and  technical capabilities needed to enhance CMS\u2019s efforts to detect potential  cases of fraud, waste, and abuse.", "Beyond the IDR initiative, CMS program integrity officials have not yet  taken appropriate actions to ensure the use of One PI on a widespread  basis for program integrity purposes. According to program officials, the  system was deployed in September 2009 as originally planned and  consisted of a portal that provided Web-based access to software tools  used by CMS and contractor analysts to retrieve and analyze data stored  in IDR. As currently implemented, the system provides access to two  analytical tools. One tool is a commercial off-the-shelf decision support  tool that is used to perform data analysis to, for example, detect patterns  of activities that may identify or confirm suspected cases of fraud, waste,  or abuse. The second tool provides users with extended capabilities to  perform more complex analyses of data. For example, it allows the user  to customize and create ad hoc queries of claims data across the different  parts of the Medicare program.", "However, while program officials deployed the One PI portal and two  analytical tools, the system is not being used as widely as planned  because CMS and contractor analysts have not received the necessary  training for its use. In this regard, program planning documentation from  August 2009 indicated that One PI program officials had planned for 639  analysts to be trained and using the system by the end of fiscal year  2010; however, CMS confirmed that by the end of October 2010, only 42  of those intended users had been trained to use One PI, with 41 actively  using the portal and tools. These users represent fewer than 7 percent of  the users originally intended for the program.", "Program officials responsible for implementing the system acknowledged  that their initial training plans and efforts had been insufficient and that  they had consequently initiated activities and redirected resources to  redesign the One PI training plan in April 2010; they began to implement  the new training program in July of that year. As of May 25, 2011, One PI  officials told us that 62 additional analysts had signed up to be trained in  2011 and that the number of training classes for One PI had been  increased from two to four per month. Agency officials, in commenting on  our report, stated that since January 2011, 58 new users had been  trained; however, they did not identify an increase in the number of actual  users of the system.", "Nonetheless, while these activities indicate some progress toward  increasing the number of One PI users, the number of users expected to  be trained and to begin using the system represents a small fraction of  the population of 639 intended users. Moreover, as of late May 2011, One  PI program officials had not yet made detailed plans and developed  schedules for completing training of all the intended users. Agency  officials concurred with our conclusion that CMS needs to take more  aggressive steps to ensure that its broad community of analysts is  trained. Until it does so, the use of One PI may remain limited to a much  smaller group of users than the agency intended, and CMS will continue  to face obstacles in its efforts to deploy One PI for widespread use  throughout its community of program integrity analysts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Not Yet Positioned to Identify Financial Benefits or to Fully Meet Program Integrity Goals and Objectives through the Use of IDR and One PI", "paragraphs": ["Because IDR and One PI are not being used as planned, CMS officials  are not yet in a position to determine the extent to which the systems are  providing financial benefits or supporting the agency\u2019s initiatives to meet  program integrity goals and objectives. As we have reported, agencies  should forecast expected benefits and then measure actual financial  benefits accrued through the implementation of information technology  programs. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  requires agencies to report progress against performance measures and  targets for meeting them that reflect the goals and objectives of the  programs. To do this, performance measures should be outcome-based  and developed with stakeholder input, and program performance must be  monitored, measured, and compared to expected results so that agency  officials are able to determine the extent to which goals and objectives  are being met. In addition, industry experts describe the need for  performance measures to be developed with stakeholders\u2019 input early in a  project\u2019s planning process to provide a central management and planning  tool and to monitor the performance of the project against plans and  stakeholders\u2019 needs.", "While CMS has shown some progress toward meeting the programs\u2019  goals of providing a centralized data repository and enhanced analytical  capabilities for detecting improper payments due to fraud, waste, and  abuse, the current implementation of IDR and One PI does not position  the agency to identify, measure, and track financial benefits realized from  reductions in improper payments as a result of the implementation of  either system.

However, as of  March 2011, program officials had not identified actual financial benefits  of implementing IDR.", "Further, program officials\u2019 projection of financial benefits expected as a  result of implementing One PI was most recently reported to be  approximately $21 billion. This estimate was increased from initial  expectations based on assumptions that accelerated plans to integrate  Medicare and Medicaid data into IDR would enable One PI users to  identify increasing numbers of improper payments sooner than previously  estimated, thus allowing the agency to recover more funds that have  been lost due to payment errors.", "However, the current implementation of One PI has not yet produced  outcomes that position the agency to identify or measure financial  benefits. CMS officials stated at the end of fiscal year 2010\u2014more than a  year after deploying One PI\u2014that it was too early to determine whether  the program has provided any financial benefits. They explained that,  since the program had not met its goal for widespread use of One PI,  there were not enough data available to quantify financial benefits  attributable to the use of the system. These officials said that as the user  community is expanded, they expect to be able to begin to identify and  measure financial and other benefits of using the system.", "In addition, program officials have not developed and tracked outcome- based performance measures to help ensure that efforts to implement  One PI and IDR meet the agency\u2019s goals and objectives for improving the  results of its program integrity initiatives. For example, outcome-based  measures for the programs would indicate improvements to the agency\u2019s  ability to recover funds lost because of improper payments of fraudulent  claims. However, while program officials defined and reported to OMB  performance targets for IDR related to some of the program\u2019s goals, they  do not reflect the goal of the program to provide a single source of  Medicare and Medicaid data that supports enhanced program integrity  efforts. Additionally, CMS officials have not developed quantifiable  measures for meeting the One PI program\u2019s goals. For example,  performance measures and targets for One PI include increases in the  detection of improper payments for Medicare Parts A and B claims.  However, the limited use of the system has not generated enough data to  quantify the amount of funds recovered from improper payments.", "Because it lacks meaningful outcome-based performance measures and  sufficient data for tracking progress toward meeting performance targets,  CMS does not have the information needed to ensure that the systems  are useful to the extent that benefits realized from their implementation  help the agency meet program integrity goals. Further, until CMS is better  positioned to identify and measure financial benefits and establishes  outcome-based performance measures to help gauge progress toward  meeting program integrity goals, it cannot be assured that the systems  will contribute to improvements in CMS\u2019s ability to detect fraud, waste,  and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and prevent or  recover billions of dollars lost to improper payments of claims.", "Given the critical need for CMS to improve the management of and  reduce improper payments within the Medicare and Medicaid programs,  our report being released today recommends a number of actions that we  consider vital to helping CMS achieve more widespread use of IDR and  One PI for program integrity purposes. Specifically, we are  recommending that the Administrator of CMS  finalize plans and develop schedules for incorporating additional data  into IDR that identify all resources and activities needed to complete  tasks and that consider risks and obstacles to the IDR program; implement and manage plans for incorporating data in IDR to meet  schedule milestones; \uf0b7  establish plans and reliable schedules for training all program integrity  analysts intended to use One PI; \uf0b7  establish and communicate deadlines for program integrity  contractors to complete training and use One PI in their work; conduct training in accordance with plans and established deadlines  to ensure schedules are met and program integrity contractors are  trained and able to meet requirements for using One PI; \uf0b7  define any measurable financial benefits expected from the  implementation of IDR and One PI; and \uf0b7  with stakeholder input, establish measurable, outcome-based  performance measures for IDR and One PI that gauge progress  toward meeting program goals.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, CMS agreed with these  recommendations and indicated that it plans to take steps to address the  challenges and problems that we identified during our study.", "In summary, CMS\u2019s success toward meeting its goals to enhance  program integrity will depend upon the agency\u2019s incorporation of all  needed data into IDR as well as the effective use of the systems by the  agency\u2019s broad community of program integrity analysts. In addition, a  vital step will be the identification of measurable financial benefits and  performance goals expected to be attained through improvements in the  agency\u2019s ability to prevent and detect fraudulent, wasteful, and abusive  claims and resulting improper payments. In taking these steps, the  agency will better position itself to determine whether these systems are  useful for enhancing CMS\u2019s ability to identify fraud, waste, and abuse  and, consequently, reduce the loss of funds resulting from improper  payments of Medicare and Medicaid claims.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
