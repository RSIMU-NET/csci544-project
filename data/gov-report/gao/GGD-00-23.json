Customs is responsible for determining the final classification and value of the merchandise. The Mod Act also gave Customs and importers a shared responsibility for ensuring compliance with trade laws.

During the first step, known as cargo release, Customs assumes direct control of the merchandise and uses an inspection process to verify that the cargo meets import requirements and is properly and accurately documented. When Customs determines that these requirements have been met, the cargo is released. During the second step, referred to as entry summary, Customs selects for review some of the detailed paperwork that has been submitted by the importer. Customs subsequently liquidates the importation (completes the transaction) after determining that the appropriate import duty has been paid.", "Although cargo release and entry summary are Customs\u2019 major programs for ensuring compliance with trade laws, its commercial fraud, fines, penalties, and forfeitures program is its major weapon against violators of these laws. Customs also assesses liquidated damages when an importer does not comply with regulations. Civil monetary penalties, on the other hand, are assessed for violations, such as misclassification, knowingly falsifying the country of origin, and other fraudulent acts. Customs usually takes seizure actions when merchandise is illegal or not admissible to the United States.", "Although Customs agents, inspectors, and import specialists assess penalties and make seizures, it is the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures offices that are responsible for administrative processing and tracking of all liquidated damages, penalty, and seizure cases. Customs has been performing these activities for many years, long before the Mod Act, and continues to perform them in addition to its informed compliance efforts.", "For over 15 years, Customs has used its Automated Commercial System (ACS) to store and process import information and to manage import- related activities, such as collecting revenue and capturing trade statistics.ACS allows Customs to identify, track, and control imported merchandise during cargo release and entry summary liquidation processing.

After several attempts, compromise legislation acceptable to Customs, Congress, and the trade community was developed. This legislation, the Customs Modernization and Informed Compliance Act or Mod Act, which allowed Customs to automate its processes incrementally and allowed Customs to be flexible and innovative in redesigning its business processes, became law on December 8, 1993, as Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.", "The Mod Act introduced two new concepts: informed compliance and shared responsibility. These concepts were premised on the theory that in order to maximize voluntary compliance with Customs laws and regulations, the trade community needed to be fully and completely informed of its legal obligations. In addition, Customs was to effectively communicate its requirements to the trade community, and the people and businesses subject to those requirements were to conduct their regulated activities in conformance with U.S. laws and regulations. The trade community was to use reasonable care in meeting its responsibilities. According to Customs, there is a general consensus that a \u201cblack and white\u201d definition of reasonable care is impossible because the concept of acting with reasonable care depends upon individual circumstances.

Compliance rates, used to measure the effectiveness of these initiatives and actions, are showing no measurable improvement.", "Although Customs has monitored and evaluated certain aspects of the initiatives and actions, it has not evaluated, nor does it have a plan to evaluate, the impact on compliance of the overall informed compliance strategy. A properly designed and implemented evaluation would enable Customs to determine whether the overall informed compliance strategy is working and determine what contributions the initiatives or actions are making. This seems especially important since Customs may not be able to reach its goals in terms of coverage for the compliance assessment and account management initiatives. Given that both initiatives may stay far smaller than originally envisioned, it is important to determine what effect they are likely to have on compliance rates with the importer coverage they can reasonably achieve.", "Under the Results Act, agencies are to assess their performance against their goals and determine, for goals not achieved, whether the goals were too high, resources too scarce, or agency efforts too ill-managed. Customs has adjusted its compliance goals to reflect a 4-year delay because, according to Customs, the established goals were too ambitious for the resources available. An evaluation of the informed compliance initiatives and actions could provide Customs with the information it needs to maximize the use of the resources available for this program by enhancing what works and reducing or eliminating what does not. It could also provide the information needed for Customs to establish reasonable goals for the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Customs develop and implement an evaluation of the effectiveness of its informed compliance strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of the Treasury. In a letter dated November 11, 1999, the Customs Service\u2019s Director of the Office of Planning provided us with comments on the draft, which we have reprinted in appendix IV. Customs\u2019 primary focus concerned the report\u2019s recommendation, which Customs felt should be clarified to focus on the five compliance programs targeted by the report, and not on the entire broad piece of legislation that is the Mod Act. If the phrase \u201cand the specific initiatives and actions it developed to implement the Mod Act\u2026\u201d were omitted from the draft recommendation, Customs believed it would be able to better target its response to the issues raised in the report. We agree with Customs and omitted the phrase from the recommendation to ensure Customs\u2019 focus on evaluating its informed compliance strategy and not other parts of the Mod Act.", "Customs also believed that the report should recognize that its informed compliance efforts have been continually evaluated and refined, but our report conveys the opposite impression. Customs also stated that many monitoring and evaluation efforts are under way, and major component areas of informed compliance will continue to be analyzed and assessed. It said enhancements to programs and processes will also be implemented as appropriate. We stated that \u201cWhile Customs has monitored and evaluated certain aspects of the initiatives and actions, it has not evaluated nor does it have a plan to evaluate the impact on compliance of the overall informed compliance strategy.\u201d We agree with and support Customs\u2019 ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and enhancement efforts of its many programs, including those related to informed compliance activities. However, we continue to believe that an evaluation, under the Results Act umbrella, of the initiatives and actions that implement the informed compliance strategy is necessary for Customs to be able to set realistic performance goals for improving importers\u2019 compliance rates. Moreover, this evaluation could identify the contribution of each initiative and action toward achieving the overall goal of the informed compliance strategy and improving importers\u2019 compliance rates.", "In addition, Customs stated that the report gives the impression that as the compliance rates have not risen to the levels anticipated, there is something inherently wrong with the informed compliance approach. Customs also stated that it believes there is a value to informed compliance above and beyond raising compliance, as comments from several importers that we interviewed indicated. We have not concluded that there is something inherently wrong with the informed compliance strategy and did not intend to give that impression. We stated in our conclusions section on page 37 that compliance rates, used to measure the effectiveness of informed compliance initiatives and actions, are showing no measurable improvement and that a properly designed and implemented evaluation could determine whether the overall informed compliance strategy is working and what contributions the initiatives or actions are making. If, after such an evaluation, Customs determines that one or more of the initiatives are not making substantial contributions to the overall goal of raising importers\u2019 compliance rates, then either part or all of the informed compliance strategy should be reexamined at that time. In addition, we included comments from the major importers to show that there was indeed value to the informed compliance program, notwithstanding our concerns about the lack of progress in producing the benefits expected from the program.", "Customs also raised concerns about the correlation we make between the compliance assessment and its impact on compliance as indicated by an analysis of 59 importers (see p. 21). Customs believes that it is premature to draw any conclusions regarding the link between compliance assessments and compliance measurement because the programs measure different areas of compliance. Customs also believes that our conclusion that compliance assessments may not have improved compliance based on a drop in fiscal year 1998 compliance rates is premature and not sufficiently supported. Customs does not feel that sufficient analysis has been done to lead to that conclusion and requests that the analysis of compliance rates of 59 importers, many of which are not statistically valid, be removed from the report as the support for drawing the conclusion.", "In addition to the written comments from Customs on the results of our analysis of 59 importers and the impact on compliance from their compliance assessments, we had several discussions with Customs officials on this issue. Specifically, as further clarification on this issue, the officials believed that (1) because most of the compliance rates in our analysis are not statistically valid, we should reconsider using them as a basis for indicating the impact of compliance assessments; (2) it is premature to draw any conclusions regarding the link between compliance assessments and compliance measurement; and (3) compliance determined under a cargo examination (compliance measurement) is not identical to compliance as a result of a compliance assessment. The officials pointed out that, for example, the compliance assessment may conclude that an importer is not compliant because of unreported value in its merchandise. This is determined through an examination of the importer\u2019s books and records. On the other hand, the officials noted that compliance measurement examinations may determine that an importer is not compliant because of inaccurate marking of merchandise. This would be determined by physical inspection of the merchandise, which could not be determined during a compliance assessment.", "As noted on page 21 of the report, although most of the compliance rates in our analysis are not statistically valid, they continue to provide an indicator about whether or not overall compliance improved at importers that had received compliance assessments. In addition, the Regulatory Audit Division Director agreed that our analysis, although not based on statistically valid compliance rates, does have some usefulness for evaluating compliance. As we also noted on page 16 of the report, compliance assessment is a review to ensure that a company\u2019s imports are in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, the goal being to ensure maximum compliance. Although a compliance assessment involves reviewing a company\u2019s books and records, it also involves statistical sampling of entry transactions, including a minimum review of compliance in five trade areas, including classification, value, and quantity. This procedure appears to establish the link between compliance assessment and compliance measurement, since compliance assessment findings are used to determine the frequency of future compliance measurement examinations. It also appears that compliance measurement results could and should be used to analyze the impact of compliance assessments. As our limited analysis showed on page 21, compliance measurement rates serve as an indicator of whether or not overall compliance has improved.", "We have also included in the final report technical comments and suggestions from Customs as appropriate.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 10 days after its issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Honorable Sander M.
