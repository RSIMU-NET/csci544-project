The  documentation of standards and guidelines is important because it  provides system administrators and other operating personnel specific  instructions on how to, among other things, implement controls and  configure systems in order to comply with agency information security  policies.", "Another important element of an information security program involves  promoting awareness and providing required training so that users  understand the risks and their role in implementing related policies and  controls to mitigate those risks. However, the extent of noncompliance  with strong security policies and guidelines suggests that some  operating personnel were either unaware of appropriate security  practices or insensitive to the need for implementing important  information system controls.", "An ongoing monitoring program that includes testing and evaluation  helps to ensure that systems are in compliance with policies, and that  policies and controls are both appropriate and effective. This type of  oversight is fundamental because it demonstrates management\u2019s  commitment to the security program, reminds employees of their roles  and responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates areas of  noncompliance and ineffectiveness. Although contractors conducted  several reviews of controls for the Pay.gov computing environment,  Pay.gov operating personnel did not consistently or promptly correct  identified weaknesses. For example, about 22 percent of the  weaknesses we identified during our review had been identified in these  prior reviews, including a serious vulnerability related to the security  zones established for the Pay.gov computing environment.", "In particular, a key component of an ongoing monitoring process is the  review of security configuration settings on devices after software has  been installed or maintenance has been performed. Operating personnel  are often required to change security configuration settings on systems  in order to install new software or devices and to perform maintenance  on existing ones. Because of this change, it is important to ensure that  these security settings are reset to their secure values when the  installation or maintenance is completed. However, FMS did not ensure  that operating personnel performed a postinstallation review to identify  vulnerable configuration settings after a new release of Pay.gov was  installed. Operating personnel stated that some of the weaknesses we  identified could have occurred when system security settings were  changed to install the new release but not reset to their secure value  after the installation was complete.", "These deficiencies are consistent with those we previously reported on  FMS oversight of its other contractors that provide operational support for  key FMS financial systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FMS Asserts It Has Corrected Many Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["FMS generally agreed with the weaknesses we identified and took  immediate steps to address them. FMS asserted that half of the weaknesses  had been addressed during or within 1 week following our on-site review  and that it has since corrected 47 of the 49 weaknesses identified. FMS is  actively working to address the remaining two weaknesses. Prompt  implementation of these actions by FMS demonstrates a commitment to  securing Pay.gov resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although FMS and the Federal Reserve had implemented numerous  controls to protect Pay.gov computing resources, risks were not  sufficiently assessed, and numerous control weaknesses increased risks to  the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Pay.gov systems and data  because FMS did not provide sufficient management oversight to ensure  that key elements of the Pay.gov information security program were fully or  consistently implemented. While FMS has asserted that it has taken  immediate action to correct the weaknesses that we identified during our  review, much work remains to be done to enable FMS and the Federal  Reserve to promptly address new security threats and risks as they emerge.  Ensuring that known weaknesses affecting the Pay.gov application and its  computing environment are promptly mitigated requires top management  support and leadership, disciplined processes, and consistent oversight.  Until FMS ensures that steps are completed to mitigate these weaknesses  and address emerging ones, it will have reduced assurance that the Pay.gov  application and computing environment are safeguarded against misuse  and unauthorized disclosure and modification, and its exposure to these  risks will remain unnecessarily high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Pay.gov  application and computing environment, we recommend that the FMS  Commissioner direct the Pay.gov program manager to develop and  implement an action plan for strengthening Pay.gov computer controls.", "In addition, we recommend that FMS Commissioner strengthen  management oversight of the Pay.gov initiative by directing the Pay.gov  program manager to  assess risks for the Pay.gov computing environment,  develop technical implementation guidance to (1) assist Pay.gov  operating personnel with implementing controls and configuring  Pay.gov devices in accordance with strong security practice and  (2) document reasons for using less secure configuration settings,   track and actively coordinate with Pay.gov operating personnel to  correct or mitigate known weaknesses and report the status of  corrective actions to the FMS Commissioner on a regular basis, and  establish procedures for the proactive review or audit of the  configuration settings on Pay.gov devices after installation or  maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments on a draft of this report (which are  reprinted in app. I), the FMS Commissioner concurred with our  recommendations and noted that FMS had already implemented 96 percent  of the recommendations in the Limited Official Use Only version of this  report, with the rest to be addressed as part of an upcoming release of  Pay.gov. The Commissioner also identified the specific corrective actions  that FMS has taken to strengthen management oversight of the Pay.gov  initiative. These include (1) completing a comprehensive security risk  assessment for the Pay.gov computing environment; (2) documenting and  implementing appropriate security and management controls to protect the  application and its computing environment; (3) establishing a team to  periodically check the configuration of servers and networks, as well as to  evaluate operational staff awareness of and adherence to established  policy; (4) engaging the Federal Reserve\u2019s National Incident Response  Team and establishing an agreement with the Federal Reserve that the  general auditors of the various Reserve Banks will conduct regular  information technology audits of FMS\u2019s Internet applications; (5)  instituting greater separation of duties and a more rigorous software  change management process to maintain stricter control over deployed  software; and (6) documenting security policies in all statements of work  so that all vendors are aware of and accountable for security requirements.  According to the FMS Commissioner, these actions have already helped to  more consistently enforce security controls over Pay.gov.", "The FMS Commissioner takes issue with one element of our assessment.  Throughout this report, we attribute many of the weaknesses jointly to  FMS and the Federal Reserve. The Commissioner believes it is  inappropriate and unnecessary to include the Federal Reserve as a  responsible party to the report\u2019s findings because all management  responsibility and authority over all business, technical, and policy  decisions reside exclusively with FMS. We agree with the FMS  Commissioner that management responsibility rests with FMS, which is  why we have addressed our recommendations to the Commissioner.  However, we also believe it is appropriate and necessary to include the  Federal Reserve as a responsible party because (1) the Pay.gov application  and computing environment reside at Federal Reserve facilities, (2) the  Federal Reserve\u2019s personnel and contractors are responsible for operating  the Pay.gov application and computing environment, and (3) day-to-day  operational decisions and activities by the Federal Reserve\u2019s personnel or  contractors contributed to the security weaknesses affecting Pay.gov.", "If you have any questions or need any further information, please contact  Gregory C.
