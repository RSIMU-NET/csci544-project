In the first phase, in a comparison of data from fiscal years 1988 and 1994, we found that IRS had invested additional time in these audits of large corporations but revenue agents recommended fewer additional taxes per audit hour. For these years, IRS ultimately assessed 27 percent of the recommended taxes against these corporations.", "This assessment rate and these audit results raise issues about the productivity of such audits. Initiated under our basic legislative authority, this review identified factors that contributed to the assessment rate and audit results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For audit purposes, IRS splits large corporations (those reporting $10 million or more in gross assets) into two groups. Of the 46,700 large corporations in 1994, IRS placed about 1,700 corporations, usually exceeding $250 million in assets, into CEP. IRS audits the large corporations not in CEP (hereafter referred to as \u201clarge corporations\u201d) under the Examination Division\u2019s general program. The Examination Division audits tax returns to determine whether taxpayers paid the correct amount of tax.", "As discussed later in detail, IRS audit staff are to take various steps before auditing a return. First, the staff must classify and select a return for audit. IRS classifies returns to highlight tax issues (e.g., income, deductions, credits) that should be audited. Then, an IRS revenue agent is to plan how to audit such issues and collect information from the large corporation, as needed. If the corporation does not provide all requested information in a reasonable period without a valid excuse, IRS may issue a legal summons to compel the taxpayer to comply. The Department of Justice works with IRS to enforce the summons in court.", "For each audit issue, if the revenue agent views this information as insufficient support for the position taken on the return, the agent is to recommend adjustments to the return and compute a corrected tax liability. On the other hand, if the information supports the return filed by the large corporation, the agent is to recommend no tax change. The revenue agent presents the audit results to the large corporation officials, who may either agree or disagree. If the large corporation agrees, any additional tax that the revenue agent recommended becomes assessed. If the large corporation disagrees, it may file a protest with IRS\u2019 Office of Appeals, which is tasked with settling tax disputes without litigation on the basis of what is fair to the government and the taxpayer.", "An appeals officer is to evaluate the relative strengths of the government\u2019s and taxpayer\u2019s positions by reviewing the facts, including additional information provided by the taxpayer, pertinent court decisions, and the results of informal conferences with the taxpayer. To settle a tax dispute, an appeals officer can consider the hazards of litigation. The officer is then to negotiate mutual concessions in an attempt to arrive at a settlement. If a case is settled, any additional tax is assessed and the appeals officer is to prepare an Appeals case memorandum, or written summary, of how the case was handled. The summary is to include the issues raised; pertinent facts; applicable regulations, rulings, and court decisions; and the merits and hazards of litigation of each side. If a case is not settled, Appeals is required to issue a notice of deficiency and the taxpayer has 90 days to file a petition with the Tax Court. Even after a case is docketed in court, IRS District Counsel, by itself or by reengaging Appeals, may attempt to settle the case prior to trial.", "IRS data showed that in fiscal year 1992, Examination sent 2,235 large corporate cases to Appeals. As of late fiscal year 1995, Appeals had settled about 1,800 of those cases. Of those not settled by Appeals, three were settled by District Counsel, two were settled by trial, and the remainder were still open in Appeals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objective was to determine what factors affected the results of auditing large corporations as well as the amount of additional taxes recommended in these audits that are ultimately assessed. To accomplish our objective, we used two methodologies. First, we sent questionnaires to IRS revenue agents, IRS appeals officers, and corporate taxpayers associated with a nationally representative sample of audits in which a large corporation agreed with the additional recommended taxes at the end of either the audit or appeals processes during fiscal year 1994. To focus on larger audits, we restricted this questionnaire study to the universe of large corporate audits with $75,000 or more in recommended additional taxes and concentrated about one-third of the sample in a stratum with recommended taxes of $1 million or more. Our sample of 500 included about $2.3 billion of the $2.6 billion in recommended additional taxes and $648 million of the $810 million in taxes assessed from the 1,266 large corporate audits in our universe. Appendix I provides a detailed description of our sample selection methodology.", "We also sent a more general questionnaire to IRS group managers because, being responsible for many types of audits, they were not as likely as the above respondents to recall information about specific audits of large corporations. We randomly sampled group managers nationwide who had large corporate audits in their inventories as of August 1995. Questionnaire results for revenue agents, group managers, and appeals officers are presented in appendices II through IV, respectively. Because the questionnaires were sent to a sample rather than all members of their respective universes, all of the sample results are subject to sampling error. Unless otherwise noted, all estimates presented in this report have a 95 percent confidence interval of less than plus or minus 10 percent. Questionnaire results for the large corporations are not included because of a low response rate that did not allow us to develop estimates.", "Second, we obtained input from various IRS staff. We visited IRS\u2019 National Office, its 4 regional offices, and 7 of its 33 district and appeals offices to interview key officials. During the design phase of our review, we visited three additional districts and two additional appeals offices. In the National Office, we contacted officials in the Examination Division, National Appeals Office, and the Strategic Planning Division. In conjunction with our site visits, we interviewed selected Appeals, District Counsel, and Examination officials to obtain their views. Appendix V lists all locations visited and the officials interviewed at each location. In addition, we asked the Examination Chiefs in all 33 IRS district offices nationwide and Appeals Chiefs in all 33 appeals offices nationwide to give us their written comments on certain factors related to these large corporate audits. We received responses from 31 (94 percent) of the Examination Chiefs and 30 (91 percent) of the Appeals Chiefs. Their views are incorporated throughout this report.", "We obtained oral comments on a draft of our report from IRS and the Tax Executives Institute (TEI). We discuss such comments and our evaluation of them at the end of this letter. Overall, we conducted our work at IRS\u2019 National Office, 4 regional offices, 10 of the 33 district offices, and 9 of the 33 appeals offices. In addition, we used questionnaires received from all of IRS\u2019 33 district offices. We also asked Examination Chiefs and Appeals Chiefs nationwide to give us their comments on factors related to these large corporate audits. We did our work from May 1995 to November 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Statistics Raise Issues About Audits of Large Corporations", "paragraphs": ["Our 1995 report on large corporate audit trends provided statistics on IRS audits of large corporations between fiscal years 1988 and 1994. These statistics covered the audit results and assessment rate over this 7-year period. Neither we nor IRS knows what the assessment rate should be, but these statistics indicate that IRS has been investing a lot of time and money recommending additional taxes that do not get assessed.", "For example, in a comparison of data for 1988 and 1994, we found that IRS invested more resources in large corporate audits but recommended less additional tax per hour. IRS spent 25 percent more hours and audited only 3 percent more returns. Even so, the amount of taxes recommended (in constant dollars) dropped 23 percent per audit hour and 7 percent per audited return. In addition, IRS\u2019 no-change rate doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent.", "Further, for the 7-year period, we computed that IRS assessed, on average, 27 percent of the additional taxes that IRS revenue agents recommended in these audits. The assessment rate includes the amount of recommended taxes that the large corporations agreed to pay at the end of the audit as well as those amounts sustained after any appeal. Over the 7 years, large corporations appealed between 66 and 85 percent of the additional taxes recommended and agreed to pay the rest. Since 1990, corporate taxpayers have been appealing a lower percentage of the recommended taxes and agreeing to a higher percentage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Assessment Rate and Audit Results", "paragraphs": ["We identified four factors that affected the assessment rate and/or audit results, such as the lower recommended taxes per audit hour in 1994 compared to 1988. Although the exact impact is unknown, each factor can affect both the rate and results. For example, three of the four factors\u2014complex tax laws, conflicting performance measures between Examination and Appeals, and limited coordination between these two IRS functions\u2014can produce a lower assessment rate.", "As for lower audit results, the three factors can each have a different impact. Complex laws cause IRS\u2019 audits to be very time consuming, which can lower the amount of recommended taxes per hour. Although Examination\u2019s performance measures would encourage higher amounts of recommended tax, Appeals measures would not be as likely to affect the audit results. Limited coordination between Appeals and Examination was unlikely to affect the audit results being disputed by corporations because the audits had already been done. On the other hand, future audit results on similar tax issues were likely to be reduced when revenue agents did not receive feedback on which disputed issues were conceded and why; such knowledge could enhance future audits.", "The fourth factor entailed a number of aspects of an audit that could reduce the taxes recommended per audit hour or the assessment rate. Because revenue agents generally worked alone without much assistance from counsel or their management, they needed more time to develop enough support to recommend taxes that could be assessed after an appeal. These agents also did not have a sufficient basis for selecting corporate tax returns with potential for significant tax changes. Generally, audits of returns with low potential were more likely to result in recommendations for little or no tax change and were less likely to be appealed. Thus, these audits would generally have little effect on the assessment rate. However, when a revenue agent tried to recommend taxes without sufficient support, such recommended taxes would not likely be sustained in Appeals, and the assessment rate would be lower. The following sections discuss each of these four factors in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tax Law Complicates IRS\u2019 Audits of Large Corporations", "paragraphs": ["IRS and large corporate taxpayers can have legitimate differences over how tax laws should be interpreted. We found that complex, ambiguous laws have created opportunities for both large corporations and IRS to interpret the tax laws differently. This discretion, in turn, increased the likelihood of tax disputes. Without clear tax laws, resolution of these disputes can get complicated and can ultimately depend on the negotiating skills of the IRS and corporate representatives. Because the corporate representatives have usually prevailed in Appeals or the courts, recommended additional taxes have tended not to be assessed.", "We have previously reported that the federal tax laws are complex, difficult to understand, and in some cases indecipherable. Some of the large corporate officials who responded to our survey indicated that a major reason for disputing recommended taxes was revenue agents\u2019 interpretation of tax laws. We estimate that revenue agents judged that about 86 percent of the corporate tax disputes were due to different interpretations of the tax laws. Appeals officers in our universe cited the hazards of litigation as the primary reason for resolving these interpretive differences in favor of the corporations for an estimated 56 percent of the additional taxes being appealed. The National Director of Appeals told us in a letter that these audits often raise issues involving substantial doubt or variances of opinion because these issues are complex and not definitively answered by litigation.", "The complex tax laws also affected IRS\u2019 ability to conduct audits, according to 21 of the 33 Examination Chiefs and 27 of the 33 Appeals Chiefs nationwide. Such complexity, in combination with the broad scope of the tax laws, made it difficult for IRS to ensure that its revenue agents stayed current in their tax law knowledge and for large corporations to comply with the tax laws. \u201cTaxpayers are aware of the difficulty of determining with exactness the liability that they have. They are also aware that the courts cannot resolve all disputes arising out of the audit process. Therefore, the Service must pursue the administrative resolution of these cases whenever possible. The fact that the Service is highly motivated to resolve cases without litigation means that compromises on difficult and controversial issues will take place. Knowing this, taxpayers naturally take advantage of the process to dispute those issues on which some doubt exists.\u201d", "To help resolve problems with tax law complexity and recurring issues in CEP audits, our 1994 report recommended that IRS should more strongly propose changes to the tax laws. IRS agreed and has established a work group to evaluate ways to implement this recommendation. To the extent that IRS is successful in getting Congress to simplify the various complex tax issues, large corporations are likely to benefit as well as IRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differing Measures in Examination and Appeals May Have Reduced the Assessment Rate", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 overall mission is to collect the proper amount of taxes in a manner that is efficient and fair and promotes public confidence. The Examination and Appeals functions also have important missions that should contribute to IRS\u2019 overall mission. Revenue agents are charged with protecting the government\u2019s interest in receiving the proper amount of tax. They are instructed to make their audit recommendations without deviating from IRS\u2019 legal positions or considering the hazards of litigation (i.e., the chance of losing in court). On the other hand, appeals officers are charged with resolving tax controversies without litigation to the extent possible while being fair and impartial to both the government and the taxpayer. They are instructed to consider the hazards of litigation and may concede the recommended taxes in part or in whole on that basis.", "Performance measures typically move a function toward desired ends within a mission. In doing so, the performance measures within the two functions reflect their respective missions and may not encourage the functions to work together effectively to accomplish IRS\u2019 overall mission. For example, Examination has traditionally focused on measuring the amount of additional taxes recommended per audit and per audit hour. On the other hand, Appeals has focused on measuring the number of tax disputes settled as quickly as possible without litigation. These different measures have the potential to lead to a lower assessment rate. The audit measures may encourage revenue agents to propose tax adjustments regardless of whether they can be sustained on appeal and discourage agents from fully developing issues because of time pressures to close the audits. Appeals\u2019 measures may encourage appeals officers to settle more cases in less time even when some of the recommended taxes have a justifiable basis under vague or complex tax laws. As a result, a high proportion of recommended taxes may not be assessed, but Examination could claim success for recommending high amounts of taxes and Appeals could claim success for settling the case without litigation.", "In our 1994 CEP report, we reported a similar situation for CEP audits and recommended that IRS add an IRS-wide measure, such as the collection rate, to the functional measures. Although IRS disagreed with this recommendation when commenting on a draft of the CEP report, IRS officials subsequently told us they plan to implement such an IRS-wide measure in some form during fiscal year 1998. Such a measure could similarly be applied to various types of audits, including audits of other large corporations.", "An IRS-wide measure such as the collection and/or assessment rate could encourage IRS functions to work together to accomplish IRS\u2019 overall mission of collecting the proper amount of tax. National Office Examination and Appeals officials expressed concerns about possible unintended effects from creating such a measure. For example, they said an overall IRS measure such as the assessment rate could encourage revenue agents to avoid raising difficult audit issues or appeals officers to settle disputes just to drive up the assessment rate. However, this measure of the tax outcomes also would be likely to encourage revenue agents to more fully develop audit issues that could be sustained if appealed. As discussed later, such a measure also could encourage appeals officers to coordinate with Examination while still remaining impartial and independent in settling tax disputes.", "As measures are emphasized over time, they become ingrained, making changes very difficult. At every location we visited, we heard about the driving force of existing measures from Examination or Appeals officials and the difficulty of changing or adding to them. These officials noted that as new measures are introduced, the culture of the organization will resist change and cling to the past.", "Many Examination and Appeals managers we contacted also expressed concerns over using an assessment rate as a measure for the large corporate program. In part, they pointed to impurities in IRS\u2019 databases that do not allow them to separate audit actions from nonaudit actions, such as claims or net operating losses. IRS has been developing a new database to help identify these problems and their impacts on the revenue collected due to audits and other enforcement efforts.", "One case in our sample epitomizes the concerns about the assessment rate being skewed by nonaudit actions. In this case, the revenue agent recommended several hundred million dollars in additional taxes. Appeals sustained 100 percent of the issues and the taxes recommended by the revenue agent. However, the large corporation submitted additional information as well as a net operating loss and other claims during the Appeals process. Appeals accepted and approved these losses and claims. The losses and claims almost completely offset the additional taxes recommended by the revenue agent. As a result, about 1 percent of the recommended taxes was assessed. Until the databases account for them, nonaudit actions that are considered during the Appeals process will continue to overstate or understate the rate at which taxes recommended in audits get assessed.", "On the other hand, of the 40 regional and district officials we interviewed, 14 told us they supported using the assessment rate. One Appeals Chief told us \u201cThe measurement standards would be more appropriately based on dollars ultimately assessed and collected.\u201d In addition, at least one official from each function\u2014Appeals, Counsel, and Examination\u2014in the four regions told us that both Examination and Appeals should be accountable for the assessment rate. Further, 7 of 33 Chiefs of Examination said they already used a cross-functional measure, such as the amount of additional taxes recommended that gets assessed, as an additional way to evaluate audit effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Audit Circumstances Hindered Revenue Agents From Developing Recommended Taxes That Could Be Sustained", "paragraphs": ["Audits of these large corporations can be complex and technical but are generally done by a single revenue agent. Although they worked alone, these revenue agents received little assistance from district counsel or their group managers. Also, IRS\u2019 approach for classifying and selecting these large corporate returns did not help ensure that revenue agents spent their audit time on the most noncompliant returns. Finally, the agents had difficulty obtaining information from the large corporations.

For the large corporations in our study, the average return was audited by a single revenue agent with about 8.5 years of corporate auditing experience. IRS has lost about 1,800 experienced revenue agents over the past 3 years. IRS National Office Examination officials as well as regional and district officials interviewed noted that if IRS continues to lose its senior revenue agents without being able to replace them, corporate audits will become less productive. Furthermore, these agents could not easily develop corporate expertise because they generally conducted many other types of audits, such as those of partnerships and individuals.", "Given the level of experience of these revenue agents and the complexity of the tax law, training in corporate income tax practices and the tax laws is important. In this regard, the revenue agents in an estimated 38 percent of the audits in our study population believed that they needed, but had not received, training that would have improved their ability to conduct their audits. A common need cited was for more industry-related training. Further, 25 of the 33 Examination Chiefs nationwide indicated that additional training in specific industries would enhance audits of complex, technical issues. A regional task force cited a need for additional training so revenue agents could become more proficient in recognizing and developing corporate issues. In February 1997, National Office Examination officials told us they were developing a specific course that will be used to train all revenue agents assigned to large corporate audits. To help guide revenue agents doing large corporate audits, they also planned to have audit criteria and procedures in place by the end of calendar year 1998.", "However, six Examination Chiefs pointed out the difficulty in providing additional training when training funds have been diverted to other areas because of budget limitations. For example, one Examination Chief told us that for fiscal year 1996 the training budget was cut so severely that Examination could not conduct continuing professional education for revenue agents. National Office Examination officials told us during November 1996 that IRS added $10 million to fiscal year 1997 training funds across IRS, of which Examination received $1.4 million. According to one of the officials, these funds should help Examination provide most, but not all, of the basic continuing professional education training to its revenue agents.

However, we found that revenue agents usually did not request assistance from district counsel or their group managers on planning and doing the audits.", "Revenue agents for most of the 1,266 audits in our study population said they did not request any legal assistance on matters of tax law or overall issue development. We estimate that revenue agents reported requesting assistance from the Office of District Counsel for about 14 percent of the audits, and from the Office of Chief Counsel for about 8 percent of the audits. However, for an estimated 55 percent of those audits in which revenue agents requested assistance, they judged that such assistance had a positive or very positive effect on their ability to obtain the taxpayers\u2019 agreement. Appeals officers consulted with district counsel during resolution of an estimated 20 percent of the most significant issues raised by revenue agents. For about half of these consultations, the appeals officers indicated that District Counsel helped them to resolve the disputes to a great or very great extent.", "Our interviews with district office officials identified a major reason for infrequent requests for legal assistance. These officials were concerned about revenue agents and appeals officers not receiving the assistance in a timely manner. Counsel officials in the four districts we visited acknowledged that responding to requests for formal legal assistance can be time-consuming. However, these officials told us they could help improve the effectiveness of the large corporation audits by assisting the revenue agent in developing audit issues and obtaining requested information. They believed that such involvement could be justified and helpful. In February 1997, National Office Examination officials told us that Counsel involvement in CEP cases is working well and support looking for ways to increase Counsel\u2019s involvement in the large corporate cases. However, Counsel officials cautioned that increased involvement would have to be on a selective and informal basis due to staffing constraints.", "Less than half of the revenue agents in our universe indicated their group managers were involved in identifying audit issues, discussing complex audit issues, obtaining information from the taxpayer, or resolving disputed issues. In well over half of those audits in which revenue agents indicated their managers were involved, the revenue agents indicated that such involvement helped them. For example, we estimated that in 207 of the audits in our population, revenue agents indicated that their group managers were involved in obtaining requested information from taxpayers; in an estimated 83 percent of those audits, the revenue agents viewed such involvement as either very positive or somewhat positive.", "Examination officials and the regional task force report provided insights on why managers were not more frequently involved in agents\u2019 audits. For example, they said most group managers did not have sufficient experience or time to substantially assist revenue agents. Examination officials from the districts we visited told us that group managers were responsible for many revenue agents and other auditors who audit a range of tax entities, from individual returns through complex corporate returns, that involve different tax rules and issues. Officials said that group managers tended to focus their attention on newer staff and administrative duties. They said that as a result, revenue agents were left to conduct these corporate audits with minimal managerial involvement, and group managers lost the opportunity to develop their corporate audit experience.", "Both the Examination officials and the regional task force report concluded that these large corporate audits were more effective when group managers with corporate audit experience were actively involved. For example, 20 of the Examination Chiefs nationwide indicated that group manager involvement was crucial to the success of these audits.", "To increase managerial involvement and audit effectiveness, four districts we visited had recently created groups of existing revenue agents that specialized in large corporate audits. Managers with extensive corporate auditing experience led these groups to help their agents get assistance in selecting, planning, and doing audits. District officials believed that these groups, although fairly new, have improved the effectiveness of large corporate audits because, in part, of the focus and assistance of group managers.", "IRS\u2019 National Office has not yet issued any uniform guidance on how to measure the success of these groups. Accordingly, not all districts were consistently measuring the impacts; some were focusing on different audit results (e.g., recommended taxes per hour versus no-change rate). National Office Examination officials told us that they would like to learn more about the impacts of these specialized groups across the districts that had created them.", "In evaluating these groups, it is important to recognize that some districts may not have enough corporate workload or revenue agents to justify these specialized groups. That is, such districts may wish to maintain flexibility in using revenue agents on other than large corporate audits. At least one Examination Chief was concerned about the potential impacts on audit results in the short term. Even so, officials in these districts believed that these specialized groups will ultimately yield better large corporate audit results, cancelling out any initial decline in the results.

To determine which large corporations to select for CEP, IRS scores corporate tax returns on specific criteria, such as corporate structure, assets, and income. IRS does not have a consistent approach or criteria for classifying and selecting tax returns for large corporations not in CEP. The approach and criteria varied by district.", "In general, revenue agents and/or their group managers selected the returns to audit, depending on the IRS district. Many districts charged revenue agents with both classifying and selecting issues for audit, and some districts had other auditors do the initial selection and classification. Some districts relied on service center staff to classify large corporate returns, using criteria provided by that district, or subjectively without using any such criteria before sending the selected returns to the district.", "In sum, our analysis of questionnaire responses and our interviews with IRS officials showed that the IRS staff doing the selection and classification had to ultimately rely on their experience and judgment about audit potential. They had limited criteria and little information on (1) any previous audits of the large corporation or (2) overall large corporate audit results by issue and industry to guide their decisions. Some of these staff may be sufficiently experienced to find returns that would be productive to audit. However, the audit results in fiscal year 1994 showed that more returns were audited without any recommended tax changes or with lower amounts of recommended tax per audit hour than in fiscal year 1988.", "National Office Examination officials have expressed similar concerns about their selection and classification system for large corporate audits. They established a task force to develop a more structured system, but budget constraints have stalled the task force\u2019s efforts. In lieu of the task force, the National Office is testing the benefits of providing additional information on a corporation, such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports, to the revenue agent reviewing the corporate return. Examination is also testing potential improvements to the classification system; none of the tests are far enough along to have useable results. Selected IRS districts are testing classification of returns by market segment.", "Also, IRS is developing the Examination Operational Automated Database in an attempt to capture audit results by issue and industry. Examination officials believe that this database could be used to enhance any selection and classification system by providing feedback on tax issues (e.g., unreported gross receipts, overstated travel expenses) by industry (e.g., manufacturing, wholesale trade) that have proven to be productive to audit. That is, IRS could identify issues and industries in which audits generated more recommended taxes per audit hour. By tracking such audit results, Examination officials believed that this database will be particularly helpful in classifying audit issues. These officials said IRS already had most of the necessary hardware and software. They estimated that enhancements in fiscal year 1997 would cost about $320,000 and that administrative costs would average a staff year per district. This system is being tested in two IRS districts and is expected to be operational by the end of calendar year 1998.", "Further, IRS officials from some districts with groups specializing in audits of large corporations told us such groups have helped improve the return selection and classification processes at these districts. These groups can improve not only the selection process but ultimately the productivity of these corporate audits. For example, in one district, an Examination official told us that while the overall percentage of audits closed with no additional tax recommended was about 10 percent, the rate within the specialized group was only about 3 percent.

Not having the information hindered IRS\u2019 ability to do effective audits and support tax recommendations.", "Appeals and Counsel officials in all four districts we visited told us that revenue agents do not always have adequate information to support recommended taxes. Taxpayers provided information to Appeals that had not been provided to the revenue agents in an estimated 53 percent of the disputed audits. Appeals officers for some of the audits noted that revenue agents had provided insufficient information to justify their development of an audit position. For example, appeals officers for an estimated 27 percent of the disputed audits indicated that not all of the top three dollar issues had been fully developed by the revenue agents during the audit.", "Examination and Appeals officials told us that some corporate taxpayers did not always provide requested information in a timely manner, if at all. Corporations can have difficulty providing information when IRS\u2019 requests are vague, for old data, or made late in the audit. On the other hand, corporations have little incentive to provide all information, particularly if it will lead revenue agents to make adjustments or to audit other areas on the tax return. IRS officials we interviewed believed that problems in obtaining all the information needed to support tax recommendations were becoming more prevalent.", "Examination, Appeals, and Counsel officials said agents should ensure that they have adequate information to support tax recommendations. They also expressed the opinion that the recently formed specialized groups can increase managerial and counsel involvement in helping revenue agents obtain the information needed to support their recommended taxes. They noted that these group managers, when involved, were usually able to help agents obtain requested information from taxpayers.", "Counsel officials told us that their involvement, including the discussion and issuance of summons when needed, could help secure information. They noted that revenue agents need to make information requests early in the audit so that the summons process, if needed, can begin as soon as possible, enhancing its effectiveness. IRS generally uses a summons as a last resort, meaning IRS has tried all other administrative means of obtaining requested information. Although used infrequently, a summons can prompt large corporations to provide the requested information. If it does, the investment in time and money can prove to be worthwhile compared to spending time awaiting information that may not be received."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination Between Appeals and Examination Was Limited", "paragraphs": ["During the appeals process for large corporate audits, coordination between Appeals and Examination was limited. Appeals generally did not share with Examination new information from large corporations. Sharing this information would give revenue agents the opportunity to review it and provide their comments to Appeals before the settlement. After the final settlement, Examination did not always distribute Appeals\u2019 summary of that settlement to its revenue agents. Our work showed that such limited coordination resulted from insufficient requirements and incentives to coordinate. Although Appeals\u2019 independence in settling tax disputes is critical, limited coordination between the two functions can hinder IRS\u2019 efforts to reach a balanced settlement as well as to improve future audits.", "Appeals officers for an estimated 25 percent of the disputed audits indicated they had no interaction with revenue agents while resolving the disputed tax issues. Appeals and Examination officials have acknowledged such limited coordination overall. An Appeals task force draft report cited Examination\u2019s concerns about the current Appeals process not providing Examination with an opportunity to present its views on key issues prior to resolution. Knowing that large corporations usually have unlimited access to the appeals officer to discuss the dispute, Examination officials said limited involvement and coordination with Appeals creates the appearance that the government\u2019s interest is not fairly represented and that the Appeals process is not balanced.", "This appearance of bias can be aggravated when an appeals officer does not share with Examination staff new information provided by large corporations. Appeals officers for an estimated 53 percent of the disputed audits in our study population indicated that large corporations provided additional factual information for at least one of the top three dollar issues. However, the appeals officers asked Examination to review the new information in 139, or an estimated 43 percent, of those disputed audits in which corporations provided new information. Revenue agents reported a similar lack of coordination. They indicated that Appeals asked them about new information in only an estimated 17 percent of all disputed audits. Neither we nor IRS knows whether the appeals officers should have shared the new information in these cases. Our CEP work indicated that CEP corporations are more likely to win more disputes when they provide information to Appeals that Examination has not had the opportunity to review.", "In addition, Examination officials told us that Appeals seldom shared the proposed settlement with Examination so that revenue agents could have one last look at how the dispute was to be settled and whether any new information played a part. National Office Examination officials told us in February 1997 that they do not believe it is realistic for Appeals to share proposed settlements in every case. However, Examination wanted the opportunity to review and discuss new information submitted after the audit closed.", "Two reasons help explain this limited sharing with Examination staff. First, although IRS does require appeals officers to share significant new information with Examination, it left the definition of \u201csignificant\u201d to the discretion of each appeals officer, recognizing that sharing all new information would not be realistic. Given the uncertainty over this requirement, Appeals could not ensure that the significant information had been shared. Without a definition of significant and without adequate controls to ensure that all significant new information is shared, neither we nor IRS knew whether the appeals officers involved with our study population had met the requirement for sharing significant new information. Also, IRS did not require Appeals to share its proposed settlements with Examination.", "Second, the limited sharing partially resulted from the differing roles and incentives driving the work of Examination and Appeals. Appeals Chiefs we interviewed said they encourage appeals officers to involve the revenue agents in reviewing new information but advised their appeals officers to be conscious of the time and costs to do so. That is, if the appeals officers believe they can review the information in a shorter period of time than a revenue agent can, the appeals officers should most likely do it. Our interviews with Examination officials also indicated that many revenue agents have little incentive to spend time reviewing new information on a case that Examination has already closed. Further, both Appeals and Examination officials at the National Office said that sharing all new information would be unnecessary and too time-consuming. In February 1997, these Appeals officials told us they believed much of the new information submitted by taxpayers was not significant.", "Regardless, sharing significant new information, especially that relating to issues that may not be sustained, would help IRS to maintain its designed separation of duties\u2014revenue agents could audit the new information and appeals officers could focus on settling the entire dispute. To help meet this end, our 1994 CEP report recommended that IRS improve controls to ensure that Appeals provides CEP teams an opportunity to comment on proposed settlements. IRS disagreed at the time, but Appeals subsequently proposed a procedure to promote better communication with Examination and better settlement of key issues in CEP cases. Under that proposal, Examination could identify five key issues in a case nearing settlement and Appeals would not settle the key issues until it had considered feedback from Examination. This way, Examination would have the opportunity to review the proposed settlement and advise Appeals of any significant facts, laws, or other factors that may need further consideration. According to many Examination and Appeals officials we interviewed in the districts, allowing Examination to provide this input could add balance to the appeals process without adversely affecting Appeals\u2019 independence. The proposed procedure also could help ensure that Appeals provides Examination with significant new information that taxpayers submit and an opportunity to comment just prior to settling a case.", "Recognizing that taking these steps could involve some additional time, both Examination and Appeals officials told us during our field visits in early 1996 that the steps were worth taking. However, in November 1996, National Office Appeals officials told us that IRS had recently decided not to implement testing of this proposed procedure because of concerns by both Appeals officials and large corporations that such a procedure could impede Appeals\u2019 ability to independently settle tax disputes. However, these Appeals officials said that Appeals\u2019 independence would not necessarily have to suffer under this proposal.", "Regarding final settlements, Appeals has a procedure for sending a copy of the final written summary to Examination, but Examination has no process in place to ensure that this feedback reaches the appropriate revenue agent. Revenue agents indicated that they received the written summary in an estimated 61 percent of the disputed audits. Examination officials and revenue agents told us that this summary can provide insights on why a recommended tax adjustment was or was not sustained on appeal. For example, the summary typically discusses the reasons for settling the disputes, such as hazards of litigation. Without knowledge of significant facts or laws followed in the settlement, the revenue agents lose an opportunity to learn about the types of tax issues involved in the case and the support needed to sustain future tax disputes.", "In summary, Appeals attempts to provide large corporations with a review of their tax disputes that is independent of Examination or other IRS functions before these corporations decide whether to litigate. However, both Examination and Appeals officials told us that increased coordination and communication could help to improve their working relationship and to correct the appearance of imbalances during appeals without reducing the independence. To illustrate this point, a Regional Chief Compliance Officer told us about the need for more balance whenever large corporations withhold information during the audit but provide that information to Appeals. Examination Chiefs told us more interaction would afford an opportunity for their agents to better explain their recommended taxes as well as any difficulties they may have had in obtaining information to support their recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of questionnaire responses and interviews with IRS officials identified at least four factors that contributed to the low assessment rate or decline in audit results for 1988 to 1994. First, complex tax laws impeded revenue agents\u2019 efforts to determine the correct tax liability and appeals officers\u2019 efforts to fairly settle tax disputes. Second, differing performance measures prompted revenue agents to recommend as much tax as soon as possible and appeals officers to settle tax disputes without litigation as soon as possible. We recommended in our 1994 report that IRS more strongly propose legislative changes to reduce tax law complexity and consider cross-functional measures, such as the collection and/or assessment rate. IRS is taking action on both of these recommendations. We make no new recommendations on these issues because our 1994 recommendations can also apply to audits of other large corporations.", "Third, various aspects of the audit process impeded revenue agents\u2019 ability to develop recommended taxes that can survive appeals. IRS recognized these aspects but faced constraints in surmounting them. Budget pressures limited the use of team auditing to buttress agents\u2019 lack of expertise in auditing large corporations. The broad and complex nature of tax administration complicated efforts to carve out more time for group managers and district counsels to formally assist revenue agents\u2014who often work alone without much assistance. Revenue agents viewed such assistance, whether formal or informal, as helpful in identifying and discussing audit issues, requesting corporate information, and pursuing requests that have not been answered. Further, IRS initiated efforts, such as a task force to study ways to improve return selection and classification, but these efforts stalled due to budget constraints.", "Some IRS districts have taken a step that could address many of these problems. They have combined senior revenue agents and managers into groups that specialize in large corporate audits. Examination officials in districts that created these groups believed that their initial experiences indicated that the groups helped improve return selection and classification, information gathering, and audit productivity. They also believed that the groups allowed managers and agents to share knowledge and assistance in a focused, timely way. However, the districts generally had limited data on the actual impacts of these groups, and IRS\u2019 National Office has not provided criteria or oversight to guide the measurement of the impacts. National Office Examination officials said they would like to learn about the impacts of these groups across the districts.", "Fourth, the Appeals and Examination functions did not always share information. Unlike CEP teams that have an ongoing audit presence, revenue agents who audit these large corporations move on to other audits. We recognize that sharing all information would not be realistic; however, Appeals could inform Examination officials of any new information that would cause the appealed issues to not be fully sustained. Doing so would help IRS to maintain the intended separation of duties. Examination could have an opportunity to audit the new information and Appeals officers could then focus on their responsibility for settling the entire dispute. After a dispute was settled, Examination did not have a system for regularly sharing Appeals\u2019 summaries of the final settlements with revenue agents. Knowing about the final settlement could help agents to learn about and support tax issues that could sustain appeals. For any form of enhanced sharing, maintaining Appeals\u2019 independence would be paramount.", "In recommending improvements, we tried to recognize the costs and constraints to IRS. Most of our recommendations will entail limited costs. For example, providing more specific, objective guidance and criteria on return selection need not be an expensive proposition, particularly if the new database on audit results helps to identify the types of large corporations and tax issues that have proven productive to audit. The use of more informal legal assistance would create some costs, but that assistance could be provided more quickly and at less cost than formal assistance. Further, providing more structure and guidance to districts on evaluating the impacts of the specialized audit groups should not cost much and could provide big dividends if IRS had more certainty about the impacts of these groups on the productivity of large corporate audits. Appeals\u2019 sharing of significant new information with Examination could add some time to resolving the disputes, but that investment should be worthwhile if the revenue agents learn how to do better audits or help to determine the correct tax liability. Even if some costs increase, the accompanying improvements should help IRS to better invest its limited enforcement funds in trying to ensure that large corporations are paying the correct amount of taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the audits of tax returns filed by large corporations, we recommend that the IRS Commissioner provide more specific objective criteria and procedures to guide the selection of large corporate tax returns and classification of tax issues with high audit potential across the districts; develop criteria and procedures to guide the evaluation across the districts of the impacts of groups specializing in audits of large corporations; encourage District Examination management to work with District Counsel officials on finding cost-effective ways to provide revenue agents with the necessary legal assistance; require Appeals to notify Examination of new information received from a large corporation that could cause the appealed issues to not be fully sustained, and require Examination to (1) indicate whether it wishes to review the new information and, if so; (2) review the information and notify Appeals of the results of the review as soon as possible; and require Examination management to provide feedback to its revenue agents on the final settlements that Appeals reaches with large corporations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report in a meeting on February 20, 1997, with IRS officials who represented you.

IRS plans to begin testing this system in selected districts within each IRS region by the summer of 1997 and to implement it by the end of 1998.", "Second, IRS officials said they plan to develop criteria and procedures to guide the evaluation of the district groups that specialize in audits of large corporations. IRS hopes to finish these actions during 1998.", "Third, IRS officials said they plan to issue an IRS-wide memo by May 1997 to encourage district Examination management to work with District Counsel officials on finding cost-effective ways to provide revenue agents with the necessary legal assistance, including the use of field service advice and technical advice memoranda.", "Fourth, IRS Examination management said it plans to change the Internal Revenue Manual to require that revenue agents be provided with feedback on Appeals\u2019 final settlements with large corporations. Because the next series of changes to the Manual will not be done until the end of fiscal year 1997, Examination officials plan to issue a memorandum on this requirement during May 1997.", "IRS officials did not agree to implement the fifth recommendation that would require Appeals to share its proposed settlements with Examination so that Examination could see whether the large corporation provided new information that affected the settlement. Examination officials said they want to see significant new information, but requiring Appeals to share all proposed settlements may be too formalized and too strong a process for obtaining the new information.", "Appeals officials expressed concern that sharing proposed settlements could create perceptions that Appeals\u2019 settlement authority would be subject to an Examination veto. This perception could prompt large corporations to close off Examination\u2019s reinvolvement by taking the dispute to court. They also believed that this sharing would add time to the settlement process that usually would be significant and would not change the final settlement. Finally, they believed that reinvolving Examination could produce an adversarial relationship to the extent that appeals officers felt pressured to justify their settlement proposals.", "We also asked TEI to provide comments on the same draft report. We met with TEI officials on February 21, 1997, to obtain their comments. They also supported or had no opposition to the same four recommendations that IRS agreed to implement. Although we made no recommendations on these topics, they supported creating an IRS-wide performance measure and more training for revenue agents as well as applying CEP processes to non-CEP audits. Like IRS, they expressed similar concerns with the recommendation on sharing proposed settlements with Examination so that it could see how new information affected the settlements. They also expressed the concern that sharing the proposed settlement may prompt Examination to go beyond the new information and try to re-audit other issues.", "In recommending that Appeals share proposed settlements to allow Examination to see whether new information significantly affected the settlement, we did not intend to undercut Appeals\u2019 settlement authority or grant Examination veto power over settlements; in fact, our draft report pointed to the importance of retaining Appeals\u2019 independence in settling disputes. Thus, we did not envision that the act of sharing would require a highly formalized process or much time in the majority of cases.", "Rather, our intent was, and still is, to provide an inducement for appeals officers as well as large corporations to share significant information with Examination. We believed that some control or check was needed to better ensure that Examination had the opportunity to play its appropriate role in reviewing information to determine the correct tax liability and protect the government\u2019s revenue. We intended that the requirement to share would provide a control over the appeals officers\u2019 use of discretion in judging the need to share new information. We also intended that this requirement would send a signal that large corporations cannot intentionally bypass the audit process by providing new information to appeals officers during negotiations over tax liability.", "Our focus on the need for a control stems from responses to our questionnaires and to our interviews with district office officials during 1996. Although Examination officials recognized that communication with Appeals has been improving, Examination officials and staff still pointed to instances in which they did not have a chance to review significant new information that a large corporation had provided to Appeals. In some cases, they noted that they had asked for similar information during the audit.", "Even so, we understand the concerns expressed by Appeals and TEI officials about sharing the significant new information through the proposed settlements. We discussed several other ways to address the concerns and still have IRS provide a control over Appeals\u2019 sharing of new information with Examination. These discussions prompted us to change our recommendation on how to better ensure that Examination has an opportunity to review the new information. Under our changed recommendation, Appeals would notify Examination as soon as possible after a large corporation provided new information that could cause the disputed issues to not be fully sustained. Upon notification, Examination could choose to do nothing, ask for details, or ask to review the information. Examination and Appeals would need to develop procedures on how much time Examination has to request and review the information, how the information would be shared, how extensive the review would be, and how the results of the review would be communicated to Appeals.", "We believe that this option would provide Examination the opportunity to fulfill its intended roles\u2014determine the correct tax liability and protect the government\u2019s revenue\u2014while mitigating the concerns raised by Appeals and TEI. As we envision it, this recommendation would not delay or disrupt many final settlements because the information would be shared soon after being received. One exception, of course, would be if the information was significant enough and the review was revealing enough to change the settlement that the appeals officer would have made without Examination\u2019s involvement. Even with this exception, settlement authority would still rest with the appeals officers.", "This report contains recommendations to you.
