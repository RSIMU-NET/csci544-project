For example, coding requirements could  vary from payer to payer, making the filing of claims with multiple payers  administratively burdensome for providers. In addition, this wide  variability in coding made it difficult to electronically transmit  standardized health-related information and compromised the reliability of  health-related data. In enacting the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Congress sought to simplify data  reporting and claims processing requirements across all providers and  payers and facilitate the electronic transmission of health-related  information. In so doing, HIPAA required the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt standard code sets for  describing health-related services in connection with financial and  administrative transactions, such as filing claims for payment. In addition,  HIPAA required these standard code sets to be used by members of the  health care industry. In August 2000, HHS adopted the following two code  sets for reporting medical procedures.  1.  For reporting inpatient hospital procedures, HHS selected the  International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical  Modification, Volume 3 (ICD-9-CM Vol. 3). This code set is maintained  publicly by HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  2.  For reporting physician services and other medical services including  outpatient hospital procedures, HHS selected the Current Procedural  Terminology (CPT), which is maintained and copyrighted by the  American Medical Association (AMA).", "In addition to the code sets HHS adopted for reporting medical  procedures, HHS adopted code sets to standardize the reporting of  diagnoses and other health-related services, such as medical devices,  supplies and equipment, prescription drugs, and dental services.

HHS recognized that  these procedural code sets would need to be revised in the future,  particularly ICD-9-CM Vol. 3, and specifically cited the International  Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedural Coding System  (referred to here as 10-PCS) as a potential replacement for ICD-9-CM   Vol. 3, once it was ready for implementation. Nevertheless, many  representatives of the health care industry argue that the lack of  comparability between existing code sets contributes to the inefficiencies  providers and payers experience in using two procedural code sets and  impedes the analysis of health-related data. These representatives of the  health care industry have suggested the adoption of a single code set for  reporting inpatient hospital procedures, physician services, and other  medical services such as hospital outpatient procedures. For example,  since 1993 the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics  (NCVHS)\u2014a public advisory body to HHS in the areas of health data and  administrative simplification\u2014has recommended the adoption of a single  code set for reporting these procedures.5, 6  Given these concerns, you asked that we study issues surrounding  procedural code sets. Specifically, we have examined the benefits and  challenges associated with: (1) the ICD-9-CM Vol. 3 and CPT as standard  code sets under HIPAA, (2) 10-PCS, the new procedural code set which  was designed to replace ICD-9-CM Vol. 3, and (3) potentially replacing dual  procedural code sets with a single set for reporting inpatient hospital  procedures, physician services, and other medical services such as  hospital outpatient procedures.", "The NCVHS serves as the statutory public advisory body to HHS in the area of health data  and statistics.

Very distinct but related  procedures may all be classified under one code, and variations in  procedures performed or technologies used may not be identified. For  example, in this code set, a single code exists for all multiple vessel  percutaneous angioplasties (code 3605), without specification as to the  number of blood vessels involved, or what type of equipment\u2014balloon-tip  catheter, laser, or stent\u2014was used.

Generally, these procedures would be assigned codes  within the pacemaker code sequence in the cardiovascular section (code  sequence 3770-3789). However, the code sequence for pacemaker codes is  full and there is only one code available for use in the defibrillator code  section. Therefore, to add new codes for these six new procedures, CMS  assigned these new technologies to the code sequence beginning with \u201c00,\u201d  which is outside of their appropriate section.

These differences in terminology may result in coding errors,  particularly when the code set is first implemented, as coding  professionals transcribe the terminology used on medical records into   10-PCS codes, which in turn could affect the appropriateness of payment  and the accuracy of information used to analyze data on utilization,  outcomes, and cost.", "Finally, there are some cases where 10-PCS\u2019s specificity creates a  significantly greater number of codes, and it is unknown what effects, if  any, this increased volume of codes will have on coding accuracy or the  availability of useful data.

Because of the  specificity of 10-PCS, 180 different procedures currently reflected under  this one ICD-9-CM Vol. 3 code would be coded separately under 10-PCS.  With more codes available for use, there are more opportunities for coding  errors with inaccurate codes used in describing the procedure provided,  particularly if the descriptions of procedures on medical records do not  capture all the dimensions of the procedure needed to complete a code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of 10-PCS Will Involve Financial Costs and Administrative Burdens", "paragraphs": ["10-PCS may not meet two of the criteria for standard code sets  recommended by HHS\u2019s HIPAA implementation teams: it may not have  low implementation costs and its implementation as a standard code set  may not keep data collection and paperwork burdens on members of the  health care industry as low as possible. 10-PCS is a distinct departure from  the design and logic of ICD-9-CM Vol. 3; thus the existing health care  administrative system\u2014including computer software, coding manuals,  claims and remittance forms, and training for coding professionals and  other health care professionals\u2014would need to be adapted if 10-PCS were  to be implemented.

For example, for  payment purposes, hospitals need to use both procedural code sets\u2014an  inpatient hospital procedure receives an ICD-9-CM Vol. 3 code for payment  purposes whereas the same procedure performed in a hospital outpatient  department receives a CPT code. In order for hospitals to analyze the  provision of services across inpatient and outpatient departments, they  must voluntarily code these procedures using both ICD-9-CM Vol. 3 and  CPT so that these data can be aggregated. For the same reason, this dual  code set arrangement complicates the research activities of health care  analysts seeking data on a particular procedure performed across  providers and sites of service. Such analyses are becoming more important  as advancements in medical technology increase the ability of providers to  perform procedures in various sites of service.
