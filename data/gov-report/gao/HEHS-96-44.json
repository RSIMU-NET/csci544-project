In reality, Medicaid is not 1, but rather 56 separate programs that differ dramatically across states. While federal statute mandates who is eligible for coverage and the broad categories of services that must be provided, each participating state designs and administers its own program by (1) setting certain income and asset eligibility requirements, (2) selecting which optional groups and services to cover, and (3) determining the scope of mandatory and optional services. As a result of this flexibility, Medicaid is not available to everyone who is poor. In 1993, Medicaid provided health care coverage to less than half of those with incomes below the poverty level. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) monitors each state program for compliance with federal regulations. (App. II contains more background information on the Medicaid program.)", "The $130 billion Medicaid program is at a crossroads. Between 1985 and 1993, Medicaid costs tripled and the number of beneficiaries increased by over 50 percent. Current projections suggest that program costs will double over the next 5 to 7 years. To constrain rising health care costs, states are increasingly turning to mandatory enrollment of some or all Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care delivery plans\u2014arrangements that limit a beneficiary\u2019s choice of physicians and hospitals. In many cases, these managed care plans are prepaid a fixed amount per enrollee. This financing arrangement has demonstrated the ability to lower service utilization, which in turn can hold down costs.", "In order to implement mandatory managed care programs, states must obtain a waiver of certain Medicaid requirements. The waiver authority that gives states the greatest flexibility is section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 allows the executive branch to waive most federal Medicaid requirements for demonstration projects likely to assist in promoting program objectives. Since 1992, 22 states have asked to use this demonstration authority to restructure their Medicaid programs. The common thread present in what have been termed \u201ccomprehensive\u201d 1115 demonstration waivers is (1) the switch from a fee-for-service to a managed care approach to delivering health benefits and (2) the use of anticipated savings plus other funding streams to expand coverage to groups previously ineligible for Medicaid."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicaid Programs Restructured Under Redefined Budget Neutrality Policy", "paragraphs": ["Eleven states with 1115 waivers approved since 1993 have undertaken an ambitious experiment to demonstrate that the Medicaid program can actually save money while simultaneously expanding coverage.

Compared to expenditure trends for the predemonstration program, states suggest that the net result of waivers will be lower costs\u2014even though managed care savings are being reinvested. Eleven more waivers are pending, and all but a few applicants are pursuing a similar managed care cost-containment/coverage expansion strategy.

After a year of review, the Bush administration rejected the application on the grounds that the state\u2019s proposed benefits package might violate the Americans With Disabilities Act. A report prepared for the National Governors\u2019 Association criticized the handling of Oregon\u2019s application, noting that the review process did not give due weight to the state role in Medicaid, had a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on innovative proposals, and imposed budget neutrality requirements that were too narrow. The Clinton administration subsequently announced plans to streamline and expedite the review process for 1115 waivers.", "Oregon revised and resubmitted its waiver application in late 1992 and the following March became the first state in over 10 years to obtain approval for a comprehensive 1115 demonstration. Since then, 10 additional waivers have been approved. Another 11 states have applications pending, and others have expressed interest in submitting requests for 1115 waivers. States with approved and pending waivers account for about 49 percent of the nation\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries and 52 percent of total Medicaid expenditures. As of July 1995, however, only five states\u2014Oregon, Hawaii, Tennessee, Rhode Island, and Minnesota\u2014had begun implementation.

HMO-style health plans are prepaid a fixed amount based on the number of enrollees rather than reimbursed after each service is rendered. Such prepayment on a per capita basis is often referred to as \u201ccapitation.\u201d A convergence of trends\u2014spiraling Medicaid expenditures coupled with a stronger interest on the part of mainstream HMOs in serving the Medicaid population\u2014has given impetus to as well as facilitated the adoption of a managed care cost-containment strategy by states. And rather than turning to physician gatekeeper arrangements that dominated past managed care experiments, many states are using the flexibility gained under 1115 Medicaid waivers to adopt capitated alternatives.", "Reacting to quality-of-care, marketing, and other problems that surfaced in a number of Medicaid managed care programs, the Congress enacted provisions in 1976 with the general goal of encouraging HMOs to provide public clients a quality of care comparable to that available to private clients. At the time, HMOs were the prevalent form of managed care. One provision discouraged the creation of HMOs serving only Medicaid beneficiaries by requiring that at least a certain percentage of the patients be privately insured. The participation of private-paying patients, who presumably have a choice of health plans, was instituted as a proxy for quality. A second provision added in 1981 allows recipients to terminate enrollment in an HMO at any time. From the beneficiary\u2019s perspective, these provisions offer protection against enrollment in an HMO seeking excessive profit at the expense of quality. From the HMO\u2019s perspective, however, unrestricted freedom to disenroll makes it difficult to plan financially and therefore renders the enrollment of Medicaid recipients less attractive. This provision added to the hesitancy of many mainstream HMOs to participate in Medicaid, further restricting states\u2019 ability to experiment with fully capitated health plans.", "In 1993, about 4.8 million beneficiaries, or about 12 percent of the Medicaid population, were enrolled in some type of managed care.Though a number of voluntary and mandatory managed care options are available to states, the enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries has lagged behind national trends. Without an 1115 waiver, states essentially have three managed care options: voluntary enrollment in an HMO, in which case the beneficiary must also have a choice of obtaining services on a fee-for-service basis and be allowed to disenroll at will; mandatory enrollment in an HMO, provided the beneficiary can choose from among a number of competing HMOs, with disenrollment allowed on a monthly basis (or every 6 months if an HMO meets certain federal requirements); and voluntary or mandatory enrollment in a physician gatekeeper system in which either the physician\u2019s charges are partially capitated or the physician is reimbursed under fee-for-service.", "The last two options require waivers of Medicaid provisions that have been widely provided under section 1915(b) of the Social Security Act. As of July 1994, 37 states operated 1915(b) waiver programs. These programs were primarily substate (that is, in a limited geographic area), voluntary, and involved physician gatekeepers rather than HMOs. Until 1993, only two states\u2014Arizona and Minnesota\u2014operated mandatory HMO managed care programs under the authority of an 1115 waiver.

Waivers use income standards to define and, in effect, limit who is eligible, but states further restrict the number of individuals that can actually obtain coverage through explicit enrollment caps, other barriers, and even premiums. Because of greater than anticipated enrollment, several states are taking additional steps to limit the number applying for coverage.", "Most states are adding groups who were previously ineligible for Medicaid\u2014single adults and childless couples. However, it is important to recognize that some categories of newly eligible individuals in one state may already be enrolled in Medicaid in another because of differences in the qualifying income levels established by states for families and optional coverage expansions allowed by statute. Moreover, states may have previously provided health coverage to some new eligibles outside of Medicaid\u2014that is, through state-funded programs. For example, Kentucky\u2019s planned expansion under its now suspended 1993 waiver includes both previously ineligible individuals and individuals who could have been included in Medicaid at state option. In Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Minnesota the expansions either are limited to or include individuals who could have been Medicaid- eligible at state option. Both Hawaii and Minnesota offered state-funded coverage to many included in their waivers.", "Table 1.2 summarizes the coverage expansion goals of seven states with approved 1115 waivers. Generally, expansion goals are stated in terms of the number of newly eligible individuals expected to be covered under the waiver at the end of the 5-year period of each demonstration. Enrollment in year 1 may be less than the 5-year enrollment goal, since states typically anticipate reaching \u201cfull enrollment\u201d gradually. State goals should be viewed as targets subject to a number of constraints, especially financing. Some waivers indicate that the state will limit enrollment if funding proves to be inadequate. At least one state, Tennessee, has already done so.", "At one end of the expansion continuum, Tennessee\u2019s waiver program has no eligibility income limit and requires only those enrollees above 400 percent of the poverty level to pay the full premium. Tennessee set an original enrollment cap of 500,000 on new eligibles and excluded individuals who were insured before a certain cutoff date to forestall a migration from private insurance. The state lowered its cap in December 1994, in effect limiting the expansion to the approximately 400,000 previously uninsured individuals already enrolled. In contrast, Oregon\u2019s expansion goals are less ambitious because, in part, the employer mandate was expected to cover low-income workers. The waiver expands eligibility up to 100 percent of the poverty level, requires no premiums from participants, and has no explicit enrollment cap. In order to address budgetary constraints, the legislature enacted several changes that the state began implementing on October 1, 1995. However, HCFA has yet to approve Oregon\u2019s request to require premiums of some newly eligible participants.", "Some 1115 waivers, such as Hawaii\u2019s, target individuals who were already covered by state-funded expansion programs outside of Medicaid.Consequently, Hawaii did not anticipate much additional enrollment as a result of its waiver. Unlike Hawaii, Minnesota\u2019s waiver application did not include single adults and childless couples covered under state-funded MinnesotaCare. State officials told us that requesting a federal match for this group would have created a budget neutrality problem because of the cost. Instead, the approved waiver shifts children covered under MinnesotaCare into Medicaid\u2014a group that could have been included in the program at state option. Finally, Rhode Island\u2019s expansion group is limited to pregnant women and children who could also have been covered at state option without an 1115 waiver."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treatment of Low-Income Populations Under Waivers Is Controversial", "paragraphs": ["Embedded in many comprehensive 1115 demonstrations is a controversial philosophical shift in the way publicly supported health care is provided to the poor\u2014a shift (1) inherent in the adoption of managed care delivery systems and (2) visible in the treatment of those newly eligible under the demonstration. The cumulative effect of these changes is to place more responsibility on the individual beneficiary. Advocacy groups for the poorand waiver states disagree on the extent to which low-income beneficiaries can shoulder these responsibilities.", "Advocacy groups typically see Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as many of the working poor to whom coverage is being extended, as a vulnerable, high-risk, and sicker segment of the population. They are concerned about the ability of the poor to access services in a managed care system. As noted earlier, some critics of managed care argue that it creates a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d to deliver fewer or less costly services than may be needed. Advocacy groups also worry that managed care will (1) further reduce the historically low Medicaid reimbursement levels, (2) diminish quality of care, and (3) curtail access to providers that have traditionally served the poor. Finally, they see a disincentive for the poor to participate in waiver programs when premiums, though subsidized, are high relative to income. States, on the other hand, point out that the waivers require them to implement significant quality assurance programs such as collecting and analyzing encounter data and conducting annual satisfaction surveys. They contend that access and quality were never optimal under a fee-for-service delivery system in which choice was guaranteed but not necessarily available and high emergency room use was an underlying symptom of access problems. Finally, states generally see employment as a proxy for health and evidence for distinguishing between the newly eligible working poor and the more vulnerable beneficiaries typically enrolled in Medicaid.", "The \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of new eligibles\u2014that is, the attempt to treat them as if they were purchasers of private insurance\u2014is perhaps the hallmark of most state 1115 demonstrations. For the newly insured, states have attempted to break Medicaid\u2019s psychological link with welfare by establishing eligibility criteria and enrollment mechanisms distinct from those that apply to traditional beneficiaries, many of whom qualify for Medicaid by virtue of receiving cash assistance. For example, most waivers eliminate the asset test, often criticized as intrusive and expensive to administer, and rely instead on a gross income test. Moreover, rather than the frequent redeterminations of eligibility associated with Medicaid, many newly eligible individuals are enrolled for periods ranging from 6 to 12 months. In some states, enrollment of new eligibles is not handled by the agency that administers Medicaid. In fact, Florida plans to hand this task over to insurance agents\u2014further underscoring the similarity to a private insurance product. In general, application forms are simpler and in some states can even be mailed. Newly eligible individuals usually receive the full acute care benefit package available to traditional Medicaid recipients. Only in the case of Florida is the benefit package more restrictive. Finally, many states require individuals with incomes above the poverty level to contribute toward the cost of health care coverage by charging premiums, co-payments, and deductibles.", "For the traditional Medicaid population, the major change associated with 1115 waivers is the wholesale movement from fee-for-service to some type of managed care\u2014even in rural areas and, often, even for those who are aged, blind, or disabled. For some, such as low-income families in Oregon and Minnesota who were already enrolled in mandatory managed care programs, the change may be imperceptible. Under most 1115 waivers, eligibility requirements are unchanged and benefits remain the same or are more generous. For example, Tennessee lifted service restrictions on its Medicaid benefit package. Only Oregon altered benefits to help finance coverage expansion. The redefined package, commonly known as the \u201cprioritized list,\u201d eliminates some costly health services while adding a broad array of preventive care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Waiver Designs Often Reflect State Context and Health Reform Goals", "paragraphs": ["A notable feature of the growing number of 1115 waivers is their divergent techniques for using Medicaid as a springboard to achieve some degree of reform in state health care systems.

Though many waivers were conceived when national reform appeared imminent, the recent retrenchment from broader reform goals suggests that Medicaid waivers have become a more important component of state health care reform. Appendix IV compares several states across a range of indices that are relevant to understanding the diversity evident in waiver designs.", "The 1115 waiver is health care reform in Tennessee. The state\u2019s emphasis on managed care promises to increase penetration by that delivery system in a region long resistant to such a change while at the same time significantly reducing the number of uninsured. The success of this policy hinges on the adoption of a stringent cost-containment strategy with regard to health care financed through the waiver.", "In contrast to Tennessee\u2019s nascent reform program, Florida\u2019s as yet unimplemented waiver represents a logical progression from earlier small market reforms intended to provide access to affordable insurance for the working poor. The state hopes to use its waiver to achieve a dramatic enrollment expansion in the state\u2019s voluntary, small business-oriented purchasing cooperatives and a significant reduction in its estimated 24-percent uninsured rate. Florida stands alone in the extent to which it distinguishes between traditional and newly eligible Medicaid recipients. While the former are required to choose between different forms of managed care, newly eligible recipients may select any health plan offered by state-supported purchasing cooperatives with the sole proviso that the enrollee is responsible for any difference between the subsidy and the plan premium. Florida\u2019s 1992 health reform legislation established a goal of universal coverage, and the legislature promised to revisit the choice of a voluntary over a mandatory approach unless there was a significant reduction in the number of uninsured.", "In Minnesota, Oregon, and Hawaii, the waiver is only one element of a much more ambitious reform agenda\u2014an agenda that some state officials believe has been brought into question since the 1994 health care debate. All three states have universal coverage as a goal. Hawaii already has a limited exemption from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that allows it to require employers to offer health insurance to their workers. Oregon\u2019s Medicaid waiver is also built around an ERISA exemption to permit enactment of an employer mandate. Obtaining that exemption is now considered unlikely. In contrast, Minnesota had been attempting to finance universal coverage with an individual mandate, though state officials told us that this approach is no longer considered a possibility. Both Hawaii and Minnesota have relatively small uninsured populations and, prior to the 1115 Medicaid waiver, had already taken steps to address this problem through the establishment of state-funded coverage expansions. All three states have significant managed care penetration. Moreover, Oregon and Minnesota have a decade of experience with Medicaid managed care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing of Waivers Is Most Contentious Issue", "paragraphs": ["An important element of the administration\u2019s commitment to streamline and expedite the review of 1115 waivers was the promise to maintain the principle of waiver budget neutrality \u201cmore flexibly than has been the case in the past.\u201d Despite this commitment, a number of factors have contributed to a lengthening of the process, including extensive negotiations over financing. In fact, both administration and state officials told us that budget neutrality is often the most contentious issue.", "Though a policy of budget neutrality has been in effect since the early 1980s, previous 1115 Medicaid demonstrations were usually small-scale experiments targeted at specific populations (for example, pregnant drug-users on Medicaid) or implemented in a limited geographic area. As a result, the potential impact on state and federal expenditures was more circumscribed and the task of devising a cap to ensure cost neutrality was less challenging. Oregon\u2019s 1991 waiver application was the first of a new breed of \u201ccomprehensive\u201d 1115 demonstrations\u2014complex proposals that were sometimes controversial and often tied to broader health reform agendas. HCFA officials told us that the number, scope, and complexity of such comprehensive demonstrations in effect elevated the importance of budget neutrality while making it more difficult to evaluate and enforce.", "In a memo preceding promulgation of a more flexible approach to budget neutrality, HHS officials recognized the incentive for states to shift costs to the federal government and the need to constrain such behavior. Nonetheless, they outlined several arguments for a less strict approach. For example, they pointed out that the federal government might want to (1) share in the risks and costs of testing innovations that were ultimately in its own interest; (2) set the stage for health reform by supporting changes that should not wait even if they are somewhat more costly; and, finally, (3) provide some fiscal relief to states overburdened by the rising number of uninsured, increasing charity care requirements, and federally mandated expansions. Most importantly, the memo recognized that whatever policy was adopted needed to be clear and consistently applied.", "There are two key aspects to the administration\u2019s revised budget neutrality policy. First, states are allowed to demonstrate budget neutrality over the life of the waiver rather than on a yearly basis, allowing more time to recoup any associated start-up costs. Second, recognizing the difficulty in estimating the costs of continuing the prewaiver program over the period of the demonstration and the inherent element of judgment in undertaking such an estimate, the administration announced that it was open to state suggestions on the development of a new baseline methodology. According to HHS and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials who share responsibility for implementing this revised policy, there are three critical steps in determining baseline costs: (1) selecting a base year, (2) developing a trend factor for growth from the base year to the first year of implementation, and (3) developing a trend factor for baseline costs over the period of the waiver. The method used to develop baseline costs is important because it is the benchmark against which the administration assesses waiver costs. The higher the baseline, the easier it is for a state to demonstrate cost neutrality."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Monitoring and Enforcing Budget Neutrality", "paragraphs": ["The final waiver agreement consists of a set of terms and conditions that, among other things, spells out how budget neutrality will be monitored and enforced. Although there are important state-specific variations, the administration has taken two basic approaches to enforcement. Tennessee and Florida have an aggregate cap on the amount of federal matching funds available for their demonstrations, while all other states have a per capita limit. The federal government will not match state expenditures above the specified caps. Table 1.3 highlights the important differences in what the expenditure caps cover and how they work in the four states whose budget neutrality agreements we assessed.", "Aggregate caps are the most straightforward and uniform of the two approaches. In Tennessee and Florida, the federal government agreed to an explicit expenditure limit on demonstration costs. With the exception of certain recipient growth in Florida, the federal government will not match any costs above this cap. For states that use the per capita approach, the federal government agreed to a cost-per-recipient limit. For Hawaii, this cost limit is based on per capita fee-for-service costs from 1993 trended forward to the first year of the demonstration. If, as the state anticipates, the switch to managed care produces savings over fee-for-service rates, they can be applied to the costs of those newly eligible. In Oregon, the agreement specifies per capita cost limits for both traditional and newly eligible enrollees. However, the number of new eligibles is limited to an agreed-upon percentage of traditional Medicaid enrollment. With the exception of Tennessee, no state is held at risk for growth in the Medicaid population caused by an economic downturn.

In fact, compared to the cost of continuing the existing Medicaid program, many states project that the demonstrations could actually save money.

The conventional wisdom that 1115 expansions are financed largely by managed care savings is misleading. In at least two states with approved waivers, funds redirected from DSH and other programs play a more significant role.

As shown in table 2.3, both states had relatively large DSH programs at the time their waivers were approved. The theory behind eliminating or greatly reducing DSH payments to hospitals is that fewer uninsured will translate into less uncompensated care. Compared to other financing sources, DSH appears to be the most tangible and assured source of financing.", "Tennessee\u2019s waiver also proposes to redirect funds from two additional sources\u2014public health programs and DSH-like payments, referred to as local government charity care.

Since hospitals would continue to face significant levels of uncompensated care, the state was reluctant to redirect all of its DSH funds. Consequently, Florida\u2019s finance plan only shifts growth in its DSH resources toward coverage expansion. Because of the relative modesty of its DSH payments, Florida was forced to search for an alternative funding source. The state decided to eliminate Medically Needy Program coverage and to reallocate those funds to help subsidize the purchase of private health insurance. A state is not required to offer a Medically Needy Program under Medicaid. Because the Medically Needy Program pays for health services only after individuals have already incurred large liabilities, Florida considers the program to be similar to DSH.

In addition to managed care efficiencies, the state also anticipates lower Medicaid costs under the waiver as a result of adopting its redefined benefit package, known as the prioritized list, and an employer mandate.

State estimates suggest that about 85 percent of the financing for expanded coverage is attributable to the combination of switching to managed care delivery arrangements and using the prioritized list.

These differing strategies reflect each state\u2019s decision on how best to balance the need for savings against (1) the extent and maturity of the state\u2019s managed care infrastructure and (2) concerns about enrollee access, quality, and choice.", "Demonstrations typically rely on a mix of different types of managed care delivery, though one is often predominant: HMO-style systems in Oregon, PPOs in Tennessee, and physician gatekeeper arrangements in Florida. Table 2.4 shows the actual enrollment of beneficiaries in Tennessee and Oregon, and Florida\u2019s projection of enrollment if the state implements its approved waiver. The high penetration of HMOs in Oregon, with enrollment of almost one-third of the state\u2019s population, facilitated the state\u2019s decision to rely on this type of managed care delivery system. In Tennessee and Florida, enrollment in HMOs is significantly lower\u20146 percent and 18 percent of each state\u2019s residents, respectively. HMOs and PPOs participating in the 1115 demonstration in all three states are reimbursed on a per capita basis, referred to as a capitation payment. Physician gatekeepers, on the other hand, are often paid on a fee-for-service basis, though some are partially capitated. What differentiates managed care from fee-for-service is not only the method of reimbursement but the attempt to control the utilization of services. Although gatekeepers in Florida would be paid for each service delivered, enrollees must get prior authorization to see a specialist. PPOs in Tennessee, on the other hand, have 3 years to employ physician gatekeepers to help control the length of inpatient hospital stays and the utilization of other services.", "Tennessee\u2019s approach to managed care reflects the strategy used by large employers. The state asked for and received a substantial capitation discount from participating HMOs and PPOs. Tennessee acknowledges that its shift from fee-for-service to capitation is unlikely to result in significant utilization savings at the outset, since most traditional and newly eligible recipients are enrolled in PPOs that lack gatekeepers rather than in more structured HMO-style managed care arrangements. Despite the belief that utilization savings will be lower during this initial phase-in period, substantial capitation discount savings still accrue to the state. Tennessee officials noted that PPOs in turn often obtain significant pricing discounts from their providers. Our recent report on the Tennessee demonstration notes that a primary concern about the future of the demonstration is the poor financial performance of participating managed care plans and the willingness of physicians to contract with those plans. The demonstration\u2019s viability, we concluded, may hinge on the continued willingness of the health care community to participate in the program in spite of the low reimbursement levels. Although analysis of access to and quality of health care under the waiver has been limited because of problems in collecting data on enrollee visits to providers, beneficiary surveys and advocacy groups both indicate that access is a problem.", "In contrast to Tennessee\u2019s steep, up-front, capitation discounts, Oregon took a longer range approach that emphasizes access and quality. Concerned about the adverse impact of its already low Medicaid fee-for-service rates on the delivery of services, Oregon\u2019s initial capitation rates represent an increase over comparable fee-for-service rates prior to the 1115 demonstration. According to state officials, this increase contributed to the decision of a large number of HMOs to participate in the demonstration. As a result, about 91 percent of the recipients covered under Oregon\u2019s 1115 waiver are enrolled in some type of fully capitated HMO\u2014over three times more than the state\u2019s original estimate. Oregon assumes that more highly structured managed care will better control the utilization of services and that over time health care costs will rise at a slower rate than under the old fee-for-service reimbursement system.", "Finally, there appears to be a wide spectrum of opinion among 1115 waiver states about the extent of savings from alternative managed care structures. Florida assumes that a physician gatekeeper arrangement, which preserves recipient choice, will produce the greatest managed care savings and anticipates that the majority of its Medicaid population will select this option. Only one-third of the state\u2019s Medicaid population is expected to enroll in fully capitated HMOs, the system that Oregon considers to be the most cost-effective form of managed care delivery. The gradual erosion of savings in Kentucky, which employs physician gatekeepers under a 1915(b) waiver, suggests that state enforcement and oversight of such managed care arrangements are critical. According to state officials, emergency room use has risen again after an initial decline.

Second, such programs made it easier for states to provide coverage to entire families.

At least one state, Minnesota, cited another rationale for its self-funded program, MinnesotaCare. State consultants concluded that the lack of an employer mandate would result in the migration of children from private insurance to Medicaid. Eligibility rules in MinnesotaCare were designed to prevent such a migration.

Table 4.3 compares estimated and actual enrollment under the waiver for both traditional and new eligibles. Hawaii officials project that as a result of this higher-than-expected enrollment, the waiver will exceed the federal budget limit for 1994-95 by approximately 23 percent\u2014$47 million.", "Under the waiver agreement, higher costs in one year can be offset by lower costs in another\u2014as long as expenditures over the 5-year life of the waiver do not exceed the cap. Hawaii officials told us that the state expects waiver costs to be slightly under the cap for the full 5 years of the program as a result of state efforts to reduce program expenditures. The following changes in eligibility standards and premiums were effective on August 1, 1995: (1) the point at which enrollees will be charged the full premium will be reduced from 296 percent of the federal poverty level to 201 percent, (2) individuals eligible for coverage under the employer mandate but who meet demonstration income requirements will be disenrolled, (3) self-employed individuals will be required to pay a minimum of 50 percent of the premium\u2014regardless of their stated income, and (4) parental income will be taken into consideration when determining the eligibility of students under age 21. The state suspects that these last two groups either understate income or do not appropriately account for parental income. Officials in Hawaii told us that premium collections are keeping pace with expectations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tennessee: First-Year Enrollment and Cost Experience", "paragraphs": ["During its first year of waiver implementation, Tennessee enrolled about 418,000 previously uninsured or uninsurable individuals. Although its waiver application proposed an open enrollment period once a year, the state actually accepted and processed enrollment requests throughout 1994. Moreover, Tennessee liberalized a restriction that had disqualified participation by individuals with access to insurance as of March 1993 by moving the effective date to July 1994. In late December 1994, however, the state unexpectedly announced an end to open enrollment for individuals not traditionally eligible for Medicaid. Enrollment\u2014including both traditional Medicaid and new eligibles was about 39,000 less than the state\u2019s 1994 enrollment cap of 1.3 million. Tennessee also informed HCFA that the enrollment cap for the remainder of the demonstration would be 1.3 million rather than 1.5 million beneficiaries. State officials attributed the freeze in enrollment of new eligibles to a budget crisis caused, in part, by demonstration costs.", "HCFA reports indicate that the state spent about $443 million (14 percent) less than allowed under the waiver agreement cap. Nonetheless, Tennessee covered several hundred thousand newly eligible individuals while increasing expenditures by less than half a percent from SFY 1993 to SFY 1994. Table 4.4 compares SFY 1993 enrollment and expenditures with those in SFY 1994, the first year in which the waiver became effective. Moreover, as shown in table 4.5, the state is now projecting lower waiver expenditures that could increase federal savings over earlier estimates. In the first 3 years alone, lower expenditures could more than double the state\u2019s previous estimate of savings due to the waiver.", "Both the (1) gap between 1994 waiver expenditures and the federal cap on spending and (2) projected reduction in waiver expenditures to well below the amount permitted under the state\u2019s 1115 financing agreement may be linked to problems in identifying state matching funds for DSH. HCFA officials told us that, from the outset, they anticipated Tennessee would have difficulty in drawing down federal funds up to the maximum allowed under the waiver agreement. They pointed out that although the Tennessee DSH program was available to provide a major source of funding for coverage expansion, the state discontinued its hospital tax with the onset of waiver implementation. This tax had been a source of state match for federal DSH funds. Undoubtedly, the shortfall in premiums collected from newly eligible enrollees and counted as part of state matching funds also contributed to Tennessee\u2019s financing problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tennessee Encounters Problems in Collecting Premiums From Enrollees", "paragraphs": ["Tennessee has encountered serious problems in collecting enrollee premiums. Initially, the state estimated that it would collect about $21 million in premiums during the first 6 months of the waiver as new eligibles gradually signed up for the program; premiums would increase up to $117 million in the last year when full enrollment had been achieved. However, for the first 6 months, Tennessee only collected $2.4 million, forcing it to find other sources of state matching funds.", "Lower-than-expected premium revenues in Tennessee are due, in part, to a series of administrative glitches. Even though enrollment of the uninsured began in January 1994, initial premium notices were not mailed until June 1994. The notice informed enrollees that premium booklets would be mailed soon for monthly payments beginning with July. Then, the state contractor failed to mail up to 80,000 premium booklets, an error that was not discovered until November 1994. In February 1995, the state sent letters to nearly 60,000 households notifying them of past due premiums totaling $31 million. Approximately 62,000 individuals\u2014about 15 percent of new eligibles\u2014had been disenrolled from the program as of June 1995 and upwards of 20,000 more were within the 30-day notification period for termination.

While states have benefited from recent economic trends, the potential for a resurgence in medical inflation, a recession, and large numbers of traditional and/or new eligibles could create problems for Tennessee, Oregon, and Hawaii.", "In Tennessee, the 1115 agreement provides the state with a fixed budget to serve both traditional Medicaid and newly eligible recipients. Though the state appears to have a tight lid on cost increases, it is already under pressure to raise capitation rates that most providers consider unrealistically low. A slowdown in economic growth and the associated increase in Medicaid enrollment due to rising unemployment could further exacerbate the state\u2019s current budget crisis and provide additional ammunition to already aggrieved providers.", "Increased medical inflation and a recession could pose a somewhat different dilemma for Oregon and Hawaii. Under the terms of their waiver expenditure caps, these two states are not at risk for changing economic conditions that could increase the number of traditional Medicaid beneficiaries. Thus, the limit on demonstration costs floats upward with enrollment, permitting increased federal and state Medicaid expenditures. If increased state costs associated with covering more traditional beneficiaries is accompanied by an acceleration in medical price increases, however, the additional budget resources required could threaten Oregon\u2019s and Hawaii\u2019s coverage expansion plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Comprehensive 1115 Medicaid demonstrations have given states flexibility to test innovative approaches for the delivery of publicly funded health care services. While the waivers were intended to give states program flexibility, it is not clear whether the administration\u2019s decision to simultaneously provide budgetary flexibility is consistent with the current emphasis on reducing the federal budget deficit. Under the four approved waivers we analyzed, the federal government is potentially at risk for a net increase of about $2 billion in Medicaid expenditures. While Tennessee\u2019s waiver agreement meets the test of budget neutrality, those of Florida, Oregon, and Hawaii do not. The agreements in these three states represent the antithesis of the budgetary certainty that the Congress appears to be moving toward in social program spending.", "We believe the granting of additional section 1115 waivers merits close scrutiny for several reasons. First, the potential budget impact of 1115 waivers may increase if the administration continues to show budgetary flexibility in its review of additional state proposals. The administration has granted a number of additional waivers since Florida\u2019s, the most recently approved waiver whose budget neutrality agreement we examined in detail. Moreover, the number of pending waivers continues to grow and now includes New York, whose Medicaid expenditures represented about 16 percent of national program costs in fiscal year 1993. Second, given the priority attached to reducing the deficit, it may be appropriate to consider whether or at what point taxpayers should benefit from managed care savings that are currently being reinvested to expand Medicaid coverage to millions of additional individuals.", "Finally, though comprehensive 1115 Medicaid waivers were approved during a period of economic recovery and a slowdown in medical inflation, the recession of the early 1990s coupled with rapid medical price increases serve as a reminder of the risks posed by fixed agreements in variable-cost environments. The combination of higher medical inflation, a recession, and large numbers of traditional and newly eligible Medicaid enrollees could pose equally unattractive alternatives for both the federal government and states: (1) increasing funding or (2) reducing benefits/denying coverage to hundreds of thousands of people newly enrolled under the waivers. Consequently, we question whether demonstration waivers granted for a limited period are the best approach to reducing states\u2019 uninsured populations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services and OMB disagreed with our conclusion that the waiver funding caps for Oregon, Hawaii, and Florida are not budget neutral. We continue to believe that the administration\u2019s waiver funding caps for these states may result in increased federal spending.", "We do not believe that our methodology is the only appropriate method to estimate budget neutrality baselines, and agree that using a tailored, state-specific approach would be more appropriate. We did tailor our methodology to the specific services covered by the demonstrations and did reflect current DSH rules. We saw no evidence, however, that the administration itself adopted this approach. The only state-specific data evident in the negotiating record were historical trends, which were clearly not expected to continue. The acute and long-term care cost projections cited in the administration\u2019s comments are not consistent with OMB\u2019s published forecast of overall growth in the Medicaid program.", "While OMB characterized its own approach to budget neutrality as \u201cad hoc,\u201d we adopted a consistent and uniform methodology that challenges the administration to support its contention that these demonstrations should grow at such high rates. To date, the administration\u2019s own methodology remains shrouded in generalities. We believe that potential program cost increases of hundreds of millions of dollars should be based on a more clearly specified methodology.", "Second, contrary to the administration\u2019s assertion, state variation in Medicaid programs and expenditures was a central component of our assessment of budget neutrality. After using OMB\u2019s national forecasts to project without-waiver expenditure trends, we examined the waiver negotiating record and asked state officials to identify why future state Medicaid expenditures should exceed the national norm. As noted, we found no state-specific evidence to support the high budget caps agreed to by the administration. Even in the case of Florida, whose Medicaid program had been growing faster than the national average, the state\u2019s own estimates show that key factors contributing to past growth were not expected to be sustained.", "OMB maintains that \u201cit is more appropriate to use a current law rather than a current services baseline for adjudicating budget neutrality.\u201d Yet, it points out that \u201cthe President\u2019s budget does not differentiate between the two.\u201d We do not question OMB\u2019s authority to estimate the baseline, including anticipated behavioral changes in mandatory programs where such changes are allowable under current law. We do question whether in this case such an adjustment is appropriate, based on our review of state practices in these programs. The only explicit use of current law evident in the waiver approval process is OMB\u2019s decision to include those hypothetically eligible for Medicaid under current law within their baseline. Of the four states we reviewed, OMB\u2019s approach only affected the baseline for Hawaii, as is reflected in figure 3.6. Since no attempt was made in Hawaii\u2019s or in other states\u2019 waivers to suggest that they would have expanded Medicaid eligibility to hypothetical groups if their 1115 demonstrations had not been approved, we chose not to include hypotheticals in the baseline.", "Finally, the administration questioned the basis for our estimate of expenditures under the waiver funding agreements for Oregon and Hawaii, states with per capita funding limits. We asked and were told by administration officials that no estimates had been made of potential expenditures under those caps. Consequently, we worked closely with state officials to develop such estimates.
