The objectives of this report were to determine the extent to which (1) CMS's methodology for estimating Medicaid improper payments follows OMB guidance and produces reasonable national and state-level estimates and (2) corrective action plans have been developed to reduce Medicaid payment error rates and whether these plans address the types of payment errors identified. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CMS's policies and procedures against federal guidance and standards for estimating improper payments and developing related corrective actions to address errors. GAO also reviewed the results of all state-level reviews and conducted site visits at selected states that either received relatively large amounts of Medicaid payments or had varying rates of estimated improper payments, including states with possible best practices. GAO also met with cognizant CMS officials and contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) methodology for estimating a national improper payment rate for the Medicaid program is statistically sound. However, CMS's procedures did not provide for updating state data used in its methodology to recognize significant corrections or adjustments after the cutoff date. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires that federal agencies establish a statistically valid methodology for estimating the annual amount of improper payments in programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments. CMS developed the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program in order to comply with improper payment estimation and reporting requirements for the Medicaid program. Under the PERM methodology, CMS places states in one of three cycles, and each year one of the cycles reports new state-level data based on the previous year's samples. CMS then calculates the national Medicaid program improper payment estimate using these new data for one-third of the states and older data for the other two-thirds of the states. CMS's estimated national improper payment error rate for fiscal year 2011 for the Medicaid program was 8.1 percent, or $21.9 billion. However, CMS's procedures did not provide for considering revisions to state-level Medicaid program error rates used in the CMS methodology for calculating its national Medicaid program error rate. Because corrections to the 2 years of older data after the cutoff date are not officially recognized by CMS, the entire 3-year cycle could be affected. OMB has identified as a best practice that agencies should establish a policy for handling unscheduled corrections to data. Until CMS establishes procedures for considering changes to initially reported state-level error rates that would be significant to the national error rate, CMS is impaired in its ability to ensure that its reported estimate of the extent of national Medicaid improper payments is reliable.", "CMS and state agencies developed corrective action plans (CAP) related to identified PERM payment errors. However, GAO identified the following areas where improvements were needed in CMS's written guidance to states on CAPs to ensure efficient and effective actions to reduce improper payments.", "CMS's PERM Manual did not clearly identify the circumstances under which states should consider, and if cost effective include, nonpayment errors (such as certain coding errors that could have but did not result in a payment error) and minimal dollar errors in their CAPs.", "The PERM Manual and the associated website did not provide complete and consistent information on the required elements to include in a state CAP.", "CMS guidance did not clearly delineate CMS officials' roles and responsibilities for conducting oversight of (1) state CAP submissions to ensure that they contained all of the required elements and adequately addressed errors identified in the PERM reviews and (2) states' progress in implementing CAP corrective actions.", "Although the nonpayment errors identified in PERM reviews did not result in improper payments, the underlying issues may result in improper payments in future years if not addressed.

We focused on the  Medicaid payment error rate reported for fiscal year 2011. As part of this  assessment, we conducted interviews with CMS officials and its  contractors to clarify our understanding of both the sampling and  estimation methodologies. We also reviewed CMS\u2019s program manuals for  both the payment error and eligibility payment error components of  PERM, as well as professional statistical literature, to assess the  statistical validity of CMS\u2019s methodology. In addition, we reviewed state- level payment error rates to determine whether the sample sizes  assigned to states were in accordance with OMB statistical guidance. We  also used the results of these reviews and analyses to identify and  assess the reasons for any weaknesses in the estimation methodology,  and their potential effects on identifying and reporting Medicaid improper  payment estimates for fiscal year 2011 and going forward. In addition to  reviewing the statistical methodology, we obtained actual payment error  data for selected states and independently calculated the payment error  rates. The scope of our review did not include an assessment of  individual states\u2019 processes or payment systems. We assessed the  reliability of the claims and error rate data by gaining an understanding of  the processes the contractors or states use to perform reviews, including  any use of data sharing to determine eligibility, and their quality controls.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To further address the second objective, we reviewed agency policies  and procedures related to the development of PERM corrective action  plans (CAP) and CAPs for all 50 states and the District of Columbia used  to address the root causes of improper payments identified from the  PERM reviews, and conducted interviews with officials from CMS. We  also reviewed CMS\u2019s error rate reduction plans and initiatives to reduce  Medicaid improper payments. In addition, we assessed CMS\u2019s process  for monitoring state corrective actions and its methodology for measuring  the effectiveness of corrective actions to reduce improper payments  against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related  to monitoring. The scope of our review did not include an assessment of  individual states\u2019 implementation of their CAPs.", "To support both objectives, we conducted site visits at seven state  Medicaid offices (California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania,  South Carolina, and Texas). During these site visits, we interviewed state  personnel involved in the PERM process to gain an understanding of how  these states compiled the universes of claims and beneficiaries that are  sampled for the PERM reviews, how these states conducted eligibility  reviews, and how these states developed corrective action plans and  worked with CMS on corrective actions. We selected these states based  on criteria such as states\u2019 federal share of Medicaid payments and errors  identified in PERM reviews. The seven states we visited collectively  claimed about 37 percent of the total federal share of Medicaid payments  made in fiscal year 2010. We also selected these states to achieve  variation in the error rates found during PERM reviews included in the  fiscal year 2011 reporting of the Medicaid improper payment estimate.  One state had the highest error rate for eligibility reviews as well as the  highest combined error rate. This selection also allowed us to focus on  certain states with noted vulnerabilities in program integrity efforts, as well  as states with possible best practices. Although it does not allow us to  generalize findings to all states and thus the program as a whole, we  believe these state visits, combined with our analysis of CAPs for all  states, enable us to determine if states\u2019 corrective actions are addressing  the types of improper payment errors that have been identified.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to March 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

CMS developed PERM in  order to comply with the requirements of IPIA, which was amended by  IPERA. PERM uses a 17-state, 3-year rotation for measuring Medicaid  improper payments. Medicaid improper payments are estimated on a  federal fiscal year basis through the PERM process. The estimate  measures three component error rates: (1) fee-for-service (FFS),   (2) managed care, and (3) eligibility. FFS is a traditional method of paying  for medical services under which providers are paid for each service  rendered. Each selected FFS claim is subjected to a data processing  review. The majority of FFS claims also undergo a medical review.  Managed care is a system where the state contracts with health plans to  deliver health services through a specified network of doctors and  hospitals. Managed care claims are subject only to a data processing  review. Eligibility refers to meeting the state\u2019s categorical and financial  criteria for receipt of benefits under the Medicaid program. States perform  their own eligibility reviews according to state and federal eligibility  criteria. See appendix II for additional details on these three components.  CMS uses its PERM Manual to provide detailed guidance for  implementing CMS regulations on PERM. PERM regulations set forth the  methodology for states to estimate Medicaid improper payments and  outline the requirements for state CAPs. Figure 1 shows the PERM  process for estimating and reducing Medicaid improper payments.", "Through its use of federal contractors, CMS measures the FFS and  managed care components while states perform the eligibility component  measurement. CMS contracts with two vendors\u2014a statistical contractor  and a review contractor\u2014to conduct the FFS and managed care review  components of PERM and calculate error rates. The statistical contractor  is responsible for (1) collecting and sampling claims and payment data for  review, including performing procedures to ensure that the universe is  accurate and complete; (2) reviewing state eligibility sampling plans; and  (3) calculating state and national error rates. The review contractor is  responsible for conducting data processing and medical reviews after the  statistical contractor selects the samples of claims. Beginning with the  fiscal year 2011 measurement cycle, state-specific sample sizes are  calculated based on the prior measurement cycle\u2019s component-level error  rates and precision.", "All payment error rate calculations for the Medicaid program (the FFS  component, managed care component, eligibility component, and overall  Medicaid error rate) are based on the ratio of estimated dollars of  improper payments to the estimated dollars of total payments. The overall  Medicaid error rate represents the combination of FFS, managed care,  and eligibility error rates. Individual state error rate components and state  overall Medicaid error rates are combined to calculate the national  component error rates and national overall Medicaid error rate. PERM  accounts for the overlap between claims and eligibility reviews by  calculating a small correction factor to ensure that Medicaid eligibility  errors do not get \u201cdouble counted\u201d if the sampled item was also tested in  either the FFS or managed care components. National component error  rates and the national overall Medicaid program error rate are weighted  by state size in terms of outlays, so that a state with a $10 billion  Medicaid program \u201ccounts\u201d 10 times more toward the national rate than a  state with a $1 billion Medicaid program.", "For fiscal year 2011 reporting\u2014the reporting period covered by our  audit\u2014CMS reported an estimated national Medicaid improper payment  error rate of 8.1 percent or $21.9 billion ($21,448 million in overpayments  and $453 million in underpayments).

This law  also requires heads of federal agencies to report on a description of the  steps the agency has taken to ensure that agency managers, programs,  and, where appropriate, states and localities are held accountable  through annual appraisal criteria for (1) meeting applicable improper  payment reduction targets and (2) establishing and maintaining sufficient  internal controls, including an appropriate control environment that  effectively prevents improper payments from being made and promptly  detects and recovers improper payments that are made.

CMS reports national Medicaid error  rates at this 90 percent confidence interval to be consistent with OMB\u2019s  requirements, but CMS\u2019s procedures provide that the sample size for  PERM is to conform to OMB optional guidance for estimating payment  errors\u2014specifically, the PERM Manual specifies a target precision of plus  or minus 3 percentage points at a 95 percent level of confidence within  each state. The PERM Manual provides for the sample size for each  state to be based upon the previous payment error rate and the OMB  optional standard for the precision and confidence level. To estimate the  percentage of dollars paid in error, CMS\u2019s PERM Manual provides for  using a ratio estimation methodology to produce the PERM estimate.

For example, states may request a recalculation  when information supporting a claim as correctly paid was submitted to  CMS after the cycle cutoff date\u2014but CMS\u2019s review contractor did not  have time to complete the review\u2014or when a mistake made by the PERM  contractor was identified.

CMS officials  acknowledged that historically CMS has had to postpone the cycle cutoff  to allow the process to be as complete as possible while still permitting  CMS to report an improper payment rate timely in HHS\u2019s AFR. However,  after the cutoff date, CMS\u2019s PERM Manual does not allow for any  revisions to be factored into a state\u2019s official error rate.", "In reviewing the results of state PERM reviews, we identified some  instances where CMS issued revised state Medicaid error rates. For  example, CMS issued a revised rate to one state for its eligibility reviews  for the fiscal year 2008 measurement cycle because in January 2010, two  months after error rate reporting, CMS and the state discovered that the  amount of dollars in error was reported incorrectly by the state. This  revised overall state error rate estimate decreased from 20.8 percent to  7.8 percent. In another example for the same fiscal year 2008  measurement cycle, in December 2009, 1 month after error rate  reporting, CMS issued a post-cutoff date revised rate to a state for its FFS  reviews because CMS received additional documentation from providers  after the cycle cutoff date for official error rate calculations. This revised  overall state error rate estimate decreased from 6.4 percent to 5.9  percent. These revised percentages were not included in the official  error rates used to calculate the national estimate of Medicaid improper  payments.

In its fiscal year 2011 agency financial report (AFR), the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that as  required under Section 601 of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  Reauthorization Act of 2009, it published a final rule on August 11, 2010,  effective September 30, 2010, which required the eligibility reviews to be  consistent with the state\u2019s eligibility verification policy rather than  reviewing eligibility against a single, federal methodology, which was  done in the past. After publication of the final rule, states were allowed to  review cases under the new methodology. HHS also reported that based  on current regulations, certain cases from the fiscal years 2008 and 2009  measurement cycles, included in the error rates below, would no longer  be considered as errors.", "Table 2 provides a list of state error rates used to determine HHS\u2019s fiscal  year 2011 reporting of national Medicaid improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Medicaid Outlays and Estimated Improper Payment Error Rates Reported by the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 provides a list of Medicaid outlays and estimated improper  payment error rates reported in the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) agency financial reports (AFR)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Additional Details for Medicaid Error Rates", "paragraphs": ["Table 4 provides the margins of error at the 90 percent confidence level  for error rate data presented in figure 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Types of Errors Identified in Payment Error Rate Measurement Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Table 5 provides a list of error types identified during the fiscal years 2008  to 2010 Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measurement cycles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Health and  Human Service\u2019s (HHS) letter dated March 13, 2013.  1.

We clarified the report to acknowledge that the Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) written guidance does not indicate that  states could address an error by stating why an action is not being  implemented.
