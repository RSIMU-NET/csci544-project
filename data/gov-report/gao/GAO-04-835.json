Since 1992, the United States has signed so-called \"Open Skies\" agreements with 15 of the 25 EU countries. A \"nationality clause\" in each agreement allows only those airlines designated by the signatory countries to participate in their transatlantic markets. In November 2002, the European Court of Justice ruled that existing Open Skies agreements were illegal under EU law, in part because their nationality clauses discriminated against airlines of other EU nations. The United States and the EU have been negotiating revisions to these agreements. Experts agree that removing the nationality clause is central to any new agreement. GAO was asked to report on (1) how prevalent Open Skies agreements are and what their effects on airlines and consumers are, (2) what the key ways that commercial aviation between the United States and the EU could be changed by the Court of Justice decision are, and (3) how the elimination of nationality clause restrictions might affect airlines and consumers. GAO's work included both analyzing data on transatlantic air service and evaluating information from and positions of industry officials, subject-matter experts, and stakeholder groups. GAO is making no recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Open Skies agreements have benefited airlines and consumers. Airlines benefited by being able to create integrated alliances with foreign airlines. Through such alliances, airlines connected their networks with that of their partner's (e.g., by code-sharing agreements), expanded the number of cities they could serve, and increased passenger traffic. Consumers benefited by being able to reach more destinations with this \"on-line\" service, and from additional competition and lower prices. GAO's analysis found that travelers have a choice of competitors in the majority of the combinations of U.S.-EU destinations (such as Kansas City-Berlin). The Court of Justice decision could alter commercial aviation in four key ways. First, it would essentially create one Open Skies agreement for the United States and EU, thereby extending U.S. airline access to markets that are now restricted under traditional bilateral agreements. Notably, more U.S. airlines would gain legal access to London's Heathrow airport, which is restricted by the U.S. agreement with the United Kingdom. Second, it would also allow EU airlines to operate into the United States from airports outside their own countries. Third, for EU airlines, a revised agreement could alleviate some obstacles to merging with other EU carriers or creating subsidiary operations in other countries. Finally, the possibility that EU airlines might move some operations into other EU nations raises concerns about which EU nations' regulatory and legal systems would govern. U.S. airlines and consumers are likely to benefit from the elimination of the nationality clause, but the benefits may not be realized in the near term. Both U.S. consumers and airlines would benefit from gaining access to markets restricted under bilateral agreements, especially London's Heathrow airport, though capacity considerations there are likely to postpone and limit such access. Consolidation within the EU aviation industry could occur, with the effect on U.S. consumers varying, depending on whether consolidation creates additional competition or reduces it in particular markets. EU airlines could begin new transatlantic service in countries other than the airline's own, which would provide consumers with additional competitive choices. However, those airlines would likely face difficulties in competing successfully at another airline's hub."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the late 1970s, commercial aviation within the United States and the  nations that form the European Union (EU) has become substantially  deregulated, creating greater competition, lower fares, and significant  increases in passenger traffic. Commercial aviation between the United  States and the EU is not deregulated to the same degree. Since 1992,  however, the United States has signed what are called \u201cOpen Skies\u201d  agreements with a number of EU nations. These bilateral agreements seek  to create a more deregulated transatlantic environment between the two  nations signing the agreement by reducing or eliminating operating  restrictions on the airlines of either nation. This means that any airline  licensed by either nation can offer service between the two nations. This  same relaxation of restrictions does not extend, however, to airlines  licensed by other nations. Under what is called the \u201cnationality clause,\u201d the  right to provide nonstop service between a point of origin in one nation and  a destination in a second nation is limited to airlines that are owned and  controlled by citizens of the two nations signing the agreement, thereby  effectively excluding other EU airlines from providing competing service.", "In November 2002, the European Court of Justice, the EU body responsible  for interpreting European law, ruled that seven existing Open Skies  agreements and the bilateral agreement between the United States and the  United Kingdom violated EU law. In particular, the Court of Justice found  that the nationality clause illegally discriminated against airlines from other  EU nations because it excluded them from entering the transatlantic  aviation market between the two nations that had signed the agreement. In  June 2003, the European Council, composed of representatives from each  member state, issued a mandate to the European Commission to negotiate  with the United States on the creation of an Open Aviation Area, which  provides for the liberalization of the U.S.-EU market, including the removal  of restrictions on foreign investment in airlines between the EU and the  United States.", "In October 2003, the United States and the EU opened negotiations.  Industry experts and stakeholders we spoke with agreed that resolving the  nationality clause was the key issue. However, in June 2004, the European  Council rejected a draft agreement being negotiated by the United States  and the EU Commission. The European Council stated that further efforts  should focus on \u201cmore balanced market access provisions\u201d than were  included in the draft agreement. U.S. officials interpreted that as referring  to a desire by EU carriers to gain more direct access to the U.S. domestic  aviation market. Further contacts are being considered. U.S. and EU  officials stated that current agreements remain in effect. There is no set  time frame for when the matter must be settled.", "Changing the agreements to remove the nationality clause restrictions  carries implications for U.S. and EU airlines, airline passengers, and other  stakeholders within the airline industry. These negotiations thus represent  an opportunity to examine the current agreements and their effect on the  U.S. airline industry, as well as the implications of potential changes to  those agreements. You asked us to report on the potential implications of  changes in these agreements. We examined the following questions:  How prevalent are Open Skies agreements between the United States  and EU nations, and what has been their effect on airlines and  consumers?", "What are the key ways that commercial aviation between the United  States and the EU could be changed by the Court of Justice decision?", "How might the elimination of nationality clause restrictions in any new  U.S.-EU agreement affect airlines and consumers?", "To examine the prevalence and effect of Open Skies agreements on airlines  and consumers, we reviewed prior research from a variety of organizations,  including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and we analyzed  DOT data on passenger traffic from 1990 through 2002. To determine the  key issues related to the European Court of Justice\u2019s decision, we  interviewed officials from five major U.S. and eight major EU airlines; DOT;  the U.S. Department of State (State); the European Commission  Directorates General for Competition, Employment, and Transport; U.S.  and EU labor unions and associations; and EU airports, as well as officials  of EU aviation trade associations. To determine how the absence of the  nationality clause restrictions might affect airlines and consumers, we  interviewed industry experts about the likely outcome of removing the  nationality clause restrictions, and used prior research to highlight any  potential benefits or barriers that airlines and consumers would face. We  also analyzed available data on capacity constraints at EU airports and the  effect of opening transatlantic markets on labor. We assessed the reliability  of the various data sets analyzed throughout the report and determined that  they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We recognize that other important factors must be carefully examined  when analyzing international aviation. For example, issues relating to  safety and security regulatory oversight are obviously critical to any  comprehensive analysis of air transportation. Because of the magnitude of  these issues, however, we agreed with your staff at the outset that they  were beyond the scope of this report. In addition, while the EU mandate  called for the creation of a more open aviation market (including issues  such as foreign ownership restrictions and access to domestic markets),  both U.S. and EU officials acknowledged that addressing the Court of  Justice ruling and resolving the nationality clause issue were both  priorities, and we therefore focused our report on the issues linked to the  ruling only. We also agreed to exclude from this report several other related  issues \u2013 such as requirements that U.S. government employees and others  using U.S. government financed foreign air travel to use U.S. airlines.

EU aviation  deregulation began in 1987 and led to the creation of a single European  aviation market. In 1993, the EU efforts mirrored U.S. deregulation by  removing all government restrictions on routes, fares, and capacity, as well  as barriers to cross-border investment of European airlines. By 1997, the  EU removed the final operating restriction by allowing cabotage within the  EU. Deregulation has allowed substantial growth in both U.S. and EU  airline operations and passenger traffic, with consumers on both sides of  the Atlantic benefiting from decreased fares and increased service. As  airline operations and passenger traffic grew, U.S. and EU aviation industry  employment increased as well (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Open Skies Agreements Extend Partial Deregulation to Transatlantic Routes", "paragraphs": ["For many decades, international air service has been governed by aviation  agreements that are based on the principle that nations have sovereignty  over their airspace. This sovereignty is defined by nine \u201cfreedoms of the  air\u201d that have developed over time to outline possible aviation rights  between countries. During a 1944 international civil aviation convention in  Chicago, the participating countries decided that international aviation  would be governed by negotiated bilateral aviation agreements that specify  \u201ctraffic rights,\u201d such as the number of airlines that can operate between  markets, the airports from and to which they operate, the number of flights  that can be provided, and the fares that airlines could charge. These  aviation rights, including the right to prevent foreign airlines from cabotage  operations, have been the basis for international aviation.", "Under traditional bilateral agreements, air services can only be offered by  airlines that are licensed and designated by the two countries that sign the  agreement. To be licensed to provide commercial air services, an airline  must meet various legal and regulatory requirements. Among these  requirements are citizenship and control tests, which require that an airline  be majority-owned and effectively controlled by citizens of the licensing  country. In the United States, the airline must also meet economic fitness  and safety requirements. EU law establishes a framework for the granting  of airline licenses and air operators certificates, but all Community  airlines licensed by EU member states in accordance with EU law are  permitted to provide transport throughout the EU. The process by which  countries indicate which airlines are authorized to provides service under  the agreements is called \u201cdesignation.\u201d Designation has traditionally  indicated that the country making the designations will ensure appropriate  regulatory oversight. This responsibility extends to ensuring that the airline  complies with international civil aviation safety and maintenance  standards.", "Open Skies agreements are a particular kind of bilateral agreement. They  remove the vast majority of restrictions on how airlines of the two  countries signing the agreement (signatory countries) may operate  between their respective territories. For example, they remove prohibitions  on the routes that airlines of the signatory countries can fly, or the number  of airlines that can fly them. These expanded operational rights represent  significant alterations to the traditionally more restrictive bilateral  agreements that specified service frequency, capacity, routing, and pricing.", "While they granted more rights to airlines of the signatory countries, Open  Skies agreements, through the nationality clause, allow the U.S.  government to block airlines of other countries from these rights. For  example, while both Germany and France have Open Skies agreements  with the United States, the German-based carrier Lufthansa is not  permitted by either France or the United States to operate flights between  France and the United States, without it being a continuation of a flight that  originates in Germany. Yet according to DOT officials, if it is deemed \u201cnot  inimical\u201d to U.S. interests, DOT can waive the ownership and control  requirements. For example, DOT officials stated that, under the  multilateral Open Skies agreement signed with Brunei, Chile, New Zealand,  and Singapore, it applied a more flexible definition of the nationality clause  for nations covered by the agreement and focused on ensuring that the  airlines covered by that agreement are \u201ceffectively controlled\u201d by nations  that signed the agreement.

Open  Skies facilitated the formation of more integrated international alliances  between U.S. and EU airlines, which allowed the airlines to expand their  networks and provide competitive service for more passengers to more  locations at cheaper fares.

The change centers on the alliances that various U.S.  and EU airlines have formed with each other. Operating in an alliance  allows an airline to greatly expand its service network, without having to  increase the number of routes it flies using its own aircraft. In the simplest  case, an international code-sharing alliance links the route network of one  airline with the route network of another, forming an end-to-end alliance  with little overlap (see fig. 3). In this way, alliances have allowed airlines to  expand the number of markets that received \u201con-line\u201d service between the  U.S. and EU. Airline passengers prefer this type of \u201cseamless\u201d service,  compared to interline service, because it allows the convenience of single  ticketing and check-in, among other things.", "Alliances greatly increase the number of markets that can be served on-line  because they connect locations that were otherwise served only by one of  the alliance airlines. This concept, illustrated in figure 3, allows networks  to serve \u201cbehind-and-beyond\u201d markets. Transatlantic flight occurs between  what are called \u201cgateway\u201d airports, such as Atlanta and Paris. A \u201cbehind\u201d  point is a location that feeds passenger traffic into the gateway airport on  one side of the Atlantic, while \u201cbeyond\u201d points are those destinations that  can be reached once a passenger has traveled to the gateway airport on the  other side of the Atlantic. For example, Kansas City, Missouri, and Berlin,  Germany, constitute a \u201cbehind-and-beyond\u201d market. Neither city has  nonstop transatlantic service, so passengers from either destination must  first fly to a gateway airport. A passenger originating a trip in Kansas City  would have to take a flight into a gateway airport (such as Atlanta),  connect to a transatlantic flight to an EU gateway (such as Paris), and then  connect onto a flight to Berlin.", "Most major U.S. airlines that provide transatlantic service (American,  Delta, United, Northwest, US Airways, and Continental) belong to  international alliances with other airlines, including many from the EU. To  more closely integrate scheduling and pricing, alliance partners may  request that they be given immunity from national antitrust laws, which  would otherwise prohibit potential competitors (i.e., the alliance partners)  from coordinating pricing and services. DOT has granted antitrust  immunity to most of the alliances that U.S. airlines have with EU airlines.  Beginning with Northwest and KLM Royal Dutch Airline (KLM) in 1993,  DOT approved antitrust immunity for U.S. airlines with 18 international  alliance partners. Yet not all alliances have received antitrust immunity.  U.S. policy stipulates that only airlines from countries that have signed  Open Skies agreements with the United States can receive antitrust  immunity. The efforts to obtain antitrust immunity for an alliance between  American and British Airways has twice failed, in part because the United  States was unable to obtain an Open Skies agreement with the United  Kingdom and the airlines were not willing to cede Heathrow slots as  required by competition authorities. American and British Airways are  limited in the number of markets in which they can code-share, and are not  permitted to coordinate market scheduling and pricing in the same way as  other airlines that do have antitrust immunity.

Based on scheduled flights for May 2004, 83 percent of the  possible U.S.\u2013EU markets (5,165 of 6,210) were scheduled to receive  on-line service with nonstop, single-connection or double-connection  service.  More than half of those markets were served by nonstop or  single-connection flights. Table 3 summarizes the connectivity of major  U.S.-EU markets. (Additional markets may also have received on-line  service, but the service would have required more than two connections  and would thus be excluded from our analysis.)", "In addition, consumers in most U.S.-EU markets have a choice of service  from more than one competing airline or alliance. Figure 4 illustrates that  consumers flying between Kansas City and Berlin have four different  competitive alternatives. In the 174 nonstop markets, 71 percent have at  least three airlines providing either nonstop service or competitive  single-stop service.  In markets where the best level of service is one-stop  or on-line single connections, over 85 percent have at least three  competitors, and in markets where the best level of service involves two  connections, 60 percent have three or more competitors (see fig. 5).", "Between 1996 and 1999, according to DOT, within Open Skies countries,  fares dropped an average of 20 percent, compared to a 10 percent fare  decrease in non-Open Skies markets (see table 4). These differences are  consistent across the various categories of markets, such as  gateway-to-gateway markets and behind-beyond markets. Much of the  decrease has been attributed to the incentive for alliances to offer  lower-priced on-line service rather than the higher-priced interline connecting service.

The four key areas raised by  potential changes to the nationality clause are closely intertwined and are  as follows:  A new U.S.\u2013EU agreement that would address the nationality clause  issue would likely supersede the five existing restricted bilateral  agreements and also would become effective in the five EU nations  where no agreement currently exists. It would thus provide U.S. airlines  with expanded legal traffic rights (i.e., rights to operate between two  destinations) into what are now restricted markets.

Under an Open Skies agreement that included an EU nationality clause, Air  France would have the right to fly between any EU city and any city in the  United States. In theory, Air France could also decide to establish a  mini-hub in a city outside of France, where it could potentially begin  providing nonstop service into additional U.S. cities. This same flexibility  would extend to all EU airlines and to all U.S.-EU markets.

Similar to the experience of current Open  Skies agreements, U.S. consumers and airlines would benefit from gaining  access to the 10 restricted markets, such as the United Kingdom, Spain,  Ireland, and Greece. The likely source of the greatest benefit would be  London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, since it is the largest destination for U.S.  travelers (see fig. 8). If a new agreement extended the U.S. Open Skies  framework to all EU member states, it would remove the restrictions of the  Bermuda 2 agreement. U.S. airlines with no current access to Heathrow  would gain the right to operate there. For example, Continental Airlines,  which currently has no Heathrow access with its own aircraft, would be  able to begin service into Heathrow from any U.S. airport, including its  hubs at Newark, Houston, and Cleveland. (Continental now operates flights  from those hubs into London\u2019s Gatwick Airport and code-shares with Virgin  Atlantic into Heathrow.)  Because Heathrow is the major U.S.-EU gateway,  many U.S. airlines view the opportunity to gain access to this market as a  positive benefit.", "Access to Heathrow by additional U.S. airlines represents potentially  positive benefits to consumers and airlines. Consumers would benefit from  gaining greater choice of airlines, service from more U.S. destinations, and  possible competitive pressures on price. For example, if all U.S. airlines  now serving London by flying into Gatwick switched their operations to  Heathrow, London-bound consumers would benefit because access to  central London is faster and easier from Heathrow. In addition, consumers  in Denver and Detroit, who now have flights into Heathrow only on British  Airways, would likely benefit from the additional competitive presence on  those particular routes. Airlines that do not now have access to Heathrow  would benefit from being able to carry passengers into a valued  destination. Even though these airlines operate to London\u2019s Gatwick  Airport, they have reported losing high-yield business passengers and  corporate accounts to competitors because of their inability to provide  service to Heathrow.", "For consumers and airlines to realize such benefits, however, airlines  would first need to gain de facto access to airport slots, gates, and terminal  space. Because Heathrow is already operating essentially at full capacity, a  new entrant airline would have to gain access through the existing slot  allocation process, which provides limited opportunities for new  entrants--airlines with no more than four slots per day (the equivalent of  two daily takeoffs and landings). Each year, the number of slots that  become available through the normal slot allocation process is equivalent  to about five daily takeoffs and landings. Existing EU slot allocation  regulation requires the slot coordinator to set aside 50 percent of any slots  that become available for distribution to new entrants. Before those slots  are made available, however, incumbent airlines have limited rights to  acquire any open slot and substitute another they already hold. Incumbent  airlines can use this process to \u201ctrade up\u201d slots they hold at less desirable  times for newly available slots that might be for more commercially  advantageous times. This effectively relegates the slots available to new  entrants to commercially less desirable times. However, once a new entrant  does obtain slots, it can gain slots at more commercially viable times  through a grey market, which is used by airlines to trade slots. These trades  are allowed during any point of the year and are often done so for payment.  The EU does not officially condone this grey market, although a 1999  decision by a UK court found this system to be acceptable within European  law.  The EU has recently initiated proceedings against this system.", "While some officials have pointed out that the slot allocation process does  give priority to allocating slots to new entrant airlines, there is  disagreement regarding the effectiveness of this process in assisting new  entrants. Once a new entrant airline acquires five or more daily slots, it is  no longer considered a new entrant and then must compete for any  available slot as an incumbent airline. To gain additional slots for  transatlantic operations, a new incumbent airline with five slots would  have to compete against British Airways, with over 500 daily slots, and  Virgin Atlantic, with just over 30 daily slots (in the Summer 2004 scheduling  season).", "Another option for U.S. airlines to gain slots is based on the reallocation of  slot resources between alliance partner airlines. Some airline officials said  that, once the legal restrictions are removed, international alliances with  substantial numbers of Heathrow slots could reallocate these slots  between alliance members, thereby providing U.S. airlines with some  access to Heathrow slots. Some European airlines have stated that this  option would be discussed within the alliance; others maintained that  alliance partners would be hesitant to trade or sell slots to other alliance  members, because the Heathrow operations likely add considerable  revenue to their own network.  Alliance partners may also be hesitant to  trade or sell slots because, although the alliances are established through  legal contracts, past experience has shown that airlines can and do move  out of alliances. Thus, a slot sold or traded might be permanently lost or  used against the airline in the future. Finally, even if an alliance partner may  have a slot that theoretically could be put to more productive commercial  use by trading or selling it to another alliance partner, other capacity  constraints at Heathrow could prevent its use for transatlantic operations.  For example, a slot (with its associated Jetway and terminal facilities) used  for 40-passenger turboprop operations could not readily be transformed for  use by a 400 passenger Boeing 747.", "Given the limits imposed by these slot allocation options, it may be some  time before the potential benefits for U.S. airlines and passengers emerge.  Some European airline officials have pointed out that gaining access to  slots, gates, and terminal space at Heathrow can be done over time. They  cite Virgin Atlantic as an example of an airline that originally obtained slots  at less preferable times and, over time, acquired additional slots and traded  them with other airlines. Through trading, Virgin Atlantic gained a number  of slots at prime times. In Virgin Atlantic\u2019s case, it applied for and obtained  six daily slots once the UK government designated it as one of the two  British airlines allowed to provide transatlantic service from Heathrow in  1991.  By 1996, it had obtained approximately 15 daily slots, which rose to  28 daily slots by 2001. Airline officials reported that between 1996 and 2001,  the airline gained an additional five pairs of daily slots to the United States.  As of the 2004 summer schedule, Virgin Atlantic will have just over 30 daily  slots. That total includes four pairs of slots that Virgin Atlantic was able to  acquire this year for about 20 million British pounds (approximately $36  million).", "Airlines may also gain access if capacity at Heathrow expands.

British Airways is expected to be  the principal tenant at the new terminal, and its relocation there will  allow other airlines (possibly new entrants) to gain access to facilities in  other terminals.

There are no  official estimates of the impact on runway capacity of a change to  \u201dmixed mode,\u201d but BAA, plc, has suggested that this change could  increase slot capacity by 10 per hour. However, it is unclear if the UK  government will approve this change due to opposition by local  communities related to the expected increase in noise.", "The UK government\u2019s 2003 report on the future of air transport  supported further development of Heathrow, including a new runway  and additional terminal capacity, but only after a new runway at  London\u2019s Stansted Airport was finished and only if stringent  environmental limits could be met.  The report indicated that any  additional future enhancements to Heathrow\u2019s capacity would be  completed within the 2015-2020 period.", "A report commissioned by the EU on the effects of different slot allocation  approaches concluded that current EU slot regulation provides incumbent  airlines an advantage and makes it difficult for new airlines to obtain slots  to introduce new or more frequent service.  It also concluded that if the  EU adopted various market mechanisms (such as secondary trading,  increased slot prices, or slot auctions), higher passenger volumes would  occur. The report did not recommend that the EU commission require  divestiture of slots as a condition of airline mergers. However, in its  approval of the Air France\u2013KLM merger, to ensure that new entrant airlines  could provide new competitive service on certain markets, the EU  commission sought the surrender of 94 daily slots from Air France and  KLM.  Generally, incumbent airlines object to such events, arguing that they own the slots and would have to be compensated for them.  BAA, plc,  officials also voiced the concern that forcing incumbents to surrender slots  each time a new entrant wanted to gain access to the airport was not  permitted in the EU slot regulation and would create an undesirable  precedent, in part because of the instability it would create for incumbent  airlines\u2019 operations.", "While a new U.S.\u2013EU agreement would provide U.S. airlines with legal  access to markets that are now restricted, airline officials stated that,  without actual physical access, these new legal rights would be  meaningless. This is especially true for access to Heathrow.

In the United States,  consumers at dominated airports experience higher average airfares than  do those at more competitive airports.", "Although removal of the nationality clause restrictions would theoretically  open the door for new competition in various markets, airlines will likely  face significant operating barriers in those markets, particularly at  dominated hub airports. In the past, we reported that new competition at  key domestic airports was inhibited by a lack of access to slots and airport  facilities.  In 2004, an EU report noted that competition at certain key  airports continued to be inhibited by lack of available slots at attractive  times. The report listed Heathrow, Frankfurt, Madrid, and Paris\u2019s Charles  de Gaulle airports as having more demand for slots than available capacity,  either throughout the day or at peak times of the day.", "As in the United States, major European gateway airports also tend to be  dominated by a single carrier or alliance.  As table 6 shows, each of the  EU\u2019s major airports has one airline that controls a much larger percentage  of scheduled seat capacity than its next largest competitor. Transatlantic  flights to and from these airports are generally dominated by one alliance.  For example, Delta and Air France, both members of the Sky Team  Alliance, fly 100 percent of the nonstop flights between Atlanta and Paris\u2019s  Charles De Gaulle airport.

EU airline officials with whom we spoke said they have no plans to  establish a significant presence in the hub airports of other airlines.  Officials said it would be difficult to successfully compete in a hub against  an incumbent airline because of the inherent advantages airlines maintain  in their own hub airport.

Generally, removal of regulatory barriers to industry structure,  when accompanied by appropriate competition-preserving antitrust  policies, is expected to improve operating efficiencies and promote  innovation. The U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Horizontal Merger  Guidelines recognize that competition usually encourages firms to  become more efficient. Mergers can also generate significant efficiencies  by permitting a better utilization of existing assets, enabling the combined  firm to achieve lower costs than either firm could have achieved without  the merger. In turn, that may result in lower prices, improved quality,  enhanced service, or new products. At the same time, however, because the  motivation behind mergers is the prospect of financial gain, mergers are  restricted under both U.S. and EU antitrust laws in their ability to create or  enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise. Market power in this  instance is the ability of a firm to profitably maintain prices above  competitive levels for a significant period of time. Thus, while  consolidation in an industry through mergers can produce efficiencies and  potential consumer benefits, it remains important for antitrust or  competition authorities to guard against market abuses.", "Analyses we have previously conducted of actual or proposed mergers in  the U.S. domestic market suggest that mergers often have both positive and  negative effects.

However, other officials said that restrictive bilateral agreements  still held with three other major aviation nations would limit the extent to  which airlines would seek to consolidate. The three nations most  frequently mentioned were Japan (because of the size and value of the  existing market), China (because of the size and value of the potential  market), and Russia (because of the implications of overflight rights). For  example, Russia and Germany currently have a bilateral agreement that  restricts routes and overflight rights to Russian and German airlines. If  Lufthansa Airlines were to merge with another EU carrier, it is not clear  that Russia would extend these rights to the merged airline. If an EU carrier  did not have overflight rights from Russia, its flight times and costs for  operations to other Asian countries would increase significantly. These  officials said airlines that had received traffic rights and other operating  considerations through such agreements might be unwilling to risk losing  them through a merger.", "A merger can have negative effects on consumers in those markets where  the merger reduces the number of effective competitors. This negative  effect is increased if the two airlines that merge have significant  overlapping markets or if the merger creates an airline that dominates a  particular market. Industry experts generally agree that, with dominance in  a market, airlines can wield market power and make entry into those  markets by would-be competitors more difficult. Therefore, an airline that  can wield this market power has the ability to raise fares when  unconstrained by competition. Consolidation also raises the possibility that  competition in key markets will be reduced, thereby potentially affecting  fares and service. The current merger between Air France and KLM  illustrates this point. The European Commission noted that the merger  would also eliminate or significantly reduce competition on 14 routes,  including 3 transatlantic routes (Amsterdam\u2013New York,  Amsterdam\u2013Atlanta, and Paris\u2013Detroit).

These \u201cmega\u201d alliances would  provide the vast majority of international aviation service and would be  solidified around the Star, SkyTeam, and oneworld alliances, with the  major U.S. and EU airlines providing the vast majority of transatlantic  service.

Increased competitive  pressure resulting from any new U.S.-EU agreement may lead airlines to  seek reductions in operating costs. Because labor represents the single  largest portion of these costs, labor groups have expressed concern that  EU airlines might consider relocating to EU countries with\u2014from an  operating standpoint\u2014more favorable labor laws.", "Differences in labor costs and labor law among EU member states certainly  exist. According to a 2003 EU study, the newest 10 member states had an  average gross domestic product that is 40 percent of the average for the 15  other member states.  The EU has adopted a common set of rules with  regard to certain labor policies, such as gender equality, nondiscrimination,  and health and safety. Even so, specific regulations and enforcement  authority remain with the member states. Additionally, EU member states  still maintain their own national labor laws, some of which may provide  airlines with more favorable labor environments. Differences remain, for  example, in how EU member states regulate collective bargaining. For  instance, an EU report stated that the new EU member nations had  generally very weak collective bargaining regulations when compared to  the other EU member nations.", "According to labor representatives, the ability of airlines to relocate to or  establish subsidiary operations in other member states would enable  airline management to replace the existing workforce with lower-wage  workers. Additionally, EU officials stated that there is no EU law regulating  the representation, in collective bargaining, by a single employee  organization. As a result, workers in the same \u201ccraft\u201d (i.e., pilots or flight  attendants) employed by a single company but located in different EU  member states cannot be represented by a single employee organization.  There are, however, common rules concerning the right to information and  consultation of employees in Community-scale undertakings and  Community-scale groups of undertakings. According to labor  representatives, employee representation rights are critical to preventing  downward pressure on wages. These rights include single representation  for all members of an employee group, including those of subsidiaries and  holding companies; the ability to negotiate an agreement; and effective  enforcement of a negotiated agreement. Unless labor gains some of those  rights, airlines will be able to establish subsidiaries and then substitute  lower-wage labor for the existing workforce. A study prepared for the  European Cockpit Association, the association of each member state\u2019s  pilots unions, argues, that with the increase in inter-company and  cross-national alliances, trade unions and employee associations based in  single countries and without inter-union networks could be left without an  effective voice in the future restructuring of the industry, such as  determining where work will be located and under what conditions.", "While many aspects of this issue remain unsettled, we did not find  substantial evidence to indicate that airlines would relocate operations or  establish \u201cflag of convenience\u201d subsidiaries in lower-wage EU countries, at  least in the short term.", "None of the EU airline officials we interviewed indicated a desire to  relocate to a low-wage country, citing company branding and markets as  being more important in driving business decisions than low-wage labor.  Airline officials said that commercial aviation differs from other  industries because the product (air travel) must be produced close to  the customer base (population and economic centers). Consequently,  airlines need to maintain their major operations at key economic  centers, none of which are located within the lower-cost countries.  Another example that suggests factors other than low-wage labor drive  an airline\u2019s business decisions is that EU regional airlines, not bound by  international bilateral agreements, have not pursued movement to  countries with lower wages and social costs over the last 11 years,  despite the fact that such movements were possible after the creation of  a single European aviation market.", "Despite the fact that pilots and flight attendants are inherently mobile  and could theoretically travel from lower-cost areas to do their work,  airlines said it was preferable to locate flight personnel close to the base  of operations. Therefore, airlines will have to provide a competitive,  market-based compensation package to retain qualified employees. For  example, an airline that chose to have a major base of operations in  Paris would need to hire employees paid at \u201cmarket\u201d salaries. To run its  daily operation from Paris to Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways, for  example, employs 70 French citizens at its Paris offices and Charles De  Gaulle Airport. To compete in the labor market for qualified employees,  Cathay officials said that it must offer a compensation package that is  competitive with that offered by other airlines.", "If an airline decided to move its operations to another EU country or  import low-wage labor from there, it appears unlikely they would have  access to a sufficient supply of appropriately trained personnel. For  example, according to EU and airline officials, the number of pilots  available in these countries who are trained on aircraft used by the  airlines is relatively small.", "Finally, airline and government officials noted that both U.S. and EU  pilots have negotiated scope clauses that limit the airline\u2019s ability to  substitute workers from lower-wage subsidiaries for its current  workforce (i.e., engage in \u201clabor substitution\u201d). Moreover, available  evidence suggests that the creation of the EU\u2019s single market has not led  to labor substitution. A report by the UK Civil Aviation Authority stated  that, since EU aviation deregulation and the creation of a single market,  the United Kingdom had not had any airlines reflagging to a more lax  regulatory regime or workers displaced by cheaper workers from other  countries in the EU, nor had any UK airlines lost any market share to  airlines from lower-wage EU countries, despite the fact that the United  Kingdom is one of the higher-wage EU countries.", "While there currently appears to be little evidence of serious consideration  of relocation or establishment of subsidiaries for access to low-wage labor,  the removal of the nationality clause restrictions and the accession of 10  lower-wage member states into the EU does change the market dynamic.  EU labor groups said that the benefits of relocating business operations  among the 15 countries that comprised the EU prior to May 2004 were  limited, since there was not a large wage and social cost disparity between  them. Now, the disparities are greater. In addition, one U.S. labor  representative said that, while there initially may be little economic  incentive for established transatlantic EU airlines to move their operations  to countries with lower costs and labor standards, new entrants could use  the change in regulatory structure to gain a competitive advantage.  Furthermore, over time, there may be economic incentives for established  EU airlines to move their principal places of business or to establish  subsidiaries in countries with lower labor standards. Some airline officials  cite low-cost carrier Ryanair as an example of a carrier that is taking  advantage of the fact that the EU\u2019s single market is still governed by  individual member states\u2019 labor laws, and that pay and working conditions  are not subject to collective labor agreements at the European level.", "Because of this concern, U.S. labor representatives have proposed that  certain protections be included in any draft U.S.-EU agreement that would  reduce the incentive for airlines to take advantage of \"flags of  convenience.\u201d  One proposal would be to include a definition of \"principal  place of business\" in the draft to help clarify which set of laws would be  applied to a given carrier. Including this definition would make it harder for  major EU airlines to establish subsidiaries in lower labor standard  countries and have those laws applied to them. Setting this standard would  also clarify which country would be responsible for overseeing and  enforcing safety and security requirements for the airlines.", "The success of low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Southwest raises the  question of whether existing low-cost carriers could successfully compete  in the transatlantic market. Typically, low-cost carriers have succeeded in  the domestic market by providing point-to-point service, often at less  congested airports. These airlines achieve their comparative cost  advantages through lower operational costs (often gained through using a  single aircraft type), and greater productivity. Recently, low-cost carriers  have begun to compete with network airlines by offering long-haul  (transcontinental) service. Under current Open Skies agreements, both  U.S. and EU low-cost carriers can provide nonstop flights between the U.S.  and the home countries of the EU low-cost airlines. However, it is unclear  how low-cost carriers would compete on transatlantic routes. Key aspects  of the low-cost carrier business model, notably the higher relative  productivity of labor and aircraft and the use of a single fleet type, are more  difficult to achieve on transatlantic routes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["A new aviation agreement without nationality-based restrictions between  the United States and the EU could create additional benefits for  consumers and airlines, but would require oversight from antitrust  authorities to ensure that the benefits of more open markets in the EU  accrue to the traveling public. The existing bilateral aviation agreements  between the United States and individual EU countries would need to be  modified to resolve legal concerns within the EU, namely the nationality  clause. Depending on the outcome of negotiations between the United  States and the EU, the changes could be relatively minor or could result in  a comprehensive opening of the U.S. and EU markets. With a new  agreement that removed the nationality clause restrictions and expanded  the Open Skies framework, U.S. consumers and airlines could benefit from  increased access to new destinations within the EU,  lower fares from more  efficient route networks, and potentially more competitive routes. As  discussed in this report, such benefits may be limited because the current  alliance structure and bilateral agreements already provide many benefits,  and because congestion and limited access to key airports may mitigate or  delay the potential benefits. Resolving the EU legal concern over the  nationality clause could lead to continued consolidation among airlines  within the EU and potentially stronger ties between U.S. and EU airlines.  However, mergers such as that between Air France and KLM raise  questions about their impact on U.S. consumers because of their  antitrust-immune alliance partnerships with U.S. airlines. For example,  how might the Air France-KLM merger affect the international operations  of their U.S. partners, Delta, Continental and Northwest?  In evaluating the  potential effects of such a scenario, how would regulators separate the  effects or influences of airlines\u2019 international operations from their  domestic operations?  Since other major U.S. airlines participate in  alliances with EU airlines, further European industry consolidation would  continue to raise such questions.", "In the absence of any significant competitive pressure from low-cost  carriers flying between the United States and the EU, there is a risk that  beneficial elements of potential restructuring could be offset by a reduction  in competition between alliances. Antitrust authorities in the United States  and EU will need to be vigilant to safeguard the benefits that could accrue  from the changing market structure.", "The net effect on airlines and consumers will depend on (1) when and to  what extent U.S. airlines might gain access to markets that are now  restricted, and (2) the business strategies that U.S. and EU airlines adopt.  Obviously, the outcomes of any of these developments cannot be predicted.  For example, low-cost airlines\u2013which have often been a source of  innovation\u2013may find ways to alter their traditional business plans in ways  that would make them a competitive alternative to major network carriers  in transatlantic service. Past experience has shown that removing  government restrictions on aviation (e.g., through domestic deregulation or  Open Skies agreements) provided benefits to consumers, airlines, and the  industry\u2019s workforce. Because those significant benefits have already been  realized, the benefits associated with additional liberalization of the  U.S.-EU markets should be similar in nature but incremental in scope. It  appears that the greatest source of likely benefits to both U.S. airlines and  consumers lies in gaining de facto access to London\u2019s Heathrow Airport.  How the benefits from access to such restricted markets may compare to  those already realized from the other 15 Open Skies agreements ultimately  depends on the extent of the increase in competition and changes in airline  operations and passenger traffic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT and State for their review and  comment.

Specifically, our objectives were to answer the following questions: (1) how  prevalent are Open Skies agreements between the United States and EU  nations, and what has been their effect on airlines and consumers; (2) what  are the key ways that commercial aviation between the United States and  EU could be changed by the Court of Justice decision; and (3) how might  the elimination of nationality clause restrictions in any new U.S.-EU  agreement affect airlines and consumers?", "To determine how prevalent Open Skies agreements are and what their  effect on airlines and consumers has been, we reviewed prior research  from Department of Transportation (DOT), the UK Civil Aviation Authority,  the EU Directorate General Transport and Energy (DG TREN), and other  aviation research organizations. We reviewed documents from the  Department of State (State) to identify the EU member nations with Open  Skies agreements and reviewed the five bilateral agreements the United  States has with 5 of the 10 non-Open Skies EU member nations. (The  United States does not have any relevant aviation agreements with Cyprus,  Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania.) We interviewed officials from these  agencies to confirm that the information in these documents and reports  were correct.", "To determine the effect of Open Skies, we looked at the growth of  transatlantic passenger and freight traffic, and we analyzed historical data  on airline passenger and freight traffic. We used DOT\u2019s T-100 on-flight data  to determine the total number of passengers and the total weight of freight  and mail volumes that flew between the United States and the EU from  1990 to 2002. U.S. and foreign airlines are required to report all nonstop  segments in which at least one point is in a U.S. state or territory. To  facilitate analysis of the T-100 data, we contracted with BACK Aviation  Solutions (BACK), an aviation-consulting firm. BACK obtains the DOT data  and makes certain adjustments to these data, such as correcting recognized  deficiencies in the airlines\u2019 data submissions, when these submissions have  not met DOT\u2019s standard of 95-percent accuracy.", "To determine the reliability of DOT\u2019s T-100 data and BACK\u2019s product, we (1)  reviewed existing documentation from DOT and BACK about the data and  the systems that produced them, (2) interviewed knowledgeable agency  and company officials, and (3) performed electronic tests of the data.

We concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report.", "When analyzing the scheduled service in markets, we selected the largest  U.S. and EU airports in terms of passenger traffic, based on airport  categorization by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the  Airports Council International. While this does not include all airports  within the United States or EU, the U.S. airports selected accounted for  96.6 percent of the total U.S. passenger traffic in 2002, and EU airport  officials stated the EU airports selected comprised the major European  airports. We also used the May 2004 schedule data to examine the number  of competitors within a given airline market. DOT has in the past defined a  \u201ccompetitor\u201d as an airline or alliance that has a market share of at least 10  percent of available flights. As in prior reports on the effects of changes in  competition of proposed mergers or alliances, we adopted that 10 percent  threshold. To determine the number of competitors within each market, we  identified the best level of service provided and the competitive  alternative. For example, if a market has nonstop service, that would be  considered the best level of service. However, one stop/single on-line  connecting service may be a valid competitive alternative to nonstop in  some markets (e.g., among the subset of passengers who are not time- sensitive or may be more sensitive to prices). Therefore, when the best  level of service is nonstop, to determine the number of competitors, we  counted all airlines that provided either nonstop service or one stop/on-line  single connecting service. For markets where the best level of service is  one stop/on-line single connecting service, we counted airlines that  provided two stop/on-line double connecting service as additional  competitors.", "To determine what the key ways are that commercial aviation between the  United States and EU could be changed by the Court of Justice decision,  we interviewed officials from DOT, State, DG TREN, the European Union  Directorate General for Competition (DG COMP), France, Germany, the  Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as from U.S. and EU airlines,  EU airports, and EU aviation trade associations.

FedEx  officials indicated that if a night ban was enacted, it would limit them with  regards to expanding future operations.
