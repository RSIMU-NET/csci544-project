Category I missiles and rockets are nonnuclear and handheld. The missiles are the Stinger, Dragon, and Javelin; the rockets are the light antitank weapon (LAW) and the AT4. The Stinger can destroy aircraft in flight, and the Dragon and Javelin missiles and the LAW and AT4 rockets can pierce armor. Category II munitions and explosives are hand or rifle grenades, antitank or antipersonnel mines, C-4 explosives, TNT, and dynamite. See appendix I for pictures of the  category I missiles and rockets.", "In September 1994, we reported that many serious discrepancies in the quantities, locations, and serial numbers of handheld category I missiles indicated inadequate management oversight for these lethal weapons. Further, we reported that the services did not know how many handheld missiles they had in their possession because they did not have systems to track by serial numbers the missiles produced, fired, destroyed, sold, and transferred. At that time, we could not determine the extent to which any missiles were missing from inventory. We also stated that security measures were not uniformly applied at all locations where missiles were stored. Our report contained several recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to correct these problems. In addition, the Army Inspector General conducted two follow-up studies and found similar problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Improved Oversight of Category I Missiles", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken actions to correct the deficiencies cited in our September 1994 report. In that report, we recommended that DOD conduct independent worldwide inventories of category I missiles to establish a new baseline number. DOD established the new baseline number as of December 31, 1994, as shown in table 1. The Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps are the primary purchasers of category I missiles; consequently, our review and the prior report focused on their inventories.", "Our prior report also recommended that DOD establish procedures to track, document, and report additions to and deletions from the new inventory baseline. Since that time, the Army has begun modifying its automated system\u2014the Standard Army Ammunition System\u2014to report changes to the inventories of Stinger, Dragon, and Javelin missiles by serial number. The modification to the system is designed to provide item managers at all Army commands with 24- to 72-hour notification of changes to the inventory. In the interim, the Army has implemented manual reporting procedures to track handheld missiles on a monthly basis. This temporary system has a 30- to 45-day time lag in reporting changes to the missile inventory. The Navy and the Marine Corps have also implemented automated systems to track category I missiles. The Navy\u2019s automated system is intended to provide information within 24 to 48 hours on where a given missile is located, and the Marine Corps\u2019 system is intended to provide such information within 24 hours.", "In addition, our prior report recommended that DOD establish procedures to include a random sampling of missile containers during inventories to ensure that they contain missiles. The services have since established procedures to verify the presence of missiles inside their containers during maintenance checks. Finally, our report recommended that DOD reemphasize security procedures and reexamine the current security policy. In response, the services reemphasized physical security regulations for all category I munitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Still Exist in DOD\u2019s Oversight of Category I Missiles", "paragraphs": ["Although the services established a baseline inventory count of category I missiles as of December 31, 1994, updates to the baseline continue to be made as additional missiles are located or errors are discovered. Discrepancies existed at some sites between records of the number of category I missiles in their inventories and our physical count, but we were able to reconcile the discrepancies manually. Even though missile containers are being opened and serial numbers are being verified, random checks are not being performed because the services stated that they would be too costly. Also, DOD has not fully complied with physical security regulations at all of its sites."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Category I Missile Baseline May Still Be Inaccurate", "paragraphs": ["Army officials stated that, because of prior reporting, weaknesses involving the handheld missile inventory, they cannot fully assure that the category I missile baseline is completely accurate. The baseline had to be updated several times since its establishment because additional missiles were located. In February 1996, the Army discovered it had not counted 3,949 missiles during the initial inventory, which increased its baseline by almost 7 percent. Some of the missiles had been in transit and were not counted by either the shipping or receiving parties. Other missiles were being used by the Signal Communications Electronics Command in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, for test purposes but were not included in the initial baseline inventory.", "A Stinger missile had been at a storage facility in Kuwait since September 1992. Pakistanis discovered the missile during post-Desert Storm cleanup operations, and Kuwait did not return it to the United States until April 1996. However, the Army had previously reported that 6,373 Stinger missiles were shipped to and subsequently sent back from the Persian Gulf. Thus, the Army did not realize that this missile had been missing from inventory until after it was discovered.", "Also, errors in the initial inventory count have affected the baseline. For example, two missiles on the Army item manager\u2019s contractor database actually belonged to another country through the Foreign Military Sales program. These missiles, which were included in the baseline number, were at the contractor\u2019s facility for repair. At the time of our visit, one of the missiles was still at the facility, and the other had been fixed and returned. The item manager stated that the contractor was not reporting to her the number of missiles received, completed, and returned. However, as a result of our finding, the contract has been modified to provide the item manager a monthly report of the missiles received at the contractor\u2019s facility and the missiles transferred from the contractor\u2019s facility to a DOD facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discrepancies Found Between the Physical Count of Missiles and Records", "paragraphs": ["In our September 1994 report, we noted that records of the number of category I missiles in some sites\u2019 inventories did not match our physical count. This problem still exists at the Army and Marine Corps sites we visited, but we were able to reconcile the discrepancies manually. At a Navy storage site, we found no discrepancies between the item manager\u2019s records and our physical count.", "At the Army military storage location we visited, we found discrepancies between the item manager\u2019s records and the missiles we counted at the storage facility. All of the missiles that were on the item manager\u2019s records, but not at the storage location, had been issued to units for training. We used the Army\u2019s monthly interim reports to reconcile the discrepancies. We verified that these missiles had in fact been expended during training exercises. The item manager still had the missiles on the records because of the lag time in receiving the interim reports.", "We also found five discrepancies with our missile count at a Marine Corps site that we visited. All of the discrepancies involved the serial numbers. One missile was not on the item manager\u2019s records because the wrong serial number was keyed into the system. Two missiles were upgraded and their serial numbers changed; the new serial numbers, however, were not yet changed on the database that we used to conduct our reconciliation. Two of the six digits in one missile\u2019s serial number were apparently transposed on the container. Finally, one missile\u2019s correct serial number was in both the depot\u2019s and item manager\u2019s systems, but the wrong number was apparently stenciled on the container.", "We also found discrepancies at two contractor facilities where both the Stinger and Dragon were being upgraded or modified. Most of the discrepancies were due to the lag between the time we received the database and the time we performed our physical count. Many missiles on the item manager\u2019s records had already been sent to the DOD storage sites by the time we conducted our inventory count. We verified that the DOD storage sites had received the missiles.", "However, we found four additional missiles at one of the contractor facilities that were not on the item manager\u2019s records. The item manager had recorded that one of the missiles, still at the contractor\u2019s facility, was made non-lethal (demilitarized). Eight additional missiles were also listed as being at that contractor\u2019s facility, but six were actually at another location, and two belonged to other countries, as stated previously, under the Foreign Military Sales program.", "Finally, we noted a practice during this review, in addition to those that have been previously mentioned, that complicates serial number tracking: giving new serial numbers to missiles that have been upgraded. Stinger missiles that are undergoing a technical upgrade will be given new serial numbers once the upgrade has been completed. According to a Production Assurance and Test Division official, U.S. Army Missile Command, the justification for changing the serial numbers was that the missiles would, in effect, become new missiles, since they would be broken down into major component parts and reassembled with different components. Both the old and new serial numbers would then be cross-referenced. However, a Quality Assurance official, U.S. Army Missile Command, stated that he had opposed changing the serial numbers because it would be harder to track the life cycle of the missiles and that cross-referencing old and new serial numbers would create additional bookkeeping and the potential for transposition and other errors. Instead of changing the serial numbers, the upgraded missiles could be distinguished by adding a suffix to the serial number."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missile Container Checks Are Not Done Randomly", "paragraphs": ["Even though the services have established procedures to verify the presence of missiles inside their containers, a representative sample is not always being selected, according to the services, because it would be too costly. For example, an Army official said that during maintenance checks only the missiles that are easy to access in a storage facility are selected to be opened. This methodology does not provide complete assurance that missiles are not being stolen because it may not deter insider theft. Moreover, opening a representative sample of missile containers helps to obtain assurance that all reported missiles do exist, are held by the services, and are owned by DOD. This check improves the accuracy of the missile inventory reports for item managers as well as DOD\u2019s financial statements required by the CFO Act.", "We opened 108 missile containers to verify the presence of the correct missile in each container. Figures 1 and 2 show opened Stinger and Dragon missile containers. All containers had a missile, but the serial number on one container did not match the one on the missile. Neither the item manger nor the site officials could determine the reason for the mismatch. In another instance, a contractor official discovered that a missile going through an upgrade did not have the same serial number as its container. The correct container was at the storage depot, and the missile inside belonged in the container located at the contractor\u2019s facility.", "Also, according to an Army policy notice, the sample size and the results of missile container checks are to be reported to the item managers. However, we found that Army item managers were not receiving this information. As a result of our finding, the Chief of Staff, Army Materiel Command, issued a memorandum reemphasizing the reporting requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All Sites Comply With Security Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Some of the sites we visited were not in full compliance with service or DOD security regulations. Personnel at one Army location were not inspecting all vehicles leaving the storage area. The Army Inspector General\u2019s 1996 report also noted that not all sites were fully enforcing physical security regulations.", "The Army Inspector General included the National Guard in its follow-up review of handheld missiles. In its report, the Inspector General noted that National Guard sites were storing category I Dragon missiles in violation of DOD and Army physical security policies. Both of these policies permit the National Guard to use the missiles for training purposes only and store them temporarily at Guard installations. However, the Inspector General found that some sites had the Dragon missile in storage for many years.", "As a result of the Inspector General\u2019s report, the Army National Guard was directed to return the Dragon missiles to the storage sites. Since that time, all missiles have either been returned or used for training. The National Guard requested approval to permanently store Dragon missiles at selected sites. The Army denied this request because some storage sites were not in compliance with its physical security regulations. For example, armed guards were not used to prevent unauthorized access of the storage structures when intrusion detection systems were inoperable. However, if a site can meet physical security regulations, the Army stated it would reconsider a request only to temporarily store Dragon missiles at selected sites.", "Contractors are required to follow DOD Manual 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives, for their security guidelines. These regulations are not as stringent as the Army\u2019s physical security regulations. For example, Army regulations require that storage sites be secured with two locks and keys and that no one person have possession of both keys at the same time. DOD regulations permit one lock and key, which allows single individuals access to storage sites.", "We noted the following conditions, among others, at one of the contractor facilities we visited:", "The entrance to the storage area was not locked.", "No guard was available to check vehicles entering or exiting the storage area.", "There was no clear zone outside the security fence. (This area was cleared, however, after our visit.)", "One employee had keys to operate the locks to the storage site, security fence gate, and gate to a perimeter road that led to the main road. This employee also had the code for calling in to security to deactivate the intrusion detection system. We observed this employee leave the storage site in a truck, proceed to unlock the perimeter gate, and exit. We believe that allowing one person such access leaves the missiles more vulnerable to theft. After bringing this concern to the attention of the Commander, Army Materiel Command, a memorandum was issued requiring that the security requirements of Army Regulation 190-11 and the Army Materiel Command supplement requiring that storage sites be secured with two locks and keys, among other things, be included in contracts for activities involving category I munitions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Oversight Weaknesses Also Exist for Category I Rockets", "paragraphs": ["The services have different procedures and requirements for maintaining oversight of AT4 and LAW rockets. The Army and the Navy manage AT4 and LAW rockets by production lot and quantity. The Marine Corps maintains oversight and visibility of AT4 rockets (it does not have any LAW rockets) by serial numbers. Although we found no missing rockets in our physical count, three AT4 rockets that were sent to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Storm are missing from the Marine Corps\u2019 inventory. The investigations were closed on these three missing rockets, but no conclusions were reached by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service on whether the rockets were missing, lost, or stolen. The Marine Corps adjusted their physical inventory to reflect the decrease of the three AT4 rockets. However, the serial numbers will remain within its accounting and reporting system should these rockets be recovered.", "The Army manages AT4 and LAW rockets by production lot and quantity. However, the Army item manager\u2019s oversight of the AT4 rocket extends only to the quantities that are issued to the various major commands. Each major command then redistributes AT4 rockets to the installations within that command, and oversight for installation inventories is maintained by the major command. The item manager, therefore, does not know the quantities of AT4 rockets at the installation level.", "The Army is developing a system, called Unique Item Tracking, for all of its category I munitions, including the AT4. This system is intended to provide weekly reports showing the serial number of each munition by location. The purpose of the system is to identify the last accountable location of a weapon in the event that it is lost or stolen and recovered by law enforcement or other organizations. However, the system will not include the LAW rocket, since it is being phased out of the inventory, and most LAWs do not have serial numbers.", "The Navy also manages AT4 and LAW rockets by production lot and quantity. The Navy item manager does not oversee the rockets by serial number because it is not a requirement. This situation could be problematic if a rocket is missing because the Navy does not have a system in place to identify the missing rocket by serial number. However, some storage locations report AT4 rockets by serial numbers in addition to production lot and quantity.", "We conducted a physical count of AT4 and LAW rockets at Army, Navy, and Marine Corps storage sites and were able to match the physical count with the item managers\u2019 records.

In accordance with the CFO Act of 1990, each agency is to establish an integrated financial management system. Establishing an integrated, general ledger controller system, which ties together DOD\u2019s accounting systems with its logistics and other key management systems, is critical if DOD is to effectively ensure oversight and control over its sensitive materials. For example, an integrated accounting and logistics system will automatically update both sets of records when missiles or other sensitive inventory items are purchased and received. In addition, carrying out rudimentary controls, such as periodically reconciling DOD\u2019s accounting and logistics records, will help oversee and identify any unaccounted for in-transit items. Audit reports have repeatedly pointed out, however, that DOD\u2019s existing accounting and related systems, including its logistics systems, are not integrated and lack a general ledger.", "As part of DOD\u2019s efforts to reform its financial operations, the DOD Chief Financial Officer has stated that DOD will develop property accountability systems that will meet the federal government\u2019s system requirements.

International terrorist groups receive financial aid and other forms of assistance from several nations. The Secretary of State has determined that these countries have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism by supplying, training, supporting, or providing safehaven to known terrorists.", "Intelligence officials told us that there are a variety of places around the world for terrorists to obtain weapons. For example, several countries besides the United States, including Bulgaria, China, Egypt, France, Japan, Czech Republic, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom produce handheld surface-to-air missiles.", "Terrorists tend to favor small conventional weapons\u2014handguns, rifles, grenades, machine guns, or explosives\u2014because they can be easily transported and hidden from view. C-4 plastic explosives can be purchased from several countries. In addition, law enforcement officials told us that extremist groups have made their own C-4. Terrorists have used plastic explosives. For example, less than one pound of Semtex, similar to C-4, was used to bring down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.", "There have been thefts of category II munitions and explosives by uniformed and DOD civilian employees that involved quantities of items such as grenades, C-4 explosives, and TNT. We previously reported that military inventories remain more vulnerable to employee theft than outside intrusion. Table 2 shows the types and quantities of category II items reported missing, lost, or stolen from 1993 to 1996. Some of the weapons were recovered.
