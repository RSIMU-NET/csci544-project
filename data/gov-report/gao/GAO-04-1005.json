Active duty members receive an immediate annuity upon retirement based on pay rates in effect on the date of retirement. Eligible reservists must wait until their 60th birthday to receive an annuity. The annuity of retired reservists who remain subject to recall is based on pay rates in effect when they reach their 60th birthday. Current data do not provide DOD with the information it needs to determine what changes, if any, to the reserve retirement system are needed. DOD has not established thresholds for attrition attributable to retirement and, without thresholds, it is not possible to assess the extent to which DOD is retaining the desired numbers of senior reservists or the extent to which retirement benefits influence decisions to leave or stay in the reserves. Nevertheless, GAO's analysis of DOD data for selected periods when reservists were deployed shows that the overall makeup of the reserve force by years of service, age, and pay grade has remained relatively even and that overall reserve retention rates, to date, have remained relatively stable. DOD has, however, identified certain high-demand occupational specialties, such as military police, where retention rates have decreased. While these cases do not necessarily suggest that uniform retirement reform is required, they do suggest that targeted corrective actions of some sort may be needed. The estimated cost of lowering the age of receipt, coupled with an associated increase in retiree health care costs, is significant and considering the fact that military basic pay will continue to grow and health care costs will continue to rise, the longer-term cost will be significant. Importantly, all reservists--not just the minority of reservists who have deployed to recent operations--would be covered under this change. In addition, reservists who are experiencing increased deployments may not be the beneficiaries of a reduction in the age of receipt, given that only one in four reservists currently stays in the reserves long enough to retire. Finally, DOD has not studied changes to the reserve retirement system in the context of the total force. Changes, if not evaluated from a total force perspective, could result in a significant increased cost with little or no benefit and may produce unintended consequences on DOD's active duty forces."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the Department of Defense (DOD) has increasingly  relied on members of the National Guard and Reserve to carry out its  military operations domestically and abroad.

The long-term fiscal pressure created by the known demographic  trends and rising health care costs, combined with increased homeland  security and defense commitments, and moreover, the gap between the  estimated costs of DOD\u2019s transformation needs and likely budgetary  resources, sharpen the need to carefully scrutinize the longer-term costs  and implications before these changes are enacted into law.

Previously, reservists were viewed primarily as an  expansion force that would supplement active forces during a major war.  DOD has since moved occupational specialties that are key to conducting  any military operation into the reserve forces and, therefore, increasingly  relies on reservists not only to supplement but also to replace active forces  in military operations worldwide. Accordingly, DOD has called more than  335,000 reservists to active duty since September 11, 2001. Today\u2019s  increased reliance on the reserve components is a product of a number of  factors: evolving total force policies, effects of force downsizing,  increasing mission demands, and the Abrams Doctrine. In the aftermath of  the Vietnam War, former Chief of Staff of the Army General Creighton  Abrams asserted his belief that U.S. armed forces should not go to war  again without the involvement of the National Guard and Reserve, given  that decisions to employ reservists would reflect the national intent of the  public. This philosophy became known as the Abrams Doctrine, and it has  profoundly influenced DOD\u2019s national defense strategies and plans. In fact,  and as pointed out in the Fiscal Year 2002 Annual Report of the Reserve  Forces Policy Board, DOD entered into the Global War on Terrorism  dependent on the reserve components as the cumulative effect of 30 years  of adherence to the Abrams Doctrine. In the Global War on Terrorism, the  reserve components are considered full partners, providing nearly one-half  of the personnel who currently comprise the total force. The Reserve  Forces Policy Board cautioned that if DOD retains this doctrine, reserve  forces will be committed for the duration of military operations and used  and stressed as never before, adding that appropriate adjustments will be  necessary to spread the burden and provide for the long-term  sustainability of the force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Composition of the Reserve Forces", "paragraphs": ["At the end of fiscal year 2003, DOD had approximately 1.2 million Guard  and Reserve members in the Ready Reserve.

Congress established a retirement annuity,  receivable at age 60 upon completion of at least 20 years of service, to  provide them with this additional incentive. The sole purpose of reserve  retirement is to provide a monetary incentive for qualified reserve  personnel to retain membership in the reserve components and continue  their training. This incentive provides the reserves with a pool of skilled,  trained, and readily available personnel to augment active duty forces in  times of national emergency.

The  purpose of the military compensation system\u2014of which retirement is one  part\u2014is to attract, retain, and motivate the number of quality personnel  needed to maintain the desired level of national security. DOD has said  that the military retirement systems\u2014both active duty and reserve\u2014 should support and complement force management requirements (e.g.,  youth, vigor, and career development opportunities); be integrated into the  military compensation system; and be structured to replace and maintain  income for retirees. Both retirement systems have the shared purpose of  maintaining a pool of skilled, trained, and readily available personnel  subject to recall during time of war or national emergency.", "Differences between the retirement systems exist, however, because the  reserve retirement system was originally intended to compensate civilian  reserve retirees differently than active duty retirees. The active duty  retirement system, which was created in the mid-1800s, was originally  intended to provide for the separation of older officers with over 40 years  of service to obtain a youthful and vigorous officer force, and improve  promotion opportunities for younger officers. This active duty retirement  system has been substantially modified over time. For example, the  provision enabling active duty military personnel to retire after 20 years  was first introduced in 1915. More than 30 years later, the 20-year  provision was adopted for all active duty officers and enlisted personnel in  all services. When the reserve component retirement system was created  in 1948, Congress and the War and Navy Departments did not intend that it  should be comparable to the active duty retirement system. In contrast,  the purpose of the reserve retirement system was to improve retention, as  opposed to encouraging attrition, by providing a financial incentive for  qualified personnel to maintain their reserve affiliation and continue  training in the reserves. Establishing age 60\u2014the age at which federal  civilian employees could retire in 1948\u2014as the age at which reservists  would be eligible to receive retirement annuities provided a mechanism to  retain reservists for a longer period of time while compensating civilian  reserve retirees differently than active duty retirees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Active Duty and Reserve Component Retirement Systems Have Similar Features", "paragraphs": ["Both the active duty and the reserve component retirement systems  require 20 years of service for vesting and benefit eligibility. The fact that  neither the active duty nor the reserve component retirement system  provides for reduced annuities if personnel serve less than 20 years  provides a strong incentive for servicemembers to either leave the military  after serving only a few years or stay in the military for 20 years or longer.  For active duty members, each year of service counts as a qualifying year  for retirement purposes. Reservists must earn a minimum of 50 points,  each year, for the year to qualify for retirement purposes. Reservists  typically train one weekend each month and earn 4 points for each  weekend (two drills per day). In addition, they earn 1 point for each day of  annual active duty training (typically 12 points for a 2-week period) and an  additional 15 points annually for being a member of a reserve unit.  Reservists earn an additional point for each day that they are called to  serve on active duty. Between fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 2001,  reservists earned, on average, 64 retirement points per year. In fiscal year  2003, reservists earned, on average, 138 retirement points. The increase is  likely due to the number of reservists who were called to active duty.  Appendix II provides a more detailed discussion of the reserve retirement  points system.", "Generally speaking, both retirement systems apply a rate of 2.5 percent  to the number of creditable years served and then apply this rate to  servicemembers\u2019 basic pay to determine retirement annuities. In the case  of reserve personnel, the number of creditable years served is, essentially,  a prorated number of calendar years of service. (Specifically, reserve years  of creditable service are calculated by dividing a reservist\u2019s accumulated  retirement points by 360\u2014roughly, the number of days in a year.)  Typically, current active duty servicemembers who retire after serving  20 years on active duty receive retirement annuities that are equivalent to  50 percent of average basic pay over their last 3 years of service. Current  active duty servicemembers who retire after serving 30 years on active  duty receive retirement annuities that are equivalent to 75 percent of their  final basic pay. In contrast, current reserve members who retire after  serving all 20 years in the reserves, and who earn only the minimum  50 required points in each of those years, would receive annuities that will  be equivalent to approximately 7 percent of basic pay. Most reservists,  however, earn more than 50 points each year. Reservists can apply a  maximum of 90 points each year toward their retirement calculation\u2014 earned from their weekend drills and annual 2-week period of active duty  training\u2014but can apply up to 365 points each year if they are called to  active duty. Reservists who are called to active duty will earn more points,  which will translate into a higher retirement annuity, if they serve their full  20 years. In addition, many reservists previously served some time on  active duty before affiliating with one of the reserve components.  Therefore, while their retirement annuities will be significantly less than  the annuities of their active duty counterparts, the annuities of retired  reservists who served on active duty at points during their careers will be  greater than 7 percent of basic pay.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2001, both active duty and reserve personnel  became eligible to participate in the federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings  Plan on a voluntary basis. The Thrift Savings Plan is a tax-deferred savings  and investment plan only available to currently employed federal  government employees and provides active duty and reserve  servicemembers the opportunity to contribute additional funds to their  retirement. Service secretaries have the legislative authority, if they  choose, to provide matching funds for active duty personnel in critical  military occupational specialties, but not for reservists. Agency officials  frequently cite monetary recruitment and retention incentives as effective  for hard-to-fill positions. To date, the service secretaries have not used  this human capital flexibility for any active duty military personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Main Differences between the Two Systems Are the Age of Receipt of Annuity and the Effective Pay Rates Used to Calculate Annuities", "paragraphs": ["One significant difference between the active duty and reserve retirement  systems is the age at which retirees receive their annuities. Active duty  personnel immediately qualify for receipt of an annuity after 20 years of  service, should they decide to retire, that compensates them for lost  income potential. The Defense Science Board Task Force on Human  Resources Strategy stated in a 2000 report that many, if not most, active  duty retirees suffer a \u201csecond-career\u201d earnings loss when transitioning to  the civilian sector in their 40s or 50s and that immediate receipt of  retirement pay reduces the financial penalty associated with the transition  to a second career. As a result, the immediate annuity provides a strong  incentive for active duty personnel to retire when eligible. Reservists  similarly become eligible for retirement upon completing 20 years of  service, but they are not eligible to receive an annuity until their  60th birthday\uf8e7the age at which federal civilian employees could retire  when the reserve retirement system was enacted. The incentive for  reservists to separate once retirement eligibility is achieved is not as  strong, given that their retirement annuity is delayed until they reach  age 60.", "A second significant difference between the two retirement systems is the  basic pay rate that is used to calculate retirement annuities. Active duty  retirement pay is based on basic pay rates that are in effect when active  duty servicemembers retire. Reserve retirement pay is calculated  differently, depending on retirement options that reservists select.  Reservists who attain 20 years of qualifying service for retirement  purposes and who elect to retire can, if otherwise eligible, (1) continue  their affiliation in the reserves in a nondrilling status, (2) transfer to retired  reserve status in which they retain their reserve affiliation but are not  required to train, or (3) request a discharge. Reservists who continue their  reserve affiliation in a nondrilling status do not drill or receive basic pay,  but they can acquire additional retirement points. In addition, they  remain subject to being involuntarily called back to active duty. Reservists  who transfer to retired reserve status do not earn basic pay or additional  retirement points. They are, however, also subject to being involuntarily  called back to active duty. Retirement pay for reservists who retain some  form of affiliation with the reserves, and who are subject to involuntary  recall to active duty until they reach age 60, is based on pay rates that are  in effect on the reservists\u2019 60th birthday. Accordingly, this provision  creates an incentive for reservists to retain their affiliation with the  reserves until age 60 in order to benefit from the calculation of their  annuity at the higher pay rate. Reservists who request a discharge from the  reserves once they become retirement eligible are not subject to being  called back to active duty. They also do not receive their annuities until  their 60th birthday, but their retirement annuities are derived from basic  pay rates in effect at the date of discharge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which Changes Are Warranted to the Reserve Retirement System Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Current available data do not provide DOD with the information it needs  to determine what changes, if any, to the reserve retirement system are  warranted. While DOD has established enlisted personnel attrition ceilings  as a performance metric for each of its six reserve components, it has not  established attrition ceilings for its reserve officers. In addition, it has not  established thresholds or targets for attrition attributable to retirement. In  fiscal year 2003, for example, 2.1 percent of DOD\u2019s selected reservists  retired from reserve duty. Without thresholds or targets, it is not possible  to assess the extent to which DOD is retaining the desired numbers of  senior military members or the extent to which retirement provisions  influence decisions to leave or stay in the reserves. Furthermore, some  retention rates may be artificially high because, at various times since  September 11, 2001, DOD has implemented \u201cstop loss\u201d policies that have  precluded servicemembers\u2014both active and reserve\u2014from separating  from military service. Of all the services, the Army has made the greatest  use of this policy. Nevertheless, our analysis of various DOD data for  selected periods of time when reservists were called to active duty to  support military operations reveals that the overall composition of the  reserve force by years of service, age, and pay grade has remained  relatively even and that DOD has not experienced significant declines in  any of these variables. Similarly, departmentwide reserve retention rates  for fiscal years 1991 through 2003 remained relatively stable, fluctuating  between 76.5 and 82.9 percent and the reserve components generally met  their retention thresholds for enlisted personnel in recent years. In fiscal  year 2003, for example, all components met their thresholds, with the  exception of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard who  missed their thresholds by less than 1 percent. DOD has, however,  identified certain high-demand occupational specialties where retention  rates have decreased. While these cases do not necessarily suggest that  uniform retirement reform is required, they do suggest that targeted  corrective actions of some sort may be needed. For example, the retention  rate for the military police within the Army Reserve dropped from  approximately 67 percent in fiscal year 2000 to 49 percent in fiscal year  2003. Similarly, the retention rate decreased for Army National Guard  members in aviation, dropping from 80 percent to approximately  30 percent in fiscal year 2002. Finally, recent responses by reservists to  surveys administered DOD-wide reflect these retention statistics.  Responses to questions about career intent indicated that most reservists  intended to continue their service in the reserves. For example, in the  most recent survey available\u2014September 2003\u201467.3 percent of all  reservists who responded indicated that they would continue in the  reserves and noted that reserve retirement was a reason for joining the  reserves."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Available Data Do Not Provide DOD with Complete Information", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have complete data to properly identify whether changes to  the reserve retirement system are needed. Our prior work has shown that  one of the critical success factors for strategic human capital management  is the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions. A fact based  performance-oriented approach to human capital management is crucial  for maximizing the value of human capital as well as managing relative  risks. Accordingly, DOD has established enlisted personnel attrition  ceilings as a performance metric, for each of its six reserve components,  which vary by component. For example, for fiscal years 2003 through  2005, the attrition ceilings range from a low of 12 percent in the Air  National Guard to a high of 36 percent in the Naval Reserve. According to  DOD, these ceilings represent the maximum number of losses deemed  acceptable in a given fiscal year that are not to be exceeded. However,  DOD has not established attrition ceilings for its reserve officers. An  official within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve  Affairs stated that DOD historical data indicate that military officers tend  to be more career-focused than enlisted personnel. While on occasion  there are some officer retention issues, DOD has generally found that  long-term officer retention is more stable and higher than enlisted  personnel retention. Consequently, DOD has not identified a need for  establishing officer attrition ceilings.", "Furthermore, DOD has not established similar ceilings for the subset of  reserve attrition that can be attributed to retirement for officers or enlisted  personnel. For example, 17,959 reservists, representing 2.1 percent of the  Selected Reserve, retired from selected reserve duty in fiscal year 2003.  Without ceilings or targets against which to measure attrition attributable  to retirement, however, it is not possible to assess the extent to which  DOD is retaining the desired number of senior reserve officer and enlisted  personnel or to determine whether changes to the reserve retirement  system are needed to manage the force. In other words, without targets,  DOD cannot determine if 2.1 percent attrition due to retirement is  desirable.", "Identifying or establishing retirement goals would be beneficial to DOD for  several reasons. First, retirement is a force-shaping tool. As we previously  stated, the purpose of DOD\u2019s retirement systems\u2014both active and  reserve\u2014should support force management requirements (e.g., youth,  vigor, and career development opportunities) in addition to replacing or  maintaining income for retirees. Second, retirement policies provide the  primary financial incentive available to those senior personnel most likely  to be affected by retirement policies. According to DOD\u2019s Sixth  Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, reserve retirement  provisions begin to shape the retention decisions of military personnel  with as little as 5 to 7 years of service, and the effect of these provisions   on retention decisions gradually increases as servicemembers approach  20 years of service. This can be attributed, in part, to the fact that DOD\u2019s  retirement systems do not provide reduced annuities to members who  serve less than 20 years. DOD officials have observed that the retirement  incentive has a noticeable retention effect that begins at the 12th to 14th  year of service. DOD assumes that most personnel who have more than  14 years of service have decided to make a career out of the military and  will stay until they are eligible for retirement, and DOD data show that  attrition rates decline as servicemembers approach 20 years of service.  Accordingly, DOD does not offer retention bonuses to military members  who have served 14 years or longer. Third, retirement is a very expensive  force-shaping tool. As noted earlier, for fiscal year 2004, DOD estimates  that it will need about $15.1 billion to fund its current reserve retirement  system.", "Finally, DOD does not have the best data available to determine if changes  are needed because it has implemented \u201cstop loss\u201d policies in recent years  that have precluded servicemembers\u2014both active and reserve\u2014from  separating from military service. As a result, retention rates may be  artificially high. At various times since September 11, 2001, all of the  services have employed stop loss policies for both active duty personnel  and reservists at different times and in different ways. Stop loss policies  include, but are not limited to, the following examples. The Air Force was  the first service to use \u201cstop loss\u201d and invoked it for the entire Air Force  between September 2001 and January 2002. The Navy soon followed by  implementing stop loss for certain specialties between September 2001  and February 2002. The Marine Corps instituted stop loss for certain  specialties beginning in December 20, 2001, and terminated all stop loss in  May 2003. The Army began using stop loss in November 2001 and, as of the  issuance of this report, the Army is the only service operating a stop loss  policy. Many within and outside of DOD are concerned about the impact  that lifting stop loss in the Army will have on attrition. While some fear  that servicemembers will leave the military in great numbers, others  encourage caution, suggesting that while a spike in attrition might occur, it  would be prudent to wait to see if the spike is temporary or long lasting. It  is important to note that a number of Army personnel affected by the stop  loss policy had already planned to leave the service upon completion of  their military obligation. Thus, some service members\u2019 departure is simply  delayed.", "DOD should not only be able to measure the degree to which its  retirement system is meeting its goals but also assess how well the  retirement system helps the organization achieve its goals and pursue its  mission. This assessment would then enable DOD to determine if changes  to its reserve retirement system are needed from a workforce management  perspective. The fact that DOD has established attrition goals for its  reserve enlisted personnel is helpful. However, establishing goals for the  subset of attrition that is attributable to retirement would provide DOD  with even more meaningful data. For example, if overall attrition remained  constant but retirement attrition decreased, this trend could suggest that  the attrition was occurring at earlier career points and that fewer  servicemembers were deciding to make the military reserves a career. We  have previously reported that high-performing organizations identify their  current and future human capital needs and then create strategies for  identifying and filling gaps. The types of data that can inform workforce  planning efforts include, but are not limited to, the size and shape of the  workforce, skills inventory, attrition rates, and projected retirement rates  and eligibility. We previously testified that it is important to consider the  impact of retirement on the age and experience distribution of the force,  but that DOD lacked critical data needed to assess alternatives to the  existing retirement system. DOD also testified that retirement benefits  help shape the force by creating a reserve force with certain  characteristics and a specific distribution of personnel by rank and years  of service. However, officials in DOD\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Reserve Affairs told us that they currently do not have any  way to empirically measure the retention effects of the reserve retirement  system. According to a 2001 study conducted for the 9th Quadrennial  Review of Military Compensation, DOD should (1) assess whether the  current skill, experience, and age composition of the reserves are  desirable and, if not, what they should look like now and in the future and  (2) develop an accession and retention model to evaluate how successful  varying combinations of compensation and personnel management  reforms would be in moving the reserves toward that preferred  composition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of DOD Workforce Data Does Not Suggest That Changes to the Reserve Retirement System Are Warranted", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOD workforce profile data over three points in time\u2014 1991, 1997, and 2003\u2014for enlisted and officer reservists, by years of  service, age, and pay grade, does not demonstrate that significant gaps  have occurred in the reserve component workforce that might suggest that  changes to the reserve component retirement system are warranted from a  workforce management perspective.

First, the estimated cost of lowering the age of receipt, from age 60  to as low as 53 with limitations\u2014or, in some cases, lower\u2014will be  significant, given that all reservists who qualify for retirement\u2014and not  simply the minority of reservists who have deployed to recent contingency  operations\u2014would be covered under this change. Based on DOD data, our  cost estimates of the five current legislative proposals are substantial,  indicating that the cost of reserve retirement will increase by a range of  almost $3 billion to over $20 billion, depending on the proposal, over the  next 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office had not estimated the cost  of the retirement benefit for all five legislative proposals at the time of  our review. When associated health care costs are factored in, the total  projected increase ranges from more than $3 billion to nearly $35 billion  over the same period. Considering the fact that military basic pay  will continue to grow and health care costs will continue to rise, the  longer-term cost will continue to be significant. Second, lowering the  age of receipt will align the reserve retirement system more closely with  the active duty retirement system, but may not affect reservists who are  experiencing increased deployments and associated hardships. Many of  these reservists are not likely to be the beneficiaries of a reduction in the  age of receipt of annuity, given that only one in four reservists currently  stays in the reserves long enough to become eligible for retirement. Third,  retirement is only one human capital management tool available to DOD\u2019s  workforce managers to compensate servicemembers for hardships  experienced during their careers. DOD\u2019s workforce managers can consider  making targeted investments in specific human capital approaches. In  addition to changes to the retirement system that would have a broad  effect, DOD also has more targeted approaches available to it. For  example, DOD has several special pays and allowances it can use to  compensate servicemembers, such as hazardous duty pay and family  separation allowances. In addition, Congress has approved, but DOD has  yet to implement, a special allowance for servicemembers who experience  excessive deployments. Fourth, DOD has recently identified a need to  rebalance the reserve and active duty forces to reduce the stress on  certain high-demand occupations. Better use of these human capital  management tools can help DOD address the issues of equity and the  increased use of reservists in military operations. Finally, DOD has not yet  studied changes to the reserve retirement system in the context of the  total force, even though these changes could have unintended  consequences on DOD\u2019s active duty forces. For example, if the reserve  retirement system were changed to offer an immediate annuity after  20 years of creditable service, some personnel who have made career  decisions to remain on active duty until retirement might be inclined to  leave active duty and apply to serve their remaining time in a reserve  component."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Proposals Are Designed to Lower the Age of Receipt", "paragraphs": ["Members of the 108th Congress introduced five legislative proposals that  would reduce the age at which retired reservists can receive their  annuities from age 60 to something lower. The rationale often given for  these proposals is that reserve benefits, such as retirement, should be  enhanced in light of the frequency and duration of deployments that many  reservists are experiencing. One of these proposals would allow reservists  who served 20 years to retire and receive their annuities, immediately, at  any age. A second proposal would allow reservists who served 20 years to  leave the service and receive their annuities beginning at age 55. A third  proposal would reduce the age of receipt from 60 to as low as age 53\u2014on  a sliding scale\u2014by 1 year for every 2 additional years served beyond  20 years of service. For example, reservists who served 22 years would be  eligible to receive their annuities at age 59, and reservists who served  24 years would be eligible to receive their annuities at age 58. Under this  proposal, reservists would have to serve 34 years to be eligible to receive  annuities at age 53. A fourth proposal follows the same model but  establishes 55 as the minimum age at which reservists could begin to  receive annuities. Finally, a fifth proposal would retain eligibility of receipt  at age 60 but allow reservists to apply for receipt of reduced annuities at  younger ages.

Reserve retirees would also be eligible, under four of the legislative  proposals, for DOD-provided health care benefits for each year that the  age of receipt is lowered. Using estimates of projected numbers of retirees  and assumptions regarding the demographic characteristics of military  personnel and their families provided by DOD\u2019s Office of the Actuary, and  average health costs for personnel and their dependents provided by  DOD\u2019s Office of Health Affairs, we calculated that DOD would incur  additional health care costs ranging from $2.39 billion to $14.24 billion.", "Table 2 presents estimates of increased appropriations that would need to  be paid into the Military Retirement Fund to finance the increased  retirement benefits.

More generous proposals,  such as allowing reservists who have fulfilled 20 satisfactory years of  service to begin receiving retirement annuities immediately, could  increase appropriations by over $20 billion during fiscal years 2005 and  2014. Table 2 also presents estimated associated increases in health care  appropriations.", "It should be noted that the numbers reported in table 2 underestimate the  costs of any of these proposals because they do not include the past  service liability created by the proposals. In addition, these estimates  assume that retention among personnel not yet eligible for retirement  would remain unchanged from recent experience.

Finally, we interviewed officials in the Offices of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs and Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness to analyze the extent to which DOD has  studied reserve retirement reform from a total force perspective.", "We developed our own estimates of the increased costs that would be  incurred under each retirement proposal using projections made by DOD\u2019s  Office of the Actuary and data received from DOD\u2019s Office of Health  Affairs. We obtained estimates from the DOD actuary on the number of  personnel that would be affected by each retirement proposal and then  multiplied this population estimate by the estimated costs of providing  retirement and health care benefits.", "To estimate the retirement benefit costs, we asked DOD\u2019s Office of the  Actuary to estimate the number of new persons who would be eligible to  retire under each retirement proposal. The DOD actuary also estimated  the normal cost of each proposal. To develop estimates of the normal cost  of each alternative, the DOD actuary projected future personnel levels  based upon the number of persons participating in the selected reserve  forces on September 30, 2003. The DOD actuary generally assumed that  future retention rates in the reserve forces would be the same rates that  were observed from 1997 to 2000 and also assumed that personnel, newly  eligible under the different proposals, would retire at the same rates as  personnel who are currently eligible. The DOD actuary assumed that  retirement benefit increases would vary from 1.3 to 3.0 percent between  fiscal year 2005 and 2014, that future pay raises for the uniformed services  would range from 3.4 to 3.75 percent, that the real rate of return on  retirement investments would be 3.25 percent, and that the rate of  discount would be 6.25 percent. For each proposal, we applied the DOD  actuary\u2019s estimate of the increase in the normal cost percentage to the  projected level of basic pay that would be paid to reservists from fiscal  year 2005 through fiscal year 2014 to estimate the amount of additional  funds that would need to be appropriated to the Military Retirement Fund.", "To estimate the increased costs of providing health care benefits to newly  eligible retirees under each proposal, we again used the DOD actuary\u2019s  estimate of the number of new retirees under each proposal. We also used  assumptions, provided by DOD\u2019s Office of Health Affairs, that one-half of  these retirees would be single and that one-half would have dependents.  DOD\u2019s Office of Health Affairs assumed that the average number of  dependents in this latter group of retirees would be 2.94. The Office of  Health Affairs also assumed that the costs to provide health care would be  $2,242 for each retiree and $1,910 for each dependent in fiscal year 2005.  Based on these data, we calculated that the costs of providing health care  through DOD\u2019s health care system would increase 10 percent annually  from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2014.", "We conducted our review from November 2003 through July 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key Provisions of the Reserve Retirement Points System", "paragraphs": ["The reserve retirement system, which has remained largely unchanged  since its enactment in 1948, is built upon a points system that provides  DOD with a means to convert the total number of years served by  reservists on a part-time basis into the equivalent number of full-time years  served. Essentially, DOD divides the total number of points that a reservist  earned in each qualifying year by 360\u2014roughly, the number of days in a  year. This prorated adjustment provides DOD with the ability to calculate  retirement annuities for both active duty and reserve retirees on a  comparable basis.", "Reservists must accumulate 20 years of creditable service to become  retirement eligible and, as of October 1, 2002, reservists must also serve  the last 6 years in a reserve component. A creditable year of service is a  year in which a reservist earns a minimum of 50 points. Retirement points  can be classified as inactive duty points and active duty points.", "Reservists typically earn inactive duty points in a number of different  ways:    Weekend drills. Reservists attend weekend drills each month. Each day  is divided into two drill periods, of 4 hours in duration, and reservists  earn 1 point for each drill. This equates to 4 points for each weekend,  or 48 points annually.", "Annual training. Reservists participate in 2 weeks of training annually  and typically earn 12 points for this training time.", "Affiliation with a reserve unit. Reservists earn 15 points annually for  being a member of a reserve unit.", "Additional points. Reservists can earn additional points for such things  as completion of accredited correspondence courses or participation in  funeral honors duty. Reservists, however, cannot apply more than 90  inactive duty points toward retirement in any given year.", "In addition, reservists receive 1 point for any day served on active duty  prior to separating from active duty and affiliating with a reserve  component. When called to active duty, reservists also earn active  duty points\u20141 point for each day served. Reservists can earn a maximum  of 365 active duty points in any calendar year and a career maximum of  10,950 points or 30 years of creditable service.
