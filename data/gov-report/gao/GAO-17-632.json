In this report, GAO (1) described how selected states monitored MLTSS access and quality, and (2) examined the extent to which CMS oversees MLTSS access and quality in selected states.", "GAO reviewed federal regulations, guidance, and internal control standards. For six states selected for variation in location, program size and duration, and other factors, GAO reviewed reporting requirements, reports to CMS, and other documents.

States are increasingly delivering such services through managed care, known as managed long-term services and supports (MLTSS). In MLTSS, as with most Medicaid managed care programs, states contract with managed care organizations (MCO) to provide a specific set of covered services to beneficiaries in return for one fixed periodic payment per beneficiary. In addition, beneficiaries have the right to appeal an MCO decision to reduce, terminate, or deny their benefits, or file a grievance with an MCO regarding concerns about their care.", "The six states GAO reviewed\u2014Arizona, Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Texas\u2014used a range of methods for monitoring access and quality in MLTSS programs. To oversee beneficiaries' care, GAO found that states used\u2014to varying levels\u2014external quality reviews, beneficiary surveys, stakeholder meetings, and beneficiary appeals and grievances data. For example, while all six states used external quality reviews and beneficiary surveys, GAO found that states varied in the extent to which\u2014and how\u2014they used appeals and grievances data to monitor beneficiaries' concerns about quality and access in their MLTSS programs.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the federal agency responsible for overseeing Medicaid\u2014did not always require the six selected states to report the information needed to monitor access and quality in MLTSS programs. CMS primarily relied on its reviews of state-submitted reports to monitor MLTSS programs for compliance with federal regulations and state-specific reporting requirements, and what states are required to report to CMS can vary by state. Although CMS highlighted certain elements that it deemed essential to developing and maintaining high quality MLTSS programs in its 2013 guidance, GAO found that CMS did not require all selected states to report on these elements\u2014namely, provider network adequacy; critical incidents, which are events that may cause abuse, neglect or exploitation of beneficiaries; and appeals and grievances. CMS did not require three of the six states that GAO reviewed to regularly report on network adequacy or provide summaries of critical incidents. Further, although CMS requires all selected states to report on their quality assurance efforts, GAO found that states often report general descriptions of their planned and ongoing quality assurance activities for MLTSS or their entire comprehensive managed care programs. Consequently, state reporting did not always provide CMS with information needed to assess state oversight of key elements. Gaps in reporting requirements may mean that CMS does not always have information needed to monitor key aspects of MLTSS access and quality among selected states and it may not be able to reliably detect state or MCO practices that do not meet CMS's guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS take steps to identify and obtain information to oversee key aspects of MLTSS access and quality, including network adequacy, critical incidents, and appeals and grievances.

In MLTSS, as with most Medicaid managed care programs,  states contract with managed care organizations (MCO) to provide a  specific set of covered services to beneficiaries in return for one fixed  periodic payment per beneficiary\u2014typically, per member per month. As  of May 2017, 22 states had enrolled beneficiaries in MLTSS programs  and 5 additional states planned to implement such programs. In fiscal  year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, MLTSS  accounted for an estimated $29 billion of the $158 billion in total Medicaid  spending on long-term services and supports.", "Given the potential vulnerability and significant needs of the Medicaid  beneficiaries who use long-term services and supports, federal and state  oversight of MLTSS programs is crucial for ensuring their access to  quality care\u2014that is, the provision of health care services that promote  desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional  knowledge. The types of beneficiaries eligible for MLTSS programs vary  by state, but can include the elderly; adults with physical, intellectual, or  developmental disabilities; and children with disabilities. These  beneficiaries may have limited ability to care for themselves, and may  need support such as nursing care or assistance with eating or dressing.  Many beneficiaries prefer to receive support in home- and community- based settings, and MLTSS programs can be a strategy for states to  expand access to home- and community-based care, potentially at a  lower cost than institutional care. MLTSS programs can also provide an  opportunity for states to better integrate Medicaid long-term services and  supports with acute care or other services. At the same time, however,  the use of managed care to meet MLTSS beneficiaries\u2019 needs assumes  that the provision of appropriate services can be achieved in a cost- effective manner for a population that is among the most vulnerable and  has particularly high health care needs.", "As with Medicaid generally, the states and the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS)\u2014share responsibility for overseeing MLTSS programs,  including monitoring beneficiaries\u2019 access to and quality of care. States  are responsible for the operation of MLTSS programs and for monitoring  the MCOs that provide the care. CMS is responsible for approving and  monitoring states\u2019 MLTSS programs to ensure that they comply with all  applicable federal requirements. For example, among other beneficiary  protections to help ensure access to care, MLTSS beneficiaries have the  right, by law, to appeal an MCO\u2019s decision to reduce, terminate, or deny  payment for services, such as a decision to deny coverage for a specific  service or reduce the hours of MLTSS services. MLTSS beneficiaries  may also file a grievance with an MCO about their care, such as to  express dissatisfaction about difficulty getting an appointment with an  MLTSS provider or concerns about the quality of MLTSS care. In  addition, CMS may set state-specific requirements for an individual  MLTSS program, which are generally known as special terms and  conditions. For example, in state programs\u2019 special terms and conditions,  CMS may establish reporting requirements in which states must  periodically report to CMS on specific aspects of their MLTSS programs,  such as on measures of access to care or quality.", "You asked us to provide information on how states are implementing  MLTSS and on CMS oversight of MLTSS programs. In January 2017, we  issued a report that examined how selected states structured financial  incentives in their MLTSS programs and CMS\u2019s policies and procedures  for overseeing states\u2019 payment structures. In this report, we  1.  describe how selected states monitored access and quality in their  MLTSS programs, including their use of beneficiary appeals and  grievances; and  2.  examine the extent to which CMS oversees MLTSS access and  quality in selected states.", "To describe how states monitored access and quality in their MLTSS  programs, including their use of beneficiary appeals and grievances, we  reviewed selected states\u2019 documentation of their MLTSS monitoring  efforts as well as relevant federal regulations and guidance regarding  state oversight. Out of the 21 states with established MLTSS programs as  of calendar year 2013, we selected 6 states\u2014Arizona, Delaware, Kansas,  Minnesota, Tennessee, and Texas\u2014whose MLTSS programs were  authorized under a section 1115 demonstration or section 1915 waiver  and reflected a range of experiences in terms of the length of time they  had been in place; the number of beneficiaries receiving MLTSS in fiscal  year 2013; the percentage of MLTSS spending on services provided in  the home and the community\u2014referred to as home- and community- based services (HCBS)\u2014in fiscal year 2013; and geographic region. The  fiscal year 2013 data on MLTSS programs and their number of  beneficiaries and spending were the most recently available state-level  data at the time we selected states for review. The 6 states represented  over 30 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries in MLTSS programs as of  July 2015. We collected information on the methods these states used to  monitor access and quality in MLTSS programs, such as quality  improvement strategies and external reviews, and examined states\u2019 uses  of beneficiary appeals and grievances. We reviewed documentation, such  as state contracts with MCOs\u2014which specify what services MCOs are  required to provide and what information MCOs are required to report to  the state, among other responsibilities\u2014and state quality strategies. We  also reviewed state data on beneficiaries\u2019 appeals and grievances and  states\u2019 compliance actions in calendar years 2013 through 2015, and the  outcomes of beneficiaries\u2019 appeals for calendar year 2015. We  interviewed state Medicaid officials about their monitoring efforts, and  discussed state oversight with CMS officials. Neither the MLTSS  programs in these six states nor the methods they use to monitor access  and quality that we examined are generalizable to other states.", "To examine the extent to which CMS oversees MLTSS access and  quality in selected states, we reviewed documents regarding CMS\u2019s  monitoring efforts, including Medicaid managed care regulations and  CMS guidance on MLTSS programs. In addition, for our 6 selected  states, we reviewed their MLTSS special terms and conditions, including  CMS\u2019s reporting requirements regarding MLTSS access to and quality of  care, and examined the variation in those requirements across states. We  focused on states\u2019 reporting requirements related to the section 1115 and  1915 demonstrations and waivers, the most commonly used authorities  for MLTSS programs. We also reviewed the states\u2019 quarterly and annual  reports to CMS about their MLTSS programs, and assessed whether  those reports were consistent with CMS\u2019s state-specific reporting  requirements. We also interviewed CMS and state officials about MLTSS  monitoring and oversight efforts. We assessed CMS\u2019s monitoring efforts  using agency guidance that lists key elements of effective MLTSS  programs, which CMS uses to review state applications for new MLTSS  programs as well as existing MLTSS programs. For our analysis, we  focused on a subset of key elements that were directly related to access  and quality of care, and could be reviewed in the context of state  reporting requirements. We also considered the extent to which CMS\u2019s  monitoring efforts are consistent with relevant Standards for Internal  Controls in the Federal Government, specifically, those related to  monitoring. In addition, we interviewed officials with HHS\u2019s  Administration for Community Living, which is responsible for increasing  individuals\u2019 access to community supports.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to August  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Individuals needing long-term services and  supports have varying degrees of difficulty performing activities of daily  living, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, and eating, without assistance.", "They may also have difficulties with preparing meals, housekeeping,  using the telephone, and managing money. Long-term services and  supports to address these needs are generally provided in two settings:  institutional facilities, such as nursing facilities and intermediate care  facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities; and home and  community settings, such as individuals\u2019 homes or assisted living  facilities. HCBS cover a wide range of services and supports to help  individuals remain in their homes or a community setting, such as  personal care services to provide assistance with activities of daily  living.", "MLTSS programs can vary due in part to the flexibility that Medicaid  allows states in establishing their programs. For example, states have  flexibility in determining which populations to include in their MLTSS  programs and whether to use mandatory or voluntary enrollment. States  also have flexibility in determining what services to include. In addition,  states may choose to have MLTSS as part of a broader, comprehensive  managed care program that also provides acute care or behavioral health  care, or to have MLTSS as a separate managed care program.

To be eligible for MLTSS,  beneficiaries must meet income and asset requirements, and also meet  state-established criteria on the level of care needed, such as needing an  institutional level of care. Once a person is determined eligible, the  individual can be enrolled to receive MLTSS from an MCO. The MCO  then works with the beneficiary to develop a service plan that addresses  the beneficiary\u2019s needs and preferences, including determining the type  and amount of services the beneficiary needs. (See fig. 2.) For example,  for a beneficiary receiving care in the home, the MCO determines if  personal care services are needed and, if so, the amount of services,  such as the number of hours needed per week. The MCO is then  responsible for implementing this service plan and coordinating the  beneficiary\u2019s care.", "Although MCOs are responsible for coordinating MLTSS beneficiaries\u2019  care, states remain responsible for the operation of MLTSS programs and  must monitor the MCOs. State contracts establish MCO responsibilities  with respect to the services the MCO is responsible for providing, the  beneficiary protections that must be in place, and the information the  MCO must report to the state. States then monitor MCO actions for  compliance with contractual requirements. States may take compliance  actions if they find that MCOs are not complying with contractual  requirements and if they identify issues with MCOs\u2019 provision of care.

Among  the most commonly used authorities are section 1115 demonstrations  and section 1915(b) waivers. Before approving an MLTSS program, CMS  works with the state to shape the program design, including how the  program will align with CMS guidance. In 2013, CMS issued guidance  that set expectations for states seeking approval of MLTSS programs  through section 1115 demonstrations or section 1915(b) waivers. In  particular, CMS listed 10 key elements of effective MLTSS programs that  the agency expects states to incorporate into both new and existing  MLTSS programs. These elements address a range of topics, including  qualified providers (or network adequacy), participant protections  (including appeals and grievance processes and a critical incident  management system with safeguards to prevent abuse, neglect, and  exploitation), and quality (implementation of a comprehensive quality  strategy for MLTSS). For example, states must ensure that MCOs  maintain a network of qualified long-term services and supports providers  that is sufficient to provide adequate access to covered services;  establish safeguards to ensure beneficiary health and welfare; and  develop mandatory MCO reports on MLTSS quality of care performance  measures, analyze those reports, and take corrective actions if needed.  CMS\u2019s guidance noted that if a state incorporated these 10 elements it  would increase the likelihood of having high-quality MLTSS programs.  CMS uses these elements to review and approve states\u2019 MLTSS  programs.", "When CMS approves an MLTSS program under a section 1115  demonstration or section 1915 waiver, it establishes state-specific  requirements for the program and also specifies how it will oversee the  program on an ongoing basis. For example, CMS may require a state to  conduct specific MCO monitoring activities. In addition, CMS may require  a state to submit quarterly and annual performance reports to CMS.  These reports may address state-specific measures of quality and  access, including information on appeals and grievances. Within CMS,  oversight of MLTSS programs is a joint responsibility of the agency\u2019s  central and regional offices.", "In addition to state-specific requirements, states with MLTSS programs  are also subject to broader quality requirements that apply to all Medicaid  managed care programs. For example, states must have an external  quality review process to assess the quality of care MCOs provide to all  managed care beneficiaries, including MLTSS beneficiaries. States may  use an external quality review organization (EQRO)\u2014an independent  organization specializing in external quality reviews\u2014to conduct several  required external quality review activities, and must use an EQRO for an  annual quality review. States must also have a quality strategy for  MLTSS programs that includes, for example, a discussion of performance  measures, performance improvement projects, and state quality oversight  plans. Changes to requirements for states regarding Medicaid managed  care quality are slated to take effect in July 2017 or later, under CMS\u2019s  2016 Medicaid managed care final rule, which was the first major change  to Medicaid managed care regulations since 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Appeals and Grievance Processes", "paragraphs": ["The beneficiary appeals and grievance processes are important  beneficiary protections for MLTSS programs.

A beneficiary can file an appeal in response to an MCO\u2019s  decision to, among other things, reduce services, terminate services, or  deny payment for services. For example, a beneficiary could appeal an  MCO\u2019s decision to deny coverage for a specific type of MLTSS care, such  as personal care services, or to reduce the number of personal care  attendant hours a beneficiary will receive. After the beneficiary submits an  appeal, the MCO will either approve the appeal (meaning that the MCO,  through its internal appeals process, overturns its original decision and  resolves the appeal in favor of the beneficiary), or deny the appeal  (meaning that the MCO upholds its original decision). If an MCO denies  the appeal, the beneficiary can request that the state review the MCO\u2019s  decision through the state\u2019s fair hearing process, in which state officials  rule on whether the MCO\u2019s decision should be upheld.", "Grievances. A beneficiary can file a grievance with an MCO to express  dissatisfaction about any matter not covered by appeals. For example, a  beneficiary could file a grievance about difficulty getting an appointment  with an MLTSS provider, concerns about the quality of MLTSS care, a  provider or MCO not respecting a beneficiary\u2019s rights, or a provider not  treating the beneficiary respectfully. Beneficiaries may also submit  grievances directly to the state, in a manner determined by the state,  such as to the state Medicaid agency or state long-term care  ombudsman.

In some cases, these oversight methods were specific to  MLTSS programs, while in other cases the methods addressed MLTSS  as well as other state managed care programs. Examples of state  oversight methods included the following:  External quality reviews: All six states implemented the external quality  reviews that CMS requires, which involves assessments of MCOs\u2019  compliance with requirements related to quality, and validating MCO  performance measures and performance improvement projects. In each  of these states, the state\u2019s EQRO assessed MCO compliance with quality  requirements and reported to the state on their findings.

These included steps to improve performance on  measures such as the rates of potentially preventable hospital  admissions and emergency department visits.", "The Delaware EQRO assessed aspects of quality and access across  the two MCOs that operated both MLTSS and non-MLTSS services.  The EQRO\u2019s 2014 report to the state reported, for example, that both  plans were compliant with Medicaid managed care regulations  regarding quality assessment and performance improvement, but that  they could improve in managing the grievance and appeals process,  and ensuring appropriate resolution and communication with  beneficiaries and providers.", "In addition to required EQRO reviews, five of the six states reported that  they had their EQROs conduct other quality oversight activities. For  example, Delaware\u2019s EQRO took part in a task force that provides a  forum for sharing best practices, and identifies and implements quality  improvement strategies. Tennessee contracted with its EQRO to prepare  an annual report on national initiatives that may affect managed care, and  conduct educational meetings for state quality staff and MCOs.", "Use of MCO performance measures and beneficiary surveys: All six  states tracked performance measures, which varied by state, but included  measures such as rates of hospitalization, timely MCO response to  beneficiary grievances, and the proportion of beneficiaries receiving  certain services. For example, Texas tracked the proportion of grievances  that were resolved within certain time frames, and Kansas tracked the  proportion of beneficiaries receiving HCBS care who received a flu  vaccine. The states also used beneficiary surveys to help monitor MLTSS  care. For example, one state\u2019s survey asked beneficiaries about their  satisfaction with and ability to access services. States generally used  surveys that were designed by the state or by their EQRO. The states  used established surveys, or incorporated questions from established  surveys, such as the National Core Indicators\u2013Aging and Disability survey  and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers & Systems in  their surveys.", "Reviews of beneficiary information such as medical charts or case  files: Five of the six states reported that they had efforts to review or  audit MLTSS beneficiary information, such as medical charts, case files,  or other information, to identify potential issues with MLTSS care. The  frequency of their efforts ranged from quarterly to once every 3 years. For  example, Arizona conducted medical chart reviews at least every 3 years,  reviewing a sample of charts for MCO compliance with case management  requirements in areas such as timeliness, assessments of care, and the  services provided to beneficiaries. Delaware conducted quarterly on-site  reviews, which included reviews of beneficiaries\u2019 case files, level of care  assessments, and each MCO\u2019s critical incident management system, to  ensure that beneficiaries were receiving necessary services and that  MCOs were complying with requirements regarding MLTSS care.", "Reviews of provider networks: Officials in all six states reported  conducting their own assessments of MLTSS provider networks or  requiring MCOs to report on their MLTSS provider networks. Kansas,  for example, conducted provider network adequacy assessments and  annual audits about access. Minnesota, every 2 years, surveys  geographic areas to identify provider gaps, and assesses provider  networks and providers\u2019 ability to deliver services; it shares information on  any identified provider gaps with its MCOs. Arizona required MCOs to  submit an annual plan about provider network development, including  information on any network gaps, and to report any changes in networks  which would affect more than five percent of beneficiaries within one  geographic service area.", "Stakeholder meetings: Officials in all six states told us that they met with  stakeholders, such as state long-term care ombudsmen, beneficiary  advocates, or providers, on a regular basis to discuss beneficiaries\u2019  experiences with MLTSS care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Varied in the Extent to Which They Used Appeals and Grievances to Monitor Beneficiaries\u2019 Concerns about MLTSS Access and Quality", "paragraphs": ["The six states we reviewed varied in the extent to which\u2014and how\u2014they  used appeals and grievance data to monitor beneficiaries\u2019 concerns about  quality and access in their MLTSS programs.

In  these two states, MCOs that provide MLTSS also provide non-MLTSS  services, such as acute care. While both states collected and used data  on managed care appeals and grievances, they did not require MCOs to  report MLTSS appeals and grievances separately from those for other  managed care services and beneficiaries, or in a way that allowed the  states to identify all MLTSS-specific appeals and grievances. In the  other four states\u2014Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, and Tennessee\u2014the  MCOs reported MLTSS appeals and grievances separately from appeals  and grievances related to other managed care services and  beneficiaries. Within these four states, monitoring practices varied.  Officials in one of these four states, for example, reviewed monthly  reports on MLTSS appeals. They said appeals data helped them  understand what was happening with beneficiaries on a regular basis,  identify any systemic patterns in appeals, and take action if needed. They  also noted that, as one way of measuring access to care, they review  appeals and grievance data for any beneficiary complaints about not  having access to providers. In Kansas, officials said that they regularly  reviewed appeals and grievances separately for all beneficiaries receiving  HCBS; they reviewed appeals and grievances for beneficiaries receiving  MLTSS care in a nursing facility as part of their review of the state\u2019s  broader managed care population.", "Calculating appeals and grievances rates: Three states\u2014Kansas,  Minnesota, and Tennessee\u2014calculated rates of MLTSS appeals and  grievances as a proportion of beneficiary enrollment, so that they could  track patterns or changes in appeals and grievances independent of  changes in enrollment, while one state, Delaware, calculated a rate of  grievances as a proportion of beneficiary enrollment but did not calculate  a rate of appeals. Officials in one of these states told us that calculating  rates\u2014rather than by looking only at the numbers of appeals and  grievances\u2014allowed more meaningful comparisons of appeals and  grievances across MCOs. Officials in this state provided an example of  when the state took an action based on appeals rates. The state identified  that one MCO had a significantly higher appeals rate than other MCOs,  and as a result, put a temporary moratorium on the MCO\u2019s  implementation of reductions in or terminations of certain services. The  state examined the reasons for the high appeals rate\u2014which involved the  MCO\u2019s process for managing beneficiaries\u2019 use of services\u2014and lifted  the moratorium after the MCO addressed the issues. After the state lifted  the moratorium, the MCO\u2019s appeal rate dropped to a rate similar to that of  the other two MCOs. The remaining two states, Arizona and Texas, did  not calculate rates of appeals and grievances based on beneficiary  enrollment.", "We analyzed grievance rates in one state and found that one MCO\u2014 identified as MCO B in figure 3\u2014consistently had a lower number of  grievances than other MCOs in the state. However, when grievances  were calculated as a proportion of enrollees, MCO B\u2014which had fewer  enrollees than other MCOs\u2014had a higher grievance rate than most other  MCOs. See figure 3 for an illustration of the difference in grievance  numbers and grievance rates for two of the MCOs in this state.", "Using categories of appeals and grievances: The six states varied in  the extent to which\u2014and how\u2014they used categories of appeals or  grievances to identify beneficiary concerns about specific types of  services or access to care issues. States can request that MCOs report  beneficiary appeals and grievances in categories based on the type of  beneficiary concern. For example, a beneficiary appeal about a reduction  in private duty nursing service hours could be categorized as being  related to that particular type of service, and a grievance about late  transportation services that caused the beneficiary to miss an  appointment could be categorized as being related to transportation  services. State officials told us that using categories can help them  identify patterns or changes in appeals and grievances, and highlight  areas where the state could take action to address beneficiary concerns.

In the two remaining states, each state was  able to review appeals decisions directly and so did not rely on MCOs to  categorize appeals.", "Examples of Appeals and Grievances  Categories  Minnesota had managed care organizations  (MCO) categorize appeals and grievances by  setting of care, type of service, and the type of  issue the beneficiary raised. For example,  regarding the types of issues MCOs could  report:", "Appeals categories included services and  benefits; failure to provide services within  contractual timelines; and billing and  financial issues, among others. coordination of care; and technical  competence and appropriateness, among  others. quality of care, quality of service, and case management. State  officials said they regularly review MCOs\u2019 grievance data and evaluate  the grievance categories, working to refine the categories to make  them as useful as possible. For example, they evaluate MCOs\u2019  explanations for grievances they categorized as an \u201cother\u201d type of  grievance (as opposed to a specific category), in order to identify new  types of beneficiary concerns.", "Arizona used several categories of grievances, such as access to  care, medical services provision, and transportation. State officials  provided an example of how they adjusted categories to reflect  emerging areas of concern. They explained that transportation  services, which enable MLTSS beneficiaries and other beneficiaries to  access care, had the highest number of grievances. As a result, the  state required MCOs to work more closely with transportation  providers. In addition, the state refined its grievance categories to  better track specific types of transportation concerns, such as the  timeliness of pick up, unsafe driving, and missed or late appointments.", "Monitoring appeals outcomes: The six states varied in the extent to  which they monitored whether the appeals that MLTSS beneficiaries filed  were ultimately approved or denied by MCOs\u2014that is, whether MCOs  reversed their initial decisions to reduce or terminate services or to deny  coverage for MLTSS care. Officials from one state said that data on  appeals outcomes, particularly decisions where the MCO reversed its initial decision, are as important as the data on the appeals themselves.  They noted that if MCOs often reverse their decisions, it indicates a  problem with beneficiaries being put through appeals unnecessarily. Four  states\u2014Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, and Tennessee\u2014monitored the  outcomes of MLTSS appeals. Arizona monitored the outcomes of appeals  for its managed care programs generally, though its appeals outcome  data did not distinguish all MLTSS-related appeals from other types of  appeals. Finally, one state\u2014Texas\u2014had not previously required MCOs to  report information about appeals outcomes, but began requiring MCOs to  do so during the course of this study, starting in September 2016.", "Two of the six states\u2019 Medicaid agencies\u2014in Delaware and Tennessee\u2014 were actively involved in determining appeals outcomes. In Delaware,  nursing staff with the state Medicaid agency reviewed each appeal and  represented the state as a voting member on MCO panels for appeals  decisions. In Tennessee, the state directly receives and processes all  appeals and shares them with the MCO, which then reconsiders its  original decision. If the MCO upholds its decision, the state completes its  own review and determines whether to uphold or overturn the MCO\u2019s  decision. Officials from both states said state involvement helped the  state identify trends in appeals and address issues, and Delaware  officials believed that their involvement was facilitated by the relatively  small size of the state. In the remaining four states\u2014Arizona, Kansas,  Minnesota, and Texas\u2014appeals outcomes were decided by MCOs  without state involvement, though beneficiaries in all states had the right  to request a state fair hearing, which could overturn the MCO\u2019s decision.", "States varied in the extent to which appeals resulted in MCOs\u2019 decisions  being upheld or reversed. In the two states where the state Medicaid  agency was actively involved in the appeals process, a greater share of  beneficiary appeals were resolved in favor of the beneficiary\u2014in other  words, a greater share of MCOs\u2019 initial decisions were overturned\u2014than  in the other states.

States identified issues through their MCO  monitoring efforts and other means. States took various actions to resolve  those issues, ranging from warning letters or notices to MCOs to financial  penalties. For example, in Delaware, the state Medicaid agency issued a  formal notice to an MCO about deficiencies the state identified in its  quarterly reviews of beneficiaries\u2019 medical charts. Delaware found  deficiencies with respect to beneficiary contact with behavioral health  providers, and difficulty in scheduling timely coordination of care  meetings. Arizona assessed financial penalties in response to an MCO\u2019s  failure to coordinate medically necessary transportation. The state  identified the issue through hundreds of beneficiary grievances related to  transportation services, which the state tracked to a transportation  provider that served MLTSS and other beneficiaries. The prevalence of  compliance actions varied across our selected states; some states, for  example, reported over 20 instances in which they required MCOs to  submit corrective action plans to address issues that affected MLTSS  beneficiaries, while other states reported using few corrective action plans  from 2013 through 2015."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Oversight Relied Primarily on State Reporting, but Selected States Were Not Always Required to Report Key Information on MLTSS Access and Quality Needed for CMS Oversight", "paragraphs": ["CMS generally depends on quarterly and annual reporting requirements  as stipulated in states\u2019 special terms and conditions as a framework to  monitor access and quality in their MLTSS programs. CMS\u2019s reporting  requirements are customized for each state, and as such, the content and  specificity of reports can vary by state. CMS officials told us that as state  reports are received, the central and regional office staff reviews them for  compliance with federal regulations and the state\u2019s particular reporting  requirements. Agency officials explained that after reviewing the state  reports, regional office staff can contact state Medicaid officials as  necessary with questions or concerns. CMS officials indicated that all six  of our selected states were compliant with their reporting requirements,  and that the agency did not request additional reports from the states  from 2013 through 2015. Also, all of our selected states were required to  have meetings with CMS at varying intervals, depending on the state. The  frequency of these meetings was determined when CMS approved the  states\u2019 special terms and conditions, and ranged from bimonthly to  quarterly.", "While CMS has specified certain parameters for state oversight of  MLTSS, the agency did not always require the six selected states to  report the information needed to monitor this oversight. CMS\u2019s 2013  guidance for MLTSS programs highlights the 10 elements that it deems  essential for developing and maintaining high-quality programs, which  CMS uses when reviewing or approving state MLTSS programs. In  particular, this guidance establishes key elements to ensure access and  quality, including qualified providers (which includes an adequate network  of qualified providers), participant protections (which includes appeals  and grievance processes and reporting of critical incidents), and quality.  Further, CMS\u2019s guidance says that states should provide reports to CMS  to demonstrate their oversight of these elements. In addition, federal  internal control standards stipulate that agencies conduct monitoring and  evaluation activities. In our review of the reporting required of our  selected states, however, we found that CMS did not require all states to  report on certain areas related to those key elements\u2014namely network  adequacy, that is, the sufficiency in the number and types of long-term  care providers serving beneficiaries in the managed care plans; critical  incidents, which are events or situations that cause or may cause harm to  a beneficiary\u2019s health or welfare, such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation;   and appeals and grievances. As a result, we found cases where state  reporting did not allow CMS to assess state adherence with federal  guidance and oversight of MLTSS access and quality.", "Network adequacy. CMS did not require three of our six selected  states\u2014Arizona, Minnesota, and Tennessee\u2014to regularly report  information on network adequacy, but it did require Delaware,  Kansas, and Texas to report such information. As part of states\u2019  oversight responsibilities of MCOs, CMS requires states to ensure  that MCOs maintain a network of providers that is sufficient to provide  adequate access to all covered services, and includes network  adequacy as 1 of the 10 elements it uses to review, approve and  renew MLTSS waivers. CMS regulations direct MCOs to submit  assurances of network adequacy to the state. However, CMS  currently does not require that states report this information to the  agency unless it is stipulated in the state\u2019s reporting requirements, or  if CMS requests it. CMS officials said that the agency can request  network adequacy information from the states, even though it may not  be part of the reporting requirements in the states\u2019 special terms and  conditions. Given that in recent years CMS has not requested that any  of our selected states provide additional information, including  network adequacy assurances, the agency may miss potential  network adequacy issues in states where there are no specific  reporting requirements. Without ongoing monitoring of network  adequacy, CMS may not be able identify when enrollment or other  trends begin to erode beneficiary access to MLTSS.", "Critical incidents reports. CMS required three of our six states\u2014 Delaware, Kansas, and Minnesota\u2014to submit analyses or summaries  of their MCOs\u2019 critical incidents reports, but did not require the other  three states\u2014Arizona, Tennessee, and Texas\u2014to do so. Even though  Delaware was required to submit information on critical incidents, in  our review of two of the state\u2019s 2015 quarterly reports, we did not find  summaries or data on critical incidents. In addition, Delaware\u2019s annual  report did not provide any information on critical incidents in the state,  but described how the state collects and tracks critical incidents and  their outcomes on a monthly basis. This gap in Delaware\u2019s reporting,  and the lack of a requirement to report in Arizona, Tennessee, and  Texas, means that CMS cannot directly monitor the degree to which  critical incidents are occurring in these states or how the states are  tracking and resolving incidents that involve reports of abuse, neglect,  or exploitation of vulnerable beneficiaries.", "Appeals and grievances. CMS required all states to report  information on complaints or problems reported by consumers, of  which appeals and grievances are an important part. However, the  level of detail CMS required from each state varied. For example,  CMS\u2019s reporting requirements for Delaware, Kansas, and Minnesota  specifically included a request for MCO appeals and grievance reports  with outcomes or overturn rates, which represent the extent that  MCOs reverse their decisions to deny certain services, and which can  indicate potential access problems. However, for the other states,  Arizona, Texas, and Tennessee, CMS only requires that they report a  summary of the types of complaints or grievances that consumers  identified about the program in a quarter, including any trends,  resolutions of complaints or grievances, and any actions taken or  planned to prevent other occurrences. In addition, CMS included  language in Texas that required the state to report on appeals, but not  necessarily appeals outcomes. A lack of specificity in the reporting  requirements may result in CMS not receiving necessary information  on beneficiary appeals and grievances. For example, CMS\u2019s use of  such a broad reporting requirement yielded the following reporting  responses from the three states:", "Arizona provided appeals and grievance summaries for two  specific programs, but not for the MLTSS population as whole.  CMS officials acknowledged that the grievance and appeals data  included in Arizona\u2019s quarterly and annual reports were only for  those two programs, which aligned with reporting requirements in  the state\u2019s special terms and conditions.

Even though the rates of appeals or grievances were  available in four of our selected states, CMS did not require any of the  states to report them. Furthermore, without requiring states to report  readily available information on the rates of appeals and grievances  and appeals outcomes, CMS may not be able to identify trends in  consumer complaints and denied appeals in a timely manner, and  may not be able to identify MCOs that may be inappropriately  reducing or denying services.", "Example of One State\u2019s Reporting  Requirements on Events That May Affect  Access to Care   Events occurring during the quarter or  anticipated to occur in the near future that  affect health care delivery, including but not  limited to: systems and reporting issues,  approval and contracting with new plans;  benefits; enrollment; grievances; proposed or  implemented  changes; quality  of care; changes in provider qualification  standards; access; proposed changes to  payment rates; health plan financial  performance and the implementation of  managed long-term services and supports,  that is relevant to the demonstration; pertinent  legislative activity; and other operational  issues.", "We also found cases where CMS\u2019s reporting requirements lacked detail,  which may have limited the usefulness of the information states provided  in certain sections of their reports. Although CMS required all of our  selected states to report on \u201cevents that may affect access to care\u201d (see  sidebar), as well as quality assurance efforts, the requirements were  broadly written, and as such, they may not garner the information needed  for CMS to monitor access and quality. For example, CMS used the  same, or similar, statement to indicate that all states should report on  quality assurance efforts: \u201cIdentify any quality assurance and monitoring  activities in the quarter.\u201d In response to this, we found that four states  reported general descriptions of their planned and ongoing quality  assurance activities for MLTSS or their comprehensive managed care  programs as a whole, and often repeated the same or similar information  in subsequent quarterly reports. For example, in Minnesota\u2019s quarterly  reports, the state provided little information about its quality assurance  efforts other than a description of how the state has a team that meets  twice a year to review and analyze performance measure and  remediation data. Furthermore, the same information is repeated in  multiple quarterly reports.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services\u2019 (CMS) Onsite Review of  KanCare.  In response to hundreds of complaints from  beneficiaries, providers, and advocates voiced  directly to CMS between late 2015 and mid- 2016, in October 2016, the agency conducted  a detailed, on-site review of KanCare,  Kansas\u2019s comprehensive managed care  program that includes managed long-term  services and supports (MLTSS). For this  review, CMS requested documentation from  the state beyond what the state is required to  report\u2014such as managed care organization  (MCO) oversight policies and procedures. The  agency also reviewed information on specific  complaints, and met with state officials in  multiple state agencies to discuss overarching  concerns and to remediate individual  complaints.  As a result of this review, CMS found  systemic, longstanding program deficiencies  in Kansas\u2019s state oversight that it had not  previously identified from the information  obtained through the state\u2019s required  reporting. Specifically, CMS found that the  Kansas state agency was substantively out of  compliance with federal statutes and  regulations as well as with its approved state  plan, and that this noncompliance \u201cplaced the  health, welfare, and safety of KanCare  beneficiaries at risk and required immediate  action.\u201d CMS also found that Kansas\u2019s state  agency\u2019s oversight of its MCOs had  diminished since the beginning of its  operation, that it did not seem to be analyzing  access to care reports, and that it did not have  a comprehensive system for reporting and  tracking critical incidents, among other issues.  As of July 2017, Kansas was implementing a  corrective action plan to address these issues. external quality review, CMS does not have one consistent approach for  monitoring MLTSS programs. Instead, CMS customizes its monitoring of  MLTSS to each state\u2019s program to accommodate the variability among  MLTSS programs. The customized approach to monitoring is reflected  in the quarterly and annual reporting requirements in the program\u2019s  special terms and conditions. When asked about differences in content  and specificity in reporting requirements for the same elements across  states, agency officials said that these differences could be partly due to  changes in the staff who write the reporting requirements. They also said  that terminology of requirements may evolve as state programs age with  later versions, reflecting more refined language. Also, states with more  recently approved programs may have requirements that reflect lessons  CMS staff has learned about the programs. However, any gaps in  reporting requirements, and gaps in state reporting from what CMS has  required, may mean that CMS does not always have the data to monitor  key aspects of MLTSS access and quality among selected states and  may be unable to reliably detect state or MCO practices that do not meet  CMS\u2019s guidance. See sidebar for an example of how oversight of access  and quality is diminished when CMS does not obtain necessary  information.", "The new 2016 managed care final rule will require states to report  annually on their managed care programs, beginning one year following  the release of new CMS guidance. The managed care rule specifies that  annual reports must include, among other things: appeals, grievances,  and state fair hearings; access and availability of services; MCO  performance on quality measures; and results of any corrective action  plans, sanctions, or other actions taken by the states. At the time of our  review, the specific requirements were not yet known, including whether  states would need to address MLTSS programs separately from  managed care programs for acute care services, which have different  networks of providers.

Although states\u2019 increasing  use of MLTSS can yield benefits for improved access to quality care, it  also heightens the importance of federal and state oversight, which is  critical to ensure that the potentially vulnerable populations served by  these programs\u2014such as the elderly and adults with physical or  developmental disabilities\u2014are able to obtain the care they need, when  they need it. States rely on MCOs to coordinate MLTSS care, but remain  responsible for monitoring beneficiaries\u2019 access to and quality of care.  Along with the states, CMS plays an important role in establishing  requirements for MLTSS programs and overseeing states\u2019 programs. To  monitor MLTSS programs, CMS relies in large part on states\u2019 reports on  different aspects of their programs.
