CBP documents reviewed include ACE deployment schedules,  acquisition decision memos, remediation plans, cost estimates, and a  staff post mortem report on the ACE acquisition process. We also  interviewed officials from CBP and five partner agencies regarding the  ACE acquisition process since 2013: the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of  Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),  the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and  the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). We  selected these five agencies on the basis of their size (to include both  large and small agencies), the degree to which they require  documentation for clearing or licensing cargo, and recommendations from  officials of CBP and the Department of the Treasury regarding agencies  that would provide a range of experience in transitioning to ACE. We also  reviewed prior GAO reports on ACE acquisition. While ACE is designed  to permit management of both exports and imports, we focused on the  implementation of ACE capabilities to manage imports, because CBP\u2019s  efforts to complete and improve ACE functionality are currently focused  primarily on import trade.", "To examine other agencies\u2019 progress in accessing and using ACE data,  we obtained summary information on ACE usage for CBP\u2019s 49 partner  agencies, including information such as whether an agency had a  memorandum of understanding with CBP regarding ACE access, whether  it accessed trade data through ACE data and how it did so. While we  collected information on all 49 partner agencies, we focused our analysis on the 22 partner agencies that CBP identified as requiring  documentation for clearing or licensing cargo for import or export. To  collect this information, we identified and reviewed Federal Register  notices posted by the agencies. We obtained documentation on agency  participation in ACE from CBP officials and from the Department of the  Treasury. We also discussed the documentation and our descriptions  with CBP officials and partner agency officials. To understand how the  five selected agencies used ACE, we conducted case studies that  included reviewing CBP user guidance documents and documents from  the respective agencies on their transitions and interviewing agency  officials in Washington, D.C., and at the ports of New York and Newark.", "To examine available information about actual and potential cost savings  and enforcement benefits from using ACE, we obtained information on  efforts by CBP, partner agencies, and companies involved in international  trade to identify and measure efficiency gains and potential cost savings.  The CBP documents we reviewed included listings and definitions of  metrics for determining efficiency gains and CBP\u2019s method for using  those to calculate potential cost savings, and also documentation of  CBP\u2019s process for determining the reliability of the data and measures. In  addition, we reviewed a 2015 report on CBP\u2019s ACE metrics by the DHS  Office of the Inspector General, which recommended that CBP strengthen  its metrics; the Inspector General subsequently closed those  recommendations as implemented. On the basis of our review of the  available information, we determined that CBP\u2019s metrics were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of conveying the estimated value of these  efficiency gains. To understand earlier CBP estimates of potential cost  savings from ACE, we reviewed a cost-benefit analysis conducted and  revised by CBP during 2002-2004. We also reviewed a more recent cost  benefit analysis conducted by FDA. In addition, we interviewed officials at  CBP and the 5 case study partner agencies regarding information on  potential cost savings and other benefits from ACE, including officials in  CBP\u2019s Office of Enforcement who discussed challenges with developing  metrics to measure enforcement benefits. In addition, to obtain  information on observed and potentials benefits and cost savings of ACE  to importers and exporters, and related companies, we interviewed  representatives of these companies. We also obtained information from  CBP regarding their preparations to assess the benefits of enhancements  to ACE after core ACE capabilities are completed. We interviewed CBP  and agency officials in Washington, D.C., and at the ports of New York,  N.Y., and Newark, N.J., concerning benefits and challenges associated  with using ACE. We selected these ports because they allowed us to  interview CBP officials charged with processing a large volume of diverse  imported goods, representing both air and sea cargo. These ports also  afforded an opportunity to interview field staff representing four of our five  case-study agencies (APHIS, CPSC, FDA, and FWS). We also discussed  these issues with CBP officials with the agency\u2019s Center for Commercial  Targeting and Analysis, each of CBP\u2019s five National Targeting and  Analysis Groups, and six of the agency\u2019s 10 Centers of Excellence and  Expertise (national-level CBP units responsible for processing imported  goods associated with designated industry sectors), which we  judgmentally selected. We also discussed these issues with 16 trade  community representatives\u2014that is, representatives of companies that  buy and sell internationally traded products as well as brokers and  shippers that work for and with these companies\u2014some of whom  participate in organizations that advise CBP regarding its operations.  These 16 representatives included members of the Trade Support  Network, a private sector group created to provide input to CBP on its  business processes, including ACE; the Commercial Customs Operations  Advisory Committee, a private sector group created to advise the  Departments of the Treasury and Homeland Security on CBP\u2019s  commercial operations; and the National Customs Brokers and Freight  Forwarders Association.", "To analyze the approach that will be used to manage ACE after core  capabilities have been completed, we obtained information on CBP  processes to identify, evaluate, and operationalize changes to enhance  ACE.
