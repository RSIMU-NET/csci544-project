However, the Bureau did depart from the traditional day and location for the release of the Income and Poverty Estimates report in 2003 and subsequent years. According to the Bureau, the day of the 2003 release was changed because of a delay in producing a companion report, and the location was changed from Washington, D.C., to Suitland, Maryland, in part, because the Director of the Census Bureau stated that he wanted to raise awareness that the construction of its new headquarters had just started. Some of the Bureau's documented practices, such as guidance on who has authority to choose the release date and location, lacked specificity. Also, the Bureau's documented Income and Poverty practices are outdated as they are contained in a 21-year-old memo. The Bureau is updating it, to among other things, reflect current technology. Most of the 14 statistical agencies in GAO's review generally adhered to NRC's guidance, important for (1) the wide dissemination of data, and (2) maintaining a strong position of independence. Still, there were some notable gaps. For example, 6 of the 14 agencies lacked dissemination policies (as recommended by NRC) that promote the regular and frequent release of major findings from an agency's statistical program. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in concert with other statistical agencies, is developing governmentwide guidance on the release and dissemination of statistical products that, according to OMB officials, parallels NRC's and other generally accepted release practices.

OMB expects to issue the directive  for public comment in the spring of 2006.", "To the extent OMB\u2019s dissemination directive appropriately addresses the  principles underlying NRC\u2019s guidance and Statistical Policy Directive  Number 3, the directive could enhance the quality and credibility of  federal statistical data, in part, by replacing the patchwork of agency- specific guidance with a more transparent, commonly accepted, and  consistently applied framework for disseminating data. For example,  OMB\u2019s directive could help promote more consistent adherence to key  data release practices such as the wide dissemination of data and  maintaining an agency\u2019s independent position.", "As noted in the previous section, the dissemination procedures at several  statistical agencies we examined lacked elements important for these  practices, including (1) authority to release statistical information without  prior clearance by department policy officials, (2) data dissemination  policies that foster the frequent release of major findings from an agency\u2019s  statistical programs, and (3) an established publications policy that  describes the types of reports and other data releases to be made  available. As a result, their data products could be better protected, with  the directive, from the appearance of, or actual political involvement.  More specifically, OMB\u2019s new directive could address how best to address  the gaps that exist between agencies\u2019 data dissemination practices on the  one hand, and NRC\u2019s guidance on the other.", "As OMB moves forward with its new directive, our interviews with OMB  and statistical agency officials, as well as our past work on data quality  guidance and internal control standards, identified the following questions  that will be important for OMB\u2019s dissemination directive to consider:  Coverage: What will be covered by the directive?\u2014principal statistical  agencies only?\u2014the statistical functions of all agencies?\u2014or only  statistical products? It will be important for OMB\u2019s directive to clearly  define what it does and does not cover so that both statistical agencies and  their parent organizations share the same understanding of their  respective authorities, and help ensure dissemination procedures are  consistently implemented. Certain roles, responsibilities, and processes  need to be clarified as well. Indeed, officials at two statistical agencies we  spoke with said there is ambiguity as to whether a statistical press release  is a statistical product and if so, whether statistical agencies can issue  them with or without first getting releases cleared at the departmental  level. Additionally, OMB has issued a number of guidelines, directives, and  standards on federal statistics. Are there any gaps and overlaps among  them, and can they be better integrated?", "Documentation: To what extent, and how, should agencies document  their data dissemination procedures and policies, and how often should  they be reviewed and updated? The agencies we examined did not always  document their processes for disseminating statistical data, relying instead  on professional practice. However, as NRC points out: \u201cAlthough a long- standing culture of data quality contributes to professional practice, an  agency should also seek to develop and document standards through an  explicit process.\u201d", "Moreover, documented guidance would lend more transparency to the  data dissemination process, and thus provide a basis for agencies to  explain their dissemination decisions to policy makers, news media, and  the public. Indeed, an OMB official told us that Statistical Policy Directive  Number 3 is a useful tool for explaining to high level policy officials the  procedures agencies must follow to maintain the integrity of the data, and  why the officials may not access principal economic data before it is  released to the public nor comment on it until after its release.  Documented guidance could also help ensure continuity in the face of  employee turnover.", "The importance of documenting agencies\u2019 data dissemination practices  can be seen in the Bureau\u2019s experience in releasing data from the 2000  Census on the homeless and others without conventional housing, when  the Bureau was criticized for shifting its position on reporting components  of this population. In our 2003 report, we noted that although the Bureau\u2019s  decision stemmed from its concerns over the reliability of the underlying  data, the Bureau\u2019s lack of documented, clear, transparent, and consistently  applied guidance governing the release of data from the 2000 Census  hampered the Bureau in explaining its actions. Had such guidance been in  place, it could have helped the Bureau be more accountable and  consistent in its dealings with the public, and helped to ensure that the  Bureau\u2019s decisions both were, and appeared to be, totally objective.", "Flexibility: How much leeway should agencies have in implementing  OMB\u2019s directive? Agency officials we spoke with noted the different  missions of the various statistical agencies and cautioned against a one- size-fits-all approach. As a result, it might not be practical to require all  agencies to meet predetermined release dates because it could lead to  additional workload burdens and staffing issues.", "Monitoring: How will OMB ensure agencies comply with its directive?  Indeed, the effectiveness of the policies and procedures laid out in OMB\u2019s  directive will rest in large part on the extent to which agencies and their  parent departments adhere to them. Related questions include whether  there should be a regular assessment of agencies\u2019 compliance, and if so,  how often should it occur, and whether this should be done by OMB, or by  the agencies through a self-assessment.", "Posting Data: Should agencies\u2019 dissemination policies include written  guidance for releasing information via specific channels? Indeed, although  NRC\u2019s guidance calls on agencies to disseminate data using a variety of  outlets so that the information reaches as wide an audience as possible,  should agencies also have a standard set of conduits where the public will  know an agency\u2019s data will always be available? Such conduits might  include, among others, an agency\u2019s Web site. Because all of an agency\u2019s  data products would be, at a minimum, available from a central point of  access, it could help strengthen an agency\u2019s credibility because the public  would always know where to find it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A key lesson learned from the Bureau\u2019s experience is the importance of  fully documented, specific practices for maintaining the integrity of data  products, and by extension, the credibility of the agencies that release  them. Thus, as the Bureau updates its practices for releasing the Income  and Poverty Estimates, it will be important for the Bureau to more  thoroughly document its dissemination procedures so they are clear to the  public.", "Further, OMB\u2019s efforts to develop governmentwide guidance on data  dissemination is a positive step toward enhancing the credibility of federal  statistical data, especially to the extent the directive mirrors NRC\u2019s  guidance and Statistical Policy Directive Number 3, as it would replace  each statistical agency\u2019s procedures with a more transparent, commonly  accepted, and consistently applied framework for disseminating  information. As OMB works to complete its directive, it will be important  for it to pay particular attention to those elements dealing with the wide  dissemination of data and maintaining a strong position of independence  that, our survey of statistical agencies suggests can be adhered to by a  greater number of agencies.

These  areas include the extent to which agencies should have (1) full authority to  release statistical information without prior clearance by their respective  departments, (2) data dissemination policies that foster the frequent  release of major findings from agency\u2019s statistical programs, and (3) an  established publications policy describing the types of reports and other  releases an agency has available.", "We are also recommending that the Director of OMB direct his agency to  include in its directive additional elements and characteristics important  for agencies\u2019 data dissemination practices, including (1) clear definitions  of what is, and what is not covered by the directive, (2) the extent to  which agencies should document their data dissemination guidance and  how often the guidance should be reviewed, (3) the amount of flexibility  agencies have in implementing OMB\u2019s guidance, (4) procedures for  monitoring agencies\u2019 adherence to its directive, and (5) the feasibility of  requiring agencies to distribute data products through a standard set of  channels as well as through other outlets as appropriate, so that the public  will always know at least one source it can turn to and obtain agency data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, Commerce neither agreed  nor disagreed with our recommendation for the Bureau to fully document  its key data dissemination practices for releasing the Income and Poverty  Estimates.
