For example, FPS has not identified performance measures for all of the Plan's strategies, has not included targets for the identified performance measures (e.g., a desired target for the \u201cattrition rate\u201d measure), and has not linked the measures to FPS's human capital goals. GAO's work on measuring program performance has found that targets and linkages are among the attributes of successful performance measures. FPS and NPPD officials said they plan on developing measures with targets and linkages but have not yet established time frames for completing these tasks.

Through its  federal security workforce, FPS provides facility security services that  include law enforcement, security, and emergency response. Our prior  work found that FPS faces several workforce-related challenges, such as  managing and addressing its current and future workforce needs. To  address these and other challenges, we recommended, and Congress  directed, FPS to develop a strategic human capital plan to help agency  leaders effectively use its federal security workforce to carry out its  mission of protecting federal facilities. FPS issued a final Strategic Human  Capital Plan (the Plan) in February 2015. FPS also developed a staffing  model, which identified the number and composition of the federal  security workforce needed to meet its mission.", "A Senate Appropriations Committee report, which accompanied the  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015, included a  provision for us to evaluate the Plan. The committee also asked us to  evaluate FPS\u2019s staffing model. This report examines: (1) whether FPS\u2019s  Plan and related human capital planning efforts align with key strategic  workforce-planning principles and (2) how FPS designed and uses its  staffing model to help ensure that it has the workforce it needs to meet its  mission.", "To address both objectives, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations,  FPS and DHS documents, and our prior work related to workforce  planning and human capital management. We interviewed or obtained  information from officials at FPS headquarters and three selected  regions, NPPD, and the General Services Administration (GSA). To  examine whether FPS\u2019s Plan and related human capital planning efforts  align with key strategic workforce-planning principles, we reviewed and  assessed FPS\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Plan and related efforts against five key  strategic workforce-planning principles. We obtained these principles  from our 2003 report on key principles for effective strategic workforce  planning. We compared these principles with guidelines in the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework (HCAAF) that apply across federal agencies  and determined that the principles we developed are generally consistent  with OPM\u2019s guidelines. We did not assess the effectiveness of the Plan  because FPS is still in the process of implementing it. To assess the  design of FPS\u2019s staffing model, we reviewed FPS\u2019s August 2013 model  (the latest available) and interviewed FPS officials to better understand  the process they followed to design the model and how they collected  data used in the model. We evaluated FPS\u2019s design of the model using  standards for internal control in the federal government, guidance we  published in 2009 on assessing the reliability of computer-processed  data, and four key practices we identified on the design of staffing  models. We identified the key practices from our previous reports that  discussed staffing models, discussions with a physical security industry  association, and staff within our agency with workforce-planning  expertise. We also assessed the reliability of data FPS used in the  staffing model by reviewing available documentation, interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data, and examining data entries in the  model for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness. We could not  determine the reliability of data used in the model as FPS did not provide  us with documentation on steps taken to ensure data quality, which is a  key practice discussed more fully in the report. Finally, to examine how  FPS uses its staffing model, we reviewed FPS\u2019s staffing analysis  documents to understand FPS\u2019s staffing levels and interviewed FPS  headquarter officials. We evaluated FPS\u2019s use of the staffing model using  standards for internal control in the federal government and associated  guidance.

In  conducting its mission, the agency provides two types of activities: (1)  physical security and (2) law enforcement activities. As part of its physical  security activities, the FPS workforce conducts facility security  assessments, which consist of identifying and assessing threats to and  vulnerabilities of a facility, as well as identifying countermeasures (e.g.,  security equipment) best suited to secure the facility. The agency\u2019s law  enforcement activities include proactively patrolling facilities, responding  to incidents, and conducting criminal investigations, among other things.  (See app. II for a list of activities FPS performs).", "To carry out these activities in fiscal year 2015, FPS maintained a  workforce of 1,371 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at its headquarters and in  its 11 geographic regions (see fig. 1 below). FPS\u2019s Plan and staffing  model focus on this federal workforce. This workforce consists of 1,007  law enforcement staff (inspectors, criminal investigators, and special  agents) performing physical security and law enforcement activities and  364 non-law enforcement staff providing mission support. FPS also  manages and oversees approximately 13,500 PSOs (i.e., contract  guards) posted at federal facilities. These PSOs have responsibility for  controlling access to facilities; conducting screening at access points to  prevent the entry of prohibited items, such as weapons and explosives;  responding to emergency situations involving facility safety and security;  and performing other duties.", "FPS funds its operations by collecting security fees from federal agencies  that use FPS for facility protection. FPS collects a basic security fee of  $0.74 per square foot and an oversight fee to fund FPS for direct and  indirect costs associated with providing building- or agency-specific  security. The oversight fee is an additional 6 percent of the costs for  providing security services to a building or agency. FPS anticipates  collecting about $336.5 million in operating revenues from security fees  charged to federal agencies in fiscal year 2016.", "Over the years, we have reported on FPS\u2019s workforce-planning efforts  and challenges. For instance, in July 2009, we found that FPS faced  challenges with hiring and training new staff and did not have a strategic  human capital plan to guide its workforce-planning efforts. We  recommended that FPS take a strategic approach to managing its staffing  resources, including developing a human capital plan to better manage its  workforce needs. In October 2012, FPS implemented our  recommendation and issued an Interim Strategic Human Capital Plan. In  June 2010, we also identified several potential challenges that FPS may  face with obtaining the staffing needed to adequately protect federal  facilities, including funding challenges, difficulties in hiring inspectors, and  training backlogs.", "Since 2011, Congress has required FPS to submit a strategic human  capital plan that aligns fee collections to workforce requirements based  on current threat assessments. To meet this requirement, FPS tasked  DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development  Institute (SEDI) to analyze FPS\u2019s current organizational structure, position  allocations, and assignments of personnel to help prepare a strategic  human capital plan. In April 2012, SEDI developed a staffing model to  estimate the size and composition of the workforce FPS needs to meet its  facility protection mission. SEDI also helped develop FPS\u2019s Plan, which  identifies human capital strategies FPS intends to implement. The Plan  states that the strategies will help the agency hire and retain people with  the skills needed to carry out its mission.

FPS last  updated the staffing model in August 2013 and the Plan in February  2015.", "As FPS\u2019s parent organization, NPPD has responsibility for managing and  overseeing FPS\u2019s human capital efforts. For example, NPPD has  responsibility for recruiting and hiring FPS employees and providing  guidance on other human capital services, such as training. In August  2015, NPPD proposed restructuring its organization to improve its  management and operations. In December 2015, NPPD finalized a  Human Capital Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2020, which  identified the overarching human capital goals and objectives for all  NPPD component agencies, including FPS.

This input helped inform the Plan\u2019s  contents.", "FPS management and employees: FPS officials provided several  examples of how FPS senior executives and employees provided  input into the Plan. For example, the officials said that the senior  executives set the strategic direction for FPS\u2019s Plan and related  efforts. Furthermore, the senior executives meet regularly to discuss  broad human capital issues, such as actions the agency can take to  ensure that its workforce can address future needs. In addition, FPS  officials said that they administered surveys, held working groups, and  conducted interviews with their employees to identify specific human  capital issues, which helped shape the contents of the Plan. For  example, FPS established working groups to help develop employee  performance work plans. As discussed below, these performance  work plans identify critical core competencies and associated  performance standards for each position. These working groups  consisted of regional directors, area commanders, and other regional  staff. Furthermore, the Plan states that FPS intends to continue to  involve employees and obtain their feedback as the agency  implements the Plan.", "NPPD: NPPD is responsible for providing human capital services  (e.g., recruiting, hiring) on behalf of FPS. FPS obtained input from  NPPD when developing and implementing the Plan and its related  efforts. For example, FPS and NPPD officials explained that NPPD  officials participated in various working groups to develop strategies  identified in the Plan.", "External stakeholders: While FPS officials told us they did not directly  solicit input from any external stakeholder on the Plan, officials said  they solicit feedback from these stakeholders on FPS\u2019s services,  which they used to inform the contents of the Plan. FPS interacts with  a number of external stakeholders. For example, FPS is responsible  for protecting all GSA-held or leased facilities, making GSA a key  customer and important stakeholder. According to FPS officials, FPS  interacts with GSA to ensure a coordinated effort for the protection of  federal facilities. According to officials, FPS also works closely with  entities such as the U.S. Marshals Service and Administrative Office  of the U.S. Courts to provide coordinated protection at U.S.  courthouses and the Social Security Administration to understand the  threat environment and additional protection measures that can  mitigate incidents.

According to the Plan, the strategies will help FPS build and  sustain a workforce that can carry out its mission. For example, under the  talent management category and related recruiting and hiring strategies,  the Plan states that FPS intended to hire 109 employees in fiscal year  2015. The Plan also states that in addition to conducting recruitment  fairs, FPS intends to make its recruiting strategy more cost-effective by  leveraging internal and external partnerships to attract talent. Under the  training strategy, the Plan describes a training program, which identifies  courses that aim to equip FPS staff to assess, mitigate, and respond to  current and emerging threats to federal facilities.", "In addition, FPS officials provided examples of how they have tailored  their strategies to address identified gaps and needs. For instance, FPS  adjusted its training program based on the results of a preliminary  assessment that identified gaps in training, according to FPS officials.  Specifically, FPS developed leadership, physical security, contracting  officer representative, and security technology courses to fill identified  gaps in employee training. FPS officials told us that once they finalize and  implement the performance work plans and career and professional  development guide, they plan to determine whether they have agency- wide gaps in skills and competencies and further refine the training  program to address these gaps. Furthermore, as discussed in greater  detail later in this report, FPS considered adapting some of its human  capital planning decisions based on gaps and needs identified from the  staffing model and other management tools.

See figure 3. However, FPS did not identify measures for  strategies that fall under the other four broad categories, such as  leadership and knowledge management and building a results-oriented  performance culture. FPS officials told us that they did not identify  performance measures beyond those related to talent management in  part because they were waiting for NPPD to finalize a human capital plan  that would be applicable to FPS and that would contain measures for the  other categories. They also noted that, due to resource constraints, they  focused more on implementing strategies described in the Plan than on  developing additional performance measures.", "Furthermore, FPS did not identify targets for the performance measures  identified in the Plan. For example, the Plan identifies \u201cquality and  effectiveness of training\u201d and \u201cattrition rates\u201d as measures but FPS has  not identified associated targets for them. For example, FPS did not  identify a desired target for the \u201cattrition rate\u201d measure (e.g., reduce new  hires\u2019 attrition rate by 3 percentage points over fiscal years 2017 through  2020). In our prior work, we have found that successful performance  measures contain targets, which can help agency managers evaluate  progress by comparing actual results to projected performance.", "In addition, the Plan does not explicitly show how the performance  measures and associated strategies link to FPS\u2019s human capital goals.

For example, FPS began to collect data to help  identify appropriate targets and continues to work on this effort, according  to officials. Additionally, when developing the Plan, FPS developed a draft  document that shows the link between the identified performance  measures and the agency\u2019s human capital goals. For example, FPS  linked its \u201cattrition rate\u201d performance measure to the agency\u2019s third  human capital goal, which is to provide FPS with the tools, mechanisms,  and processes to improve workforce effectiveness, agility, and retention.", "After the completion of our audit work in February 2016, NPPD and FPS  officials provided us with NPPD\u2019s strategic human capital plan and  complementary operational plan, which NPPD finalized in December  2015 and January 2016, respectively. At this time, NPPD\u2019s plans do not  include performance measures specific to FPS. An NPPD official who  played a key role in developing this plan said that, in the future, an FPS  operational plan that is aligned with NPPD\u2019s human capital plan and  specifically reflects FPS\u2019s human capital needs and strategies will be  developed. Further, NPPD and FPS officials told us that they will work  together to develop human capital performance measures relevant to  FPS.

Establishing  performance measures before an agency starts to implement its  strategies can help agency officials evaluate the human capital plan. If  FPS and NPPD do not develop performance measures, including targets  and linkages to goals, in a timely manner, neither agency can accurately  assess FPS\u2019s progress in achieving its human capital goals or its agency  goal of sustaining a valued, skilled, and agile workforce or the contribution  of its strategies toward achieving these goals.

We  compared the design of this model to four key practices we identified for  the design of staffing models and found that FPS\u2019s model reflects three of  these four key practices (see table 2). Specifically, we found that FPS  designed its staffing model to include (1) work activities performed by  FPS employees and the frequency and number of hours it takes to  perform them; (2) risk factors that affect the agency\u2019s operational  activities, such as the security level and quantities of facilities; and (3)  input from key stakeholders. We found that while FPS officials took some  steps to ensure the quality of data used in the model, they did not  document a process for doing so.

Incorporating these  types of data into the staffing model helps estimate the number of  staff needed to carry out an agency\u2019s activities, according to a key  practice we identified. SEDI officials reviewed documentation (e.g.,  relevant laws and regulations, FPS policies) to identify all FPS  mission and mission support activities (referred to as an activities  taxonomy)\u2014and the frequency with which the identified activities are  performed. SEDI officials identified about 200 total activities and  associated tasks. As discussed in detail below, SEDI officials  consulted with key stakeholders to estimate the required time to  perform all mission-related work activities. SEDI officials used  information provided by these stakeholders because time constraints  precluded it from conducting real-time studies, according to an FPS  official. SEDI officials also calculated average productive labor hours  to populate the staffing model (1,548 hours for non-supervisory  physical security inspectors and 1,987 hours for criminal investigators)  based on assumptions about staff\u2019s annual leave, sick leave, training  requirements, travel (for training), and time devoted to other tasks  (e.g., collateral duties). For instance, the productive labor hours used  in the model assumes that staff on average use 50 percent of their  sick leave each year.", "To estimate the number of staff FPS needed in fiscal year 2013  (1,870 FTEs), SEDI officials used the data discussed above to  calculate the estimated total number of FTEs required to perform each  activity. Figure 4 provides an example of the steps taken to calculate  the FTEs needed for one activity\u2014conducting security assessments  at a level 4 facility. SEDI officials then aggregated the FTEs for each  activity to identify the total estimated FTEs that FPS needs to carry  out its mission.", "Risk factors: FPS officials incorporated operational risk factors in its  model, including the different security levels of federal facilities.  We  previously found that commonly used industry practices for staffing  models specific to law enforcement and physical security include  identifying operational risk factors, such as the security level of  facilities and posts to be secured or protected and identifying tasks  and time it takes to conduct those activities. A federal facility\u2019s  security risk level determines the frequency with which FPS must  complete a facility\u2019s security assessment. The model includes annual  targets for completing facility security assessments by facility security  level. For example, FPS officials estimated that it would complete 509  facility security assessments for security-level 4 federal facilities in  fiscal year 2013 and included these data in the model. In identifying  key practices for the design of staffing models, we found that  accounting for these operational risk factors helps determine the  number of staff and positions needed to mitigate potential threats to  federal facilities.", "Key stakeholders: In designing the model, SEDI officials consulted  with key stakeholders and subject-matter experts, including FPS  headquarters officials, and some regional directors and managers.  According to an official, SEDI relied on the subject matter experts to  estimate the number of hours it should take to perform FPS  operational activities. A SEDI official also told us that they used these  experts because FPS staff perform unique activities and therefore, no  benchmarks exist for how long it takes to perform many of the work  activities, such as facility security assessments. FPS officials also  told us that they involved NPPD human capital officials to help identify  assumptions, such as leave estimates, that were used to calculate  productive labor hours. We have previously found that involving  stakeholders and subject matter experts when designing a staffing  model can help an agency ensure that the model reflects operating  conditions and meets user needs.", "Data quality: FPS officials took steps to ensure the quality of the data  used in the model. We have defined data quality as the use of  relevant data from reliable internal and/or external sources based on  the identified information requirements. To help ensure data quality,  FPS officials told us that SEDI officials questioned subject matter  experts to obtain work activity hour estimates for performing some  work activities and to understand what the estimates included and  then revised them as needed to improve precision. For example, if  subject matter experts included travel time as part of the estimated  time to perform a facility security assessment, then SEDI officials  excluded the travel time from the original estimate and made it a  separate work activity with estimated time for completing it.  Additionally, FPS officials told us that they compared some work  activity hour estimates from the staffing model to the actual number of  hours it takes FPS staff to perform those activities from their Activity- Based Costing Model to identify differences and make corrections,  when needed, to reflect actual conditions. Further, FPS officials told  us that they regularly reviewed and provided feedback on SEDI\u2019s  taxonomy and other data collection efforts to identify all FPS work  activities and estimated work hours as well as the underlying  assumptions used to develop some estimates, such as assumptions  related to productive labor hours. A SEDI official also told us that FPS  Operations and some regional officials reviewed the estimated hours  required to complete some work activities in the staffing model.", "Although FPS officials took some steps to ensure the quality of data  provided by subject matter experts, they did not document the  agency\u2019s process for ensuring data quality at the time FPS developed  the model, and we could not assess the reliability of data used in the  model. We found that some FPS staff questioned the quality and  reasonableness of the data in the model, particularly on work hour  estimates to complete some activities. Specifically, selected FPS  regional staff we spoke with told us that some work hour estimates did  not reflect their experience or actual operating conditions. For  example, all nine area commanders we spoke with stated that the  estimated time to complete a risk assessment of federal facilities with  a facility security level 3 (about 60 hours) was low. The area  commanders said that it takes about 80 to120 hours on average  because, similar to level 4 facilities, they need to interview multiple  tenants for the risk assessments. FPS headquarters officials told us  that they had estimated a range of 60 to 80 hours for conducting  assessments of federal facilities with a facility security level 3,  depending on the number of federal agencies and clients in the  federal facilities, but they used the 60-hour estimate in the model as  the nationwide average time to conduct those assessments. FPS  officials told us that when they update the model, they plan to validate  work hour estimates they obtained from subject matter experts and  use data from some new technologies, such as the Modified  Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST), to better reflect actual operating  conditions. FPS headquarters officials also told us that the training  hours estimates in the model represent training requirements at the  time of developing the model and that when they update the model,  they plan to change the training hours used in the model to reflect  changes in training requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Uses Its Staffing Model to Help Make Management Decisions but Has Not Yet Updated It to Reflect Current Operating Conditions", "paragraphs": ["We found that FPS uses the staffing model in conjunction with other  management tools, professional judgement, and institutional knowledge  to help inform human capital planning and budget requirements, as  described below.", "Human capital planning decisions: An FPS official told us that FPS  uses the staffing model in conjunction with other management tools,  such as the Activity-Based Costing Model, to help make staffing and  human capital planning decisions. In particular, using the staffing and  Activity-Based Costing models,  FPS found that inspectors spent  less time than was predicted in some activities. For example, FPS  officials said that FPS found that inspectors spent less time than  predicted by the staffing model on overseeing countermeasures  services at agencies. An official said that FPS used this information to  evaluate and consider making changes to inspectors\u2019 workloads and  staffing levels.", "Budget requirements: In 2014 and 2015\u2014in response to international  security events (e.g., shootings at the Canadian Parliament and in  Paris)\u2014the Secretary of DHS instructed FPS to enhance its presence  and security at federal facilities for short periods of time. An FPS  official told us that FPS used the model to understand the impact of  the additional facility security responsibilities on its staff\u2019s daily facility- protection workload. According to the official, analyses from the  staffing model, other management tools, and conversations with  regional office staff, showed that FPS needed additional staff  resources to maintain its law enforcement staff\u2019s daily workload while  at the same time providing enhanced security operations. As a result  of this analysis, in July 2015, DHS notified federal agencies that it  would increase its basic security fee from $0.74 to $0.78 and its  oversight fee from 6 percent to 8 percent in fiscal year 2017.  According to a DHS memorandum sent to agencies using FPS  services, the fee increases, combined with internal efficiencies, will  allow the agency to sustain essential security operations and maintain  the agency\u2019s capacity to rapidly surge personnel during increasingly  more common periods of heightened vulnerability in fiscal year  2017.", "While FPS continues to use the model for the purposes described above,  it does not reflect some changes in FPS\u2019s operating conditions that have  occurred since the model\u2019s last update in August 2013. For example, this  staffing model does not reflect FPS\u2019s plan to perform about 600 more  facility security assessments for level 3 and 4 facilities in fiscal year 2014  than it did in fiscal year 2013. We calculated that if FPS updated the  August 2013 model to reflect these additional facility security  assessments, FPS would have needed about 37 more FTEs in fiscal year  2014, each of which would have completed an average of about 17 of the  additional assessments. FPS officials acknowledged that the number of  facility security assessments it plans to complete can change and that  other operating conditions, such as the number of federal facilities FPS is  responsible for protecting, can change regularly. FPS\u2019s operating  conditions can also change when security or agency needs change. For  example, some GSA facilities are becoming more technologically  advanced. To address security needs at those facilities, FPS officials told  us that in conjunction with the NPPD\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications, they plan to execute more of their protection  responsibilities as they relate to the nexus of cybersecurity and physical  security. Furthermore, NPPD\u2019s planned reorganization may result in  changes to FPS\u2019s activities. Separately, FPS\u2019s operations may change  for an extended period of time in response to unexpected events, such as  when threat levels change. As noted above, FPS officials said that while  they would like to update the model to reflect changes in operations, they  have not yet done so because of limited staff resources.", "However, at the completion of our audit work in February 2016, FPS  officials told us that given the planned NPPD reorganization, NPPD has  not yet determined whether FPS will continue to have responsibility for  updating the staffing model, whether this responsibility will shift to NPPD,  or whether it will become a shared responsibility. Nonetheless, FPS and  NPPD have no specific time frames for updating the model. Standards for  internal control in the federal government and associated guidance state  that managers need timely analytical information to help make  management decisions. Furthermore, we have found in our prior work  that completing staffing models and regularly updating them in a timely  manner can help support agencies\u2019 activities and decision making.  Without a clear plan and time frames for updating the staffing model to  reflect regular and unexpected changes in operating conditions, NPPD  and FPS will have limited assurance of the accuracy of the model\u2019s  estimates of the number and composition of staff FPS needs to protect  federal facilities and their decisions regarding the FPS workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Does Not Have a Documented Process for Ensuring Data Quality in Future Updates", "paragraphs": ["Although FPS took steps to ensure data quality when it developed the  August 2013 model, FPS does not have a documented process for  ensuring data quality when it updates the model to account for changes in  operating conditions in the future.

Standards for internal control in the federal government and guidance we  have developed on assessing the reliability of computer-processed data  state that agencies should use a process to help ensure data quality.  Also, the internal control standards emphasize the importance of control  activities such as procedures for achieving an entity\u2019s objectives.

The completion of  FPS\u2019s first strategic human capital plan and staffing model, therefore,  represents significant progress. Moreover, FPS\u2019s development of both the  Plan and model largely align with recognized key workforce-planning  principles and staffing model practices.", "While FPS has taken a number of positive steps to strategically manage  its workforce, we found that FPS does not have assurance that its efforts  will achieve its stated goals. FPS has not fully developed human capital  performance measures, and while both NPPD and FPS plan on taking  additional action in this area, future progress is uncertain because the  NPPD and FPS have not established a time frame for developing  additional measures. Until FPS and NPPD develop performance  measures with targets that clearly align with FPS\u2019s stated human capital  goals, it will be difficult to determine whether FPS is on track to meet its  goals and mission, or needs to make adjustments. Furthermore, FPS\u2019s  current staffing model has not been updated since August 2013. Until  FPS develops a plan and timeline for updating the model regularly and for  unexpected changes in operating conditions that last for an extended  period of time, FPS will have limited assurance on the model\u2019s estimates  of the number of staff it needs to protect federal facilities. Finally, because  FPS did not document a process for ensuring data quality when it  developed the model, it is not clear whether future updates to the model  will accurately reflect changes in operating conditions. Without  documented guidance that describes the process FPS will use to ensure  data quality, FPS may not be able to ensure that its staffing model will  provide accurate estimates of staffing needs.

We also interviewed or obtained information  from officials at FPS, NPPD, and General Services Administration (GSA).  To determine regional staff\u2019s involvement in developing the Plan and  staffing model, we obtained information from and interviewed FPS  regional directors and nine randomly selected area commanders  responsible for facility security in 3 of FPS\u2019s 11 regions. We judgmentally  selected the 3 regions\u2014Regions 7 (Greater Southwest Region), 10  (Northwest/Arctic Region), and 11 (National Capital Region)\u2014to obtain  variation in the number of FPS-protected facilities and full-time equivalent  (FTE) employees; the number of facilities per FTE; geographic size (in  terms of square miles); number of square miles per facility in the region;  geographic location (i.e., east, central, and west locations); and whether  DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development  Institute (SEDI) visited the region when it developed the staffing model.  Because we judgmentally selected the FPS regions, our results are not  generalizable to all of FPS. We also interviewed an official from the  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which is a nonprofit  professional association representing federal law enforcement officers,  and the International Association of Chiefs of Police to obtain their  perspective on workforce planning and staffing models.", "To examine whether FPS\u2019s Plan and related human capital planning  efforts align with key strategic workforce-planning principles, we reviewed  and assessed FPS\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Plan and related efforts against five  key strategic workforce-planning principles. The five key principles  include:  1.  involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing a strategic workforce  plan;  2.  determining critical skills and competencies needed for employees;  3.  developing strategies tailored to address gaps and needs;  4.  building the organizational capability needed to support human capital  5.  developing performance measures to evaluate progress toward  reaching human capital or agency goals.", "We obtained these principles from our 2003 report on key principles for  effective strategic workforce planning. We compared these principles  with guidelines in the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Human  Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF) that apply  across the federal government and determined that the principles we  developed are generally consistent with OPM\u2019s guidelines. FPS officials  also told us that they based their Plan on the HCAAF guidelines. The five  key strategic workforce-planning principles can enhance the effectiveness  of an agency\u2019s strategic workforce-planning and can help ensure that its  strategic workforce-planning process appropriately addresses an  agency\u2019s human capital challenges, goals, and mission. We also  conducted interviews with FPS officials to obtain information on whether  FPS\u2019s Plan and related human capital planning efforts addressed key  strategic workforce-planning principles. We interviewed an NPPD official  and selected FPS regional staff, as mentioned above, to understand their  involvement in FPS\u2019s human capital planning efforts. We did not assess  how FPS tailored each of its strategies to address human capital needs  and gaps and critical skills and competencies that need attention. Rather,  we asked FPS officials to provide examples of how their strategies  addressed human capital needs and gaps. We also did not assess the  effectiveness of the Plan because FPS is still in the process of  implementing it. After the conclusion of our audit work in February 2016,  we received NPPD\u2019s Human Capital Strategic Plan and we reviewed it to  compare to FPS\u2019s Plan to the extent that time allowed.", "To assess the design and use of FPS\u2019s staffing model, we reviewed  FPS\u2019s August 2013 model (the latest available) and relevant FPS  documents, and interviewed FPS officials to better understand the  process they followed to design the model and how they collected data  used in the model. We evaluated FPS\u2019s design of the model using  standards for internal control in the federal government, our 2009  guidance on assessing the reliability of computer-processed data, and  key practices we identified on the design of staffing models. We identified  the key practices from our previous reports that discussed staffing  models, discussions with a physical security industry association, and  staff within our agency with workforce-planning expertise. We initially  identified 11 key practices, but used four key practices to evaluate how  FPS designed its staffing model. Three of the 11 practices were not yet  applicable because FPS had not yet assigned staff to manage the staffing  model, and we consolidated 8 of them because they had similar  characteristics. For instance, we consolidated 3 practices on addressing  data issues into one because all of them related to data quality. The four  key practices call for:  1.  incorporating work activities, frequency, and time required to conduct  2.  incorporating risk factors;  3.  involving key stakeholders; and  4.  ensuring data quality to provide assurance that staffing estimates  produced from the model are reliable.", "These four key practices help provide reasonable assurance that the  design of the model will provide estimates to help management make  staffing and other decisions consistent with an agency\u2019s mission.", "As part of our review of FPS\u2019s design of the staffing model, we also  assessed the reliability of data FPS used in the model by reviewing  available documentation, interviewing agency officials knowledgeable  about the data, and examining data entries in the model for obvious  errors in accuracy and completeness. FPS officials told us that some data  discrepancies we found in our assessment did not significantly impact the  estimated number and composition of staff needed to meet FPS\u2019s  mission. Given the large volume of data in the model, we did not verify  this. We could not determine the reliability of data used in the model as  FPS did not provide us with documentation on steps taken to ensure data  quality, which is a key practice discussed more fully in the report.  However, to examine the quality of selected data inputs (e.g., estimated  time for completing certain work activities) in the model, we conducted  semi-structured interviews with randomly selected area commanders in  three regions, as mentioned above, to gauge the data\u2019s reasonableness.
