While the statute required DOD to ensure that it provided the assistance in a manner consistent with the military mission of the units involved, the statute did not require an assessment of the training value of providing the assistance. In 1996, legislation repealed the program and replaced it with the current IRT Program.", "Like the prior statute, the current legislation (10 U.S.C. 2012) authorizes units or members of the armed forces to provide support and services to nondefense organizations. The law also requires that assistance be incidental to military training, not adversely affect the quality of training, and not result in a significant increase in the cost of the training; unit\u2019s assistance meet valid unit training requirements; and individual members\u2019 assistance be directly related to their specific military specialties. Moreover, as was required under the prior program, DOD officials must coordinate with civilian officials to ensure that DOD assistance meets a valid community need and does not duplicate other available public services. Finally, the statute states that assistance may be provided only if it is requested by a responsible official of the organization that needs the assistance and it is not reasonably available from a commercial entity. See appendix I for a complete version of the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2012.", "To administer the IRT Program, DOD issued a specific directive to guide military organizations entering into projects with civilian organizations and established specific processes to ensure that projects conform to statutory requirements. Although the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs is responsible for monitoring the program, military organizations exercise a high degree of autonomy in making decisions to enter into projects. Military organizations use operations and maintenance and pay and allowances appropriations to fund IRT projects and need apply to OSD only if they require supplemental IRT funding. In fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated $16 million in such funding for the program.", "We selected six IRT projects of varying sizes and activities to determine their conformance with statutory requirements. These projects consist of three road-building projects (Operation Alaskan Road on Annette Island, Alaska; Navajo Nation Building Project between Sawmill and Fort Defiance, Arizona; and Operation Good Neighbor near Gallup, New Mexico); one medical project (MIRT 97 - Adams County, Ohio); one project to place excess combat vehicles off the shore of New Jersey to build artificial reefs (Operation REEFEX 97), and one project to reconstruct a basketball court (Operation Crescent City 97 in Louisiana)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full Extent, Nature, and Cost of Program Are Not Known", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials do not know the full extent of the IRT Program.

Some service and component command officials told us that they did not require after-action reports for IRT projects that did not receive supplemental funding. Officials of organizations that required reporting of all projects stated that even they might not be aware of small projects conducted at a local level.", "Using available service and OSD records for fiscal year 1997, we found that most of the projects were engineering, infrastructure, or medical in nature. At least 129 IRT projects were conducted in at least 35 states and the District of Columbia, and all active, reserve, and National Guard components of each of the services participated in the projects. The scope of these projects varied from activities conducted in 1 day by a few participants from a single unit to joint multiyear operations with hundreds of participants. Because we were unable to determine the full extent of IRT projects, we could not characterize the nature of all the projects.", "Although OSD officials told us they had obligated approximately $15.6 million of the $16 million Congress appropriated specifically for the IRT Program in fiscal year 1997, DOD does not capture those costs that the services and their components absorbed from their own pay and allowances and operations and maintenance accounts. As a result, we could not determine total program costs. Supplemental IRT funding spent on the six projects we reviewed amounted to at least $4.6 million. Project officials told us that service and component contributions to these projects were at least $3.6 million. We could not determine their total cost because we had to rely on project participants\u2019 memories of the types of costs incurred and, in many cases, their estimates of the expenses.

Although the directive meets the legislation\u2019s requirements, DOD could improve the directive by addressing how it will implement the statutory requirement that the provision of assistance not result in a significant increase in the cost of training.", "DOD has implemented the IRT Program through its directive, much of which restates in nearly identical language the statutory provisions governing the program. It provides, in some instances, additional guidance on how DOD is to implement the program, as shown in the following two examples.", "Under 10 U.S.C. 2012(f), the Secretary of Defense is required to prescribe regulations that include procedures to ensure that assistance is provided along with, rather than separate from, civilian efforts and meets a valid civil or community need. To meet this requirement, the directive encourages the establishment of advisory councils composed of various public, private, business, and civic sector representatives. The directive states that if an advisory council does not exist in the area in which assistance is to be provided, responsible DOD commanders or other officials are to consult and coordinate, to the maximum extent practicable, with the same types of individuals who would serve on the councils.", "The statute requires that civil military program assistance be provided only if the assistance is not reasonably available from a commercial entity. The directive states that in determining reasonable availability, DOD may also take into account whether the requesting organization or activity would be able, financially or otherwise, to address the specific civic or community need.", "Additional guidance could help organizations implement the statutory requirement that assistance not result in a significant increase in the cost of training. DOD\u2019s directive repeats the language of the statute but does not explain what constitutes an increase in costs for training or a \u201csignificant increase.\u201d DOD currently does not assess whether undertaking an IRT project will significantly increase the cost of training. Guidance on this point would provide a basis for assessing whether participating military organizations were complying with the requirements.", "The directive calls on the service secretaries to ensure that commanders of units or personnel participating in IRT activities determine that the assistance provided is consistent with valid unit training requirements or related to the specific military specialty of participating personnel.

Thus, it appeared that the goal of completing a project sometimes took priority over the goal of providing valid military training. In addition, we were unable to determine whether providing the assistance had resulted in a significant increase in the cost of training for any of the six projects because DOD has established no basis for making such a determination.", "The extent to which five of the projects conformed with each statutory requirement is summarized in table 1. OSD approved the sixth project (Operation Crescent City), which was sponsored by the Marine Corps Reserve, for supplemental IRT funding and the Marine Corps conducted project planning. Marine Corps officials subsequently canceled the project when they failed to reach an agreement with the community that would allow them to ensure that statutory provisions would be met. For example, according to these officials, there was no written request letter, no agreement on who would provide services the Marine Corps unit did not have the skills to provide, and no agreement on who would pay for those aspects of the project that had no training value.", "The following paragraphs provide additional information on the conformance of the five projects to statutory requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conformance With General Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We found that the benefiting organizations for all five projects met the eligibility criteria established in the statute.

In addition, officials of Operation Good Neighbor and of Operation REEFEX 97 told us that certifications of noncompetition with the private sector had not been provided for those projects. DOD collects these certifications to establish that assistance is not reasonably available from commercial sources, as required by the statute. The officials from Operation Good Neighbor told us they had attempted to get community officials to provide a certification before starting the project but had been unsuccessful. They said they had contacted OSD officials and were told to continue the project, in spite of not having a certification. Officials of Operation REEFEX 97 told us they did not know why there was no certification for their project.", "The statute requires that the assistance not interfere with a unit\u2019s or members\u2019 ability to perform their military functions.

As a result, 25 refuelers from a bulk fuel company were trained in combat engineering skills and used to augment the 125-person combat engineering company. Marine Corps officials acknowledged the bulk refuelers\u2019 duties for this project were not related to their military specialties.

In addition, three of the five Seabees who built ramps for the handicapped had military specialties unrelated to the tasks they performed. The Seabees\u2019 military specialties were surveyor and heavy equipment operator, but they were used as carpenters/masons.", "The statute requires that the assistance have no adverse impact on training quality. Most of the individuals involved in each of our five projects were participating in valid training for their units or performing tasks in their military specialties. Officials told us that for the individuals not performing tasks in their military specialties, participation did not interfere with any other training opportunities.", "The statute requires that the assistance provided not result in a significant increase in the cost of training.

Even within those projects, OSD did not always follow its own processes for ensuring the statutory requirements for civil military projects were met and did not have procedures in place to ensure that military organizations were meeting the statutory requirement not to provide assistance that results in a significant increase in training costs. The service secretaries have not established any additional oversight requirements.", "The process for projects that receive supplemental IRT funding involves an application that the sponsoring service or component submits to OSD, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between OSD and the sponsor once OSD approves the application, and an after-action report. In its guidance for submission of requests for supplemental funding for 1997 IRT projects, OSD specified a format for application submissions. The information required includes the name of the requesting civilian organization and other contributing organizations, certification of noncompetition, training requirements or objectives to be met, and estimated funding requirements. However, the application does not require a certification that each proposed project does not result in a significant increase in the cost of training.", "For approved applications, OSD and the sponsor sign an MOA that specifies the amount of supplemental IRT funding allotted to the project and requirements to be met before the funds can be spent. An MOA may cover one or several projects that the same service or component is sponsoring. OSD officials told us that, under their policy, if the sponsor has more than one approved project, the sponsor determines the amount of supplemental IRT funds to distribute to each of its approved projects. The sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the requirements in the MOA are met.", "The MOA also requires military organizations to submit after-action reports that include, for example, the number of personnel participating in the project and an accounting of funds used to support the project. Copies of after-action reports are to be provided to OSD.", "Using documentation that OSD provided for fiscal year 1997 projects, we found that the process was not always followed because (1) sometimes applications were not submitted, (2) MOAs were not always executed, and (3) after-action reports were not always prepared. Additionally, we found cases in which MOAs were executed and supplemental IRT funds were used without the sponsor having met the requirements of the MOA. In one case, OSD had funded a project without any part of the process having been followed. OSD officials told us that they funded the project near the end of the fiscal year when it became apparent that not all of the supplemental IRT funding that had been obligated would be spent. They said that to avoid losing the funds at the end of the fiscal year, they had orally directed the transfer of funds from one Marine Corps component to another to fund this project and had not required an application, had not issued an MOA, and had not required an after-action report. The officials told us they had no paperwork relating to the project. Moreover, we found that, in some cases, sponsoring organizations, such as service components or joint organizations, had not determined that IRT projects did not result in significant increases in the cost of training because they believed this was part of OSD\u2019 s process for approving supplemental funding for projects.

However, the directive provides no designated time frame for providing the reports, and we found that they were not always submitted.

Once the services issue these instructions, DOD stated a decentralized approach can work more effectively.", "While the legislation does not permit centralized direction of activities under the IRT Program, it does not preclude DOD from conducting oversight. We do not advocate greater centralized control but rather better oversight to improve conformance with statutory requirements. For example, we recommended stronger adherence to oversight procedures already in place, modifications to those procedures, and more specific guidance on determining training cost implications. We continue to believe that such oversight is necessary and prudent to ensure compliance with the program\u2019s statutory requirements.", "DOD also stated that it has fully accounted for resources specifically authorized and appropriated in fiscal year 1997 to fund IRT projects and that the services are responsible for IRT related costs funded from service resources. While DOD stated a separate system may be required to capture total costs, it emphasized that the benefits and costs of implementing such a system should be weighed against the value and size of the IRT Program.

Phase one of the project, conducted in fiscal year 1997, involved over  850 members of the active forces of each of the military services. About  70 members of the Army and Air National Guard and the Army and Marine Corps Reserves also participated. During fiscal year 1997, the project was organized and planned and a base camp was constructed. The camp is to be used to house the military personnel who are expected to build a 14-mile road on Annette Island in Alaska over the next 5 years. The road will connect the town of Metlakatla with a remote section of the island that is much closer to the site of a proposed ferry terminal. The community believes that the proposed additional ferry access will allow more medical, educational, and commercial opportunities for the approximately 1,600 residents of Metlakatla.", "In fiscal year 1997, about 150 Marines spent 57 days on the island constructing a 300-person base camp to be used in the future by U.S. military personnel constructing the road. The base camp consists of  38 buildings, including berthing barracks, a mess hall, and shower and restroom facilities. The Marines invested over 63,000 hours of labor to construct the buildings, which are designed to last about 5 years. Unit officials stated that this project provided their personnel with many training opportunities, such as ship-to-shore landing, horizontal engineering, and vertical construction.", "Marine Corps officials told us the Alaskan deployment was good training for the engineer support company that participated. We found, however, that some individuals performed tasks unrelated to their military specialties, raising questions about whether the assistance provided was incidental to training. Specifically, because the company did not have enough combat engineers to complete the project in the allotted time,  25 Marines from a bulk fuel company, who were untrained in combat engineering skills, augmented the combat engineers. Therefore, a significant amount of time (about 2 months prior to deployment and more time on-site) was spent teaching basic combat engineering skills to the bulk refuelers. Also, Marine Corps officials told us that many tasks the combat engineers were required to perform involved skills not found in the individual training skills manual for the combat engineer. Some examples included plumbing rough-in work, masonry, quarrying operations, and finished wood frame carpentry.", "Two Navy troop transport ships carried the Marines on two separate trips from San Diego, California, to Annette Island. The trips took a total of 23 days and involved more than 650 Navy personnel. In Alaska, a Navy landing craft utility (LCU) transported personnel and supplies between the island and the mainland. Twenty five LCU personnel were assigned in support of this project. This project fit the unit\u2019s mission of ship-to-shore movement of combat troops and equipment and provided the unit the opportunity to train for and prove the capability of LCUs to perform operations for extended periods while unsupported by a ship or parent command.
