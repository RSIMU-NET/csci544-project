To do this, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, agency reports, and a non-probability sample of 21 of 76 subgrant files, consisting of data on about 56 percent of funds subgranted.

However, their respective program expenditure reporting was not consistent with federal internal control standards, making it difficult to know fully how program funds were spent. VA\u0092s reporting of first-year program funding was problematic because it did not closely track costs until midway through the fiscal year. During the second fiscal year\u00972011\u0097VA granted $7.5 million to USOC, which, in turn, awarded $4.4 million to subgrantees and spent the remainder primarily on operations and personnel. Subgrantees reported using funds for activities such as training and camps. GAO found, however, that USOC did not have sufficient reporting requirements in place for subgrantees to provide information on how VA funds were used separate from other sources of funding.", "VA relied upon self-reported, unverified information to oversee the grant program but is planning to make improvements. In fiscal year 2011, VA did not conduct any on-site or remote monitoring to verify how funds were used. Thus, VA lacked information on how well USOC and subgrantees managed grant funds, potentially exposing itself to paying for services not delivered. In 12 of 21 subgrant files selected, USOC was not holding subgrantees accountable for meeting the terms of their agreements. For example, one subgrantee agreed to conduct 10 activities, but the file indicated only 4 were conducted. VA reported that it has plans to improve to oversight, including conducting on-site monitoring of grantees\u0092 and subgrantees\u0092 use of funds and having USOC verify financial reports for at-risk subgrantees, such as those with large subgrants.", "While program benefits were reported by subgrantees and participants, up until this point VA has not systematically measured how adaptive sports activities benefit the health and well-being of veterans and service members. Subgrantees primarily report anecdotal information on program benefits, such as individual success stories. VA collects information on the number of activities and participants from USOC. In 2011, over 10,000 participants were served through nearly 2,000 activities. However, these metrics are flawed due to double counting and other measurement issues. VA officials also recognize that the metrics do not comprehensively measure program benefits. Thus, VA and USOC have hired a contractor to conduct a study on the effects of adaptive sports on rehabilitation and reintegration of veterans and service members into the community."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA take additional actions to improve grantee and subgrantee reporting of expenditures, activities, and participants, as well as USOC\u0092s monitoring of subgrantees.

To promote the lifelong health of veterans and servicemembers  with disabilities through regular participation in physical activity and  sports, as well other related purposes, the Veterans Benefits  Improvement Act of 2008 established the Office of National Veterans  Sports Programs and Special Events within the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA). The act also authorized VA to provide monthly assistance  allowances to veterans with disabilities participating in Paralympics  competitions or training operated by the United States Olympic  Committee (USOC). Additionally, the act authorized grants solely to  USOC to plan, develop, manage, and implement an integrated adaptive  sports program for veterans and servicemembers with disabilities,  including joint outreach with VA. The act also allows USOC to enter into  partnership agreements with other organizations, essentially subgranting  funds to conduct adaptive sports activities. VA conducts grant oversight to  help ensure that USOC is effectively and efficiently providing adaptive  sports opportunities, reliably managing its financial reporting, and is in  compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

VA granted $7.5 million to USOC and obligated about  $400,000 to contract with a consulting firm to design an outreach strategy  for informing eligible participants about the program. It is not clear,  however, how much money VA spent, in total, on administrative and  personnel costs associated with this program in fiscal year 2010, primarily  because VA did not closely track these costs until midway through fiscal  year 2011. VA officials told us that the Office of National Veterans Sports  Programs and Special Events did not have a full-time program director  and was not fully operational until about midway through fiscal year 2011,  and as a result, VA did not establish accounting codes for the  Paralympics program until that time. VA officials also said that some  administrative and personnel costs were charged to other VA programs  as general expenses, and therefore cannot be traced back to the  Paralympics program.

USOC  officials explained that the monthly information an athlete must submit to  obtain an allowance, such as a detailed training log, can be burdensome.  USOC is working with VA to develop a new online reporting tool to help  ease the burden of this monthly reporting requirement in an effort to  encourage greater participation.", "VA also planned to spend about $334,500 on fiscal year 2011  administrative and personnel costs associated with the Paralympics  program, the majority of which was for contracted services.

The contractor did not  use all of the funding it obligated for this contract, and returned to VA  approximately $98,500. According to VA, $11,753 in fiscal year 2011  funds was spent on personnel for the Paralympics program. However, the  salaries for the Director of the Paralympics program and other personnel  who contributed to establishing the program are not fully reflected in  these personnel costs; those salaries were funded through other VA  programs because separate accounting codes for the Paralympics  program were not established until midway through fiscal year 2011.  Indeed, the Director of the Paralympics program was paid out of funds  from the Office of National and Special Events. As a result, only those  expenses that were incurred after the codes were established were  reported on VA\u2019s budget for the Paralympics program.

USOC\u2019s plan includes a checklist for reviewing and  verifying information in these quarterly reports; the checklist mentions  comparing the reports to the agreed-upon activities and conducting  remote and on-site reviews. USOC aims to conduct enough site visits to  review the use of half of all fiscal year 2011 funds. Furthermore, USOC  plans to use risk-based criteria to select subgrantees for remote audits of  financial data; these criteria will include the size of the subgrant award,  additional granting of VA funds to other entities by the subgrantee, and  the absence of a current audit report. The remote audits will include  reviewing the subgrantees\u2019 ledgers and comparing them to what was  submitted in the quarterly reports and reviewing documentation that  supports selected transactions to ensure that they are compliant with  OMB guidance. However, given that we found that USOC was not holding  subgrantees accountable\u2014despite having an oversight process in  place\u2014VA will need to ensure its monitoring efforts include overseeing  the implementation of USOC\u2019s plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Benefits Have Been Reported but VA Does Not Systematically Measure Them", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Participants Have Reported Improvements to Their Health and Well- Being", "paragraphs": ["We found that many subgrantees and participants reported benefits from  VA\u2019s Paralympics program.

This anecdotal information included participant success stories,  testimonials, and related news articles, and was consistently positive with  regards to the program\u2019s value in the first year. (See figure 4 for  examples.)", "During our site visit to an adaptive sports event in Chicago, veterans we  spoke with also told us how adaptive sports programs have improved  their mental and physical health. All six veterans in one group interview  agreed that the greatest benefit was to their mental health; they believe  that adaptive sports are a tool that helps them deal with depression. They  also said that participating in group activities with other veterans with  disabilities made them feel less isolated in their challenges. Other  veterans said that they had experienced social benefits, including a boost  to their self-esteem; one veteran described how he developed long-term  friendships during the competitions, and another described how these  events show veterans that they can be physically active despite their  disabilities. Veterans also told us that competitions motivated them to stay  active on an on-going basis and improved their overall physical health.  For example, some veterans said regular participation in athletic activities  made them physically stronger in their remaining limbs and had improved  their balance and dexterity. One veteran in particular told us that he had  lost 68 pounds in 4 months due to his regular participation in Paralympic  program activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Counts of Activities and Participants Are Inconsistent, but VA Is Taking Steps to Improve Measurement of Program Benefits", "paragraphs": ["While VA requires USOC and its subgrantees to count the number of  adaptive sports activities conducted and the number of participants  served, these measurements are not always accurate. In its fiscal year  2011 annual report to VA, USOC stated that over 10,000 veterans and  servicemembers participated in nearly 2,000 activities. However, VA  officials acknowledged that the participation and activity data are flawed.  Indeed, in USOC\u2019s quarterly reports to VA, USOC stated there is some  double counting of unique veterans/servicemembers and activities due to  partnerships and collaboration among the Paralympic community. For  example, a veteran might attend activities sponsored by different  subgrantees, and each subgrantee might then include that same veteran  in their separate count. The extent of this double counting is unknown due  to a lack of a systematic review of the activity and participant counts.  Although VA is required by law to report annually to Congress on the  number of veterans who participated in adaptive sports activities and the  administrative expenses, it has yet to do so.", "Additionally, in our review of a sample of 21 subgrantee reports, we found  some inconsistencies with how subgrantees count program participants  and activities, further diminishing the reliability of these data. It was  difficult to determine, in fact, how 16 out of the 21 were counting their  participants or activities as many organizations had different  interpretations of what qualified as a participant or activity. For example, 8  out of the 21 subgrantee reports counted activities that did not have  veteran or military participants\u2014some of them even counted purchases of  equipment as activities. Also, 6 out of the 21 subgrantees administered  more than one type of a VA Paralympics grant and submitted reports  where it was difficult to determine which grant corresponded with which  counts of activities and participants.", "While subgrantees and program participants reported program benefits,  VA has not yet systematically measured how adaptive sports activities  specifically benefitted the health and well-being of veterans and  servicemembers. A couple of USOC\u2019s subgrantees conducted surveys  asking for feedback on specific events or activities, but VA has not  conducted a program-wide survey or study to collect information about  the various events and their benefits. Absent this measurement, VA  largely relies on the anecdotal information supplied by subgrantees and  program participants. Moreover, VA officials recognize that participant  and activity counts do not comprehensively measure how participation in  adaptive sports can improve a person with disabilities\u2019 quality of life,  including improved physical health, enhanced confidence and self- esteem, reduction in depression and improved relationships with family  members and other members of the community.", "VA wants to improve its measurement of Paralympics activity benefits. VA  and USOC have, in turn, taken the initiative to hire a contractor to conduct  a study on the effects of adaptive sports on rehabilitation and  reintegration of veterans and servicemembers into the community,  including five life domains (self-care, mobility skills, communication with  family and friends, participation in society, and acceptance of disability)  and the psychosocial outcomes, including self-esteem and quality of life.  The study will include a survey of participants in VA adaptive sports  activities, with questions focusing on uncovering key life and goal-setting  concerns of participants as well as employment and educational goals  and opportunities. VA and USOC are expecting the contractor to provide  a preliminary report to Model Community Partners by the end of  September 2012. They have also planned for the final results of this study  to be shared with internal and external audiences, including government  agencies, the research community, and the general public. In addition, VA  and USOC have tasked the contractor to conduct an assessment of the  VA Paralympics program that will include identification of issues, trends,  obstacles, and barriers, which will assist USOC and subgrantees with  managing expectations and program performance. VA and USOC have  required the contractor to provide an annual report on this assessment by  November 2012. VA officials told us they have also been assisting the  Paralympic Research and Sport Science Consortium with facilitating  research in Paralympic and adaptive sports. VA officials stated that this  research is focused on activities that would both enhance Paralympic  sports and capabilities to provide rehabilitative opportunities to Veterans  and members of the Armed Forces with disabilities. In addition, VA  officials stated that they are seeking feedback from Paralympic and  adaptive sport communities, academia, research institutions, and other  entities to try to develop metrics to measure effectiveness.", "VA officials stated that the goals of its adaptive sports programming have  changed in the past few years with the establishment of the Paralympics  program. Prior to the Paralympics program and its current leadership, the  Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs focused on engaging  veterans and servicemembers with disabilities in a few Paralympic sport  competitions it sponsored once a year. However, with the Paralympics  program and the Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and  Special Events in place, VA has expanded its goals to include veteran  participation in local and community adaptive sports programs throughout  the year and for on-going sports participation to have an impact on the  veterans\u2019 overall physical and emotional well-being. Further, VA is  working with other VA entities to incorporate Paralympic and adaptive  sports into rehabilitative whole-life programs for Veterans and members  of the Armed Forces with disabilities. For example, VA officials stated that  they worked with some of their subgrantees to develop adaptive sports  program-related training webinars and other support materials for VA  entities such as recreation therapists, centers for blind and visually  impaired, and Community Living Centers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["After veterans and servicemembers face life altering disabilities resulting  from their service in the Armed Forces, the VA Paralympics program  works to empower them to move forward in their next phase of life. In  partnership with USOC and its subgrantees, VA has been able to  introduce numerous participants to a variety of sports adapted for their  physical conditions. Beyond providing access to recreational  opportunities, veteran participants told us that adaptive sports have  changed the way they think about their disabilities and provided them with  opportunities to improve their physical health. As this program matures, it  has the potential to provide greater access to adaptive sports and garner  a wider range of benefits for participants. VA must, however, improve the  program\u2019s oversight and reporting to help ensure program funds are  efficiently and effectively used. Although USOC is planning various  oversight initiatives and is implementing an electronic reporting system for  subgrantees, we found that USOC\u2019s past efforts at financial accounting,  subgrantee oversight, and reporting on participation and activities were  weak, resulting in gaps in program knowledge about how program funds  were actually spent, whether or not all promised activities occurred, and  how many people benefitted from the activities. Moving forward, without  this information, VA and policymakers will struggle to make informed  decisions about the program\u2019s future. VA officials report that they are  building a stronger oversight structure, but to the extent USOC\u2019s  weaknesses remain, VA may miss opportunities to better use program  resources to motivate, encourage, and sustain participation and  competition in adaptive sports among veterans and servicemembers with  disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve oversight within the VA Paralympics grant program, we  recommend the Secretary of VA direct the National Director of the Office  of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events to take the  following three actions:  1.

Provide a consistent methodology for how subgrantees should  count their program activities and participants, including  explicit instruction on what should and should not be counted  as an activity or participant.  2.  Ensure USOC adds controls to its electronic reporting system that  will require subgrantees to identify how VA grant funds were used  separate from other funding sources subgrantees use to support  adaptive sports activities.  3.

Regarding USOC\u2019s electronic reporting system, VA reported  that USOC has included the requirement that subgrantees identify how  VA funds were used separately from other funding sources, and VA will  review the system before it goes on-line during the fourth quarter of 2012.   VA indicated that USOC also plans to provide training to subgrantees on  how to appropriately report on grant funds during this quarter.  In  response to our recommendation on following up on USOC\u2019s monitoring  plan, VA reported that, in April 2012, it began meeting with USOC to  improve USOC\u2019s subgrant monitoring program, which now includes  weekly conference calls with VA.

The mandated requirement to include a description of how the  United States Paralympics, Inc. (which was superseded by the  Paralympic Division of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC))  used grant funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is  provided under the first research objective. The other mandated  requirements to include the number of veterans with disabilities who  benefitted from such grants and how such veterans benefitted were  addressed under the third research objective. To address the three  objectives, we analyzed both planned and final program budget  expenditure data; reviewed program reports, guidance, and relevant  federal laws and regulations; and interviewed VA and USOC officials and  other program stakeholders about VA\u2019s Paralympics program activities  funded with fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012 appropriations.", "Specifically, to determine how VA and its grantees used program funds,  we reviewed information on planned and actual program expenditures  provided by VA and USOC and interviewed VA and USOC officials to  better understand the purposes for which funds were used. VA started  spending Paralympic program funds in fiscal year 2010, but did not have  complete final expenditure information for that first program year. As a  result, we discuss this incomplete expenditure data in our report findings.  We obtained VA\u2019s complete planned and final expenditure budget  information on fiscal year 2011 funds, but could only report planned  expenditures for fiscal year 2012, as their actual expenditures for that  year had not yet been finalized at the writing of this report. USOC  provided data to us on subgrantees\u2019 planned and final expenditures.  Subgrantees\u2019 planned expenditures were based on subgrant agreements  made by USOC and the subgrantee, and final expenditures were based  on data from quarterly reports submitted by each subgrantee to USOC.  To determine the reliability of VA and USOC data on planned and actual  program expenditures for that year, we interviewed VA and USOC  officials about their procedures for collecting and maintaining these data.  In addition, we reviewed a nonprobability sample of 21 subgrant files to  verify the accuracy of data reported to USOC and to better understand  how USOC maintains these data. The sample included all types of USOC  subgrants mentioned in the background of this report. Specifically, all of  USOC\u2019s National Partner subgrants were included, and if these National  Partners were also awarded Olympic Opportunity Fund subgrants, those  subgrants were also included. The sample also included Model  Community Partners and other Olympic Opportunity Fund subgrantees  which were selected randomly after being stratified according to their  subgrant type and USOC-designated geographic region. Due to errors in  the original list of subgrantees by subgrant type provided by USOC, our  sample also included two Athlete Development subgrants. In total, the  sample files contained information on 56 percent of funds USOC provided  in subgrants using fiscal year 2010 dollars. Due to problems we found  with subgrantee reporting, we did not report information on subgrantees\u2019  actual expenditures. (See the body of the report for more information.)  We reported only those expenditure data we believe were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our study.", "To determine how VA oversaw grantees\u2019 use of funds, we interviewed VA  and USOC officials and obtained and reviewed quarterly progress reports  from USOC, examples of progress reports from subgrantees, and VA\u2019s  and USOC\u2019s monitoring plans.
