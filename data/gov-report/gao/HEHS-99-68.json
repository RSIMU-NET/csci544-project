Unlike fee-for-service providers, however, managed care plans receive a fixed amount per month for each enrolled beneficiary, regardless of the type and number of services they provide. Consequently, plans have a financial incentive to limit beneficiaries\u2019 use of health care services.

Aggregate appeals data may indicate potential problems with a plan\u2019s appeals process, but additional information is needed to assess whether a plan adequately performs this function. A relatively low appeal rate may be the result of a plan\u2019s low denial rate or members who are unaware of their appeal rights. Conversely, a plan that denies many requests or that actively educates members about their rights may experience a relatively high appeal rate.

Nearly one-quarter of the 90 plans were cited for issuing denial notices that did not adequately explain beneficiaries\u2019 appeal rights. Two studies by HHS\u2019 OIG provide additional evidence that beneficiaries are not always informed of their appeal rights.

The potential financial burden can be substantial, especially if the denial involves SNF services.", "In three of the four plans we visited, the general practice was to issue denial notices the day before services were discontinued. We reviewed a number of SNF discharge notices at three HMOs and often found that the notices were mailed (usually by certified or express mail) to the beneficiary\u2019s home instead of being delivered to the facility where the beneficiary resided.

Ten of the 25 CHDR cases we reviewed also involved a beneficiary or his or her representative receiving a discharge notice after the beneficiary was discharged from the SNF.", "The fourth plan we visited issued SNF discharge notices 3 days prior to the discharge date.

Even when a beneficiary knows a discharge is imminent, however, he or she cannot appeal until a denial notice is officially issued. Officials from the plans we visited told us that, in almost every instance, the decision to discharge a beneficiary from a SNF is made several days before the actual discharge date.

A plan official stated that his plan has never reviewed service denials and does not know how many services its provider groups have denied. The plan has, however, recently developed a monitoring protocol to review service denials and intends to implement it soon. According to several HMO officials, this practice is common in California and is increasing in other parts of the country.", "Officials also said that HMOs typically exercise little or no oversight over provider groups\u2019 operations and have difficulty ensuring that groups adequately perform the delegated tasks. For example, according to an official from another HMO, provider groups on the West Coast expect plans to grant them the authority to issue denial notices because they are at financial risk for the services they provide. To contract with these groups, his plan must delegate that authority even though the practice is not desirable from his HMO\u2019s perspective. He said that provider groups often do not send the plans copies of issued denial notices, although the plans request them. The official estimated that his plan receives only about 30 percent of the denial notices issued by their provider groups. He added that his plan does not review the notices it does receive.", "Moreover, according to a HCFA official, HCFA does not generally monitor HMO provider groups.

Relatively few beneficiaries\u2014about 9 out of every 1,000 managed care enrollees\u2014appeal each year. Some beneficiaries may not appeal, however, because they are unaware of their appeal rights or confused about the process. Evidence from a variety of sources\u2014HCFA monitoring reports, studies by HHS\u2019 OIG, and our review of cases at plans and at CHDR\u2014indicate that plans do not always inform beneficiaries of their appeal rights as required. In some cases, denial notices cite nonspecific reasons for the denial, making it more difficult for beneficiaries to challenge their plan\u2019s decision. In other cases, beneficiaries may be unnecessarily exposed to substantial health care costs because notices are not issued in a timely fashion. Furthermore, the agency has not issued specific guidance as to the types of cases plans should expedite.", "HCFA reviews plans\u2019 implementation of the appeals process, but its monitoring protocol exhibits several weaknesses. For example, HCFA does not know whether provider groups have satisfactorily implemented the required appeals process because it exercises little oversight over provider group operations. The type of cases HCFA samples to determine whether beneficiaries were informed of their appeal rights likely systematically misses beneficiaries who were not informed. Further, the agency has not provided plans guidance on the types of appeals data they should collect and report to HCFA. HCFA agrees that it needs to strengthen its oversight of health plans\u2019 appeals process and noted that the agency has several initiatives under way."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the appeals process provides adequate protection to Medicare beneficiaries, the HCFA Administrator should take the following actions:", "Provide more explicit denial notice instructions to plans.

Some of these initiatives may be implemented shortly; others are in the early planning stage.", "HCFA expressed concern, however, about our recommendation that the agency develop criteria to help plans determine when initial and appeal decisions should be expedited. HCFA said that a further refinement of the current general criteria might inadvertently exclude unspecified standards. HCFA said that it would explore possible options regarding the criteria, but that it would proceed cautiously to avoid unanticipated problems. We disagree with the premise that further refinement of the criteria would inadvertently limit beneficiary access to expedited initial and appeal decisions. As noted in this report, specific clinical criteria have been developed and used by plans in at least one HCFA region. HCFA could develop specific criteria, to be implemented nationwide, that are understood to be an elaboration of the current general criteria and not a replacement for them.", "In addition, HCFA provided several technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 1 day from the date of this letter.

During our visits, we discussed the appeals process with plan officials and reviewed a limited number of cases at three of the locations. The cases included standard appeals and expedited appeals that were upheld and overturned at the plan level within the 6 months prior to our visit. Each case reviewed was discussed with a plan official responsible for the plan\u2019s appeals process. In addition, we made a site visit to an HMO in Maryland during a HCFA monitoring visit.

In addition, we obtained from HCFA a summary spreadsheet that showed all the monitoring reports completed in 1997 and summarized plan compliance with Medicare requirements.
