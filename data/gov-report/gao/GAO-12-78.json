In response to FHWA's designation of the DBE program as an agencywide high-risk area from 2007 through 2010 and other reasons, FHWA recently increased its oversight of state DOT DBE programs. For example, in 2010, FHWA hired a full-time DBE Program Manager and required FHWA division offices in each state to explain to FHWA headquarters how they oversee their state DOTs' DBE programs. While these steps could help FHWA ensure state DOT compliance with regulations, it is too early to assess their effectiveness. Although FHWA has increased its oversight, FHWA faces two fundamental problems with the DBE data it collects from state DOTs to assess whether state DOTs have met their DBE goals. First, the data that FHWA collects from state DOTs on actual spending on DBEs can cover multiple fiscal years and cannot be meaningfully compared to state DOTs' DBE goals, which reflect the percent of federal-aid highway funds state DOTs will expect to spend on DBEs for one fiscal year. Thus, FHWA may not be able to effectively track whether state DOTs have met their goals as required by federal internal control standards. Second, data on committed spending on DBEs--the proxy measure that FHWA uses instead to measure whether goals were met--shows that about half of the state DOTs met their DBE goals each fiscal year from fiscal years 2006 through 2010; however, FHWA has not conducted a nationwide analysis comparing committed to actual spending to know whether committed spending reflects actual spending for DBEs in all state DOTs. Thus, FHWA does not know whether its data on committed spending can be relied on to evaluate a state DOT's progress in meeting DBE goals. Ensuring that committed spending data are a reasonable proxy is important because state DOTs and FHWA make program decisions based on this information. U.S. DOT's working group that considers various improvements to the administration of the DBE program could provide FHWA with an opportunity to identify options it can use to evaluate its proxy data. Also, while FHWA uses committed spending data to facilitate timely reporting of whether state DOTs have met their goals, FHWA's reporting of data on committed spending to describe progress towards DBE goals does not include statements about potential limitations of the data--namely that the data on committed spending on DBEs might not reflect actual spending. FHWA oversees the certification activities of state DOTs, which certify that DBEs primarily working on federal-aid highway projects meet federal eligibility requirements. Other U.S. DOT administrations--the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration--oversee other certifying organizations, such as local airport authorities and state transit agencies, that certify DBEs for work primarily in those areas; such DBEs might also have the skills required (e.g., paving) to work on highway projects. FHWA divisions use their discretion to determine how much and how often to oversee state DOT DBE certification activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FHWA (1) evaluate its committed spending data to determine if it is a reasonable proxy and (2) include statements in information provided to decision makers about potential data limitations.

According to U.S. DOT\u2019s  regulations on the program, the DBE program also aims to, among other  things, create a level playing field for DBEs so that they can compete  fairly on these contracts. In 2009, U.S. DOT\u2014through its Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  and Federal Transit Administration (FTA)\u2014awarded about $4 billion (or  about 9.4 percent of U.S. DOT\u2019s total assisted contracting) to DBEs  nationwide. While recipients, such as state DOTs, of certain types of U.S.  DOT funds are responsible for implementing the DBE program, federal  oversight of these recipients is critical for ensuring that the objectives of  the program are achieved, federal funds are spent appropriately, and the  program benefits qualified businesses.

A number of offices within FHWA are involved in  helping oversee the DBE program. For example, at the national level,  FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights monitors nationwide progress in meeting  DBE goals.

We  judgmentally selected the five states to obtain variation in, among other  areas, the extent to which state DOTs met their DBE goals, the number of  certifying organizations in the state, and geographic location. Specifically,  in each of the states, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  officials from FHWA divisions and state DOTs about FHWA\u2019s oversight of  state DOTs\u2019 DBE activities. In each state, we also reviewed  documentation and interviewed officials from organizations that certify  DBEs that work on federally funded highway projects\u2014such as state  DOTs and local transit agencies\u2014and judgmentally selected these  organizations based on, among other things, their geographic location  and whether they certified DBEs that work on highway projects. We  compared FHWA\u2019s oversight of state DOTs\u2019 DBE activities to GAO  reports on oversight and accountability, including GAO guidance on  internal controls. Additionally, to address the three objectives, we  reviewed the findings of the National Review Team (NRT) that FHWA  established to oversee DBE program implementation on American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) projects.  Separately, to examine how FHWA assesses whether state DOTs are  meeting their DBE goals, we analyzed FHWA\u2019s national data on state  DOTs\u2019 committed and actual spending and how FHWA determined  whether state DOTs achieved their DBE goals for fiscal years 2006  through 2010. We conducted selected quality checks of the data,  compared FHWA\u2019s national data to the data in the Uniform Report of DBE  Awards or Commitments and Payments (commonly referred to as the  Uniform Report) for the five state DOTs that we contacted, and resolved  inconsistencies with the appropriate agency officials.

State DOTs must meet as much of their DBE participation goal as  possible using race-neutral methods\u2014actions that assist all small businesses without  consideration of DBE status. When a state cannot achieve its goal using race-neutral  methods, it must use race-conscious methods\u2014actions used to assist only DBEs\u2014to  meet the remaining portion of the goal. The primary race-conscious method is setting  contract goals on individual U.S. DOT-assisted contracts. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 26.51. See also 49  C.F.R. \u00a7 26.5.

Actual spending  includes spending on contracts completed in the fiscal year and can  include contracts that were awarded in previous years.", "State DOTs award contracts to prime contractors, which may be DBEs, and prime  contractors award subcontracts to DBE subcontractors, or commit to provide funds to DBE  subcontractors. For each reporting period, the DBE regulations require state DOTs to  provide data on the total amount of federal funds that are awarded to DBEs on U.S. DOT- assisted prime contracts, and the total amount of federal funds that are awarded or  committed to DBEs on U.S. DOT-assisted subcontracts. 49 C.F.R. part 26, appendix B.

Specifically, DBEs must be  small businesses that are at least 51 percent owned by one or more  individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged, and that  are managed, operated, and controlled by these owners. (See app. II  for more details on the eligibility requirements.) Organizations that certify  DBEs must take many steps to ensure that a DBE firm meets certification  requirements\u2014this includes, among other things, reviewing firms\u2019  applications for certification; conducting on-site visits and interviews; and  reviewing licenses, stock ownership, equipment, work completed,  resumes of principal owners, and the bonding and financial capacity of  the firm. Furthermore, DBEs are certified only in the type or types of work,  such as paving, that they can perform. According to U.S. DOT, in 2009,  about 27,000 DBEs were certified under its program.", "Generally, organizations within each state that receive DOT funds decide  which organizations within the state can certify DBEs. While some states  have multiple organizations certifying DBEs, others have one certifying  organization. For example, in the five states we focused on as part of this  review, four states (Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin) have  multiple organizations within the state that certify DBEs, and the  remaining state (Washington) has one organization that certifies DBEs for  the entire state. Each state is required by DBE regulations to have a  unified approach to certification so that the certification decisions of one  organization are honored by all the organizations receiving U.S. DOT  funds in the state. This essentially allows for a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for DBE  firms seeking certification, meaning that a DBE only needs to apply for  certification with one organization in the state, rather than apply for  certification from all the organizations in the state with which the DBE  wants to conduct work. The organizations that certify DBEs may include  the state DOT, local airport authorities, state and local transit agencies,  and city and county governments. For example, Florida has 13  organizations that certify DBEs\u2014including Florida DOT, the Greater  Orlando Aviation Authority, and Miami-Dade County. See figure 1 for  examples of organizations that certify DBEs.", "The type of work a DBE performs and the DBE\u2019s geographic location can  play a role in some states in determining which organization in the state  reviews a firm\u2019s application for certification and certifies the firm as a  DBE. State DOTs primarily review applications and certify DBEs that work  on highway projects, while local airport authorities and state and local  transit agencies primarily review applications and certify DBEs that work  on airport and transit projects, respectively. Nevertheless, the DBEs  certified by organizations other than state DOTs (such as local airport  authorities and state and local transit agencies) can also work on highway  projects if the type of work they are certified to perform can be applied to  both airport or transit and highway projects. For example, if a DBE is  certified to do paving, this DBE may be able to do paving work on both  highway and airport projects. Geographic location may also play a role in  determining which organization reviews a firm\u2019s application for  certification and certifies DBEs. For example, a county government in  Wisconsin certifies DBEs from six nearby counties in the state, regardless  of whether the DBE is interested in working on federal highway, transit, or  airport projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA\u2019s Oversight of State DOT DBE Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHWA Uses a Risk-Based Approach to Oversee State DOT DBE Programs and Has Identified the DBE Program as a Risk Area", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies should perform a number of oversight activities to  safeguard against fraud and to ensure that federal programs meet their  objectives and comply with federal regulations.

Furthermore, the office identified specific risk areas within the DBE  program, including DBE goals and DBE certifications. Given the Office  of Civil Rights\u2019 identification of the DBE program as a risk area, the  office has taken actions, such as hiring a full-time DBE Program  Manager, to help address the potential problems identified (e.g.,  fraud, improper program implementation, and other risks).", "Division office risk assessments. In 2010, 23 of 52 FHWA division  offices identified the DBE program as a risk area. These divisions  identified the DBE program as a risk area because of, among other  things, challenges related to the stewardship and administration of  state DOTs\u2019 DBE programs and to contractor compliance with DBE  program requirements. For example, one division office identified the  DBE program as a risk area because of concerns regarding the  stewardship and oversight of a state DOT\u2019s DBE program that could  lead to, among other things, confusion and lack of understanding  about how to properly implement the DBE program requirements,  increasing the opportunity for fraud and abuse. To address these  risks, the division planned to provide training to state DOT officials on  requirements specified in the DBE regulations and planned to conduct  a program review of the state DOT\u2019s implementation of specific DBE  regulations, such as those related to monitoring and achieving  contract goals.", "Agencywide risk identification.

These risks become key drivers in  developing FHWA\u2019s strategic implementation plan, which reflects the  administration\u2019s priorities for the upcoming year. According to FHWA  officials, FHWA first identified the DBE program as an agencywide  high-risk area in 2007 because the DBE program accounted for 50  percent of the risks identified in the entire civil rights area. This  designation as a high-risk area continued through 2010. In response  to the agencywide designation of the DBE program as a high-risk  area, FHWA has recently increased its oversight of the DBE program.", "FHWA division officials we interviewed from all five of the states we  focused on said that they monitor state DOT activities on an ongoing  basis to help oversee all federal-aid highway programs implemented by  state DOTs, including the DBE program, and to help identify areas that  need increased oversight attention. For example, one division official we  interviewed said that as a part of his day-to-day oversight, he reviews the  state DOT\u2019s process for setting contract goals. In some instances, this  division official said that he found that the state DOT had set all contract  goals too low to meet the state DOT\u2019s DBE goal. Furthermore, officials  from all five of the division offices said that they participate in meetings  with state DOTs and/or receive reports from state DOTs that help them  identify areas where there may be problems and where they need to  focus their attention. For example, one division office that we focused on  as part of our review requires its state DOT to provide quarterly progress  reports on DBE contract goals. The official we interviewed from this  division office said that these reports help her identify issues, such as  issues related to goals on individual U.S. DOT-assisted contracts, which  she may not otherwise hear about from her daily interactions with the  state DOT.", "In 2007 and 2008, FHWA conducted program reviews of all its federal-aid  highway programs, including the DBE program. FHWA conducted these  reviews to determine which federal highway programs required greater  federal oversight and assistance. For the DBE program reviews, FHWA  officials\u2014including those from the divisions\u2014reviewed each state DOT\u2019s  implementation of the DBE regulations to determine if the state DOT  needed more federal oversight and assistance in implementing the  regulations. Based on the results of the 2007 and 2008 reviews,  FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights decided to conduct the DBE program  reviews again in 2010 and 2011.

In January 2011, U.S. DOT updated its DBE regulations  to, among other things, add a requirement for state DOTs to analyze  in detail the reasons for any difference between their state DOT DBE  goal and the amount of federal funds the state DOT committed to  spend on DBEs for each fiscal year. State DOTs must then establish  specific steps and milestones to correct the problems they identified in  their analysis and to fully meet its DBE goal in the next fiscal year.  These requirements went into effect in February 2011. According to  U.S. DOT, the added requirement will help state DOTs understand,  when applicable, why their DBE goals are not being met, and will  increase state DOTs\u2019 accountability for meeting DBE goals. Based on  FHWA\u2019s most recent data, 54 percent of state DOTs did not meet  their DBE goals in fiscal year 2010 and would have been subject to  this requirement in fiscal year 2010 if it had been in effect.

In response to FHWA\u2019s 2009 risk  assessment, FHWA established the NRT to review six areas,  including the DBE program, that posed a nationwide risk of misuse of  Recovery Act funds. FHWA used the results of the NRT review to  identify areas for improved oversight and training. For example, the  NRT identified concerns about the process that some state DOTs  were using to evaluate whether prime contractors bidding on contracts  made adequate good faith efforts to meet DBE contract goals.  Specifically, in one of these states, the NRT found that the state DOT  awarded a majority of its contracts to prime contractors who did not  meet the DBE contract goals, but provided documentation that they  made good faith efforts to do so. While DBE regulations allow state  DOTs to award contracts based on bidders\u2019 good faith efforts and do  not limit the number of contracts that can be awarded in this way,  FHWA officials explained that awarding a high number of contracts on  the basis of good faith efforts might be a reason state DOTs do not  meet their state DBE goals. To address these concerns, the FHWA  division in this state trained state DOT staff on this issue, tracked the  number of contracts that the state DOT awarded based on good faith  efforts on a monthly basis, and further reviewed the state DOT\u2019s  process for evaluating prime contractor good faith efforts to ensure  that the state DOT was complying with the DBE regulations.  Furthermore, on a nationwide level, FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights  increased its training to FHWA\u2019s division officials on this issue.", "In addition to these steps, FHWA took a number of other actions. For  example, it increased its training on the DBE program for FHWA division  offices. FHWA also increased its focus on the DBE program during  national seminars and conferences. Furthermore, FHWA included the  DBE program, along with other civil rights areas, in its 2011 strategic  implementation plan. According to FHWA officials, the significance of this  is that the 2011 plan marked the first time that civil rights programs,  including the DBE program, were given agencywide attention.", "It is too early to determine the effectiveness of the recently implemented  oversight activities described above. But each of the oversight activities  could help FHWA protect against fraud in the DBE program, ensure that  the DBE program is meeting its objectives, and identify areas where state  DOTs may not be in compliance with the regulations. According to FHWA  officials, if they find that a state DOT has fallen short in meeting any part  of the DBE regulations, the FHWA division will work with the state DOT to  bring the state DOT back into compliance. According to officials at  FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, should a state DOT refuse to comply with  any part of the regulation without seeking a waiver from the Secretary of  Transportation, FHWA would then consider other options, including  withholding federal funds from the state DOT pursuant to regulations.45,   For example, one of the divisions we spoke with said that because of  noncompliance with parts of the DBE regulations, it presented a letter of  possible funds withholding to a state DOT.

Actual spending data are based on  completed contracts\u2014some of which could have been awarded in  previous fiscal years\u2014while a state DOT\u2019s DBE goal reflects what state  DOTs will expect to spend on DBEs on contracts that are awarded or  committed in the current fiscal year. This difference in time frames and  when contracts are awarded makes it difficult to compare the state DOTs\u2019  actual spending with its DBE goals. FHWA officials roughly estimate  about 50 percent of contracts are completed in the fiscal year in which  they were awarded. Actual spending for the remaining estimated 50  percent of contracts cover multiple years between award and completion,  and are not included in Uniform Reports until these contracts are  completed.

According to U.S. DOT officials, FHWA\u2019s practice of using committed  spending is a convention necessary to provide timely reporting; if FHWA  used actual spending to determine whether DBE goals were met, it would  have to wait several years for some contracts to be completed. Based on  the committed spending data in the Uniform Reports, about half of the  state DOTs met their DBE goals each fiscal year from fiscal years 2006  through 2010. See appendix III for the number and percentage of state  DOTs meeting their DBE goals from fiscal years 2006 through 2010,  based on committed spending data.", "FHWA has not conducted a nationwide analysis comparing committed  spending to actual spending to know whether it is a reasonable proxy for  actual spending. Thus, committed spending on DBEs may or may not  definitively show whether state DOTs met their DBE goals. According to  FHWA and state DOT officials, committed spending could be similar to  actual spending, or it could differ from actual spending. Specifically, an  FHWA headquarters official told us about two cases where she personally  compared committed to actual spending, and found that the committed  spending was close to actual spending. The headquarters official said  that in one of the two cases, she compared committed to actual spending  on individual contracts and in the second case, she compared committed  to actual spending on completed contracts historically, over a period of  time. Separately, FHWA and state DOT officials we contacted said that  committed spending could be lower or higher than actual spending. For  example, an FHWA official from one state we focused on said prime  contractors\u2019 committed spending on DBEs may be higher than actual  spending on some projects because of changes to the contract that  reduce the amount of work performed by DBEs. In another state, a state  DOT official said a prime contractor\u2019s committed spending on DBEs at the  start of a contract may be 8 percent, but the actual spending on DBEs at  the end of the contract may be only 2 percent. The official said in fiscal  year 2008 the state DOT did not meet its fiscal year 2008 DBE goal  because the prime contractor on a highway project spanning multiple  years spent less on DBEs than committed.", "FHWA\u2019s NRT also found that committed spending may not match actual  spending and thus may not provide a complete picture of whether state  DOTs are meeting their DBE goals. The NRT offered findings and  recommendations to two of the five state DOTs that we contacted during  our review pertaining to the issue of data on committed and actual  spending. For example, the NRT found that one state DOT did not require  a prime contractor to provide information to the state DOT on actual  spending on DBEs if the contractor provides work to a DBE after the DBE  goal on the contract is met. Thus, according to the NRT report, the state  DOT may not accurately capture or report all actual spending to DBEs,  and as a result may spend more on DBEs than committed. In another  state, the NRT recommended that the state DOT compare committed to  actual spending on DBEs on completed DBE subcontracts to help ensure  that the DBE program was compliant at the project level. Furthermore, in  addition to the NRT\u2019s findings, the U.S. DOT Office of Inspector General  recommended in another state that the state DOT capture all actual  spending on DBEs regardless of whether the DBE goal on a contract had  already been met.", "Without a nationwide analysis comparing committed spending to actual  spending, FHWA cannot be certain whether committed spending reflects  actual spending for DBEs in all state DOTs. Therefore, FHWA does not  know whether its data on committed spending can be relied on to  evaluate state DOTs\u2019 progress in meeting goals; hold state DOTs  accountable for meeting their DBE goals, as emphasized in U.S. DOT\u2019s  update to its regulations; make program decisions based on whether  state DOTs are meeting their DBE goals on an annual basis; or provide  assistance to state DOTs that are not meeting their goals. Furthermore, if  committed spending data on DBEs do not reflect actual spending on  DBEs, then state DOTs might potentially take inappropriate action or  inaction, depending on whether the data show a state DOT has met its  DBE goal. For example, if the data on committed spending show a state  DOT is meeting its goal, it might, as one state DOT said it does,  discontinue setting DBE contract goals, which are DBE goals on  individual U.S. DOT-assisted contracts. If the data on committed  spending do not reasonably match actual spending, however, then the  state DOT might stop its use of DBE contract goals prematurely.", "U.S. DOT has a departmentwide working group that, according to a U.S.  DOT official, considers various improvements to the administration of the  DBE program, including improvements to the various reporting forms  used in the DBE program.  As part of its efforts, this working group is  considering revising the form\u2014the Uniform Report\u2014that state DOTs use  to report committed and actual spending on DBEs. In February 2011,  the members reviewing the Uniform Report held their first meeting but did  not determine what changes to recommend. This working group could  provide an opportunity for FHWA to identify options it can use to evaluate  whether the committed spending data it uses to determine if state DOTs  have met their DBE goals is a reasonable proxy for actual spending and  whether this data can be relied on to measure progress towards goals.

Officials we interviewed from  U.S. DOT\u2019s and FHWA\u2019s Offices of Civil Rights described an oversight  approach in which the oversight of the certification activities of the  organizations that certify DBEs is delegated to one of the  administrations\u2014depending on which administration provides federal  funding to the organization. For example, FHWA is responsible for  overseeing the certification activities of state DOTs\u2014which primarily  certify DBEs that work on highway projects\u2014because these state DOTs  receive federal-aid highway funds. FTA and FAA are responsible for  overseeing certifying organizations, such as state transit agencies and  local airport authorities, that receive federal transit and aviation funds,  respectively. Defining roles and responsibilities in this way can help  federal agencies effectively oversee programs, particularly when multiple  federal entities are involved in oversight. In addition to FHWA\u2019s, FAA\u2019s,  and FTA\u2019s responsibilities for certification oversight, officials from U.S.  DOT\u2019s Office of Civil Rights said that their role, prior to the 2011 update to  the DBE regulations, was and continues to be to review and make  decisions on DBE certification appeals. According to officials, under the  updated DBE regulations that went into effect in February 2011, U.S.  DOT\u2019s Office of Civil Rights will have additional responsibilities to enforce  and oversee DBE certifications.", "FHWA officials we interviewed said that their responsibilities for  overseeing state DOT DBE programs included overseeing the state  DOTs\u2019 certification activities. As discussed earlier in this report, FHWA  oversees state DOTs\u2019 implementation of the DBE program\u2014including  how state DOT\u2019s certify DBEs\u2014using risk assessments and program  reviews. For example, in conducting their annual risk assessments,  FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and FHWA division offices consider risks  related to the DBE program, including how state DOTs certify DBEs.  Furthermore, in the 2010 and 2011 program reviews, FHWA division  offices assessed whether state DOTs were following U.S. DOT\u2019s  regulatory eligibility requirements and certification procedures when they  certified DBEs. In addition to these activities, U.S. DOT\u2019s Inspector  General\u2019s Office (IG) has a role in overseeing DBE certifications. In April  2011, the IG announced that it would conduct an audit of the DBE  program, and officials from the IG indicated that they plan to review  certifications of DBEs as part of this audit.", "In addition to risk assessments and program reviews, all five FHWA  division offices we focused on conducted additional oversight activities to  oversee the certification activities of state DOTs. As is the case with the  oversight of other aspects of the DBE program and other federal-aid  highway programs, FHWA divisions use their discretion to determine how  much and how often to carry out these additional oversight activities. For  example, one FHWA division participates in annual reviews of the state\u2019s  DBE certification processes, procedures, and activities\u2014which includes  conducting spot-checks of selected certification files and interviewing  personnel engaged in managing, supervising, and performing certification  activities.

FTA\u2019s and FAA\u2019s oversight of  these organizations is relevant for federal-aid highway projects because  these organizations certify DBEs that can work on highway projects. For  example, officials from one certifying organization we interviewed said  that while it is a transit agency, about 40 percent of the DBEs it certifies  could work on transit projects as well as other types of projects, such as  highway projects, because the skills needed for transit and highway  projects are similar. According to U.S. DOT officials, it is common for a  DBE to work on more than one type of project, such as on airport and  highway projects.

FHWA\u2019s oversight  of how state DOTs implement their DBE programs is critical for ensuring  that the programs are implemented according to U.S. DOT\u2019s DBE  regulations. FHWA has taken several steps, some of which have been  recently implemented, which could help ensure state DOTs\u2019 compliance  with DBE regulations. However, FHWA faces fundamental problems in  the data it uses to oversee DBE participation. Knowing whether a  program is meeting its goals and ensuring that data accurately reflects  federal dollars spent is a primary responsibility of oversight. Without  addressing its fundamental data problems, FHWA cannot effectively  make program decisions and implement DBE regulations. For example, if  the extent to which state DOTs are meeting their goals is unclear, FHWA  will not be able to effectively hold state DOTs accountable for meeting  their DBE goals, as emphasized in U.S. DOT\u2019s update to its regulations.   Further, without addressing its data problems, FHWA cannot be sure that  the data that shows that about half of the state DOTs are meeting their  DBE goals from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is accurate.

U.S. DOT\u2019s comments on our draft  recommendations covered two broad areas: the reliability of committed  spending data and data limitations. Specifically, U.S. DOT commented  that the committed spending data that FHWA is using is the most reliable  and accurate data available to determine on a timely basis whether state  DOTs are meeting their DBE goals.  U.S. DOT also commented that the  information presented in our report on committed spending does not  relate to the reliability of the committed spending data but rather relates to  the reporting of these data.  However, as stated in our report, FHWA may  or may not be able to rely on committed spending data to measure  progress towards goals because FHWA does not know whether  committed spending is a reasonable proxy for actual spending. We  clarified our first recommendation to better reflect the need for FHWA to  evaluate if the proxy data can be relied on to determine whether state  DOTs are meeting their DBE goals. U.S. DOT agreed to consider our  modified recommendation.  Regarding the second recommendation, U.S.  DOT officials commented that ensuring that the appropriate  methodological disclosures are included in their reporting was not enough  of an issue to warrant a recommendation.  As we note in our report,  including statements about the potential limitations of spending data is  important because it improves transparency of the data so that decision  makers can oversee and monitor progress of the DBE program  appropriately.  Consequently, we retained this recommendation with  slightly revised language.  U.S. DOT officials noted that they would re- evaluate their disclosures with regard to the data used to determine if  DBE goals are met.

Specifically, we reviewed the Safe, Accountable,  Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users  (SAFETEA-LU) and other relevant legislation, such as the Surface  Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA), which authorized U.S.  DOT\u2019s DBE program. In addition, we reviewed the GPRA Modernization  Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) and Executive Order 13576 on delivering an  efficient, effective, and accountable government. We also reviewed U.S.  DOT\u2019s regulations on the DBE program that describe state DOTs\u2019  requirements for implementing the DBE program, as well as proposed  and final rules that U.S. DOT published in the Federal Register which  recently amended DBE regulations. We also reviewed and analyzed  U.S. DOT, FHWA Office of Civil Rights, and FHWA division office  documents on the DBE program, including procedures and guidance on  DBE goals, certifications, DBE program implementation, and oversight of  the DBE program. Furthermore, we reviewed and analyzed prior GAO  reports and other reports on the DBE program, oversight, and  accountability in the federal government, including GAO standards and  guidance on internal controls. We used some of these reports to assess  FHWA\u2019s oversight of the DBE program.", "Furthermore, we conducted semistructured interviews on topics related to  our objectives. In particular, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  officials from U.S. DOT and FHWA in headquarters, including officials  from U.S. DOT\u2019s Office of General Counsel, U.S. DOT\u2019s Office of Civil  Rights, and FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. In addition, we conducted  semistructured interviews with representatives from associations,  including the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials, Associated General Contractors of America, American Road &  Transportation Builders Association, Conference of Minority  Transportation Officials, and National Association of Minority Contractors.  We interviewed officials from these associations because they are  national associations knowledgeable about the DBE program, and  because these national associations represent various stakeholders  involved in the DBE program, such as state DOT officials and contractors.  We also reviewed documentation from and interviewed officials in five  states:  Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, and Wisconsin. We  judgmentally selected these states to obtain variation in geographic  location, state population, state DOT use of race-conscious and/or race- neutral methods to meet DBE goals, whether state DOTs met their overall  DBE goals, and number of certifying organizations within the states. We  also considered whether the state used a disparity study to determine its  DBE participation goal, whether the state was involved in litigation  regarding the DBE program, whether the state was located within the  jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and  recommendations from stakeholders who are familiar with the DBE  program. We visited Florida because it was the only state mentioned by  stakeholders that met its goal by using only race-neutral methods. In each  of the selected states, we interviewed FHWA division officials and state  DOT Civil Rights and DBE Program managers. Finally, in Florida,  Wisconsin, and Washington, we interviewed prime contractors and DBE  firms, or organizations in the state that represented the DBE firms.", "In addition to these efforts, to describe how FHWA oversees state DOT  DBE programs to ensure that the state DOTs are complying with DBE  regulations, we reviewed and analyzed information related to FHWA\u2019s  oversight activities. For example, we obtained and reviewed  documentation from FHWA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and FHWA divisions  on FHWA\u2019s risk assessment process and DBE program reviews. We also  conducted semistructured interviews with the National Review Team  (NRT) that FHWA established to assess DBE program implementation on  Recovery Act projects. We also reviewed the findings of the NRT\u2019s  review, which provided a programmatic assessment of oversight at a  national level while also providing insights for the specific states we  selected for this review.

We also compared FHWA\u2019s national data to the data in the  Uniform Reports for the five state DOTs that we contacted, and resolved  inconsistencies with FHWA and the state DOTs. Given our review of the  data provided to us by FHWA, we identified problems with the data  FHWA uses to assess whether state DOTs achieved their DBE goals.  These issues are discussed in this report. Even so, our review of FHWA\u2019s  national data provided us with a perspective on how FHWA compiled and  used these data. Additionally, because data on actual spending on DBEs  cannot be used to determine if state DOTs met their DBE goals, in  appendix III, we determined the number and percentage of state DOTs  meeting overall DBE goals based on committed spending data on DBEs  for all state DOTs to illustrate orders of magnitude.
