The mortgage insurance allows private lenders to provide qualified borrowers with favorable mortgage terms, such as a 3-percent down payment, and generally compensates lenders for nearly all of the losses incurred on such loans. To support the program, FHA imposes up-front and annual mortgage insurance premiums on home buyers. FHA\u2019s single-family mortgage program currently does not require a federal credit subsidy to operate. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI), which supports this program, is required by law to contain sufficient reserves and funding to cover the estimated future payment of claims on foreclosed mortgages and other costs. FHA\u2019s current mortgage limits vary across the country from $261,609 in high-cost areas to $144,336 in low-cost areas. FHA uses management and marketing contractors to perform certain maintenance on foreclosed properties and to sell the properties to home buyers or investors.", "VA\u2019s mortgage loan program is an entitlement program that provides eligible veterans with housing benefits. The VA guaranty program allows mortgage lenders to extend loans to eligible veterans on favorable terms, such as a no-down-payment loan, and provides lenders with substantial financial protections against the losses associated with extending such mortgages. To help support the program, veterans are required to pay a funding fee of 1.25 to 3.0 percent of the loan amount. In addition, the program is financed by credit subsidy appropriations to the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Account.", "RHS operates a guaranteed loan program to help rural Americans with low and moderate incomes purchase single-family homes. The RHS guaranteed loan program does not require borrowers to make down payments or pay monthly mortgage insurance fees. To help offset losses to the government associated with providing financial protections to lenders who make RHS mortgages, RHS currently requires lenders to pay a guarantee fee of 2 percent of the mortgage principal loan amount, which they may pass on to borrowers.", "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are private corporations chartered by Congress to provide a continuous flow of funds to mortgage lenders and borrowers. To fulfill their responsibilities of stabilizing the nation\u2019s mortgage markets and expanding homeownership opportunities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders across the country and package them into mortgage-backed securities. Most mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase are conventional mortgages (i.e., mortgages with no government mortgage insurance or guarantees). They purchase single-family mortgages up to the \u201cconforming loan limit,\u201d which is now set at $300,700. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac typically require mortgage insurance from private companies on any mortgage purchases with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 80 percent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finance their mortgage purchases through borrowing or issuing mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors.", "Mortgage servicers, such as large mortgage finance companies or commercial banks, typically service mortgages insured or guaranteed by FHA, VA, or RHS or purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Mortgage servicers do not necessarily finance the mortgages they service, but rather service mortgages for a fee on behalf of those entities that own mortgages, such as lenders, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac. Large servicers typically service FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac mortgages, and some service RHS mortgages. Mortgage servicing involves administrative activities such as collecting monthly mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts for property taxes and hazard insurance, and forwarding proper payments to purchasers of the loans. Mortgage servicers also are generally responsible for \u201closs mitigation\u201d (see fig. 1) and for conducting foreclosure proceedings.

For example, servicers may be directed to mail a notice to the borrower, post a notice of the foreclosure on the affected property, and publish notice of the foreclosure in local newspapers. State laws also generally require servicers or public officials to conduct foreclosure sales. At the foreclosure sale, the servicer purchases the property by bidding the amount of the outstanding debt or the property fair market value.

During redemption periods, the organizations or servicers are generally not permitted to pursue additional foreclosure proceedings, such as evicting property residents or securing the properties. According to a Freddie Mac official, state redemption periods range from 10 days to 9 months. If properties are vacant, some state laws may permit the shortening of redemption periods and allow the organizations or servicers to take control of foreclosed properties.", "After foreclosure sales and applicable redemption periods, the organizations or servicers typically proceed with eviction proceedings if foreclosed properties are not already vacant. State laws generally govern eviction proceedings and provide certain protections to the residents of foreclosed properties. For example, state laws require servicers or the organizations to notify property residents before the initiation of an eviction lawsuit. For example, some states have notification periods that range from 3 to 7 days.", "Homeowners may also file for bankruptcy proceedings under federal law, a procedure that can extend foreclosure proceedings.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac direct their servicers to initiate foreclosure proceedings at earlier stages than FHA, VA, and RHS. According to Fannie Mae officials, while the organization directs servicers to proceed with foreclosure at an earlier stage than the government organizations, servicers are also required to continue pursuing loss mitigation efforts. Fannie Mae officials said that the organization directs foreclosures at an earlier stage to help minimize losses and because borrowers are more likely to be receptive to loss mitigation efforts when foreclosure is pending. Fannie Mae officials said that the simultaneous approach of loss mitigation and foreclosure proceedings is advantageous because it enables more borrowers to retain their homes and reduce losses in the event loss mitigation is not successful. Freddie Mac officials also stressed that loss mitigation efforts continue even after the initiation of foreclosure proceedings. A Freddie Mac official told us that in some cases the organization, servicers, and borrowers have worked out loss mitigation agreements on the date of foreclosure sales. FHA, VA, and RHS officials said that they have public missions and obligations to their customers, such as low-income Americans, veterans, and rural residents, and take additional time to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, each of these organizations also encourage their servicers to continue pursuing loss mitigation efforts after the initiation of foreclosure proceedings.", "Table 3 summarizes the procedures that the organizations have established to conduct foreclosures. As shown in the first row of table 3, all of the organizations expect servicers to follow established foreclosure time frames, which can vary by state.  Organization officials said that they have analyzed the foreclosure laws and bankruptcy laws in each state and collected data on past foreclosure proceedings to determine how long it should take servicers to complete the foreclosure process in each state. The organizations may reward servicers financially for meeting or beating these deadlines and may impose financial penalties where servicers fail to meet the guidelines. For example, FHA generally does not compensate servicers for their interest expenses if they exceed the established deadlines.", "As shown in the second row of table 3, the organizations have developed differing approaches regarding the law firms that mortgage servicers use to conduct foreclosures. In certain states, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have identified law firms that are available to servicers in conducting foreclosures. Referred to as \u201cretained\u201d or \u201cdesignated\u201d attorneys, these law firms conduct all of the legal procedures related to foreclosures. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac officials said that the designated attorneys have significant experience in foreclosure work and can ensure that the process is completed in the most efficient manner possible. VA, FHA, and RHS do not designate attorneys but rather permit servicers to choose the law firms that they will employ to carry out foreclosures. According to FHA, while the use of designated attorneys may be more efficient than allowing servicers to choose their own law firms, as a mortgage insurer FHA lacks the prerogative to designate attorneys for its servicers.", "Also, as noted in table 3, the organizations have established different bidding instructions for servicers at foreclosure sales. VA instructs servicers to bid the property fair market value less foreclosure expenses, while Freddie Mac instructs servicers to bid the outstanding debt on foreclosed properties or the fair market value. In some cases, the properties\u2019 fair market value may be less than the outstanding debt. While RHS does not require servicers to follow specific bidding instructions, the organization allows servicers to bid at 85 percent of the fair market value when the property value is less than the outstanding loan balance. According to organization officials, these instructions, by allowing bids below the outstanding debt or fair market value, are designed to encourage third parties such as investors to bid at foreclosure sales, thus permitting the organizations to avoid the costs associated with selling such properties. However, organization and servicer officials estimate that only about 3 to 5 percent of foreclosed properties are sold to third parties, because the properties are frequently occupied and investors are not allowed to inspect the properties unless they are vacant. Freddie Mac officials also said that bidding below a property\u2019s outstanding debt allows financial institutions to pursue deficiency judgments against defaulted borrowers.", "In contrast, Fannie Mae and FHA generally instruct servicers to bid the outstanding debt plus foreclosure expenses, an amount that may be significantly higher than the fair market value. Although Fannie Mae and FHA bidding instructions deter third-party bids and result in the organizations themselves selling the properties, officials said that the instructions were cost-effective. Fannie Mae and FHA officials said that the costs associated with enticing third-party bids at foreclosure sales, such as the costs for conducting appraisals to determine fair market value, were not justified by the relatively low percentage of successful third-party bids. FHA officials said that they rarely pursue deficiency judgments because most defaulted borrowers have minimal, if any, recoverable assets."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FHA Property Custody Procedures Delay Maintenance and Marketing", "paragraphs": ["VA, RHS, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac follow a similar approach in that the organizations, or servicers in the case of RHS, have custody of and are responsible for maintaining foreclosed properties from the time of the foreclosure sale until the properties are sold to home buyers or investors.

FHA procedures (1) prevent the timely initiation of critical property maintenance and marketing, as is practiced by the other organizations; (2) can delay conveyance to FHA management and marketing contractors due to time-consuming procedures necessary to perform maintenance that exceeds established cost ceilings; and (3) result in disputes between FHA servicers and management and marketing contractors after property conveyance.

The organizations and their vendors or contractors are responsible for overseeing properties during redemption periods, evicting property residents, performing necessary property maintenance, and selling the properties. Although RHS\u2019s approach differs in that servicers never convey foreclosed properties, property custody is unified. RHS servicers are responsible for overseeing properties throughout the foreclosure process, maintaining the properties, and selling them. RHS establishes a 6-month deadline for servicers to sell foreclosed properties, measured from the date of the foreclosure sale, and will generally not compensate servicers for any liquidation expenses incurred beyond the deadline.", "In contrast, FHA divides property custody and maintenance responsibilities between its servicers and contractors, which operate largely independently of one another. FHA requires servicers to oversee properties during postforeclosure sale redemption periods, to evict residents if properties are occupied, and to perform critical maintenance on properties (also known as \u201cpreservation and protection\u201d). Under FHA procedures, servicers are to initiate preservation and protection work on the date that they obtain \u201cpossession and control\u201d of the properties, typically the date that tenants are evicted or when the servicers determine that the property is vacant (see fig. 4). Servicers have 30 days to complete the preservation and protection work, convey the properties to FHA\u2019s management and marketing contractors, and then file claims with FHA to recover the costs associated with the foreclosures. FHA typically reimburses servicers for the costs associated with performing preservation and protection work.", "The management and marketing contractors also have ongoing preservation and protection responsibilities that can overlap those of the servicers (see table 4).

VA and RHS officials we contacted expressed similar views about the benefits of unified property custody.", "In contrast, by dividing responsibility between servicers and contractors, FHA procedures prevent the initiation of all maintenance necessary to protect foreclosed properties and sell them quickly. Rather, FHA procedures can prevent the initiation of critical maintenance until after servicers convey foreclosed properties to management and marketing contractors\u2014up to 30 days or more after the possession and control date.Current FHA guidance does not require servicers to clean up exterior and interior debris left on properties  unless it poses public health and safety risks. The presence of such nonhazardous debris (such as discarded furniture) for extended periods can reduce buyer interest in the properties and negatively affect neighborhoods. Property maintenance is further complicated by the fact that some local FHA offices require servicers to clean up all exterior debris, regardless of whether it is a hazard or not, while others require only hazardous debris removal. An FHA official we contacted said that FHA is working on regulations that will require servicers to remove all exterior debris. However, the FHA official said that the revised regulations will not require servicers to remove nonhazardous debris from property interiors.", "FHA procedures can also require a substantial amount of interpretation by servicers and management and marketing contractors. For example, servicers are required to determine whether debris left on foreclosed properties poses \u201cimmediate\u201d health and safety risks and whether to remove such debris.  If servicers determine that an object such as an abandoned vehicle does not pose an immediate health risk, they may decide to leave it on the property. An FHA official also said that since servicers are responsible for lawn maintenance but are not responsible for removing nonhazardous exterior debris, servicers would technically be within regulations to cut the grass around debris left on the properties. An FHA official said that FHA\u2019s new regulations will require servicers to remove exterior debris and cut the entire lawn.", "FHA\u2019s divided approach to property custody also prevents the immediate development of marketing strategies. Representatives from management and marketing contractors that we contacted said that they often do not learn about foreclosed properties until servicers convey the properties to the contractors, which could be months after the foreclosure sale.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac officials said that in cases in which required maintenance exceeds established limits, vendors call the organizations or submit fax requests. According to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac officials, their staffs work closely with their vendors and generally review and make final decisions on requests within 1 or 2 days, frequently via E-mail or telephone call. A VA official said that its 46 district offices have maintenance cost guidelines that are set within prevailing local rates. According to the VA official, when contractors determine that maintenance will exceed established rates, they call VA officials or representatives for decisions, which are typically granted within a day or two. The VA official said that contractors are subsequently required to submit photographs or other evidence to support these expenditures and VA performs audits to assess the appropriateness of these costs.", "Because FHA servicers and contractors act largely independently of one another, rather than in a coordinated fashion, FHA maintains a comparatively formal and time-consuming system for reviewing property maintenance proposals that exceed established cost ceilings. FHA expects servicers to complete preservation and protection work, including work exceeding established cost limits, within the 30-day period between possession and control and property conveyance. Servicers must submit written proposals to management and marketing contractors for review, and FHA regional officials must approve such requests as well. FHA allows the management and marketing contractors 10 days to review the servicers\u2019 requests and to respond in writing. If contractors fail to respond in writing within 10 days, FHA regulations require servicers to follow up with the contractors until the servicers receive a written response. FHA, through its contractors, may also require servicers to obtain written bids from outside providers for work exceeding the established limits. For example, a senior FHA official said that servicers are required to obtain written bids when proposed removal of hazardous exterior debris removal exceeds established cost ceilings (see fig. 5).", "According to FHA servicer representatives we contacted, obtaining permission from management and marketing contractors to do maintenance that exceeds FHA\u2019s cost ceilings can delay conveyance.

For example, we contacted a judgmental sample of seven VA district offices nationwide and found that six require title insurance policies at conveyance. VA reimburses servicers for the full costs associated with these policies. FHA also typically provides financing for new title insurance policies when its foreclosed properties are sold to home buyers or investors, while some VA offices may provide similar financing.", "FHA and VA officials said that title insurance policies provide an extra level of assurance that the organizations have title to foreclosed properties.

Several management and marketing contractor representatives that we contacted also said that they do not collect data on how often FHA title insurance policies are invoked after conveyance. However, the contractor representatives also said that title insurance policies were rarely if ever needed during the foreclosed property sale process.", "Senior FHA officials said that they were not certain whether the costs associated with purchasing title insurance policies were justified and were considering revising these policies. FHA officials also stated that the state foreclosure laws require servicers\u2019 attorneys to conduct title searches to ensure that all parties may be notified and the foreclosure properly conducted. These title searches are conducted prior to the foreclosure sale, and FHA compensates servicers for the costs associated with these title searches. FHA officials stated that the title insurance policies that servicers subsequently purchase are based on the same title searches. Therefore, the FHA officials stated that the title insurance policies offer questionable additional value. We note that two large servicers have made proposals to sell foreclosed properties for FHA, rather than conveying them to management and marketing contractors. The servicers proposed to sell FHA properties without obtaining new title insurance policies.", "VA officials have not implemented the recommendations in a 1995 VA inspector general (IG) report that questioned the cost-effectiveness of the department\u2019s title insurance policy expenditures. Although VA began to encourage servicers to purchase title insurance policies in 1989 to facilitate title reviews on foreclosed properties, the IG report concluded that the policies did not meet this objective. The VA IG report found that title defects were rare and could generally be easily corrected by VA staff. The report also found that VA paid about $23.9 million in title insurance premiums in fiscal years 1992 through 1994, but would have paid only about $121,169 to correct title defects if it had \u201cself-insured\u201d (i.e., paid to resolve these title defects) during the same period. The IG report recommended that VA work with foreclosure attorneys to ensure that foreclosures produce adequate evidence of title and discourage the purchase of title insurance policies. VA agreed in 1995 to direct its district offices to review their title evidence requirements annually and to document that new title insurance policies are cost effective in establishing title.", "Despite this 1995 VA policy, five of the six VA offices we contacted that encourage the purchase of title insurance policies at conveyance could not produce the required memorandum on cost-effectiveness. One VA district office produced a memorandum, which merely stated that it would be cost effective to encourage the purchase of title insurance policies to facilitate title reviews. However, an official at the VA district office in Houston, which does not require a new title insurance policy as evidence of title, said that its servicers generally provide a copy of a title search, which costs about $75, as evidence of title. The VA official said that title searches save time and money associated with obtaining new title policies and that the office rarely encounters title problems when selling foreclosed properties to home buyers or investors.", "Because they do not collect additional data on the cost-effectiveness of title requirements, VA and its district offices cannot determine whether similar strategies to lower the costs of purchasing title insurance policies could be used successfully. According to VA officials, they are in the process of reviewing their approach to foreclosed property management. As part of this review, VA officials said that they are reviewing the cost- effectiveness of the organization\u2019s title insurance expenditures.

These other contributing factors may include the strength of real estate markets and FHA\u2019s sale of foreclosed properties to nonprofit organizations. In addition, the compensation that FHA is required to provide to servicers may help explain the comparatively long period that it takes to sell FHA\u2019s foreclosed properties. Potentially, FHA\u2019s process for compensating servicers for expenses associated with foreclosures inadvertently provides servicers with financial incentives to take the maximum time that FHA allows to complete foreclosure proceedings.", "Servicers typically use borrowed funds to finance the payment of outstanding debt on mortgages in the process of foreclosure. When servicers bid on properties at foreclosure sales, they continue to use borrowed funds to finance the recovered properties. Servicers pay interest on these borrowings, which is referred to as the cost of funds, until they file claims with FHA when properties are conveyed. FHA compensates servicers for their interest expenses at what is known as the debenture interest rate, which is set slightly below the rate at which the foreclosed mortgages were originated. We found that the difference between the servicers\u2019 cost of funds, and the debenture interest rate that these servicers receive, can be significant. Our analysis shows that, from 1985 through the first half of 2001, the FHA debenture rate average consistently exceeded the cost of funds (see fig. 8). In September 2001, during a period of declining interest rates, the difference between this average rate and the cost of funds was about 4.5 percentage points. Given that FHA\u2019s compensation system provides servicers with a potentially significant profit, these servicers appear to have financial incentives to take the maximum time allotted to complete foreclosure proceedings.", "Conversely, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and VA servicers do not receive any interest after foreclosure sales because they convey properties immediately after the foreclosure sales. Therefore, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and VA bear the interest costs associated with holding properties themselves and have financial incentives to complete proceedings and sell properties as quickly as possible. We note that RHS\u2019s compensation system for servicers is similar to that of FHA and may provide its servicers with financial incentives to take the maximum time allotted to complete foreclosure and property sale proceedings. However, RHS has also set strict deadlines for servicers to complete foreclosure proceedings and sell properties. RHS generally requires servicers to sell properties within 6 months of foreclosure sales and will not pay any interest on loss claims beyond that date.

As a result of the inefficiencies in FHA procedures, the organization maintains or has initiated several complex layers of oversight, such as an appeals process and preconveyance inspections, to ensure that properties are properly maintained. FHA officials have appropriately considered alternative procedures to establish unified property custody, but have not yet implemented pilot programs to test their feasibility. Although unified property custody would streamline FHA\u2019s procedures, it need not come at the expense of current FHA policies that encourage servicers to pursue loss mitigation, and it need not result in foreclosure proceedings being initiated faster than is currently the case. Nor would unified custody affect state and federal laws that provide protections to homeowners. If properly designed, unified custody procedures would have built-in financial incentives that preserved foreclosed property values and resulted in faster sales to the benefit of the MMI and to neighboring communities.", "FHA and VA cannot provide information on either the costs of purchasing title insurance policies during the foreclosure process or their benefits. We estimate that FHA and VA spent $31.5 million on new title insurance policies in 2000.

We judgmentally selected these servicers on the basis of their size and willingness to provide data. Specifically, the servicers agreed to provide data on the average amount of time that they held custody of FHA foreclosed properties (from the time of the foreclosure sale until conveyance to FHA management and marketing contractors). We combined these data with national data provided by FHA on the time that it takes its contractors to sell foreclosed properties. Because RHS does not yet collect data on the time that it takes to sell foreclosed properties, we collected data from the two largest RHS mortgage servicers, which service about 30 percent of all RHS mortgages. We focused our analysis on the time from the foreclosure sale until properties are sold to homeowners or investors, because the organizations encourage servicers to pursue loss mitigation strategies until foreclosure sales. The organizations generally consider loss mitigation as the best means to minimize the cost and disruptions associated with foreclosures, and we did not want to imply that the completion of foreclosure sales should proceed any faster than is currently the case. The period of time from foreclosure sale until properties are sold to investors is also a common measure of performance in the real estate industry.

We agree that FHA data show a significant decline in the average time that management marketing contractors held properties between 1999 and 2001.  In fact, FHA data show that nearly all of the improvement in inventory time occurred by 2000.  Specifically, data that FHA provided subsequent to the official comment letter show that the average inventory time declined from 270 days in calendar year 1999 to 185 days in calendar year 2000, and 173 days in calendar year 2001. According to a senior FHA official, the 219-day figure cited for 1999 in the comment letter is incorrect.  Because we used data for calendar year 2000, the report reflects the significant decline in inventory times that FHA has reported.  Therefore, we believe that the report fairly describes the time that it takes to sell FHA properties. 2.  This footnote has been deleted. 3.  The FHA comment letter paraphrases our recommendation differently than the way the full recommendation was written in the draft report. We recommended that the HUD secretary establish unified property custody as a priority for FHA and determine the optimal method of unified property custody. FHA paraphrased our recommendation as stating that HUD should determine if unified property custody represents the optimal method of property custody and, if so, implement it after seeking any required statutory authority. We contacted a senior FHA official to obtain clarification on FHA\u2019s position on our recommendation. The FHA official said that FHA, in paraphrasing the recommendation in the draft report, did not mean to change the recommendation\u2019s meaning. FHA agrees with our recommendation that it should establish unified property custody as a priority. FHA is conducting analysis to determine the feasibility of establishing unified custody within the existing statutory framework and to identify regulatory and contractual changes that would have to be resolved to implement unified property custody. 4.  We do not agree with FHA that actions taken to suspend foreclosure proceedings in these 7,800 cases contributed to the time taken to sell FHA properties in 2000. The timeline we provided measures from the date of the foreclosure sale until properties are sold to homebuyers or investors. Because suspension of foreclosure proceedings on these mortgages occurred prior to the completion of the foreclosure sale, the suspension would not add time to the period measured in this report. 5.  We revised the figure. 6.  We revised the table. 7.  We added language to the report body. 8.  The final report notes that FHA is developing guidance to clarify the circumstances under which management and marketing contractors can demand refunds from servicers for preservation and protection work that has not been completed according to standards. 9.  We have revised the report language. 10. As stated in the report body, the section 601 authority may allow for unified property custody. While FHA\u2019s Accelerated Claims Disposition Program could reduce the number of properties that FHA acquires through foreclosure, it is too early to judge its ultimate success. Further, as the FHA commissioner states, even if the demonstration program is successful and expanded to the majority of defaulted mortgage loans, it will not eliminate FHA\u2019s responsibility for acquiring and selling foreclosed properties entirely. We believe that FHA should established unified custody as a priority for any such foreclosed properties for which it becomes responsible in the future. 11. We disagree with FHA that the draft report stated that FHA does not retain data on the number of properties that are reconveyed due to irresolvable title defects. The draft report stated that FHA does not collect data on the number of times that title insurance policies are used during the foreclosure process or the types of problems that require title insurance. Therefore, we made no changes in response to this comment. 12. As stated in the report draft, the debenture rate can significantly exceed servicers\u2019 cost of funds. In fact, the debenture rate has exceeded servicers\u2019 cost of funds since 1985. In a rising interest rate environment, such as last occurred in 1984, servicers\u2019 cost of funds may exceed the debenture rate. 13.
