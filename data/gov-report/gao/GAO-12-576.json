While the program continues to make progress, recent technical problems with the instruments and spacecraft, as well as a significant modification to the ground project\u0092s development plan, have delayed the completion of key reviews and led to increased complexity for the development of GOES-R. The technical and programmatic challenges experienced by the flight and ground projects have led to a 19-month delay in completing the program\u0092s preliminary design review. Nevertheless, program officials report that its planned launch date of October 2015 for the first satellite has not changed. While the program reports that approximately $1.2 billion is currently in reserve to manage future delays and cost growth, significant portions of development remain for major components. As a result, the program may not be able to ensure that it has adequate resources to cover ongoing challenges as well as unexpected problems for the remaining development of all four satellites.", "The success in management of a large-scale program depends in part on having a reliable schedule that defines, among other things, when work activities and milestone events will occur, how long they will take, and how they are related to one another. To its credit, the program has adopted key scheduling best practices and has recognized certain scheduling weaknesses. It has also recently instituted initiatives to automate its integrated master schedule, correct integration problems among projects, and assess schedule confidence based on risk. However, unresolved schedule deficiencies remain in its integrated master schedule and the contractor schedules that support it, which have contributed to a re-plan of the schedule of the ground system and to the potential for delays to satellite launch dates. The program recently determined that the likelihood of the first satellite meeting its planned October 2015 launch date is 48 percent. Based on this planned launch date, the program reports that there is a 37 percent chance of a gap in the availability of two operational GOES-series satellites, which could result in the need for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to rely on older satellites that are not fully functional. Until its scheduling weaknesses are addressed, it will be more difficult for the program to know whether its planned remaining development is on schedule.", "NOAA has established policies and procedures that conform with recognized risk management best practices. For example, the program has documented a strategy for managing risks that includes important elements, such as relevant stakeholders and their responsibilities and the criteria for evaluating, categorizing, and prioritizing risks. However, while the program has a well- defined risk management process, it has not been fully implemented. For example, the program has not provided adequate or timely evaluations for potential risks, did not always provide adequate rationale for the decision to close a risk, and has at least two critical risks in need of additional attention. Until all defined risk management practices are diligently executed and critical risks adequately mitigated, the GOES-R program is at risk of exceeding cost and schedule targets, and launch dates could slip."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to NOAA to assess and report reserves needed over the life of the program, improve the reliability of its schedules, and address identified program risks.

According to NOAA and  program officials, the revised development approach is to provide  flexibility in the ground system\u2019s development schedule and reduce risk  associated with the original waterfall schedule. However, the revised plan  is expected to cost $85 million more than the original plan through the  Core Ground System\u2019s completion. This cost includes increased  contractor and government staff, new oversight tools, and more  verification and testing activities associated with an increased number of  software deliveries. Program officials acknowledged that the revised plan  intends to expend additional resources to reduce schedule risk and  potential impacts to GOES-R\u2019s launch date, but that it also introduces  new cost and schedule risks associated with incremental development,  such as more software development and verification activities that require  additional government oversight and continuous monitoring.", "In addition, the program has cancelled previously exercised options to the  ground project that were once considered part of its original baseline. In  early 2011, the program determined that it could no longer fund Core  Ground System contract options\u2014which were estimated to cost  approximately $50 million.

NOAA stated that  some of the cost growth is attributed to scope changes, including  instrument options that were exercised in 2010 and 2011. Based on our  analysis, approximately $60 million of the $757 million growth in  contractors\u2019 estimated costs at completion from January 2010 through  November 2011 was due to scope changes associated with new  instrument flight model development.

NOAA requires the program office  and flight and ground projects to maintain a reserve of funds until their  development is completed. Specifically, the flight project is to maintain 20  percent of planned remaining development costs as reserve, the ground  project is to maintain 30 percent of planned remaining development costs  as reserve, and the program office is to maintain 10 percent of planned  remaining development costs as reserve.", "The program has allocated a proportion of its budget as reserves to  mitigate risks and manage problems as they surface during development.  As a result of changes in budget reserve allocations and reserve  commitments, the program\u2019s reserves have declined in recent years.  Between January 2009 and January 2012, the program reported that its  reserves fell from 42 percent of remaining development costs to 29  percent. Over the same period, the program reports that after accounting  for changes in reserve budgets and reserve commitments, reserves fell  from $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion, an approximately 30 percent reduction in its  uncommitted reserves. This is important to note since about two-thirds of  the development remains for the program\u2019s two most expensive  components\u2014the spacecraft and the Core Ground System. Recent  utilization of the program\u2019s reserves included addressing unanticipated  problems with instrument and spacecraft design, using more than expected  labor required to accomplish program and project-related milestones, and  acquiring additional resources required to execute the revised development  plan and schedule for the Core Ground System. In this regard, the  program\u2019s independent review board recently raised questions about the  sufficiency of the program\u2019s near-term remaining reserves, and program  officials decided to establish contractual funding caps for the spacecraft,  three instruments\u2014the Advanced Baseline Imager, the Solar Ultraviolet  Imager, and the Geostationary Lightning Mapper\u2014and the Core Ground  System for fiscal year 2012, delaying work into future years. Figure 5  depicts changes in program reserves over time.", "At completion of the GOES-R program\u2019s preliminary design review in  February 2012, the program reported that it was within its thresholds  because it had maintained 20 percent of planned remaining development  costs as reserve for the flight project, 32 percent of planned remaining  development costs for the ground project, and 10 percent of planned  remaining development costs for the program office. The program will  soon enter the integration and test phase, when projects typically  experience cost and schedule growth and need additional funding\u2014as  identified in our prior reviews of NASA acquisitions. The program may  need to draw from its available remaining reserves to address a number  of situations, including unanticipated problems during completion of the critical design  reviews of the spacecraft and the ground system; unanticipated problems during the integration and test of the  instruments and spacecraft, such as required redesign; potential additional labor required for ground system software potential delays in the readiness of NOAA\u2019s Satellite Operations  Facility for ground system testing, resulting in the use of contractor  facilities; and higher than expected costs for launch vehicles.", "While the program reported that reserves were within accepted levels as  of February 2012, the reserves may not be matched to remaining  development. Although the program restored two satellites to its budget  baseline in February 2011, thereby adding approximately $3.2 billion to its  total budget, it did not correspondingly change its program reserves.  The program did not report its rationale for maintaining reserves at the  two-satellite program or explain how these planned reserves were  intended to cover risks associated with the development of all four  satellites. As a result, there is limited assurance that the reserves are  appropriate for each satellite\u2019s remaining development.", "Whether the program will continue to stay within its budget depends in  part on whether officials have a full understanding of the reserves  required for remaining development. Given the program\u2019s recent use of  reserves and the significant portions of development remaining for major  components, a complete understanding and proper management of  reserve levels will be critical to successfully completing all program  components.

Accordingly, a schedule helps ensure that all stakeholders understand  both the dates for major milestones and the activities that drive the  schedule. If changes occur within a program, the schedule helps decision  makers analyze how those changes affect the program. The reliability of  the schedule will determine the credibility of the program\u2019s forecasted  dates, which are used for decision making. Our work has identified nine  best practices associated with developing and maintaining a reliable  schedule. These are (1) capturing all activities, (2) sequencing all  activities, (3) assigning resources to all activities, (4) establishing the  duration of all activities, (5) integrating schedule activities horizontally and  vertically, (6) establishing the critical path for all activities, (7) identifying  reasonable \u201cfloat\u201d between activities, (8) conducting a schedule risk  analysis, and (9) updating the schedule using logic and durations. See  table 8 for a description of each of these best practices.", "The first seven practices are essential elements for creation of an  integrated schedule. An integrated schedule that contains all the detailed  tasks necessary to ensure program execution is called an integrated  master schedule (IMS). The reliability of an integrated schedule depends  in part on the reliability of its subordinate schedules. Automated  integration of all activities into a single master schedule can prevent  inadvertent errors when entering data or transferring them from one file to  another.", "GOES-R has an IMS that is created manually once a month directly from  at least nine subordinate contractor schedules. Due to anticipated  limitations related to the number of activities that would need to be  included, program officials stated that they did not intend to make the IMS  a live, integrated file. We believe that the lack of a dynamic IMS is an  acceptable schedule limitation for an organization of GOES-R\u2019s size and  complexity. Program officials also stated that they are in the process of  creating an automated process for updating their IMS from contractor- delivered files sometime in 2012, but this was not available in time for our  analysis.", "To assess the reliability of the programwide IMS, we analyzed four  subordinate contractor schedules from July 2011 practices that were met in multiple schedules. For example, similar to the  program-level IMS, three of the contractor IMS\u2019s include all activities that  were supplemented with monthly data received directly from the  schedules of their subcontractors, and the fourth\u2014the Core Ground  System schedule\u2014included milestone activities for all subcontractors. All  four schedules also substantially or fully met the best practice for  regularly updating the schedule, including regular reporting of status and  keeping the number of activities completed out of sequence to a  minimum. Finally, three of the four schedules substantially met the best  practice for establishing accurate activity durations.", "Our rationale for the selection and analysis of schedules is discussed in app. I. provide information on schedule risk analyses conducted with risk  simulations.", "A full set of analysis results is listed in table 9. Selected strengths and  weaknesses for each of the four schedules follow the table.", "Of the four component schedules, the Geostationary Lightning Mapper  schedule demonstrated the most comprehensive implementation of best  practices. For instance, all activities and durations were appropriately  captured in the schedule; logic links were included for over 99 percent of  activities; only one small gap was present in the critical path from the date  of the schedule through the end of the project; a high percentage of  activities had appropriate logic; and the schedule was updated using logic  and durations to determine dates. However, more than 10 percent of the  resources listed in the schedule were overloaded, meaning that the  schedule required more resources than were available. Also, changes in  activity durations for one flight model did not result in a corresponding  change in the shipment date of that flight model.", "The Advanced Baseline Imager schedule substantially or fully met three  of the best practices. As mentioned above, the Advanced Baseline  Imager schedule met the best practices for including all subcontractor  records as well as regular updating and reporting on the schedule. In  addition, it provided a substantial amount of information regarding the  resources in its schedule; the contractor created a series of over 900  named codes that denote detailed information such as resource type,  location, and labor rate. However, 18 percent of remaining activities had  incomplete or missing logic, and 43 percent had soft date constraints. If  the schedule is missing logic links between activities, float estimates will  not be accurate. Incorrect total float values may in turn result in an invalid  critical path and an inaccurate assessment of project completion dates. In  the case of the Advanced Baseline Imager, many detailed activities had  large total float values throughout. Moreover, the Advanced Baseline  Imager schedule did not have a valid critical path for one of its three flight  models and did not have a critical path that spans the entire program.", "The spacecraft schedule substantially met more than half of the best  practices. It had a valid critical path through the launch dates for the first  two satellites, included and mapped all activities appropriately, included  logic links for over 99 percent of its activities, and was appropriately  updated. However, more than 10 percent of its activities had constraints,  and nearly 10 percent of its activities had gaps between consecutive  activities, also known as lags. Lags should be minimal, and should not be  used in place of activities, as they cannot be easily monitored, cannot be  included in a risk assessment, and do not take resources. For this reason,  lags should be eliminated and replaced with activities so they can be  tracked. Also, the spacecraft schedule\u2019s critical path included a year-long  current activity for which a detailed breakdown was not available, even  though the activity is in the current detailed planning period.", "The Core Ground System schedule contained weaknesses across seven  of the nine best practice areas resulting in a score of partially or minimally  met. For instance, a valid critical path could not be traced between the  schedule\u2019s latest status date and the launch date for either of the first two  satellites; 12 percent of remaining activities had incomplete or missing  logic and 13 percent had soft date constraints; and more than 75 percent  of activities had more than 100 days of total float. Also, not all  subcontractor detail activities were included in the schedule. Without  accounting for all necessary activities, it is uncertain whether all activities  are scheduled in the correct order, missing activities would appear on the  critical path, or a schedule risk analysis accounts for all risk.", "Officials for all four contract teams suggested that certain schedule  weaknesses were unique to the July 2011 schedules they provided and  that the weaknesses would be remedied in December 2011 schedules.  Our subsequent analysis did find improvements for each of the four  contractors. For example, the Advanced Baseline Imager\u2019s December  schedule had approximately 10 percent fewer activities missing  predecessors and successors than in July. The Core Ground System  schedule also performed better in three of the nine best practices,  including the presence of a full set of duration and total float information,  and better information on handoffs with external parties. However, many  weaknesses from the July schedules remained in the December  schedules. For example, officials stated that several schedule risk  analyses had been conducted for the Core Ground System schedule, but  also reported that the schedule risk analysis conducted by the Core  Ground System\u2019s subcontractor was not valid and did not provide  accurate or constructive information.", "Of particular importance is the absence of a valid critical path throughout  all the schedules. Establishing a valid program-level critical path depends  on the resolution of issues with the respective critical paths for the  spacecraft and Core Ground System components. Contract specifications  for all four contractors require that these schedules define critical paths  for their activities. Without a valid critical path, management cannot  determine which delayed tasks will have detrimental effects on the project  finish date. It also cannot determine if total float within the schedule can  be used to mitigate critical tasks by reallocating resources from tasks that  can be delayed without launch date impact. Unless the weaknesses in  these subordinate schedules are addressed, including the generation of  valid critical paths in all schedules, the programwide IMS that is derived  from them may not be sufficiently reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Practice Weaknesses Could Lead to Further Schedule Delays", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in implementing scheduling best practices undermine the  program\u2019s ability to produce credible dates for planned milestones and  events, as illustrated by schedule discrepancies that occurred between  the ground project and the flight project and the subsequent replanning  that was required.

Although the program has initiated two key  efforts that could address certain schedule weaknesses, other  weaknesses have not yet been resolved. Until the program\u2019s scheduling  weaknesses are corrected, it may experience additional delays to its key  milestones.", "The program has revised planned milestone and completion dates for  each of the instruments as well as the spacecraft and ground system  components by at least 3 months\u2014and up to 2 years\u2014since the program  originally estimated dates for key milestones in its December 2007  management control plan. Program officials noted that its December 2007  dates were notional estimates until integrated baseline reviews could be  conducted. However, delays occurred both before and after the  schedules for the instruments, spacecraft, and ground system  components were formalized. In certain cases, more recent changes  were due to delays in building and testing satellite components. For  example, the Solar Ultraviolet Imager experienced delays in 2011 and  2012 due in part to delays in software development and in procuring flight  model parts. Also, a failure in testing power supply boards caused rework  delays in 2011 and 2012 on the Geostationary Lightning Mapper  instrument. See figure 6 for a summary of changes in planned completion  dates for components of the flight and ground projects.", "The potential for delays remains as GOES-R\u2019s instruments, spacecraft,  and ground system components complete their design and testing  phases. According to program officials, the Geostationary Lightning  Mapper shipment date remains at risk of a potential slip due to redesign  efforts that have impacted the release of the build of the electronic board  component of the instrument. The current projected delivery for this  instrument is August 2013, leaving only 1 month before it is on the critical  path for GOES-R\u2019s launch readiness date. Moreover, weaknesses in  implementing schedule best practices make meaningful measurement  and oversight of program status and progress, as well as accountability  for results, difficult to achieve\u2014which can in turn reduce the timeliness  and effectiveness of the understanding and mitigation of project risks.", "The program office has taken specific positive actions that address two of  the scheduling weaknesses we identified. First, the GOES-R program  implemented the Giver-Receiver Intersegment Database, a tool that tracks  deliverables between the flight and ground projects. Giver-Receiver  Intersegment Database items are formally reviewed by various working  groups weekly and monthly before they are incorporated into the GOES-R  IMS. This initiative is intended to address a program-recognized need for  better horizontal integration (related to best practice 5). Second, the GOES- R program implemented a Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level, a  set of parametric models designed to identify the probability that a given  program\u2019s schedule values will be equal to or less than target values on a  specific date. In the Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level,  simulations are run for the expected duration of activities based on  probabilities supplied by officials in the project\u2019s cost and schedule division.  This initiative is intended to address a program-recognized need to conduct  a schedule risk analysis (related to best practice 8).", "However, the possibility of future milestone delays remains. Initial results  from the Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level from January 2012  indicated that there is a 48 percent confidence level that the program will  meet its current launch readiness date of October 2015. Program officials  plan to consult with the NOAA Program Management Council to  determine the advisability of moving the launch readiness date to a 70  percent confidence level of February 2016. Given that scheduling  weaknesses remain unaddressed, even these confidence levels may be  unreliable. Establishing accurate confidence estimates depends on  reliable data that result from the implementation of a full set of scheduling  best practices.", "Furthermore, delays in GOES-R\u2019s launch date could impact current  operational GOES continuity and could produce milestone delays for  subsequent satellites in the series. Program documentation indicates that  with the current launch readiness date of October 2015, plus an on-orbit  testing period, there is a 37 percent chance of a gap in the availability of  two operational GOES-series satellites at any one time, assuming a  normal lifespan for the satellites currently on-orbit. Any delays in the  launch readiness date for GOES-R, which is already at risk due to the  increased cost growth and recent heavy use of program reserves  discussed previously, would further increase the probability of a gap in  satellite continuity. This could result in the need for NOAA to rely on older  satellites that are not fully functional. In addition, GOES-R\u2019s schedule  reserve is being counted on to complete activities for GOES-S. As a  result, delays to certain program schedule targets could impact milestone  commitments for GOES-S.", "Until the program implements a full set of schedule best practices, and  uses it on succeeding schedule updates throughout the life of the  program, further delays in the program\u2019s launch dates may occur. In  particular, without ensuring that all contractor and subcontractor  information is included in the IMS and conducting regular schedule risk  assessments, program management may not have timely and relevant  information at its disposal for decision making. Lack of the proper  understanding of current program status due to schedules that are not  fully reliable undercuts the ability of the program office to manage a high- risk program like GOES-R."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk Management Approach Is Well Defined but Not Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Risk management is a continuous process to identify potential problems  before they occur.

As  discussed earlier in this report, further delays in the development of the  first satellite could result in problems for the second satellite\u2019s scheduled  milestones since the program is planning to complete the second  satellite\u2019s activities during periods of time set aside as reserve to  complete the first satellite\u2019s activities.

Until this risk is  added to the program\u2019s risk list with a documented mitigation approach  and regular monitoring, NOAA could delay the analysis, planning, and  actions that would limit the impacts and occurrence of the risk, and would  thus be unprepared to face the significant consequences to the program  should this risk be realized.", "While the program has well-defined policies and procedures, it has not  fully implemented its risk process.

However, associated reviews, including the  programwide critical design review planned for August 2012, have been  delayed by many months. Progress was also accompanied by technical  and programmatic challenges, such as initial failures of instrument  components and replanning of ground project software releases.  Although these two specific challenges are being addressed, others such  as instrument signal problems and a 2-year cost growth of more than 30  percent for program development contracts point to troubling patterns that  will require ongoing remediation and monitoring. NOAA has allocated  budget reserves for such situations according to its established guidelines  and reports that project reserve levels are currently within those  guidelines. However, the program has used approximately 30 percent of  its reserves over the last 3 years and significant portions of development  remain for major components\u2014including the spacecraft and Core Ground  System. In addition, the program did not change its reserves when it  restored two satellites adding approximately $3.2 billion to the program\u2019s  baseline. Unless NOAA assesses the reserve allocations across all of the  program\u2019s development efforts, it may not be able to ensure that its  reserves will cover ongoing challenges as well as unexpected problems  for the remaining development of all four satellites in the series.", "The unreliability of the program\u2019s integrated master schedule and some  contractor schedules adds further uncertainty to whether the program will  meet its commitments. The issues that exist among these schedules,  such as a lack of a full and consistent allocation of resources, incomplete  logic, and gaps in the critical path to project completion, are inconsistent  with our and agency best practices. NOAA has taken steps to improve  schedule reliability through more automated schedule integration, a  cross-project deliverable-tracking database, and its first schedule risk  assessment. However, unless the program addresses the full set of  scheduling weaknesses we identified, its schedules may not provide a  fully reliable basis for decision making.", "NOAA has defined the policies and procedures it needs to effectively  manage and mitigate these and other program risks. Nevertheless,  officials do not have a current and comprehensive view of program risk  because these policies and procedures have not been fully implemented.  Most significantly, not all known candidate risks have been evaluated;  corrective actions have not been consistently tracked; and risks we  identified in this review are not being tracked or adequately mitigated.

However, the program  has not treated concerns in accordance with its risk management plan,  which considers these to be \u201ccandidate risks\u201d and requires their timely  review and disposition, as evidenced by the many concerns in the  database that were more than 3 months old and had not been assessed  or dispositioned.

Nevertheless,  we revised our report to state that approximately $60 million of the $757  million growth in contractors\u2019 estimated costs at completion from January  2010 through November 2011 was due to scope changes associated with  new instrument flight model development.
