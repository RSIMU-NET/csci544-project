The latest edition of Publication 1212 at the time of our review was revised as of November 1994 and it contained several listings.

Because the sources we used did not contain detailed characteristics of the bond issuances, we were only able to identify bonds as having OID if they were described as discount issues or if they were initially offered for significantly less than their face value. We were unable to look for other characteristics, such as deferred interest payments, that may have generated OID income in other bonds. At our request, IRS\u2019 Office of Chief Counsel reviewed the bonds we identified as eligible for inclusion in Publication 1212 to verify that they were issued with OID, the issuance had not been reported to IRS as required, and the bonds were not included in the November 1994 edition.", "To determine how IRS ensures it is receiving Forms 8281 on new OID bond issues, we held discussions with officials of the Office of Chief Counsel, the Forms and Publications Division, and other IRS offices to obtain information on the processes IRS uses to obtain data for Publication 1212 and on how it enforces Form 8281 filing requirements; visited IRS\u2019 Detroit Computing Center, where Forms 8281 are initially processed, to ascertain the center\u2019s responsibilities in the reporting and enforcement process; spoke with the contractor that maintains IRS\u2019 Form 8281 database to ascertain its duties and responsibilities; and analyzed all readily available Forms 8281 filed with IRS since 1985 to determine total OID dollars for the bonds listed in Publication 1212 and the timeliness of form filings.", "To determine whether middlemen relied on Publication 1212 data to generate Forms 1099-OID, we held discussions with representatives of financial service companies and securities, banking, and mutual fund trade associations and firms to obtain insight on the use they made of the publication.

Further, according to IRS, middlemen can avoid penalties for incomplete or inaccurate information reporting by relying on information in Publication 1212. IRS\u2019 statements of reliance imply that the publication\u2019s list of OID bonds is complete. However, we found it to be incomplete because it was missing many bonds.", "Using publicly available information in sources such as Moody\u2019s Bond Record, we found 37 OID bonds that should have been listed in the November 1994 edition of Publication 1212 but were not. The bonds were not included because IRS had no record that the issuers had filed Forms 8281. Attorneys from IRS\u2019 Office of Chief Counsel reviewed this information and saw no reason why the issuers should not have filed Forms 8281.", "Most of the 37 bonds were issued after 1990, although some dated back to 1985. Twenty-eight were issued in 1993 through 1994. If the excluded bonds were added to those already listed in Publication 1212, the number of bonds in the 1994 edition would increase by", "8 percent for bonds listed as issued after 1985, and", "20 percent for bonds listed as issued in 1993 through 1994.", "Why the percentage increased for 1993 through 1994 was unknown.", "The 37 bonds were issued with about $10 billion of OID. For tax purposes, the OID should be recognized as income over the lives of the bonds, which was up to 20 years for some. To put this $10 billion into better perspective, the 464 bonds in Publication 1212 for which data were available were issued with about $40 billion in OID. The 28 bonds issued in 1993 through 1994 that should have been included in Publication 1212 were issued with $7.1 billion of OID. In comparison, the 145 bonds added to the publication for those years were issued with $9.1 billion of OID.", "We could not determine how much tax revenue, if any, was lost because accrued OID income from bonds not listed in Publication 1212 might have gone unreported to owners and IRS. In part, this is because information reporting would be unnecessary on some portion of the $10 billion when bonds were held in tax-exempt accounts or owned by tax-exempt organizations, corporations, and other institutions that are not required to receive information returns. Even so, bonds are not excludable from the publication merely because some eventual owners may not need to receive information returns. In its Publication 1212, IRS encourages owners of publicly offered OID bonds who do not receive Forms 1099-OID to use the publication to determine the amount of OID to report on their income tax returns.", "Although we could not estimate the amount of tax revenue, if any, that may have been lost, there is evidence to suggest that loss of tax revenue can occur when a Form 1099-OID is not provided. In an earlier report on income resulting from the cancellation of indebtedness, we found that information returns increased taxpayer reporting of such income from less than 1 percent of income to almost 50 percent. This result underscores the importance of information reporting when the taxpayer may be unaware that taxable income has been received or recognized, as in the case of OID income. Although cancellation of indebtedness income differs significantly from OID income, the two types of income are similar in that they are taxable even though the taxpayer does not receive cash in the tax year. Clearly, by requiring information reporting for OID, Congress saw the need for taxpayers and IRS to be informed of accrued but unreceived OID income.", "More bonds may have been missing from Publication 1212 than the 37 we found. Various features of a bond, such as deferred interest payments, can give rise to OID. The sources we reviewed allowed us to look for some of these features but not all. Also, representatives of a service company that maintains its own OID database and prepares information returns for middlemen estimated that the company\u2019s database contained more than 150 OID bonds that Publication 1212 should have included but did not. The bonds in this database included a few predating the 1985 issuance notification requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Lacked an Effective Process for Identifying Nonfiling of Form 8281 and Ensuring Publication 1212 Was Complete", "paragraphs": ["The tax code and related regulations require issuers to inform IRS within 30 days after they publicly issue OID bonds and subject them to a penalty of up to $50,000 for not doing so. According to IRS Chief Counsel officials, IRS generally relied on the existence of the sizable penalty to ensure reporting compliance and, therefore, presumed that Publication 1212 was substantially complete. In our opinion, such reliance might be appropriate if the penalty were enforced. However, we found no IRS organization with primary responsibility for monitoring issuers\u2019 compliance and assessing the penalty, and no evidence that IRS had ever assessed the penalty. In addition, IRS did not take advantage of other information it received that could help it identify unreported OID offerings to make the publication more complete."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No IRS Organization Was Assigned Primary Responsibility for Monitoring Compliance", "paragraphs": ["When the reporting requirement was placed on bond issuers in 1984, IRS officials discussed which part of the organization would have responsibility for (1) developing and maintaining Publication 1212, (2) monitoring Form 8281 filings from issuers, and (3) assessing penalties for noncompliance. Although IRS delegated responsibility for developing and maintaining Publication 1212 to the Forms and Publications Division, we found no evidence that it ever determined which office would monitor filings and assess penalties. IRS auditors have general responsibility for making certain that corporations under audit have filed all required forms, including Form 8281. However, as discussed more fully below, audits are more likely to occur long after a Form 8281 is due and auditors have not always identified a taxpayer\u2019s (issuer\u2019s) failure to file the form.", "According to officials of the two offices responsible for developing and issuing Publication 1212\u2014the Forms and Publications Division and the Office of the Chief Counsel\u2014neither office had authority to assess the penalty. Similarly, officials at the Detroit Computing Center responsible for processing Forms 8281 were unaware of the penalty when we brought it to their attention and did not believe they had authority to assess it. Finally, the Office of Financial Products and Transactions, which was established in March 1994 to, among other tasks, identify and develop strategies for addressing tax issues related to financial products, did not routinely receive information necessary to monitor Form 8281 filing compliance.", "IRS auditors have the only documented responsibility (Internal Revenue Manual, section 4034.5) for determining whether OID bond issuers have filed required Forms 8281 and for imposing the penalty if they have not done so. As part of a standard check when auditing corporate taxpayers, auditors are to determine whether all applicable tax and information returns have been filed, including Form 8281. If a corporation does not file Form 8281 within 30 days of issuing publicly offered OID bonds and lacks reasonable cause for not filing the form, auditors are responsible for obtaining a completed form and imposing the nonfiling penalty. However, the audits are generally initiated at least a year after the returns are filed. In addition, IRS does not audit the majority of the almost 47,000 large corporations that are most likely to be issuers of publicly offered OID debt, those with assets of over $10 million. IRS does audit most of the 1,700 largest corporations, those in its Coordinated Examination Program.", "IRS had no record of Forms 8281 being filed for the 37 bonds we found missing from Publication 1212. The bonds were issued by 34 corporations. Of these, 3 had issued other bonds that were listed in Publication 1212; the other 31 had not. The total OID income payable over the lives of these 37 bonds ranged from $27.1 million for one bond to $1.5 billion for another.", "We asked the IRS Examination Division to determine whether any of the 34 issuers had been audited for the year of bond issuance and, if so, whether the audit identified a failure to file Form 8281. According to the Examination Division, of the 34 issuers, two issuers had been audited, but IRS had neither identified nor addressed their apparent failure to file Form 8281; one issuer was under audit, but the firm\u2019s apparent failure to file Form 8281 had not been identified; and two other issuers were under audit, and because we brought the matter to IRS\u2019 attention, IRS planned to determine whether each was responsible for filing Form 8281.", "This lack of checking by auditors for required submissions was an issue that we discussed in 1989. At that time, we said IRS had missed identifying businesses that failed to file required information returns in about 50 percent of the 932 business return audits we reviewed.", "As a result of our review, IRS auditing officials were going to determine whether there were reasonable causes for the corporations not filing the 37 Forms 8281. As of August 1995, IRS had not resolved any of the 37 cases. However, as a result of our review, the Assistant IRS Commissioner for Examination issued a memorandum reminding audit staff of the Form 8281 filing requirement and reemphasizing the need to check for filing compliance when auditing corporate taxpayers. A reminder was also included in an internal newsletter that was to be sent to auditors who audit the largest corporations. In addition, IRS\u2019 Financial Products and Transaction Office included training on Form 8281 requirements as part of its continuing education program for its auditors. Financial Products and Transactions staff are generally responsible for addressing OID and other financial product issues during corporate audits.

The OID bonds that appear in Publication 1212 are limited to publicly offered, long-term (more than 1 year) issues that accrue more OID income than \u201cde-minimis\u201d amounts (.25 percent annually). They are issued by corporations, government, and quasi-government entities (such as the Federal Farm Credit Bank and the Student Loan Marketing Association) and cover a broad range of complexity, from the relatively simple to the very complicated. According to the November 1994 edition of Publication 1212, OID bonds to be included cannot be long-term OID instruments issued before May 28, 1969; original issue U.S. Treasury notes and bonds;", "U.S. savings bonds; debt instruments issued at a discount by states or their political mortgage-backed securities and mortgage participation certificates; real estate mortgage investment conduits with regular interest and commercial paper and banker\u2019s acceptances that may have been originally issued at a discount; obligations issued by tax-exempt organizations; obligations issued at a discount by individuals; certificates of deposit and other face amount certificates issued at a discount, including syndicated certificates of deposit; and, foreign obligations not traded in the United States and obligations not issued in the United States.", "Publication 1212 is to be updated annually and is to be used to prepare tax returns for a specific year. For example, at the time of our review, the latest publication was revised as of November 1994 and was to be used in preparing 1994 tax returns. It included a list of OID bonds by issuer name and, for each bond, data for use in determining the OID income to be reported. These data included the amount of OID accruing per $1,000 of maturity value on a daily and annual basis for 1994 and 1995.", "Under the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, issuers of OID bonds, or the brokers and other middlemen that hold them for bond owners, are responsible for annually reporting to certain owners\u2014primarily individuals and partnerships\u2014and IRS the income that accrued or was paid. They are to report this information using a paper or computerized IRS Form 1099-OID. Annual information returns are not required for OID income earned by tax-exempt organizations or certain taxable entities such as corporations and financial institutions. Nonetheless, taxable entities are responsible for reporting and paying appropriate taxes on OID income.", "When the Form 1099-OID reporting requirement was first placed on middlemen in the early 1980s, middlemen said they had no practical source of information with which to meet the requirement. For example, they said that although they might obtain the necessary data from the issuer\u2019s prospectus statement for each bond, the effort could be burdensome. Responding to the securities industry\u2019s requests for a practical source of information, IRS agreed to publish Publication 1212, which it first did in 1983.", "The Internal Revenue Code and related regulations require issuers of OID bonds, except for those noted above, to tell IRS when the bonds are first publicly offered to buyers. This mandatory requirement was established to ensure that information would be obtained on the 300 to 400 new issues expected each year. Reporting is to occur within 30 days of issuance, and issuers who willfully report late or not at all are subject to a penalty of 1 percent of the issue price, up to a maximum of $50,000.", "To inform IRS of a new OID bond, issuers are to send IRS Form 8281 to the Detroit Computing Center. After the Center performs some clerical processing, a company under contract with IRS analyzes the forms and accompanying information to decide which bond issues fit the criteria for inclusion in Publication 1212 and follows up with the issuers as needed. Using a computerized file of Form 8281 data, the contractor also determines the OID income-accrual rates that are to appear in Publication 1212. The contractor has no responsibility for identifying OID bonds that have not been reported to IRS on Form 8281 and including them in Publication 1212.", "The November 1994 edition of Publication 1212 included about 780 long-term OID bonds, including 478 issued since 1985. According to IRS\u2019 files, 464 of the 478 bond issues were issued with about $40 billion of OID. Information on the remaining 14 issues was not readily available from the files.", "Since IRS began issuing Publication 1212, some brokerage and financial service companies have developed proprietary databases of OID debt issues for use in preparing Forms 1099-OID (1) for their own customer accounts or (2) as a paid-for service to middlemen. These brokerage and service companies may also sell their databases to middlemen or other financial service companies for their use in preparing information returns. We did not determine how every firm built its database, but two of the largest firms (a brokerage firm and a service company) said they used financial market reporting services, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and Publication 1212."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Products Issued Since 1982 That Discussed Information Reporting for Tax Purposes", "paragraphs": ["Tax Administration: Information Returns Should Increase Proper Reporting of Farm Income (GAO/GGD-86-69, July 22, 1986).", "The Merits of Establishing a Business Information Returns Program (GAO/T-GGD-87-4, Mar. 17, 1987).", "Tax Administration: IRS\u2019 Efforts to Establish a Business Information Returns Program (GAO/GGD-88-102, July 22, 1988).", "Tax Administration: State and Local Compliance With IRS\u2019 Information Reporting Requirements (GAO/GGD-89-63, May 4, 1989).", "Tax Administration: Missing Independent Contractors\u2019 Information Returns Not Always Detected (GAO/GGD-89-110, Sept. 8, 1989).", "Tax Administration: Information Returns Can Be Used to Identify Employers Who Misclassify Workers (GAO/GGD-89-107, Sept. 25, 1989).", "Tax Administration: Status of IRS\u2019 Test of a Business Information Returns Program (GAO/GGD-90-38, May 29, 1990).", "Information Returns: Correcting Taxpayer Identification is Possible Without Disclosing Tax Data (GAO-GGD-90-90, June 5, 1990).", "Tax Policy and Administration: IRS\u2019 Compliance Programs to Reduce the Tax Gap (GAO/T-GGD-91-11, Mar. 13, 1991).", "Tax Administration: IRS Can Improve Its Program to Find Taxpayers Who Underreport Their Income (GAO/GGD-91-49, Mar. 13, 1991).", "Tax Administration: Expanded Reporting on Seller-Financed Mortgages Can Spur Tax Compliance (GAO/GGD-91-38, Mar. 29, 1991).", "Tax Policy and Administration: IRS\u2019 Efforts to Ensure Corporate Tax Compliance (GAO/T-GGD-91-21, Apr. 17, 1991).", "Tax Policy: Refund Offset Program Benefits Appear to Exceed Costs (GAO/GGD-91-64, May 14, 1991).", "IRS Needs to Implement a Corporate Document Matching Program (GAO/T-GGD-91-40, June 10, 1991).", "Tax Administration: Benefits of a Corporate Document Matching Program Exceed the Costs (GAO/GGD-91-118, Sept. 27, 1991).", "Tax Administration: Federal Agencies Should Report Service Payments Made to Corporations (GAO/GGD-92-130, Sept 22, 1992).", "Tax Administration: Information Returns Can Improve Reporting of Forgiven Debts (GAO/GGD-93-42, Feb. 17, 1993).", "Tax Administration: Computer Matching Could Identify Overstated Business Deductions (GAO/GGD-93-133, Aug. 13, 1993).", "Tax Administration: Options Reporting to IRS (GAO/GGD-95-145R, May 5, 1995)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chicago Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Thomas Venezia, Core Group Manager Neal Gottlieb, Evaluator-in-Charge Donald Kittler, Senior Evaluator The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
