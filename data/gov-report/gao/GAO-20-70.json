As of 2017, more than 400 of the large public companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock market index offered such plans to almost 2,300 of their top executives, totaling about $13 billion in accumulated benefit promises. Top executives at large public companies generally accumulated more plan benefits than top executives at the smaller public companies in the Russell 3000 stock market index. Advantages of these plans include their ability to help executives increase retirement savings and potentially reduce tax liability, but the plans come with risks as well. To receive tax deferral, federal law requires the deferred compensation to remain part of a company's assets and subject to creditor claims until executives receive distributions (see figure). Department of Treasury officials and industry experts said executive retirement plans can be tax-advantaged and may have revenue effects for the federal government; however, the revenue effects are currently unknown.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) oversees executive retirement plans for compliance with federal tax laws. For example, IRS must ensure that key executives are taxed on deferred compensation in certain cases where that compensation has been set aside, such as when a company that sponsors a qualified defined benefit retirement plan is in bankruptcy. However, IRS audit instructions lack sufficient information on what data to collect or questions to ask to help its auditors know if companies are complying with this requirement. As a result, IRS cannot ensure that companies are reporting this compensation as part of key executives' income for taxation. The Department of Labor (DOL) oversees these plans to ensure that only eligible employees participate in them since these plans are excluded from most of the federal substantive protections that cover retirement plans for rank-and-file employees. DOL requires companies to report the number of participants in the plan; however, the one-time single page filing does not collect information on the job title or salary of executives or the percentage of the company's workforce participating in these plans. Such key information could allow DOL to better identify plans that may be including ineligible employees.

Although executives may benefit from tax deferral  under an executive retirement plan, these plans are not eligible for the  same preferential tax treatment afforded to qualified retirement plans  under the IRC. For the executive to be eligible for the tax deferral,   executive retirement plans must be an \u201cunfunded and unsecured\u201d  company promise to pay benefits in the future. Generally, for an  executive retirement plan to be considered unfunded and unsecured, the  executive\u2019s rights to receive plan distributions will be no greater than the  rights of an general unsecured creditor in the event of company  bankruptcy or insolvency.

Executives are subject to federal income taxes  on their executive retirement plan distributions when they are received.  However, if an executive retirement plan fails to meet the applicable  requirements at any time during a taxable year, all of the compensation  deferred, including investment earnings associated with the deferred  compensation, is included in each executive\u2019s gross income for the  taxable year to the extent it is vested, along with an additional 20 percent  tax on the compensation to be included in gross income plus additional  income tax.

In contrast, the executive who chooses not to defer compensation  and instead takes the current compensation (paying income taxes) and  invests the balance will pay taxes on investment earnings at the individual  tax rate (see \u201cExecutive does not defer compensation\u201d at bottom of fig.  7). The actual taxes paid under either scenario\u2014deferring  compensation or not\u2014will depend on a number of factors, including the  type of investments, if any, selected by the executive or the company,  length of time invested, and applicable tax rates. For example, an  executive who does not defer compensation and invests outside of the  plan might select investments that are expected to produce long-term  capital gains, which are taxed at lower individual rates than short-term  capital gains. This same executive, if deferring compensation through the  plan, might elect to invest in short-term bonds or investment earnings  based on a market interest rate, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax  rate inside the plan than outside. As another example, a company might  invest deferred compensation in a tax-favored vehicle such as corporate- owned life insurance.", "According to Treasury officials and some industry experts, by participating  in an executive retirement plan, executives may be able to effectively  reduce their potential federal income tax liability during the deferral period  because investment earnings on associated plan assets are taxed at the  company\u2019s corporate rate that may be lower than the executive\u2019s  individual tax rate. This tax substitution of investment earnings may  allow the plan account to grow over time at a higher rate of investment  return than if an executive invested in the same or similar assets outside  the plan. Further, any such tax advantages may allow companies to  reduce their total compensation costs. Conversely, Treasury officials  told us the IRC may effectively disadvantage executive retirement plans  to the extent the tax on an executive\u2019s investment earnings outside the  plan is lower than the tax the company would pay if invested through the  plan. In this circumstance, the tax disadvantage may increase the cost of  companies\u2019 total compensation. However, our analysis of tax rates  suggests that the corporate tax rate may be lower than the individual tax  rate on several forms of investment income. In this case, the company  may be able to achieve a higher after-tax rate of return on investments  than the executive can, depending on the type of investment and amount  of time invested. The lower the applicable corporate tax rate is relative  to the applicable individual tax rate, the greater the tax benefit for the  executive or the company. Treasury officials and some industry experts  told us that, in this scenario, the potential tax advantage resulting from tax  substitution of investment earnings is effectively a federal subsidy  because the federal government receives less in tax revenue. And due  to the effects of compounding, the tax advantage is also greater the  longer the deferral period (and higher the investment return).", "Treasury officials and experts whose published work we reviewed and  interviewed told us the potential effective federal tax subsidy for executive  retirement plan investment earnings can be greater when companies  have effective tax rates that are lower than statutory tax rates. This  can occur, for example, when a company\u2019s losses from the current year  or losses carried over from prior years offset all other company income,  including any investment earnings associated with their executive  retirement plan. In these instances, the federal government could  effectively subsidize the plan investment earnings because it receives no  taxes on those earnings until funds are distributed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Compensation for Investment Earnings", "paragraphs": ["Companies also provide executives with additional executive retirement  plan compensation that increases their overall savings by not passing  along taxes paid on investment earnings during the deferral period,  according to Treasury officials and some industry experts.

Unaffected by taxation on investment earnings, the account balance  accumulates over time at a pre-tax investment rate of return, rather than  at the company\u2019s potentially lower after-tax investment rate of return, until  those funds are distributed to the executive. In this manner, this additional  compensation provided by the company allows the account balance of an  executive retirement plan to accumulate in the same way as in a qualified  defined contribution retirement plan (e.g., a 401(k) plan).

These experts also  said that not all executive retirement plan participants receive the same  treatment for their claims. These experts added that a common scenario  is to preserve in some manner the benefits for key executives who are  retained, while giving executives who are not retained, or former  executives no longer with the company, less favorable treatment as a  general unsecured creditor.

The Pension Protection  Act of 2006 amended the IRC to provide that, during a restricted period,  which includes bankruptcy, if a company that sponsors a qualified single- employer defined benefit plan sets aside or reserves assets in a trust for  the purposes of paying nonqualified deferred compensation (which  includes executive retirement plan compensation) to applicable covered  employees (key executives), the key executives are required to include  the amount of assets in their gross income for the taxable year. A  restricted period is defined as: (1) any period in which the plan sponsor is  a debtor in bankruptcy; (2) any period when the qualified single-employer  defined benefit plan of the company is in at-risk status; or (3) the 12- month period that begins 6 months before the date the qualified single- employer defined benefit plan is terminated if, as of the termination date,  the plan\u2019s assets are not sufficient to cover benefit liabilities. In general,  a company\u2019s qualified single-employer defined benefit plan is in at-risk  status if it is less than 80 percent funded.", "As part of its oversight effort, IRS officials said that its examiners can use  IRS\u2019s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Audit Techniques Guide (the  guide) to audit these plans for compliance with the IRC, including the  relevant provision, which was added by the Pension Protection Act of  2006. The guide describes the requirements in section 409A of the IRC  related to deferred compensation set aside during a restricted period.  While the guide is designed to provide guidance for IRS employees, the  guide is publicly available and also useful for businesses and tax  professionals who prepare returns. However, the guide does not instruct  examiners or other users on how to determine compliance with the  relevant provision. For example, the guide does not instruct examiners  or other users to determine if the company has set aside assets\u2014such as  by making contributions of funds to a Rabbi Trust\u2014to pay deferred  compensation during bankruptcy. It also does not require examiners or  other users to obtain data sufficient to determine whether there exists a  restricted period with respect to the company\u2019s qualified single-employer  defined benefit plan. Lastly, it does not provide instructions regarding the  type of data to collect or questions to ask to determine whether a  company\u2019s defined benefit plan is in a restricted period. When asked if  additional instructions were available to examiners on auditing companies  with these plans for compliance with the relevant provision, IRS officials  pointed us to sections of the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM), IRS\u2019s  primary source of instructions to staff, and other internal training  manuals. However, we found no specific instructions in these sources  related to the relevant IRC provision or its oversight.", "IRS officials said examiners can also review SEC filings to determine  whether there exists a restricted period with respect to a company\u2019s  qualified single-employer defined benefit plan. However, SEC filing  requirements do not apply to many privately-held companies, limiting the  usefulness of this information source for IRS audit examiners for this  purpose. IRS officials also said that Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of  Employee Benefit Plan, and the attached schedules are available on the  DOL website and that examiners can download and review these data  during their examinations. For example, officials said information on the  5500 Form\u2019s Schedule SB, Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan  Actuarial Information, can be used to verify the income tax deduction for  contributions to pension plans. Specifically, the schedule\u2019s Item 4 box,  Part I Basic Information, will be marked if the plan is in at-risk status. The  form, however, does not capture whether companies set aside assets for  the purpose of paying deferred compensation or elicit information about a  company\u2019s bankruptcy.

For example,  because PBGC represents itself and the pension plan and participants as  a creditor when companies (publicly and privately-held) sponsoring  single-employer defined benefit plans file for bankruptcy, it is aware of  such bankruptcy filings. PBGC also uses data that companies are  required to report on Form 5500, describing the assets and liabilities of  their single-employer defined benefit plans, to identify when a defined  benefit plan is underfunded or in at-risk status.

Without taking steps to improve the sufficiency of its audit  instructions to help strengthen its oversight, IRS cannot know if  companies are reporting the correct amount of income for taxation for  these key executives and if the correct amount of tax is being paid by the  executives in these instances. IRS also may not be collecting additional  taxes and interest due from key executives who participate in executive  retirement plans. Absent improved IRS oversight in this area, companies  may be failing to report assets set aside to pay deferred compensation to  key executives while in a restricted period as income for these  employees.

DOL requires  companies to report on their executive retirement plans, but the reporting  lacks important information that could allow the agency to identify plans  that may be including ineligible employees. Currently, under its alternative  reporting method regulation, DOL regulations require the administrator of  the executive retirement plan, typically the sponsoring company, to  submit a one-time single page filing statement within 120 days of the  executive retirement plan being established to satisfy ERISA reporting  requirements (see fig. 10). According to DOL officials, no other filings  are required for executive retirement plans to comply with Part 1 of Title I  of ERISA.", "The information provided in the filing statement does not describe the job  title or salary of executives participating in the plan, the percentage of the  company\u2019s workforce that is eligible to participate, or the actual  percentage of employees who participate in the plan; nor does it compare  the salaries of executives with rank-and-file workers. Because DOL  only requires companies to submit the filing statement once within 120  days of plan formation, the agency is not aware when participation in the  plan changes over time or if plans are terminated.", "When asked if these additional data would be useful to the agency, one  DOL official said that they could be used to increase oversight of  executive retirement plans. For example, the official said if the filing  statement included the percentage of the company\u2019s workforce that  participated in such a plan, a high participation percentage could signal to  DOL that the company might be permitting employees to participate in the  plan who do not meet the \u201cselect group\u201d requirements, and that such  information could prompt a DOL audit. However, the DOL official said the  agency would need to evaluate how the data would be used and the  collection costs before determining the data\u2019s overall value. The preamble  to DOL\u2019s regulation states that the agency chose to require limited  reporting because these plans are for executives who generally have  access to information concerning their rights and obligations under the  plan and do not need ERISA protections. Moreover, DOL officials said  there is no statutory requirement specifically directing the agency to  collect executive retirement plan data and no requirement for companies  to file an amended filing statement to report substantive plan changes.  However, ERISA authorized DOL to prescribe an alternative method of  reporting and the agency chose to require a limited one-time single page  filing statement for executive retirement plans.", "DOL officials said the data currently collected can only be used for simple  analysis or to facilitate the agency\u2019s ability to respond to requests from  Congress, the media, or the public. This limited usefulness regarding  eligibility is due to the age and limits of the original data submitted.  However, officials told us there currently is no plan to place executive  retirement plan reporting on DOL\u2019s regulatory project agenda. Federal  standards for internal control state that agencies should (a) use quality  information to achieve its objectives; (b) obtain data from reliable sources  in a timely manner based on identified information requirements; and (c)  process the data into quality information\u2014information that is appropriate,  current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely\u2014to support its  internal control system. Without reviewing or clarifying its reporting  requirements to allow the agency to collect more useful information on  executive retirement plans, DOL will continue to lack insight into the  composition of these plans and, as a result, may be missing opportunities  to ensure that companies with executive retirement plans are meeting the  eligibility requirements for the plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Have Indicated Companies are Often Unclear on How to Establish Executive Retirement Plan Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["Many industry experts we spoke to said that eligibility requirements for  executive retirement plans are not clearly defined and that companies are  unclear on how to establish eligibility. DOL has acknowledged that at  least in one case a company may have denied ERISA protections to rank- and-file employees by allowing them to participate in executive retirement  plans. DOL officials also said the agency has issued guidance on the  executive retirement plan provisions in ERISA. For example, DOL pointed  us to Advisory Opinion 90-14A, which DOL officials said is the agency\u2019s  most recent advisory opinion on provisions related to plan participant  eligibility. The Advisory Opinion restates that executive retirement plans  are excluded from most of ERISA\u2019s substantive protections and describes  DOL\u2019s view that the term \u201cprimarily,\u201d as used in the statute, refers to the  purpose of the plan\u2014the benefits provided\u2014rather than the participant  composition of the plan (see fig. 11). The Advisory Opinion further  states DOL\u2019s view that executive retirement plans that include employees  who are not from a select group of management or highly compensated  would fail to constitute a \u201cselect group\u201d under ERISA, which would subject  the plan to all of the requirements of Title I.", "Despite the information in the Advisory Opinion, several industry experts  expressed the view that DOL\u2019s current policy lacks specific information on  the factors companies should consider when establishing eligibility for  participation in these plans. Recent industry surveys we reviewed have  suggested some companies may be extending employee eligibility to a  relatively high percentage of their workforce\u2014in some cases, more than  30 percent\u2014and to relatively lower-paid or lower-ranked employees. For  example, results from a recent survey of executive retirement plan  sponsors suggested that just over 8 percent of respondents offer eligibility  to between 20 to 30 percent of their workforce and just over 4 percent  offer eligibility to more than 30 percent of their employees. Further, over  20 percent of respondents indicated that over 15 percent of their  workforce was considered highly compensated employees and eligible to  participate in an executive retirement plan. Industry experts pointed to  court cases that they identified as contributing to the confusion regarding  executive retirement plan eligibility, including cases that have suggested  a limit on the percentage of employees who may participate in an  executive retirement plan and still constitute a select group. Several  industry experts suggested that DOL could help to address this issue in  the future by providing a safe harbor that describes limits or thresholds  companies could follow to establish eligibility. Two industry experts  identified a range of possible information DOL could provide, such as a  ceiling on the percentage of the company\u2019s workforce permitted to  participate, job titles that could be eligible for participation, or a  compensation threshold. Industry experts also suggested more  detailed information on factors to consider for eligibility, rather than a  \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d design, would help to ensure the information would be  flexible enough for a variety of companies to apply.", "We asked DOL officials about issuing clarifying information on the  statutory requirements under ERISA for eligibility into these plans. DOL  officials stated that the agency has the authority to do so but has no plans  to issue guidance because it has not encountered eligibility problems  during plan audits and enforcement actions. Rather, DOL officials said  that in light of resource constraints, other high priority guidance projects,  and the absence of systematic abuses involving these plans, it does not  believe it advisable to shift resources from other projects to undertake a  guidance project in this area. DOL officials said the agency no longer  renders decisions on the status of \u201cselect group\u201d eligibility for executive  retirement plans in advisory opinions or in response to external inquiries  because such determinations involve factual questions that are not well  suited to an advisory opinion or informal participant assistance process.", "Federal standards for internal control require federal agencies to  communicate quality information externally through reporting lines so that  external parties can help the entity achieve its objectives and address  related risks. By exploring ways it may be able to help reduce the  incidence of ineligible employees participating in executive retirement  plans, DOL could help ensure ineligible rank-and-file employees are not  participating in these plans and are receiving the applicable protections  under ERISA. One such way may be by providing information to  companies on factors to consider when determining a \u201cselect group\u201d to  aid companies in establishing plan eligibility.", "A related issue that companies can face is dealing with eligibility  decisions that turn out to be in error. DOL officials told us they have not  issued any guidance on how companies are to correct eligibility errors  found in executive retirement plans. Officials referred us to a 2015 amicus  brief DOL filed in a particular case that described the department\u2019s views  on how companies might consider addressing eligibility errors. The  amicus brief suggests that the company could modify the plan to exclude  the ineligible rank-and-file employees and award them the full vesting and  other protections under ERISA while maintaining the plan\u2019s status under  ERISA as an executive retirement plan for those executives who do  qualify. However, the amicus brief states that DOL took no position on  the form of equitable relief appropriate under ERISA to redress an  employer\u2019s violation of vesting requirements by including rank-and-file  employees in an executive retirement plan. The amicus brief also  suggests that this approach would avoid providing a windfall gain to  executives who properly could have been included in such a plan,  because they possess sufficient bargaining power to protect their rights,  and are not the intended beneficiaries of the substantive provisions under  Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA. When asked about this remedy, DOL  officials said that funds from the executive retirement plan could be  distributed to a qualified retirement plan for rank-and-file employees, with  their benefits immediately fully vested and receiving ERISA protections.", "When we discussed the possible remedy described in the amicus brief  with IRS officials, they said that while 409A regulations were being  drafted, they were aware that applying strict distribution rules could have  adverse tax consequences for rank-and-file employees participating in  executive retirement plans. IRS officials said that removing these  employees from these plans and awarding them full vesting of their  benefits under Title I of ERISA could violate section 409A, raising  concerns that the possible remedy noted in DOL\u2019s amicus brief may be  inadequate for companies seeking a method to correct plan errors.  Officials also said that there are certain exceptions under section 409A  when accelerated payments may be permitted; however, IRS officials  said there is no current exception permitting an accelerated payment to  be made to a rank-and-file employee in order to correct a violation of Title  I of ERISA.", "IRS officials said they are willing to work with DOL to promulgate new  section 409A regulations to create an exception to the accelerated  payment rule for plans that seek to remove ineligible rank-and-file  employees from the plan and make distributions to an employee\u2019s  qualified retirement plan in order to maintain the plan\u2019s ERISA  exemption. However, IRS officials said that prescribing corrective  action in these situations is under DOL\u2019s purview and that DOL first would  need to further delineate the meaning of an executive retirement plan  employee and then decide the proper approach for removing ineligible  rank-and-file employees from a plan before any new regulations under  section 409A could be considered. As mentioned above, federal  standards for internal control require federal agencies to externally  communicate necessary quality information to achieve their objectives.  Without additional information from DOL on what companies can do to  reduce the incidence of ineligible rank-and-file employees participating in  these plans, some ineligible employees may continue to participate in  some instances, potentially subjecting them to unexpected tax  consequences such as if they are removed from the plan and the  payment of their deferred compensation is accelerated. Further, without  knowing how to properly remove ineligible rank-and-file employees when  they are found participating in executive retirement plans, companies may  be uncertain on how to re-establish an executive retirement plan\u2019s  exemption from the substantive provisions of Title I of ERISA for  otherwise eligible participants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although executive retirement plans are an important retirement savings  vehicle for corporate executives and other highly compensated  employees, little is known about certain key aspects of these  arrangements.

Little information is available at the federal level  about who is included in executive retirement plans because companies  provide minimal information to DOL only once when they implement such  a plan. By revisiting its reporting requirements, DOL can help ensure that  only executives who can bear the risks inherent in these plans are  permitted to participate. DOL has other opportunities to diminish this risk  by providing assistance to companies, such as additional information  describing plan eligibility, which could help companies reduce the  incidence of rank-and-file employees participating in these plans.

Companies  listed in the S&P 500 are generally also listed in the Russell 3,000. The  SEC generally requires public companies to disclose executive  compensation information\u2014including executive retirement plan benefits\u2014 provided to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the  next three most highly compensated executive officers. These data are  principally found in the annual proxy statement within the Summary  Compensation Table, Pension Benefits Table, and Nonqualified Deferred  Compensation Table. The data include executive retirement plan benefits  offered as a defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan. For a  given year, the total accumulated value of executive retirement plans  structured as a defined benefit provided to top executives are based on  the \u201cpresent value of accumulated benefit\u201d and \u201cpayments during the last  fiscal year\u201d as reported in the Pension Benefits Table.

We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of describing the prevalence of executive  retirement plans among companies subject to SEC\u2019s disclosure  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporate Bankruptcy Case Reviews", "paragraphs": ["To understand the expected outcomes for executive retirement plan  benefits during company bankruptcy, we analyzed data collected from our  non-generalizable review of a random sample of companies that offered  an executive retirement plan and filed for bankruptcy during the period  from October 17, 2005\u2014the effective date for most of the provisions of  the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  (2005 Bankruptcy Act)\u2014through November 30, 2017\u2014 the most recent at  the time of our analysis. The 2005 Bankruptcy Act made significant  changes to federal bankruptcy law, including provisions limiting executive  compensation in corporate bankruptcy. Using the unique Employer  Identification Number (EIN) the IRS assigns to companies, we matched  corporate Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases with DOL\u2019s  database of executive retirement plans to obtain lists of companies that  filed for bankruptcy and offered at least one executive retirement plan.  We obtained lists of corporate bankruptcy filings from New Generation  Research Inc.\u2019s (NGR) online database. NGR is a provider of data on  corporate bankruptcies and companies in financial distress. We obtained  from DOL its comprehensive list of executive retirement plans as filed  with the agency from July 1982 to August 2017. The NGR and DOL data  are not exclusive to public or private companies. To assess the reliability  of the NGR and DOL data, we corresponded with officials regarding their  respective data collection processes and requirements. We found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The results of our data  matching produced 138 Chapter 7 cases and 594 Chapter 11 cases of  companies that filed for bankruptcy and offered an executive retirement  plan. We reviewed a random selection of 151 cases (30 Chapter 7 and  121 Chapter 11) from a total of 732 relevant bankruptcy cases.", "To review bankruptcy court cases, we developed a standardized protocol  to review each identified case and data collection instrument to input the  data. The protocol included step-by-step instructions for reviewers to  follow, including prescribed court documents to review and data to be  collected. We obtained feedback on our case review protocol and data  collection instrument from two outside bankruptcy experts\u2014an attorney  with expertise in the tax aspects of corporate bankruptcies and a  bankruptcy law professor and former attorney who previously served as a  federal bankruptcy judge\u2014and incorporated their technical feedback on  the documents. We also worked with a GAO methodologist to pretest our  case review protocols and data collection instruments on a review of a  select sample cases from the matched list to ensure our review process  could collect reliable data between different reviewers.", "To obtain bankruptcy case documents to review, we used court filings  obtained from PACER exclusively and did not rely on other data sources.  PACER is an electronic public access service provided by the Federal  Judiciary that allows users to obtain case and docket information online  from federal appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts. Case documents  are available on PACER as they are filed or entered into the court\u2019s case  system. Based on our case review protocol, we reviewed (where  available), the court docket, case summary, bankruptcy petition, first day  motions, management affidavit, schedule of assets and liabilities,  statement of financial affairs, court-approved disclosure statement, court- approved plan (of reorganization or liquidation), and settlement  agreements, among other documents with information relevant to  executive retirement plans and their expected resolution in bankruptcy.  We reviewed cases based on documents available in PACER between  April and May 2018.", "Our review of 151 cases (30 Chapter 7 and 121 Chapter 11) from the  matched lists resulted in 38 Chapter 11 cases where we identified  executive retirement plan benefits in existence at or around the time of  company bankruptcy and were able to determine the expected resolution  of those benefits for employees as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding.  As part of our review, we excluded cases if: (1) we were unable to confirm  the presence of an executive retirement plan through review of court  documents, (2) the case did not have a court-approved disclosure  statement with estimated recovery percentages for various creditor  classes in the case docket, or (3) if the case was open (i.e., not  terminated) and had a reorganization or liquidation plan confirmed on or  after May 2016, about 2 years from the start of our review. For the  foregoing reasons, we were unable to identify expected outcomes in any  of the Chapter 7 cases reviewed. For Chapter 11 cases, we were unable  to ascertain actual outcome information for any of the cases we reviewed,  but based the expected outcome of the executive retirement plan benefits  on estimates provided in the court-approved disclosure statement,  bankruptcy plan (reorganization or liquidation), or settlement agreement,  which may differ from actual recoveries. To determine the expected  resolution of executive retirement plan benefits, we reviewed case filings  for evidence of specific treatment provided to employees with these  claims. To the extent we did not find evidence of specific treatment for  executive retirement plan benefits, we relied on estimated recovery  information for the class of general unsecured creditors. Because the  nature of bankruptcy proceedings depends on the facts and  circumstances of each individual cause, the results of our analysis are not  generalizable but provide illustrative examples of the potential outcomes  of such cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Selected Court Cases and Surveys on Plan Eligibility and Participation", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed selected court cases related to employee eligibility in  executive retirement plans as identified by DOL, industry experts, and  other literature.
