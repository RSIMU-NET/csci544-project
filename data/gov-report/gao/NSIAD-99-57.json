The initial training phase is conducted at Fort Benning, the second phase is conducted in the Georgia mountains, and the third phase is conducted in river and swamp terrain in Florida. In February 1995, four Ranger students died of hypothermia while undergoing waterborne training in the Florida swamps.", "The Army\u2019s investigation of the accident recommended corrective actions to improve Ranger training safety and preserve the lessons learned from the accident. Corrective actions to improve the safety of Ranger training were also prescribed by the Fiscal Year 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. The act required the Army to ensure that the number of officers and the number of enlisted personnel assigned to the Ranger Training Brigade are not less than 90 percent of required levels. The Army defines requirements as the minimum number of personnel needed to perform a unit\u2019s mission effectively. This mandate was to become effective no later than February 1997 and expire 2 years after it is achieved. The act also required the Army to establish at each of the three Ranger training locations an organization known as a \u201csafety cell,\u201d comprising individuals with sufficient continuity and experience in each geographic area to be knowledgeable of local conditions and the potential impact of weather and other conditions on training safety. The act further provided that these individuals shall serve as advisors to the officers in charge of training to assist in making training \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cno go\u201d decisions in light of weather and other conditions.", "Our preliminary report assessed the implementation and effectiveness of the corrective actions, the Army\u2019s progress in implementing the mandated staffing levels and safety cell organizations, and the adequacy of Army oversight to ensure that the corrective actions are sustained in the future. We recommended that the Army direct the Ranger Training Brigade to identify critical training safety controls and ensure that the Ranger training chain of command, and organizations outside the chain of command, conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the safety controls implemented after the accident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Increased Brigade Personnel but Many Factors Have Hindered Meeting Mandated Levels", "paragraphs": ["At the time of the 1995 accident, the Ranger Training Brigade had a staffing priority that authorized it to be staffed at about 85 percent of its personnel requirements. In response to the mandated 90-percent level, the Army excepted the Brigade from normal Army staffing priorities and raised the Brigade\u2019s officer distribution and enlisted personnel authorizations to 90 percent of the required numbers. It expected to staff the Brigade at this level in February 1997. Despite these measures, the Army was not able to assign and maintain the numbers of officers and enlisted personnel the act required for most months since that time. The Brigade staffing level has improved since the accident, even though the Army has not maintained staffing at the mandated level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mandated Officer and Enlisted Personnel Levels Have Not Been Sustained", "paragraphs": ["Although in the aggregate, the Brigade was assigned 96 percent of its required personnel in February 1997, it had only 88 percent of the required number of officers. The Brigade\u2019s officer strength has remained below the mandated 90-percent level for most of the time between February 1997 and November 1998 and fell to under 80 percent for 9 months. While the Brigade was able to maintain higher enlisted personnel levels because of the Army priority for assigning enlisted Ranger instructors, its enlisted strength overall was also under the mandated level for 14 months from February 1997 through September 1998, as shown in figure 1.", "At the end of November 1998, when we completed our review, the Brigade was assigned 59 (or 80 percent) of its 74 required officers and 596 (or 93 percent) of its required enlisted personnel. Although the number of assigned officers was below the act\u2019s requirement, it was significantly higher than it was at the time of the accident, when only 38 officers were assigned. Further, although the Brigade was assigned less than the required number of enlisted personnel from October 1997 through September 1998, it did have over 90 percent of its required number of enlisted Ranger instructors.", "As of November 1998, the Brigade would have needed eight more officers to meet the mandated 90-percent level. Fort Benning officials said that they would be unable to assign any additional officers until captains undergoing advanced infantry officer training become available in December 1998.", "Data on the Brigade\u2019s numbers of required and assigned officers and enlisted personnel by month are included in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Have Contributed to Shortfalls in Meeting Required Personnel Levels", "paragraphs": ["Many factors have contributed to the Army\u2019s shortfalls in meeting the required numbers of officers and enlisted personnel, including unplanned losses of officers, shortages of branch-qualified captains and certain enlisted specialties, unfilled requirements for other service\u2019s instructors, and higher personnel requirements.", "Army officials at Fort Benning told us that the unplanned loss of personnel was the primary reason for not meeting the mandated officer level. The Brigade lost several officers who resigned their commissions or were injured while conducting Ranger training exercises. When these unexpected losses occurred, it was not possible to immediately reassign officers from other Army units to fill them. Fort Benning officials told us that replacing experienced and branch-qualified captains was particularly difficult because they are in short supply throughout the Army. As a result, Fort Benning was unable to immediately replace the officers lost by the Brigade and had to wait for graduates of the Infantry Officer Advanced course at Fort Benning to become available.", "Some of the shortfall of enlisted personnel was due to unfilled requirements for instructors from the other services. For fiscal year 1998, the Army determined that the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine Corps were to provide 20 instructors, and for fiscal year 1999, 16 instructors, based on the numbers of students they collectively planned to enroll in the Ranger course. However, the other services have not provided the numbers of instructors required. For example, thus far, in fiscal year 1999, the Marine Corps has provided only 2 of the 13 instructors. If the services had met their instructor requirements, the Army would have achieved the mandated enlisted personnel level in most months since February 1997. Table 1 shows the number of students the Army and other services planned to enroll in the Ranger course in fiscal year 1999 with the required and assigned instructors.", "Two other factors contributed to personnel shortages in the Brigade. First, the Army had difficulty assigning the required numbers of enlisted training support personnel, such as medics and signal systems specialists, because there were, and still are, relatively small numbers of personnel with these specialties in the force. Second, in October 1997, the Army added 7 additional personnel requirements for officers and 86 additional requirements for enlisted personnel. Because the numbers of assigned personnel did not significantly change along with the added requirements, the percentages of assigned to required personnel declined significantly. Although Army officials at Fort Benning thought they could fill these positions within several months, both officer and enlisted personnel levels remained well below the mandated levels throughout fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Assignments and Civilian Personnel Shortages Reduce the Availability of the Brigade\u2019s Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The actual number of personnel available is often less than the number of personnel assigned to the Brigade. At any given time, some Brigade personnel are attending Army schools or are assigned to other duties, such as recruiting, thus reducing the actual number of personnel available to conduct and support Ranger training. As in all Army units, Brigade personnel periodically attend Army schools to complete their career training requirements or perform other duties for their units. In November 1998, the Brigade was assigned 59 (or 80 percent) of its 74 required officers. However, 3 of the 59 officers were attending schools or performing other full-time duties. As a result, the Brigade only had 76 percent of its required officers available. In addition, Ranger training battalion commanders must often assign soldiers to fill vacant civilian personnel positions. In November 1998, the Brigade had only 10 (or 20 percent) of its 49 required civilian personnel. To compensate for these shortages, battalion commanders periodically assigned Ranger training personnel to maintenance, supply, administrative, and other jobs\u2014a common practice throughout the Army when civilian personnel requirements cannot be met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unique Ranger Training and Personnel Requirements Are Not Recognized in Army Personnel Distribution Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Both Ranger training and the requirements for the personnel that conduct the training are unique. Unlike training at other TRADOC schools, Ranger training is conducted around the clock, under hazardous conditions, at three separate locations in difficult mountainous, river, and swamp terrain. The training is designed to subject students to hot and cold weather temperature extremes and mental and physical stresses, including nutritional and sleep deprivation\u2014conditions that are intended to approach those found in combat. To conduct this type of training, Ranger instructors, battalion and company commanders, and support personnel must be qualified to function effectively under similar conditions. Therefore, many Brigade personnel are required to have special qualifications, including airborne and Ranger qualifications, and some are required to have swimmer and diver qualifications. Personnel with these qualifications are in short supply and in high demand throughout the Army. However, the current Army officer distribution policy gives top priority units, such as special operations forces, 100 percent of their requirements for these kinds of specialties. Without the higher priority the Army implemented to meet the mandated levels, the Brigade would receive only about 85 percent of its officer requirement. The Brigade would therefore compete with higher priority units and other TRADOC schools to obtain personnel with these specialized qualifications. The Army\u2019s enlisted distribution policy, however, does give a higher priority to the Brigade for enlisted instructors because it needs between 60 and 180 days to train and certify personnel to become fully qualified Ranger instructors.", "Further, assigning personnel is complicated because, unlike other Army training units, the Brigade\u2019s headquarters and three training battalions are located in separate geographic areas. While Army commanders usually move personnel between positions within their units to compensate for any losses, the Brigade\u2019s ability to do so is limited because reassigning personnel from one training battalion to another involves permanent changes of station for soldiers and their families. Therefore, when losses occur, the Brigade must wait for available personnel from other Army units rather than move personnel internally between battalions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Army Plans to Staff Safety Cells With Civilians", "paragraphs": ["The act specified that safety cell personnel at each location must have sufficient continuity and experience to be knowledgeable of local terrain, weather, and other conditions. Currently, members of the Brigade and the battalions\u2019 chains of command, including the Brigade and battalion commanders, serve in the safety cells and supervise daily training safety decisions. While these people have developed a high degree of experience and knowledge of local conditions, the frequency of their rotations to new units may prevent the safety cells from obtaining individuals with sufficient continuity in the local training areas. Army officers usually rotate to new units every 2 years, enlisted personnel about every 3 years. In contrast, Army civilian employees do not rotate jobs as frequently and thus would appear to provide the continuity envisioned in the act.", "In 1996, the Infantry Center at Fort Benning and the Brigade considered requesting civilian personnel for the safety cells but decided to adopt the current approach of having Brigade personnel serve in the safety cells. However, in September 1998, TRADOC reconsidered this approach and began work on a plan to authorize hiring four civilians for the safety cells at the Brigade and at each of the three training battalions. Army officials at Fort Benning told us they plan to develop job descriptions, identify candidates, and hire staff for the safety cells by September 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrective Safety Actions Are Incorporated in Standard Operating Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s investigation of the accident recommended corrective actions to improve (1) risk assessments of training conditions, (2) command and control of training exercises, and (3) medical support and evacuation procedures.

In addition, in September 1997, the Army Inspector General reviewed the corrective actions and waterborne training safety controls at the Florida Ranger camp and concluded that they were in place and functioning as intended.", "During our review, we found that the corrective actions had been institutionalized in Brigade standard operating procedures and that the safety control measures and medical evacuation procedures remained in place and appeared to be functioning effectively. Specifically, the Brigade continued to apply safety improvements at the Florida Ranger camp, such as command and control systems to better monitor and predict river and swamp conditions, and to conduct waterborne training exercises in designated training lanes outside of high-risk areas. At all three training locations, medical evacuation procedures had been revised, rehearsed, and inspected; and physician assistants had been assigned to the Brigade and training battalions. In addition, the Brigade has improved safety and the supervision of training by requiring that its training companies be commanded by experienced and branch-qualified captains. To better supervise training safety, the Brigade also assigns an officer and an enlisted noncommissioned officer to serve as training liaisons to accompany and monitor each Ranger class through all three phases of training.", "A complete description and status of all corrective actions are included in appendixes II through V."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safety Inspections Do Not Evaluate or Document Compliance With Training Safety Controls", "paragraphs": ["Our preliminary report assessing Ranger training safety recommended that TRADOC, the Army Infantry Center, Fort Benning, the Ranger Training Brigade, and organizations outside the chain of command, such as the Army Inspector General, conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the safety controls implemented after the 1995 accident.

Also, Fort Benning has conducted two command and staff inspections, and the Brigade has conducted three command and staff inspections. In addition, the Army Inspector General has visited all three phases of Ranger training and, in September 1997, completed an inspection of the safety controls.", "However, the scope and results of the personal inspections conducted by the Infantry Center and Brigade commanders have not been documented.

Without sufficient priority, we believe that unplanned losses and other problems that have kept the Brigade\u2019s officer strength below the mandated 90-percent levels would, over time, degrade officer strength to the levels that existed at the time of the accident. In view of the increased personnel levels since the accident, and provided that the Army continues the current staffing priority for the Brigade, we do not believe that it is necessary to maintain mandated personnel levels in law.", "Additionally, the failure to evaluate specific training safety controls and document the results of such evaluations provide inadequate assurance that safety measures and controls are in place and functioning effectively.
