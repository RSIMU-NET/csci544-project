Elements required for information system security plans--which would provide a full understanding of existing and planned information security requirements--were missing. Testing and evaluation of security controls--which are needed to determine the effectiveness of information security policies and procedures--were incomplete or not performed. Elements required for remedial action plans--which would identify the resources needed to correct or mitigate known information security weaknesses--were missing, as were elements required for continuity of operations plans to restore critical systems in case of unexpected events. In addition, DHS had not yet fully developed a complete and accurate systems inventory. Shortfalls in executing responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the information security program allowed these weaknesses to occur. Although DHS has an organization that is responsible for overseeing the component implementation of key information security practices and controls, its primary means for doing so--an enterprisewide tool--has not been reliable.

Having reliable metrics on key activities such as those  we identified as having weaknesses\u2014risk assessments, security plans,  security test and evaluation, remedial action plans, and continuity of  operations plans\u2014is critical. According to DHS\u2019s information security  policies and procedures, the CISO is to use these metrics to validate the  efficacy of the program, identify gaps between reported and actual  performance data, and help focus attention on presidential, congressional,  or department priorities. In response to the OIG\u2019s FISMA evaluation, the  CIO stated that the department had recently initiated a project to review  and verify the metrics data. However, the CIO has not established a  milestone for completing this project.

However, ensuring that the  components implement key information security practices and controls,  especially with a department as diverse as DHS, requires effective  management oversight and monitoring. Having a complete and accurate  information systems inventory and a process in place to verify the  components\u2019 data on their implementation of the key information security  practices and controls is needed for DHS to effectively implement its  information security program.

We  assessed whether DHS\u2019s departmentwide information security program  was consistent with the requirements of FISMA and applicable Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) policies and NIST guidance related to  performing risk assessments, developing information security plans,  testing and evaluating security controls, documenting remedial action  plans, and documenting and testing continuity of operations plans.", "To determine whether DHS had implemented its departmentwide  information security program, we focused our review on the components\u2019  alignment with key information security practices and controls. To  accomplish this, we selected seven DHS components\u2014five of which DHS  categorize as major agency components due to their size and mission. The  five components selected were: Customs and Border Protection,  Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard, and Emergency Preparedness and  Response. We also selected these five components because they had been  in existence prior to the transformation of DHS and, from an evaluation  standpoint, focused on determining their progress in aligning with and  implementing the departmentwide information security program given  these components had their own information technology management  structures, information security policies and practices, and infrastructures.  As a comparison, we selected one component\u2014Science and Technology\u2014 that had not existed prior to the transformation to evaluate its alignment  with and implementation of the departmentwide information security  program. We also selected the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status  Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program due to its significant mission in  providing security to our nation\u2019s borders.", "Based on their criticality to DHS\u2019s mission operations, we selected for  review three major applications and three general support systems and  obtained documentation contained in the certification and accreditation  packages for the selected systems to assess the extent to which the  components implemented key information security practices and controls.  Certification is a comprehensive process of assessing the level of security  risk, identifying security controls needed to reduce risk and maintain it at  an acceptable level, documenting security controls in a security plan, and  testing controls to ensure they operate as intended. Accreditation is a  written decision by an agency management official authorizing operation of  a particular information system or group of systems. Specifically, we  reviewed and analyzed information security plans, risk assessments,  information security test and evaluation reports, remedial action plans, and  continuity of operations plans for the selected systems. We compared the  components\u2019 documented practices and controls for these information  security areas with applicable FISMA requirements, OMB guidance, and  applicable NIST guidance.", "To supplement our documentation reviews and analysis, we reviewed and  considered various audit reports from the CIO and OIG evaluations of  DHS\u2019s information security program, including DHS\u2019s and OIG\u2019s annual  FISMA reports from 2003 and 2004.", "We performed our review at DHS headquarters, the offices of the seven  components, and at our headquarters in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan  area; and at DHS\u2019s network and security operations center in Denver,  Colorado, from July 2004 through May 2005.
