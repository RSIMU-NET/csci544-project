Since 1998, Congress has required the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the federal regulator of the credit union system, to take prompt corrective action (PCA) to identify and address the financial deterioration of federally insured natural person credit unions (credit unions) and minimize potential losses to the NCUSIF. Legislation enacted in 2011 requires GAO to examine NCUA\u0092s supervision of the credit union system and use of PCA. This report examines (1) the failures of corporate and credit unions since 2008, (2) NCUA\u0092s response to the failures, and (3) the effectiveness of NCUA\u0092s use of PCA. To do this work, GAO analyzed agency and industry financial data and material loss reviews, reviewed regulations, and interviewed agency officials and trade organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2011, 5 corporates and 85 credit unions failed. As of January 1, 2008, the 5 failed corporates were some of the largest\u0097accounting for 75 percent of all corporate assets\u0097but the 85 failed credit unions were relatively small\u0097accounting for less than 1 percent of total credit union assets. GAO found poor investment and business strategies contributed to the corporate failures. Specifically, the failed corporates over concentrated their investments in private-label, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and invested substantially more in private-label MBS than corporates that did not fail. GAO also found that poor management was the primary reason the 85 credit unions failed. In addition, NCUA\u0092s Office of Inspector General has reported that NCUA\u0092s examination and enforcement processes did not result in strong and timely actions to avert the failure of these institutions NCUA took multiple actions to stabilize, resolve, and reform the corporate system. NCUA used existing funding sources, such as the NCUSIF, and new funding sources, including the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund (Stabilization Fund), to stabilize and provide liquidity to the corporates. NCUA placed the failing corporates into conservatorship and liquidated certain poor performing assets. In order to decrease losses from the corporates\u0092 failures, NCUA established a securitization program to provide long-term funding for assets formerly held in the portfolios of failed corporates by issuing NCUA guaranteed notes. To address weaknesses highlighted by the crisis, in 2010, NCUA issued regulations to prohibit investment in private-label MBS, established a PCA framework for corporates, and introduced new governance provisions. NCUA considered credit unions\u0092 ability to repay borrowings from Treasury and included measures to reduce moral hazard, minimize the cost of resolving the corporates, and protect taxpayers. While NCUA has estimated the losses to the Stabilization Fund, it could not provide adequate documentation to allow NCUA\u0092s Office of Inspector General or GAO to verify their completeness and reasonableness. Without well-documented cost information, NCUA faces questions about its ability to effectively estimate the total costs of the failures and determine whether the credit unions will be able to pay for these losses. GAO\u0092s analysis of PCA and other NCUA enforcement actions highlights opportunities for improvement. For credit unions subject to PCA, GAO found those credit unions that did not fail were more likely subject to earlier PCA action\u0097that is, before their capital levels deteriorated to the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels\u0097than failed credit unions. GAO also found that for many of the failed credit unions, other enforcement actions were initiated either too late or not at all. GAO has previously noted that the effectiveness of PCA for banks is limited because of its reliance on capital, which can lag behind other indicators of financial health. GAO examined other potential financial indicators for credit unions, including measures of asset quality and liquidity, and found a number of indicators that could provide early warning of credit union distress. Incorporating such indicators into the PCA framework could improve its effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["NCUA should (1) provide its Office Inspector General the necessary documentation to verify loss estimates and (2) consider additional triggers for PCA that would require early and forceful regulatory action and make recommendations to Congress on how to modify PCA, as appropriate.

Corporates  are financial institutions whose members are credit unions, not  individuals, and that provide credit unions with payment services,  investment opportunities, and other forms of credit, should credit unions  face liquidity needs. The corporates experienced significant financial  losses during the financial crisis that in turn contributed to losses to the  National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).

Prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, PCA  for credit unions was largely untested.

Credit  unions are owned by individual members (natural persons) who make  share deposits and are provided with products and services, such as  lending, investments, and payment processing. Credit unions are subject  to limits on their membership because members must have a \u201ccommon  bond\u201d\u2014for example, working for the same employer or living in the same  community.

In particular, when loan demand is low or deposits  are high, credit unions generally invest excess liquidity in corporates and  then withdraw funds when loan demand is high or deposits are low.  Corporates meet liquidity needs with member deposits and by borrowing  from U.S. Central, capital markets, or the Federal Home Loan Banks.Corporates primarily owned by U.S. Central, which functioned as a  corporate for the corporates, provide the same depository and other  services that corporates provide to credit unions.

In addition, credit unions can obtain investment products and  services from broker-dealers or investment firms rather than corporates.  Credit union service organizations (CUSO) also compete with corporates  and offer, among other things, investments and payment processing.

When NCUA determines the credit union is in the  undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically  undercapitalized categories, NCUA is required to take additional  mandatory supervisory actions. In addition to these mandatory  supervisory actions, NCUA often enforces discretionary supervisory  actions.

Specifically, U.S. Central and the failed corporates  overconcentrated their investments in private-label, mortgage-backed  securities (MBS), investing substantially more in private-label MBS than  corporate credit unions that did not fail (see fig. 3). At the end of 2007,  the five failed corporates had invested 31 to 74 percent of their assets in  private-label MBS. In particular, Wescorp and U.S. Central had invested  74 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of their portfolio in private-label  MBS. In contrast, 10 of the 23 remaining corporates had also invested in  private-label MBS but at lower levels\u2014for example, from 1 to 19  percent. These high concentrations of private-label MBS exposed the  failed corporates to the highs and lows of the real estate market, which  experienced significant losses.", "Furthermore, corporates had significant deposits in U.S. Central, which  led to indirect exposure to its high concentration of private-label MBS and  losses when it failed. For example, in 2007, Members United had  invested more than 40 percent of total assets in U.S. Central, and  Southwest and Constitution had each invested approximately 30 percent  of total assets, according to the MLRs.", "In addition to poor investment decisions, the business strategies U.S.  Central and the other four failed corporates\u2019 pursued contributed to their  failure. Specifically, their management implemented business strategies  to attract and retain credit union members by offering lower rates on  services and higher returns on investments. According to the MLRs, U.S.  Central shifted towards an aggressive growth strategy to maintain and  increase its market share of corporates. This strategy led its management  to increase its holdings of high-yielding investments, including private- label MBS. From 2006 to 2007, U.S. Central\u2019s assets grew by 22 percent  as members invested their liquid funds in return for competitive rates. The  other failed corporates implemented similar business strategies.", "The financial crisis exposed the problems in the corporates\u2019 investment  and business strategies, leading to a severe liquidity crisis within the  credit union system. Specifically, the downturn severely diminished the  value and market for private-label MBS and depositors lost confidence in  the corporate system because of the institutions\u2019 substantial investment in  these securities. The decline in value of these investments resulted in  corporates borrowing significant amounts of short-term funds from outside  of the credit union system to meet liquidity needs as credit unions  reduced their deposits. However, these options became limited when  credit rating agencies and lenders lost confidence in individual corporates  and some lines of credit were suspended. For example, from 2007 to  2009, credit rating agencies downgraded U.S. Central\u2019s long- and short- term credit ratings, and in 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  downgraded its borrowing ability.

The following describes these risks and  provides examples of how exposure to these risks led to the failure of a  number of credit unions.", "Operational risk includes the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed  internal controls, due diligence, and oversight. We found that  management\u2019s failure to control operational risk contributed to 76 of the  85 failures. For example, Norlarco Credit Union\u2019s management had weak  oversight policies and controls for an out of state construction lending  program and failed to perform due diligence before entering into a  relationship with a third party responsible for managing it. Norlarco\u2019s  management allowed the third party to have complete control in making  and overseeing all of the credit union\u2019s residential construction loans,  leading to a decline in borrower credit quality and underreported  delinquencies. Potential losses from its residential construction loan  program led to Norlarco\u2019s insolvency.", "Management\u2019s failure to control operational risk can also create the  potential for fraud. We analyzed NCUA\u2019s and its OIG\u2019s data and found  that fraud or alleged fraud at credit unions contributed to 29 of 85 of credit  union failures. According to NCUA, credit unions with inadequate internal  controls are susceptible to fraud. In addition, NCUA\u2019s internal  assessments of fraud showed that their examiners often had cited  inactive boards or Supervisory Committees, limited number of staff, and  poor record keeping before the fraud was discovered at the failed credit  unions. For example, the OIG reported that Certified Federal Credit  Union\u2019s internal controls were severely lacking, enabling the chief  executive officer to report erroneous financial results to the credit union\u2019s  board and in quarterly call reports. According to the MLR, before the fraud  was identified, the credit union\u2019s board was weak and unresponsive to  repeated reports of inaccurate accounting records and weak internal  controls from NCUA examiners and external auditors. The credit union  was involuntarily liquidated in 2010. NCUA OIG officials told us that some  other indicators of potential fraud are high ratios of investments to assets  and a low number of loan delinquencies.", "Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will not repay a loan or will  default. We found that management\u2019s failure to control for credit risk  contributed to 58 of the 85 credit union failures. For example, Clearstar  Financial Credit Union management originated and funded a significant  number of loans that were poorly underwritten\u2014that is, they were made  to borrowers with poor credit histories. Management then compounded  these mistakes by extending delinquent loans and poor collection  practices, contributing to the credit union\u2019s eventual failure.", "Moreover, management at some failed credit unions did not consistently  monitor the credit risk associated with member business loans (MBL).  With some limitations, credit unions can lend to their members for  business purposes. However, these loans can be risky for credit unions.  For example, NCUA reported in recent congressional testimony that due  to the lack of credit union expertise and challenging macroeconomic  conditions, over half of the losses sustained by the NCUSIF were related  to MBLs for a two year period in the late 1980s. Our analysis of NCUA\u2019s  and its OIG\u2019s data indicated that MBLs contributed to 13 of the 85 credit  union failures. According to our analysis of historical financial data, failed  credit unions had more MBLs as a percentage of assets than peer credit  unions that did not fail or the credit union industry (see fig. 4). In  addition, more than 40 percent of failed credit unions participated in  member business lending. Comparatively, NCUA had testified that only  30 percent of all credit unions participated in member business lending,  as of March 31, 2011.", "Liquidity risk is the risk that the credit union may not be able to meet  expenses or cover member withdrawals because of illiquid assets. We  found that liquidity risk contributed to 31 of the 85 credit union failures.  For example, the management of Ensign Federal Credit Union relied on a  $12 million deposit to fund credit union operations. However, when the  deposit was withdrawn in 2009, the credit union lacked other funding  sources to meet normal member demands and operational expenses,  contributing to the credit union\u2019s failure.", "Concentration risk is excessive exposure to certain markets, industries, or  groups. While some level of concentration may not be avoidable, it is the  responsibility of management to put in place appropriate controls,  policies, and systems to monitor the associated risks. We found that  concentration risk contributed to 27 of the 85 credit union failures. For  example, High Desert Federal Credit Union\u2019s management began  expanding its real estate construction lending in 2003, and by 2006, its  loan portfolio had more than doubled from $73 million to $154 million. In  2006, construction lending accounted for more than 60 percent of the  credit union\u2019s loan portfolio.

NCUA examiners had observed the substantial  concentration of private-label MBS for U.S Central and three of the four  other corporates that failed prior to 2008, but did not take timely action to  address these concentrations.

Due to the restriction preventing the Central  Liquidity Facility (CLF) from lending directly to the corporate credit unions,  NCUA designed both programs, CU-SIP and CU-HARP, so that the CLF  would lend to the credit unions, which agreed that they in turn would  invest in NCUA-guaranteed notes issued by corporates. Starting in  January 2009, corporates were required to use the invested funds to pay  down their external secured debt. Money from the corporates\u2019 debt  issuances were used to free up collateral and to pay back loans made by  the credit unions.
