As a result, many companies have adopted innovative business practices to meet customer needs and retain profitability. DOD faces a similar challenge of providing better service at a lower cost. With the end of the Cold War, DOD\u2019s logistics systems must support a smaller, highly mobile, high-technology force. Due to the pressures of budgetary constraints, DOD also must seek ways to make logistics processes as efficient as possible.", "To provide reparable parts for its approximately 7,300 aircraft (primarily helicopters), the Army uses an extensive logistics system that is based on a management process, procedures, and concepts that have evolved over time but are largely outdated. Reparable parts are expensive items that can be fixed and used again, such as hydraulic pumps, navigational computers, and landing gear. The Army\u2019s logistics system, often referred to as a logistics pipeline, consists of a number of activities that play a role in providing aircraft parts where and when they are needed. These activities include the purchase, storage, distribution, and repair of parts, which together require billions of dollars of investments in personnel, equipment, facilities, and inventory. The Army\u2019s depot repair location for helicopters and aviation parts is the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD), Texas.", "The Army also relies on this pipeline for consumable parts (e.g., nuts, bearings, and fuses) that are used extensively to fix reparable parts and aircraft. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) provides most of the consumable parts that Army repair activities need and handles a large part of the warehousing and distribution of reparable parts.", "Although not as large as the Army, commercial airlines have similar operating characteristics to the Army. They maintain fleets of aircraft that use reparable parts and operate logistics pipelines having similar activities. For both the Army and commercial airlines, time plays a crucial role in the responsiveness of logistics operations and the amount of inventory needed. Pipeline complexity also adds to logistics costs by increasing overhead and adding to pipeline times. Condensing and simplifying pipeline operations, therefore, will simultaneously improve responsiveness and decrease costs by reducing inventory requirements and eliminating the infrastructure (warehouses, people, etc.) that is needed to manage unnecessary material.", "Over the last 10 years, we have issued more than 30 reports addressing the Army\u2019s logistics problems. These reports have highlighted issues related to large inventory levels, inefficient repair practices, and information system problems. While the Army has taken actions to correct its logistics problems, these problems have not been completely resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Operates a Slow, Inefficient, and Costly Logistics System", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s current depot repair pipeline, characterized by a $2.6 billion inventory investment, is slow, unreliable, and inefficient. For 24 different types of aviation parts examined, we calculated the Army\u2019s logistics system took an average of 525 days to ship broken parts from field units to the depot, repair them, and return the repaired parts to using units. We estimated 507 days (97 percent) of this time was the result of unplanned repair delays, depot storage, or transportation time. In another measure of efficiency, we calculated the Army uses its inventory 6 times slower than an airline in our comparison.", "The amount of time required by the system is important because the Army must invest in enough inventory to resupply units with serviceable parts and cover the amount of time it takes to move and repair parts through this process. If this repair time were reduced, inventory requirements would also be reduced. For example, in an Army-sponsored RAND study, it was noted that reducing the repair time for one helicopter component from 90 days to 15 days would reduce inventory requirements for that component from $60 million to $10 million.", "Also, in a 1996 preliminary report to the Army, RAND concluded that \u201cif non-value-added steps  were reduced or eliminated, repair cycle times could become much shorter and far less variable. The benefits for the Army would be greater weapon system availability, more regular and predictable supply of serviceable components, savings from reduced pipeline inventory requirements, and a repair system more flexible and responsive in serving the needs of the combat commander.\u201d", "To calculate the amount of time the Army\u2019s system takes to repair and distribute parts using the current depot repair process, we judgmentally selected 24 types of Army aviation parts and computed the time the parts spent in four key segments of the repair process. The key segments were (1) preparing and shipping the parts from the bases to the depot, (2) storing the parts at the depot before induction into the repair shop, (3) repairing the parts, and (4) storing the parts at the depot before they were shipped to a field unit. For the parts we selected, it took the Army an average of 525 days to complete this process. Table 1 shows the fastest, slowest, and average time the Army took to complete each of the four pipeline segments.", "As shown in table 1, the repair pipeline time was both long and highly variable. The fastest time the Army took to complete any of the four pipeline segments was less than 1 day, but the slowest times ranged from 887 days to more than 1,000 days.", "In contrast, one airline we found to be using leading-edge practices, British Airways, took a much shorter period of time to move a part through its logistics system. As shown in figure 1, the average time to move a gearbox assembly through the first three segments was 116 days for British Airways while the Army\u2019s average time was 429 days, or about 4 times longer. While the Army\u2019s repair time was twice as long as British Airways, most of the Army\u2019s time occurred in the shipping and storage segments.", "In part, because of this slow process, the Army has invested billions of dollars in inventory to support peacetime operations that is not used as effectively as it could be. DOD reported that as of September 1995, the value of the Army\u2019s reparable aviation parts inventory was $2.6 billion,with 74 percent ($1.9 billion) allocated to support daily operations, 11 percent for war reserves, and 15 percent allocated as long supply\u2014 a term identifying stock that is excess to current Army requirements.", "One measure of the repair process efficiency is a calculation of how often an organization uses its inventory. This calculation is called the turnover rate. The higher the turnover rate, the more often a company is using its inventory. At one airline we visited\u2014British Airways\u2014the turnover rate for reparable parts was 2.3 times each year. In comparison, we calculated that, based on fiscal year 1995 repairs, the Army\u2019s turnover rate was  0.4 times, or about 6 times slower (see fig. 2). This calculation neither includes inventory the Army has allocated for war reserves nor inventory the Army has stored at field level organizations, which is classified as retail inventory.", "Comparing the Army\u2019s engineering estimate of the repair time that should be needed to complete repairs with the actual amount of time taken is another measure of the repair process\u2019 efficiency. Of the 525-day average pipeline time from our sample, the Army estimates an average of 18 days should be needed to repair the item(s). The remaining 507 days, or 97 percent of the total time, were spent to transport or store the part(s) or for unplanned repair delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Contribute to This Slow System", "paragraphs": ["Several factors contribute to the Army\u2019s slow logistics pipeline. Four of the factors are (1) slow processing and shipping of parts from the field to the repair depot, (2) delays in inducting parts into the repair shops, (3) inefficient organization of the depot repair process, and (4) lack of consumable parts needed to complete repairs. Because of these factors, parts sit idle or are delayed in the repair process, which lengthens the total repair time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Slow Processing and Shipping of Parts to the Depot", "paragraphs": ["Preparing and shipping a broken part from the operating unit to the depot for repair\u2014a process called \u201cretrograde\u201d\u2014took an average of 75 days for the items we examined. In contrast, British Airways estimated that only  2 days were needed to prepare and ship components from operating locations to its repair centers. In May 1996, RAND also found the Army\u2019s retrograde process to be slow; the median retrograde time for a sample of items it measured from the point when maintenance personnel determined a part was not reparable at the operating unit until it arrived at a DLA depot storage facility was 22 days and the longest time was more than 100 days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delayed Induction of Parts", "paragraphs": ["Our sample data show that broken parts may sit in storage at the depot facility for a long period of time until a certain quantity of parts are moved to or are \u201cinducted\u201d into the repair shop. Because different operating units ship parts to the depot in various quantities, each part that is inducted for repair may be stored for different amounts of time. For example, the Army inducted helicopter gearboxes into the repair shop 5 times over a 2-year period. The average storage time for the parts inducted in each group ranged from 15 to 366 days. Table 2 shows the quantity of parts inducted and the average amount of days the parts were stored before being inducted.", "According to Army officials, parts sit in storage before induction because of the method that is used to plan repair programs. Item managers periodically review and compare inventory levels and the projected requirements for parts. Based upon this analysis, an item manager determines how many parts should be either repaired or purchased to meet the Army\u2019s anticipated needs. For items that need to be repaired, the Army develops a repair program, which includes a funding estimate for the repairs. The depot can induct parts into the repair process only after this program and its related funding have been approved. Also, parts may sit in storage because an excessive amount of inventory is available to meet current and projected Army requirements. As previously discussed, 15 percent of the Army inventory is classified as long supply, or excess to current requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inefficient Organization of Repair Activities", "paragraphs": ["The Army moves parts from one location to another several times during the repair process, which increases the time required to complete a repair. Functions such as testing, cleaning, and machining are sometimes done at separate shops that are hundreds of yards apart. Routing components through different shops reduces the efficiency of the process because each time a part is moved, it must be prepared for transportation, physically moved, and processed through the shop. For example, at CCAD, the repair of hydraulic components involves routing parts through six different shops, each located 100 to 400 yards from the main repair shop (see fig. 3), which adds time and reduces the efficiency of the process. For one hydraulic part we examined, the Army estimated the repair time of  31 days\u2014only 3 days were estimated for direct labor to repair the item and  28 days (90 percent) were estimated to cover handling and moving the part to different shops, or anticipated repair delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Piece Part Support", "paragraphs": ["Another cause of delays is mechanics often do not have the necessary consumable parts that are used in large quantities to repair aircraft components. According to CCAD officials, the lack of piece parts is the primary cause for repair delays at the depot. The traditional DOD supply system used at CCAD to provide piece parts to mechanics involves several inventory storage locations at the depot and a wholesale inventory system managed by DLA (see fig. 4).", "Maintenance Shop Storage (72 Locations) $23 Million on hand $23 Million on hand DLA inventory is stored at multiple locations nationwide to support all DOD customers.", "This process has created as many as four layers of inventory in the CCAD supply system. As of August 1996, the first two layers (depot bulk storage and the automated distribution warehouse) stored inventory valued at $46 million. For the next two layers (maintenance shop storage and end-user storage), the Army does not centrally track inventory levels or supply effectiveness. Therefore, CCAD officials could not provide us with consolidated information on the amount or value of the inventory stored in these locations or if the inventory was the right type of material or in the appropriate quantity to meet the mechanics\u2019 needs. Figure 5 shows the CCAD automated storage and distribution warehouse where $23 million of inventory is stored. Figure 6 shows 1 of the 72 maintenance shop storage locations and is an example of the size of some of these facilities.", "Despite this investment in inventory, the supply system frequently fails to completely fill orders when they are placed by mechanics or other CCAD customers. According to Army records, the CCAD bulk storage warehouse did not have an adequate supply of inventory to meet customer demands 75 percent of the time during the first 11 months of fiscal year 1996. When parts are not available at the bulk storage facility, the maintenance shops can request (backorder) them from the DLA wholesale system, which may take several days or even months for delivery. As of August 1996, CCAD mechanics had more than $40 million worth of parts on backorder, of which 34 percent was still unfilled after 3 months.", "Depot officials identified several options available to minimize repair delays that are caused by part shortages. For example, depot personnel can buy the part from local vendors or fabricate the part in its machine shops. In other cases, mechanics remove parts from one component that has just entered the repair shop and install the part on one that is nearing completion. This is called a \u201crob-back\u201d of parts. Depot officials did not have any records that specifically quantify the number of rob-back actions in the depot, but they indicated that it was a common practice among maintenance personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of the Army\u2019s Process", "paragraphs": ["The following examples of parts we examined illustrate the effects of the Army\u2019s slow and inefficient logistics pipeline. First, in fiscal year 1995, the Army repaired 25 helicopter rotor heads. The average time to ship these units from field locations and complete the repair of each item was 723 days. Of the 723-day average, 577 days involved shipping and storage time and 146 days involved repair time. The Army\u2019s engineering estimate indicates the optimum repair shop time should be 35 days. At the end of fiscal year 1995, the Army had 134 units on hand, valued at $20.9 million. Using historical demand data, this inventory could satisfy Army requirements for the next 3.5 years.", "Also, in fiscal year 1995, the Army repaired 79 helicopter transmissions. It took the Army an average of 414 days to ship and repair each of these items. This 414-day average was comprised of 67 days for shipping, 229 days for storage, and 118 days for repair. The Army\u2019s engineering estimate indicates 37 days should be needed for repair shop time.

In early 1995, the Army\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics directed the Army logistics community to implement a program called \u201cVelocity Management\u201d to speed up key aspects of the logistics system and reduce the Army\u2019s need for large inventory levels. Under this program, the Army has established Army-wide process improvement teams for the following four areas: (1) ordering and shipping of parts, (2) the repair cycle, (3) inventory levels and locations, and (4) financial management. Also, under this program, the Army is establishing local-level site improvement teams to examine and improve the logistics operations of individual Army units. As of September 1996, however, Velocity Management has had no impact on CCAD operations and has had only limited success in improving overall logistics operations.", "The Army established the Velocity Management program with the goals, concepts, and top-management support that parallel the improvement efforts found in private sector companies. The overall goal of the program is to eliminate unnecessary steps in the logistics pipeline that delay the flow of parts through the system. Like the private sector, the Army plans to achieve these improvements by changing its processes, not by refining the existing system that tends to gain only incremental improvements. The Army also recognizes the importance of top-management support to the ultimate success of these initiatives. The Army\u2019s current leadership has strongly endorsed the program as a vehicle for making dramatic improvements to its current logistics system.", "As of September 1996, CCAD was not actively involved in the Velocity Management program. Instead, depot officials established a program to improve CCAD operations. Under this program, depot officials have focused on changing the management culture, measuring the actual cost of operations, and redesigning some of the local repair processes. The first major initiative pursued by depot officials was to measure the actual cost of completing repairs using an activity-based cost analysis of certain depot processes. Depot officials have also redesigned the repair process for helicopter blades, moving all of the resources needed to complete repairs into one facility, which is intended to reduce the repair cycle time. Unless CCAD\u2019s local program is expanded to include other DOD organizations, such as DLA, substantial reductions in the total pipeline time may not be possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Best Practices Can Be Used to Build on Army Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The airline industry has developed leading-edge practices that focus on reducing the time and complexity of the logistics pipeline. As discussed in our reports on Air Force and Navy reparable parts logistics operations, we identified four best practices in the airline industry that have the potential for use in military systems and have resulted in significant improvements and reduced logistics costs for several airlines, especially British Airways. These practices are the prompt repair of items, the reorganization of the repair process, the establishment of partnerships with key suppliers, and the use of third-party logistics services. When used together, they can help maximize a company\u2019s inventory investment, decrease inventory levels, and provide a more flexible repair capability. In our opinion, they address many of the same problems the Army is facing and represent practices that could be applied to Army operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Repairing Items Promptly", "paragraphs": ["Certain airlines streamlined their repair process by eliminating excess inventories and initiating repair actions as quickly as possible, which prevented the broken items from sitting in storage for extended periods. Minimizing idle time helps reduce inventories because it lessens the need for extra \u201ccushions\u201d of inventory to cover operations while parts are out of service. In addition, repairing items promptly promotes flexible scheduling and production practices, enabling maintenance operations to respond more quickly as repair needs arise.", "Prompt repair involves inducting parts into maintenance shops soon after broken items arrive at repair facilities. In contrast, as discussed earlier in this report, the Army sometimes holds parts for more than a year before they are inducted for repair. Prompt repair does not mean that all parts are fixed, however. The goal is to quickly fix only those parts that are needed. One airline that uses this approach routes broken parts directly to holding areas next to repair shops, rather than to stand-alone warehouses, so that mechanics can quickly access broken parts when it comes time to repair them. These holding areas also give the production managers and the mechanics better visibility of any backlogs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganizing the Repair Process", "paragraphs": ["One approach to simplify the repair process is the \u201ccellular\u201d concept, which brings all the resources, such as tooling and support equipment, personnel, and inventory that are needed to repair a broken part into one location, or one \u201ccell.\u201d This approach simplifies the flow of parts through the process by eliminating the time-consuming exercise of routing parts to workshops in different locations. It also ensures that mechanics have the technical support so that operations run smoothly. In addition, because inventory is placed near the workshops, mechanics have quick access to the parts they need to complete the repairs more quickly. British Airways adopted the cellular approach after determining that parts could be repaired as much as 10 times faster using this concept. Another airline that adopted this approach in its engine blade shop reduced its repair time by as much as 50 percent to 60 percent and decreased work-in-process inventory by 60 percent.", "One airline we visited has also adapted the cellular concept to its aircraft overhaul process.

The use of local distribution centers and integrated supplier programs are two approaches that specifically seek to improve the management and distribution of consumable items. These approaches help ensure that the consumable parts for repair and manufacturing operations are readily available, which prevents items from stalling in the repair process and is crucial in speeding up repair time. In addition, by improving management and distribution methods, such as using streamlined ordering and fast deliveries, firms can delay the purchase of inventory until it is needed. Firms, therefore, can reduce their stocks of \u201cjust-in-case\u201d inventory.", "Local distribution centers are supplier-operated facilities that are established near a customer\u2019s operations and provide deliveries of parts within 24 hours. One airline that used this approach worked with key suppliers to establish more than 30 centers near its major repair operations. These centers receive orders electronically and, in some cases, handle up to eight deliveries per day. Airline officials said that the ability to get parts quickly has contributed to repair time reductions. In addition, the officials said that the centers have helped the airline cut its on hand supply of consumable items nearly in half.", "Integrated supplier programs involve the shifting of inventory management functions to suppliers. Under this arrangement, a supplier monitors parts usage and determines how much inventory is needed to maintain a sufficient supply. The supplier\u2019s services are tailored to the customer\u2019s requirements and can include placing a supplier\u2019s representative in customer facilities to monitor supply bins at end-user locations, place orders, manage receipts, and restock bins. Other services can include 24-hour order-to-delivery times, quality inspections, parts kits, establishment of electronic data interchange links and inventory bar coding, and vendor selection management.

We also participated in roundtables and symposiums with recognized leaders in the logistics field to obtain information on how companies are applying integrated approaches to their logistics operations and establishing supplier partnerships to eliminate unnecessary functions and reduce costs. Finally, to gain a better understanding on how companies are making breakthroughs in logistics operations, we attended and participated in the Council of Logistics Management\u2019s Annual Conferences in San Diego, California, and Orlando, Florida.
