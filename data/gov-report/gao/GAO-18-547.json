Over 890,000 borrowers have passed a first step towards potentially qualifying for PSLF by voluntarily having their employment and loans certified as eligible for PSLF as of April 2018, according to data from Education's PSLF loan servicer. While borrowers first became eligible to apply for loan forgiveness in September 2017, few applicants had met all requirements as of April 2018, with 55 borrowers having received loan forgiveness (see figure). Education has used various outreach methods to inform borrowers about PSLF, but the large number of denied borrowers suggests that many are still confused by the program requirements.

Only loans  provided through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan)  program qualify for forgiveness. The Department of Education  (Education) manages the PSLF program and contracts with a single loan  servicer to handle day-to-day activities associated with the program,  which include responding to borrower inquiries, making preliminary  determinations about whether borrowers\u2019 employment and loans qualify  for PSLF, and processing loan forgiveness applications.", "Although borrowers are now applying for loan forgiveness through the  program, little is known about the processes for assessing borrower  eligibility and whether these processes ensure consistent services to  borrowers and safeguard taxpayer funds.

Specifically, we analyzed data on employment and loan certification  requests from January 2012 through April 2018, and data on loan  forgiveness applications from September 2017 through April 2018.  We also analyzed data on the reasons why borrowers were denied  certification and loan forgiveness. We assessed the reliability of these  data by reviewing data system documentation from the PSLF servicer  and interviewing knowledgeable officials, and we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes. To assess  Education\u2019s outreach to borrowers about eligibility requirements, we  reviewed the program documents and information that Education and  the PSLF servicer provide to borrowers, and interviewed Education  officials. To identify common questions borrowers have about these  requirements, we interviewed officials from the four largest federal  student loan servicers, including officials and frontline staff from the  PSLF servicer. We examined a 2017 Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau report on borrower complaints, including those related to the  PSLF program.

We reviewed the various methods  Education uses to provide guidance and instructions to the PSLF  servicer, including the servicing contract, contract updates, and  emails. We examined the main information sources used by the  servicer to evaluate employer eligibility and reviewed its process for  obtaining prior loan payment information from other loan servicers.  We also reviewed the information that Education and the PSLF  servicer provided to borrowers about qualifying employers and  payments. We interviewed Education officials and the PSLF loan  servicer\u2019s management and frontline staff.

In addition, at the time of our review, there was ongoing state  and federal litigation related to the administration of the PSLF program.  Therefore, we scoped our study to minimize overlap with issues pending  in litigation. For example, we did not assess any individual borrower  eligibility determinations or qualifying loan payment counts made by the  PSLF servicer.

The PSLF  servicer reviews a borrower\u2019s application and incorporates information  from any previously approved certification forms to determine if the  borrower\u2019s employment and loans qualify and if they have made 120  qualifying payments.

This includes over 150,000 borrowers who requested to have  their employment and loans certified despite not having qualifying federal  loans, which suggests these borrowers either did not know which types of  loans they had or which types qualified for the program. Borrowers who  had qualifying loans also may have been confused about requirements  related to making qualifying payments. Over 370,000 borrowers that had  their employment and loans certified as of April 2018 had not made any  qualifying payments at the time of certification because they were not on  qualifying repayment plans, had loans in a deferment or forbearance,  were still in the grace period before starting repayment, or had recently  consolidated their loans, among other reasons, according to PSLF  servicer data (see fig. 6). Although some of these borrowers may have  understood how prior choices they made regarding repayment of their  loans would affect their ability to make qualifying payments, other  borrowers may not have.", "Officials with the PSLF servicer said borrowers were frequently confused  by program requirements related to qualifying loans, employment,  repayment plans, and payments. For example, PSLF servicer officials  said that borrowers were sometimes unaware that they were not on a  qualifying repayment plan or that forbearance, deferment, and loan  consolidation would affect their qualifying payments. PSLF servicer  frontline customer service staff also said they frequently received calls  from borrowers who were confused about whether their loans qualified for  PSLF and other program requirements. Two other loan servicers we  spoke to identified the same general areas of confusion among borrowers  who call with questions about PSLF. In addition, borrower complaints  reported by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau indicate confusion  with PSLF requirements related to qualifying loans and payments.", "Education uses several methods to conduct outreach to inform borrowers  about PSLF requirements, but denial data suggest and PSLF servicer  officials confirmed that borrower confusion persists. Education currently  provides information on its website about PSLF requirements and links to  an online portal where borrowers can check what types of loans they  have and identify their loan servicer. When the PSLF servicer notifies  borrowers that their certification requests or forgiveness applications were  denied, the notification letter includes information on program  requirements and explains why the borrower did not qualify for the  program. Education has also adopted other methods to raise awareness  of the program among borrowers, such as webinars and outreach to  schools, in response to a recommendation in our previous report.  Education also instructs borrowers who have additional questions about  PSLF to contact the PSLF servicer. However, officials with the PSLF  servicer said they can provide more details about the program but cannot  answer certain eligibility questions, such as whether a particular borrower  has qualifying employment or is on a qualifying repayment plan, until the  borrower submits a form to request certification. Officials with three  other loan servicers we spoke with also said it is their general policy not  to answer specific questions about an individual borrower\u2019s eligibility for  PSLF due to the complexity of program requirements, and they instead  direct the borrower to contact the PSLF servicer. Although this approach  may help avoid the risk of other servicers providing borrowers with  incorrect advice, it highlights the need for Education to provide borrowers  with clear and sufficient information about how to qualify for the program.  It is essential for borrowers to understand eligibility requirements because  the retrospective nature of the program requires borrowers to make  decisions about their loans and employment months or years before they  submit a PSLF certification request or apply for loan forgiveness. For  example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that  borrowers have complained of spending years making payments,  believing they were making progress towards PSLF loan forgiveness, and  then learning that they were not eligible.", "Recent legislation requires Education to conduct additional outreach. The  consolidated appropriations act enacted in March 2018 appropriated $350  million to forgive the loans of borrowers who otherwise would qualify for  PSLF had they not selected a non-qualifying repayment plan. In addition  to these funds, the act directed that $2.3 million of Education\u2019s  appropriation for administering student aid be used to conduct outreach to  borrowers about PSLF, to help ensure borrowers are meeting program  requirements. The act specifically requires Education to communicate  PSLF program requirements to all Direct Loan borrowers and improve  PSLF outreach and information through calls, electronic communications,  and other methods.

Instead,  Education\u2019s guidance and instructions to the PSLF servicer are dispersed  in a piecemeal manner across multiple documents, including Education\u2019s  original contract with the servicer, multiple updates to the contract, and  hundreds of emails. According to PSLF servicer officials, administering  the program based on this fragmented collection of guidance and  instructions creates a risk that relevant information may be overlooked.", "Education\u2019s use of email to communicate key guidance and instructions  to the PSLF servicer is particularly problematic because this important  information is not disseminated to relevant individuals at Education and  the PSLF servicer in the same standard fashion as official changes to the  servicing contract. Various individuals at Education have sent emails with  guidance and instructions to different staff at the PSLF servicer. As a  result, all the relevant parties may not be aware of important policy  changes or clarifications provided in these emails, according to PSLF  servicer officials and Education\u2019s monitoring reports. In one instance, for  example, Education staff incorrectly identified what they thought was an  error in how the servicer was certifying borrowers that were employed  part-time because they were not aware of the most recent guidance that  other staff at Education had emailed the servicer on the topic. Similarly,  PSLF servicer officials said their staff are sometimes unaware of relevant  guidance and instructions in emails provided by Education, which creates  a risk that some policy updates will be overlooked and not consistently  implemented. Education has also used email to communicate certain  policy clarifications involving employer eligibility and payment counting  that, according to the PSLF servicer, have affected hundreds of  borrowers and set precedents for future eligibility decisions.", "Gaps in Education\u2019s guidance and instructions have also left the PSLF  servicer uncertain about how to administer key aspects of the program.  For example, PSLF servicer officials said that from 2016 to 2018 they  were awaiting additional clarifications from Education about how to  account for loan payments when borrowers pay more than the amount  due or submit a payment several weeks before the due date. How  overpayments and prepayments are accounted for can affect whether the  borrower\u2019s subsequent payments qualify for PSLF because borrowers  can only receive credit for one payment per month and only when a  payment is due. While Education provided a clarification about how to  address this issue in May 2018, current guidance from Education on other  topics is still unclear or incomplete, according to PSLF servicer officials.", "The absence of a central, authoritative source of PSLF guidance and  instructions creates a risk of differing interpretations and inconsistent  implementation. The PSLF servicer has developed its own internal  processing handbook based on Education\u2019s guidance and instructions,  which PSLF servicer officials said is useful for helping staff process  certifications and forgiveness applications. However, Education has  reviewed sections of this processing handbook and identified places  where the handbook does not accurately reflect PSLF requirements and  could result in borrowers\u2019 certification requests being improperly approved  or denied. The PSLF servicer has made updates to its processing  handbook to address certain issues that Education identified, but  Education has not conducted a comprehensive review of this handbook.  As a result, there is a risk that the PSLF servicer may still be applying  Education\u2019s guidance and instructions differently from how the agency  intended. PSLF servicer officials said it would be helpful if Education  created a centralized manual of PSLF guidance and instructions. The lack  of a central guidance document also makes it difficult to maintain program  continuity in the event of staff turnover or if Education decides to contract  with a new servicer to administer the PSLF program. Federal internal  control standards state that agencies should communicate information to  those who need it, in a form that enables them to carry out their  responsibilities. Education has recently taken some steps to provide  clearer guidance and instructions, such as holding meetings with PSLF  servicer officials every 2 weeks to discuss any administrative issues.  Education officials also told us they plan to develop a comprehensive  PSLF servicing manual, but they do not have a timeline for completing it.  They are currently drafting an initial section of the manual focusing on  payment counting. The current lack of a definitive and comprehensive  source of guidance and instructions for the PSLF servicer creates the risk  of inconsistent interpretations that could potentially result in borrowers  being improperly denied loan forgiveness since Education does not  currently review loan forgiveness applications that are denied by the  PSLF servicer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Information from Education Could Improve the PSLF Servicer\u2019s and Borrowers\u2019 Ability to Determine Whether Borrowers\u2019 Employment Qualifies for Loan Forgiveness", "paragraphs": ["Education has provided the PSLF servicer and borrowers with limited  information that could help them determine which employers qualify for  PSLF, creating uncertainty for borrowers and increasing the risk that the  PSLF servicer may improperly certify or deny certification to some  borrowers. Education has not provided the PSLF servicer with a definitive  source of information for determining which employers qualify a borrower  for loan forgiveness. Instead, Education has identified some data sources  the PSLF servicer can use to determine whether borrowers are working  for qualifying employers. However, these sources are not comprehensive,  and PSLF servicer officials said they sometimes have to consult other  sources that have significant limitations. For example, Education directs  the PSLF servicer to review the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s public list of  501(c)(3) organizations to identify qualifying nonprofit employers. Since  this list does not capture all potentially qualifying nonprofits, the PSLF  servicer supplements this with other sources that have not been fully  reviewed or assessed for accuracy by Education. For example, PSLF  servicer officials told us they use an online directory of nursing home  facilities to help determine if certain nursing homes are nonprofit  employers. However, this website explicitly states that it does not  guarantee that the information it provides is accurate or current. PSLF  servicer officials also said they sometimes use state government websites  to research organizations\u2019 nonprofit status, but they only have access to  the relevant information from states that provide it for free. For assessing  government employers, Education directs the servicer to www.usa.gov,  an official federal government website that describes government  agencies and services, but this source provides limited information on  state and local government employers. In addition, PSLF servicer officials  said it is particularly difficult to assess certain types of employers, such as  quasi-governmental entities and charter schools. PSLF servicer officials  said that when they are uncertain whether an employer qualifies, they  elevate the assessment to Education, but they generally try to resolve as  many employer determinations as possible by using supplemental  sources to research employers. However, the reliability of some of these  supplemental sources is unclear.", "PSLF servicer officials said that having additional information would help  them assess employers more quickly and minimize the risk of inaccurate  decisions. One way to provide this information would be for Education to  develop an official, comprehensive list of qualifying employers, which  would help the PSLF servicer assess employers and help borrowers  determine whether they are eligible for PSLF, according to PSLF servicer  officials. Education officials said they are considering creating their own  list of qualifying employers and are investigating how to leverage  information from other federal government agencies that could be useful  for categorizing employers. In particular, Education officials said they  have reached out to the Internal Revenue Service to explore the  feasibility of obtaining relevant data on employers. Education could also  expand and improve on a database that the PSLF servicer created based  on its prior assessments of employers. Education staff that conducted a  spot check on the PSLF servicer\u2019s database expressed concerns about  using it as a sole source for assessing employers, according to an  Education monitoring report, but Education officials said it could provide a  foundation for Education to build on.", "Borrowers would also benefit from additional information about qualifying  employers, according to PSLF servicer officials. Education currently  provides borrowers with basic information on the types of employers that  qualify for PSLF, but not sufficient details to reliably determine whether  specific employers qualify. When borrowers contact their loan servicer  with questions about their employer\u2019s eligibility, officials with the PSLF  servicer and other loan servicers we spoke with said they generally do not  provide borrowers with information about whether a specific employer  qualifies, due to the complexities involved in assessing qualifying  employers. Instead, borrowers are encouraged to submit an employment  certification form once they are working for an employer in order to find  out if the employer qualifies. PSLF servicer officials said that providing  borrowers with access to additional information about qualifying  employers, such as an official list, would reduce uncertainty for borrowers  and reduce the number of borrowers who submit certification requests  and forgiveness applications despite working for non-qualifying  employers. In addition, making this information readily available to  borrowers could help them to make better informed employment  decisions rather than having to wait to submit a certification request after  they have started a job to find out if their employer qualifies.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should  communicate the necessary quality information to those who need it in  order to achieve the agencies\u2019 objectives. Unless Education provides  additional information to help the PSLF servicer make employer  assessments, it will remain difficult to determine whether employers  qualify for the program, raising the risk that borrowers\u2019 certification  requests will be improperly approved or denied. Moreover, without access  to sufficient information about qualifying employers, borrowers will not be  able to reliably determine whether certain employers qualify for PSLF.  This creates uncertainty for borrowers as to which jobs and careers to  pursue and leaves them to make important employment decisions without  knowing until after the fact how these decisions affect their future  eligibility for PSLF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Could Improve the Information Provided to the PSLF Servicer and Borrowers about Whether Borrowers\u2019 Payments Qualify for Loan Forgiveness", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Collecting Consistent Payment Information", "paragraphs": ["Education does not ensure the PSLF servicer receives consistent  information on borrowers\u2019 prior loan payments from other loan servicers,  which could raise the risk of qualifying payments being miscounted. In  order to process certification requests and loan forgiveness applications,  the PSLF servicer has to examine the borrower\u2019s prior loan payment  information to determine which prior payments count towards the 120  needed to qualify for loan forgiveness. This is relatively easy in cases  where the PSLF servicer was servicing the borrower\u2019s loans during the  entire period he or she was pursuing PSLF because the servicer already  has the necessary information on their prior payments, according to PSLF  servicer officials. However, the PSLF servicer does not have the same  information readily available for loans that are serviced by one of  Education\u2019s eight other loan servicers. For these loans, Education  established a process for servicers to use in transferring loan and prior  payment information to the PSLF servicer. The servicers transfer most  information through standardized templates that Education developed.  However, despite the use of standardized templates, the PSLF servicer  does not receive consistent and reliable information from other servicers,  according to PSLF servicer officials. For example, PSLF servicer officials  said the lack of standard definitions and terminology among loan  servicers leads servicers to interpret some data fields differently, resulting  in inconsistencies in the data other loan servicers report to the PSLF  servicer. Comparable data and standardized terminology is particularly  important given the need for loan servicers with different systems and  practices to communicate key payment information with one another.  PSLF servicer officials said inconsistencies in the information provided by  other loan servicers make it challenging to determine whether borrowers  are on qualifying repayment plans or making qualifying payments. For  example, when a borrower has multiple loans, PSLF servicer officials said  they assess PSLF eligibility and payments separately for each individual  loan. Officials added that some servicers only report total monthly  payments for the borrower\u2019s combined loans, and not how these  payments were allocated among each loan. This makes it difficult for the  PSLF servicer to determine whether the borrower paid the full monthly  payment amount due on each loan, which it needs to know in order to  determine whether the payment qualifies for PSLF.", "Officials with Education and the PSLF servicer said that inconsistencies in  the information obtained from other loan servicers increase the risk of  miscounting qualifying payments.

Borrowers whose loans were  transferred to the PSLF servicer from other loan servicers have  complained about inaccurate qualifying payment counts, according to a  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report. Officials with the PSLF  servicer said they rely on borrowers to catch any payment counting errors  resulting from issues with information provided by other loan servicers.  However, the PSLF servicer provides borrowers with aggregate counts of  qualifying payments, which are useful for helping borrowers track their  progress, but do not provide borrowers with enough detail to check the  servicer\u2019s counts and identify prior payments that the servicer may have  missed (see fig. 7). Borrowers have several options for disputing payment  counts or other aspects of the eligibility determination process, including  contacting the PSLF servicer or filing an official complaint with  Education\u2019s Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group or through the  Federal Student Aid Feedback System. However, the lack of detailed  information on qualifying payment counts makes it difficult for borrowers  to determine whether the count is correct or not.", "Education officials said they have not considered requiring the PSLF  servicer to provide more detailed information to borrowers on which prior  payments were approved or denied. Officials noted that there would be a  cost associated with providing this information to borrowers, although  they have not produced a cost estimate. Also, officials said that providing  too much information may confuse borrowers, and they must consider  how to meet borrowers\u2019 need for detailed information without  overwhelming borrowers with payment counting complexities. Officials  with the PSLF servicer said providing this information to borrowers could  be helpful but would require time to confirm the information was correct  and would only be done at the direction of Education. Federal internal  control standards state that agencies should communicate necessary  quality information to external parties. While providing too much  information could prove counterproductive, borrowers could benefit from  receiving greater detail about their qualifying payments beyond the  aggregate counts of qualifying payments that they currently receive.  Without clearer and more detailed information on qualifying payments,  borrowers may not detect any errors in payment counts, which could  ultimately affect borrowers\u2019 eligibility for loan forgiveness."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Education is responsible for establishing the administrative structure  necessary to fulfill the PSLF program\u2019s goal of encouraging individuals to  enter and continue in public service employment by providing loan  forgiveness to eligible borrowers who meet program requirements.  However, Education has not provided the PSLF servicer with a  comprehensive source of guidance and instructions on how to operate  the program, raising the risk that the PSLF servicer may improperly  approve or deny borrowers\u2019 certification requests and forgiveness  applications. Education officials told us they have plans for creating a  comprehensive PSLF servicing manual, but no timeline for doing so.", "Working for a qualifying employer is one of the key requirements of the  PSLF program; however, Education has not provided the PSLF servicer  and borrowers with sufficient information for determining whether  employers qualify. This makes the PSLF servicer\u2019s employer  assessments vulnerable to inconsistencies and fosters uncertainty for  borrowers as to whether or not their employment will eventually qualify  them for loan forgiveness.", "Similarly, inconsistencies in the information used for counting borrowers\u2019  qualifying loan payments raise the risk of errors. Borrowers should be  confident that their loan payments will be accurately counted regardless  of who their servicer is. However, Education has not ensured the PSLF  servicer is receiving consistent loan payment history information from  other loan servicers, increasing the risk of inaccurate qualifying payment  counts. The chance that these and any other payment counting errors will  go undetected is compounded by the fact that Education does not require  the PSLF servicer to provide borrowers with details on which payments  qualified and which did not. This makes it difficult for borrowers to detect  erroneous counts that could ultimately affect their eligibility for loan  forgiveness. Consequently, some borrowers may be required to make  more payments than necessary before receiving loan forgiveness, while  others may be improperly approved for forgiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to Education\u2019s Office  of Federal Student Aid:  The Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid should  develop a timeline for issuing a comprehensive guidance and instructions  document for PSLF servicing.

(Recommendation 1)", "The Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid should  provide additional information to the PSLF servicer and borrowers to  enhance their ability to determine which employers qualify for PSLF. This  could involve Education developing an authoritative list of qualifying  employers or improving the PSLF servicer\u2019s existing database, and  making this information available to borrowers. (Recommendation 2)", "The Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid should  standardize the information the PSLF servicer receives from other loan  servicers to ensure the PSLF servicer obtains more consistent and  accurate payment information for borrowers pursuing PSLF.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid should  ensure that borrowers receive sufficiently detailed information from the  PSLF servicer to be able to identify any errors in the servicer\u2019s counts of  qualifying payments, including information on whether or not each  payment qualified toward forgiveness.

Regarding our recommendation to provide additional information  on qualifying employers to the PSLF servicer and borrowers, Education  stated that it is reviewing options for developing an online help tool that  would be expanded to incorporate qualifying employer information. To  standardize the information other loan servicers provide to the PSLF  servicer, Education stated it will continue its efforts to address data  definition issues related to the data exchanged between servicers. To  ensure borrowers receive sufficiently detailed information on counts of  qualifying payments, Education stated it will review the letters the PSLF  servicer sends to borrowers to determine how to better communicate  regarding qualifying payment counts, program requirements, and  employer eligibility.
