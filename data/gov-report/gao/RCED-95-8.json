Under the current program, inspection rates at the FWS ports of entry vary considerably; a majority of wildlife shipments receive no physical inspection. As a result, many illegal imports or exports of wildlife may evade detection.", "Despite recent increases in funding for the wildlife inspection program, FWS officials report that many ports are without adequate wildlife inspection coverage, and inspectors at some locations cite a need for safety equipment and other resources, such as a better information system, reference books, and computer and related equipment, to more effectively perform their jobs. Wildlife inspectors are often kept from conducting physical inspections of wildlife shipments because administrative tasks limit the time they have available to conduct inspections. In addition, LEMIS does not provide accurate, timely information about the inspection program that would aid wildlife inspectors in carrying out their responsibilities and enable FWS officials to make informed decisions about any staffing or other changes needed at specific ports of entry.", "Furthermore, a lack of prosecutions, coupled with a lack of significant penalties and fines imposed for violations that are detected by the wildlife inspection program, do little to encourage compliance with wildlife trade laws and treaties.

However, most wildlife shipments are not physically inspected, and it is likely that many illegal wildlife shipments are evading detection.", "Although the full extent of the illegal trade in wildlife imports and exports is not known, such trade appears to be extensive as judged by various studies and other assessments. For example, in 1992, TRAFFIC USAestimated that global wildlife trade (excluding timber and fisheries products) was valued at a minimum of $5 billion to $8 billion per year and that as much as $2 billion of this trade may have been illegal. FWS law enforcement officials we contacted during our review pointed out that it is impossible to determine the extent of illegal wildlife trade that is occurring. However, they provided a rough estimate that FWS is detecting less than 10 percent of the violations associated with declared shipments (those presented to FWS for clearance) and that the percentage is much lower for undeclared shipments.", "Many FWS wildlife inspectors share these views. For example, 44 (about 70 percent) of the 63 inspectors who responded to our questionnaire believed that an illegal shipment would be able to escape detection over 50 percent of the time. The inspectors identified several means, including containerized shipments, passenger traffic at airports, and international mail, by which illegal shipments of wildlife and wildlife parts and products can be concealed and go undetected because of inadequate inspection coverage.", "Law enforcement officials from the seven FWS regional offices responsible for managing the wildlife inspection program agreed that FWS is detecting very little illegal wildlife trade. For example, one FWS supervisory special agent estimated that wildlife inspectors are detecting only about 1 to 3 percent of the illegal wildlife shipments carried by passengers and 1 to 10 percent of illegally imported or exported wildlife in declared cargo shipments. Undeclared illegal shipments of wildlife have an even higher probability of going undetected, according to FWS officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Wildlife Shipments Are Not Physically Inspected", "paragraphs": ["Most wildlife shipments are not physically inspected, which is a problem that has been recognized by FWS and others for years. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Law Enforcement Briefing Materials, 1991 Edition stated that FWS is able to inspect only a minute percentage of the containerized shipments that enter this country annually. In February 1992, the Director, TRAFFIC USA, testified before a congressional subcommittee that fewer than 5 percent of all wildlife shipments are physically inspected, leaving most wildlife imports and exports completely unchecked. Our analysis indicates that the percentage of wildlife shipments that FWS inspected during the 5-fiscal-year period from 1989 through 1993 averaged about 23 percent.", "As a monitoring and enforcement tool, physical inspections are important. Their purpose is to determine if the species and quantity of wildlife contained in a shipment are the same as those specified on its declaration documents. The wildlife inspectors base their decisions on how many shipments, and how much of any given shipment, to inspect on a variety of factors that include the amount of time they have available; number of shipments awaiting inspection; contents of the shipments\u2014for example, live wildlife; violation histories relative to different types of shipments; violation histories of importers-exporters; and countries from or to which shipments are being made.", "Before fiscal year 1994, FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program had no established inspection goals. However, during the course of our review, the Division of Law Enforcement set what it considered to be attainable inspection goals for the program. These goals require that beginning in fiscal year 1994, FWS should physically inspect at least 25 percent of all shipments presented for import or export at the 11 designated ports of entry, and at least 50 percent of all shipments at nondesignated ports of entry where it has assigned wildlife inspectors. The difference in the goals for the two types of ports is primarily the result of the higher volume of shipments at designated versus nondesignated ports. According to the Deputy Chief of the Division of Law Enforcement, these goals are based on an average of the percentage of shipments that have been inspected nationwide over the past several years.", "Against this backdrop, figure 2.1 shows the total numbers of wildlife shipments processed and physically inspected by FWS over the 5-fiscal-year period from 1989 through 1993, along with the percentage of shipments inspected. The information shown in figure 2.1 and the other figures presented in this section are based on import-export data from LEMIS. As pointed out in chapter 1, the information in LEMIS on wildlife inspection activities is, according to FWS officials, often not accurate or timely and, therefore, more than likely understates the total number of imports and exports processed and physically inspected by FWS wildlife inspectors.", "The number of shipments processed during the 5-year period averaged about 77,000, with a range of 86,909 in fiscal year 1989 to 71,661 in fiscal year 1993. The number of shipments processed during the past 3 fiscal years has been fairly consistent, hovering close to 72,000. The overall rate of conducting physical inspections of shipments ranged from almost 20 percent in fiscal year 1991 to about 27 percent in fiscal year 1993. For the 5-year period, the inspection rate was about 23 percent. Reports on FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection activities disclose, however, that the number of shipments that were physically inspected at each designated and nondesignated port of entry during the period varied considerably.", "Figure 2.2 shows the percentage of shipments that were physically inspected over the 5-fiscal-year period at each of the 11 ports of entry designated by FWS.", "The figure shows, for example, that 7 percent of the shipments processed in Miami, Florida, were inspected, in contrast to a 52-percent inspection rate in Honolulu, Hawaii. As the figure shows, the ports with the higher inspection rates are generally those that process the least number of shipments, and the ports with the lower inspection rates are generally those that process the most. Overall, the inspection rate for the 11 designated ports of entry was about 18 percent.", "Figure 2.3 shows the percentage of shipments that were physically inspected during the 5-fiscal-year period at 13 of the nondesignated ports of entry where FWS wildlife inspectors were assigned during the period.", "The rates of inspections at nondesignated ports vary even more over the same 5-fiscal-year period than did the rates at designated ports. For example, almost 10 percent of the shipments processed in Tampa, Florida, were physically inspected, while just over 80 percent of the shipments processed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, were inspected. As was the case with the designated ports, figure 2.3 shows that the nondesignated ports with the higher inspection rates are generally those with the least number of shipments\u2014the nondesignated ports with the lower inspection rates are generally the ones that are the busiest. Overall, the inspection rate for the 13 nondesignated ports with assigned inspectors approached 40 percent.", "Not only do the number of shipments processed and the percentage of shipments inspected vary from port to port, the number of inspections performed per wildlife inspector varies as well. For example, the 5-fiscal-year average of the number of inspections performed per inspector at designated ports ranged from a low of 76 in Miami, Florida, to a high of 616 in Honolulu, Hawaii. For nondesignated ports, the average number of inspections performed per inspector per year ranged from a low of 30 in Denver, Colorado, to a high of 778 in El Paso, Texas.", "During the 5-fiscal-year period we examined, the inspection rates at over half of both the designated and nondesignated ports exceeded the recently established inspection rate goals. The variances in the inspection rates, the number of inspections performed per inspector, and the fact that some ports that processed fewer shipments exceeded the goals by significant margins suggest the possibility of an uneven allocation of resources within the program. When asked why such variances exist, the Deputy Chief of the Division of Law Enforcement could not identify the specific reasons for the variances, but he did tell us that it is sometimes simply a matter of the various ports giving inspections differing emphasis and priority. Furthermore, FWS regional officials told us that in addition to the inspection rates, they consider other factors in determining a port\u2019s performance, such as the number and type of shipments processed, the extensiveness of the inspections that are performed, the number of seizures, and the effectiveness of relationships established with other inspection agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Resources Identified as Adversely Affecting FWS\u2019 Inspection Efforts", "paragraphs": ["According to a number of sources, FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program is adversely affected by the limited number of inspectors and other resources that FWS is able to devote to the program. The problem stems from the fact that the wildlife inspection staff of 74 cannot adequately process and inspect the tens of thousands of wildlife shipments that flow through the ports annually. This situation has been discussed in a number of reports over the past several years. Reports issued by the FWS Law Enforcement Advisory Commission and the FWS Law Enforcement Functional Analysis Team in 1990 and 1991, respectively, each identified shortfalls in the staffing and funding devoted to the FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program as adversely affecting the agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its overall inspection mission. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, in reports on FWS\u2019 law enforcement efforts in 1988 and again in 1993, also identified inadequate program staffing as a problem. In addition, the Director, TRAFFIC USA, testified in February 1992 that the existing number of special agents and wildlife inspectors was wholly insufficient to effectively enforce U.S. wildlife laws and CITES requirements.", "As stated in chapter 1, user fees collected by FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program have remained relatively stable during fiscal years 1989 through 1993. Appropriations, on the other hand, have increased more than 235 percent during this period\u2014rising in 1993 constant dollars from $.84 million to $2.81 million. A large portion of the increases in appropriations, however, was used to establish ports in Portland, Oregon, and Baltimore, Maryland; to reestablish a full-time inspector position in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and to increase the inspection force at the port of Los Angeles, California. FWS officials told us that the funding increase that was left did not keep pace with increases in the program\u2019s salary and operating costs and that the inspection program continues to need additional staffing, funding, and other resources to be more effective."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Few Inspectors Added Despite Identified Staffing Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["Although reports such as the ones just discussed have pointed out shortfalls in the staffing levels of the FWS inspection force over the past several years, the number of FWS inspectors has remained relatively constant. For example, in 1991 the Law Enforcement Functional Analysis Team identified a need for 30 additional inspectors and recommended a total inspection force of 100. However, despite increased funding for the program, only eight inspectors have been added to the wildlife inspection staff since 1989\u2014increasing the number of inspectors from 66 in fiscal year 1989 to 74 in fiscal year 1993. Law enforcement officials we contacted at each of the seven FWS regions estimated that they collectively needed 43 additional inspectors to staff the ports of entry, resulting in a total inspection force of 117. Table 2.1 shows where FWS inspectors are currently located and identifies where regional officials believe they need additional inspectors. The ports of entry identified by the regional officials are generally ports (1) that FWS expects to show an increase in wildlife trade, (2) that have not met the recently established inspection goals, (3) that do not meet an FWS\u2019 staffing criterion that calls for three inspectors per designated port, or (4) that currently have no assigned wildlife inspector.", "As pointed out in the various reports cited, the shortfalls in staffing affect FWS\u2019 ability to conduct wildlife shipment inspections. This effect is illustrated in at least one instance when FWS increased its inspection staff at the Los Angeles, California, port of entry from 5 in fiscal year 1990 to 12 in fiscal year 1993. As a result of this increase, the number and percentage of inspections occurring at the Los Angeles port more than tripled during this period\u2014increasing from 1,528, or almost 11 percent of the shipments processed in fiscal year 1990, to 4,974, or about 34 percent of the shipments processed in fiscal year 1993.", "FWS\u2019 limited inspection workforce and budgetary restrictions on overtime mean that FWS ports of entry are frequently without wildlife inspection coverage. For example, FWS inspectors at the New York City, New York/Newark, New Jersey, port of entry, through which 29 percent of the nation\u2019s known wildlife shipments pass, do not work late evenings, nights, or on weekends, unless a commercial broker reimburses FWS for the inspectors\u2019 time. In addition, because of the limited number of staff, the majority of the nondesignated FWS ports do not have wildlife inspectors assigned. Eight of the ports identified by FWS regional officials as needing staff are nondesignated ports that currently have no inspectors. Even those nondesignated ports that do have assigned inspectors have very limited staff\u2014usually one inspector\u2014which leaves these ports with no wildlife inspection coverage when the inspectors are on leave, in training, or otherwise not on the job. When FWS inspectors are not present, FWS must rely on staff from Customs or another federal agency to clear any wildlife shipments received. Although FWS does receive such assistance, staff in these agencies have their own responsibilities and may often lack the expertise and/or inclination to vigorously pursue wildlife trade violations.", "Almost half of the wildlife inspectors responding to our questionnaire believe that without an FWS presence, illegal wildlife shipments are more likely to go undetected. Officials from the Customs Service and other federal agencies acknowledge that an FWS presence influences the degree to which they scrutinize, detain, and report suspicious wildlife shipments. This influence is illustrated by FWS\u2019 experience at the San Diego, California, port of entry. Even though they cannot document the actual numbers of violations reported to them by other federal agencies before an FWS inspector was assigned to the San Diego port in 1986, FWS regional officials responsible for the port estimated the number to have been about 30 per year. Since assigning an FWS inspector to that port, the number of violations reported by FWS, including those detected by other federal agencies, has jumped to more than 300 per year, or tenfold.", "In fiscal year 1994, FWS\u2014as a part of the federal government\u2019s downsizing efforts\u2014reduced by 21 the number of full-time-equivalent positions allocated to the Division of Law Enforcement. The Deputy Chief of the Division told us during our field work that because staffing decisions have generally been delegated to the FWS regional offices, he did not know the effect, if any, this reduction might have on the size of the wildlife inspection force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Resource Needs Identified", "paragraphs": ["FWS has not, in all cases, provided its inspection staff with the basic equipment and other resources needed to effectively perform their jobs. In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, FWS funded the inspection program at a rate of $55,000 per inspector, an amount that was to pay each inspector\u2019s salary and operating costs. According to figures provided to us by FWS regional officials, however, salary and benefit costs consume most of the funding provided and leave little to pay for such things as safety equipment (used when inspecting shipments of live wildlife), reference books, computers and related equipment, travel and transportation, office space, and uniforms. One port of entry reported to us that it is provided only $2,000 annually per inspector by its region to pay for such things as those listed above, and it estimated that double that amount was needed. Of the 63 inspectors responding to our questionnaire, 41 (65 percent) said that they did not have adequate resources with which to effectively do their work, and they identified safety equipment, reference books, administrative staff, and an improved management information system as the resources they most needed.", "Because of the way that some regions account for their costs, the Division of Law Enforcement has been unable to determine the level of funding needed by the wildlife inspection program.

Safety equipment is particularly needed when inspectors are to inspect live wildlife, which receive the highest priority for physical inspections. Live wildlife are sometimes carriers of transmittable diseases and/or capable of physically harming inspectors. Therefore, inspectors are instructed to handle live wildlife with care by avoiding direct physical contact, when possible, and by using safety equipment, such as breathing filters, eye protection, and gloves, when the handling of live wildlife is necessary. However, 22 (35 percent) of the 63 inspectors who responded to our questionnaire identified safety equipment as one of the resources they need, but do not have, to effectively perform their jobs. Wildlife inspectors we spoke with told us that such equipment is often not available for them to use and that they therefore often allow live wildlife shipments to pass through ill-equipped ports of entry without inspections by FWS. For example, according to the Assistant Regional Director for Law Enforcement in FWS Region 4, wildlife inspectors at the port of Miami, Florida, did not perform physical inspections of nonhuman primates\u2014animals known to carry pathogens such as ebola and tuberculosis, which are dangerous to humans\u2014because the safety equipment necessary to inspect the animals was not available.

We were told that because of the inspectors\u2019 workload, the entry of wildlife shipment and inspection data into LEMIS is often not timely or accurate, leading most likely to an understatement of the data that are in the system.

They attributed the situation primarily to higher priorities and staffing constraints within the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and the Department of Justice\u2019s U.S. Attorney Offices, who are responsible for prosecuting wildlife trade violations. As a result, many violations detected by the program have resulted only in the abandonment or forfeiture of the wildlife and wildlife parts and products that were being illegally shipped.

For minor violations, FWS may offer the importer or exporter the opportunity to voluntarily abandon the illegal wildlife that was being shipped.

However, we were able to obtain information relative to Endangered Species Act violations, which we were told make up a large percentage of the total violations detected by the inspection program. Our analysis of this information shows that of 1,760 individuals and companies charged with 2,896 endangered species violations that regional solicitors or the courts handled during fiscal years 1989 through 1993, only about 25 percent of the violators received penalties and/or fines for their infractions and a much lesser percentage received probation or jail. Over half of the violators simply had to forfeit the illegal wildlife they were attempting to ship into or out of the United States, while still another 20 percent had their cases dismissed by regional solicitors or the courts.", "Even repeat violators of the Endangered Species Act seldom received substantial fines or penalties or had other measures levied against them. For example, from fiscal year 1989 through 1993, FWS caught one importer 14 times attempting to illegally ship wildlife. However, the importer received no penalties or fines for the infractions; all the cases either resulted in the forfeiture of the illegal wildlife or were dismissed by the solicitor.

Although not all violations warrant such action, only one region could identify for us instances in which it had revoked or suspended import-export licenses as a result of violations. FWS officials pointed out that even if they revoke or suspend a license, oftentimes the violator will arrange to use the license of another company or individual, or will operate without one. One situation we became aware of in Florida involved a commercial importer who was convicted of illegally transporting a protected, endangered nonhuman primate. During our review, we were told that the individual was still involved in importation activities, operating under a license in his wife\u2019s name. When we asked FWS law enforcement officials why this was allowed, they said that they were gathering the additional evidence needed to show that the individual was improperly involved in importation activities using this license. In mid-1994, FWS refused to renew the license on the basis of the additional evidence it had gathered.", "FWS officials told us that the degree to which solicitors and U.S. attorneys consider and prosecute the wildlife trade cases referred to them varies. Regional solicitors we contacted attributed the lack of penalties assessed for wildlife trade violations to a variety of reasons, including (1) the longer amount of time required to process a civil penalty versus a forfeiture only, (2) a lack of staff, (3) a lack of strong evidence, (4) higher priorities, or (5) the uncollectibility of any penalties that would be assessed.

Several of these officials noted that it is well known within the commercial trade sector that the inspection of various commodity shipments is more stringent at some ports of entry than at others. According to FWS officials, this knowledge prompts some shippers to engage in the practice of \u201cport shopping,\u201d whereby they route their shipments through those ports that have a reputation for allowing certain commodities to flow through them more freely. This practice is a particularly useful tool for shippers who have been detected violating wildlife laws and treaties. Because these shippers fear scrutiny at those ports where they have been identified as violators, they route their shipments elsewhere in the hope that less familiar FWS inspectors will allow their shipments to more easily pass through. FWS currently has no formal or efficient means to check for such occurrences. Although FWS had planned at one time to upgrade its management information system, thus enabling its inspection force to more clearly and readily identify the licenses of shippers with previous violations or restrictions, it has not yet done so.

Under a scenario in which all the FWS inspectors would be moved to and absorbed into Customs without any emphasis on wildlife protection, only 2 respondents (3 percent) strongly or somewhat agreed that wildlife protection would be enhanced, 55 (87 percent) somewhat or strongly disagreed, 4 (6 percent) neither agreed nor disagreed, and 2 (3 percent) indicated that they had no basis to judge such a question. The results of the questionnaire indicated that a transfer of the inspection function would negatively affect the FWS inspectors\u2019 morale. Also, the majority of the inspectors believed that their education and work experience is valued more at FWS than it would be at Customs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program was established almost 20 years ago to accomplish the dual mission of monitoring trade in wildlife and intercepting illegal imports and exports of wildlife. On the basis of our review, we believe that FWS has had difficulty in accomplishing either aspect of this mission.", "Under the current program, the number of shipments processed and the rate of inspections performed at FWS ports of entry vary considerably, and most wildlife shipments receive no physical inspection. As a result, many undetected illegal shipments of wildlife are thought to be occurring. Although it is impossible to precisely determine how much illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife parts and products is occurring or FWS\u2019 impact on it, estimates are that FWS is detecting less than 10 percent of the violations associated with declared wildlife shipments (those presented to it for clearance) and a much lower percentage of the violations associated with undeclared shipments. The approval of NAFTA within the past year is likely to increase the volume of cross-border traffic among the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus decreasing even further the chance of violations being detected. Moreover, many violations currently detected by the program result only in the abandonment or forfeiture of the wildlife or wildlife parts or products being illegally shipped, which does little to encourage compliance with wildlife trade laws and treaties.", "Despite recent increases in the wildlife inspection program\u2019s appropriations, FWS and others largely attribute the program\u2019s limited ability to accomplish its inspection mission to a need to hire more inspectors, as well as more administrative and support personnel, and to provide the inspectors with more resources, such as a better information system, safety equipment, reference books, computer and related equipment, travel and transportation, office space, and uniforms. However, given current budgetary constraints and downsizing efforts within the federal government, increased funding for the wildlife inspection program at any level of significance, in all likelihood, will not occur. Although recently proposed revisions in FWS\u2019 user fees would provide additional funding for the program, current FWS staffing ceilings would prevent any of this increased funding from being used to increase the size of the inspection force. Furthermore, program data that reflect significant variances in inspection rates at the ports of entry and in the number of inspections performed by individual inspectors raise questions about the allocation of resources within the program.", "Before fiscal year 1994, FWS had not established any goals for its wildlife inspection program. The ones that were established in fiscal year 1994, while perhaps representing a start, do little to measure program performance or define what an effective inspection program should look like. Rather than establishing goals that are outcome-oriented and performance-related, FWS established inspection goals that it believed it could attain\u2014physically inspecting at least 25 percent of all shipments presented for import or export at its 11 designated ports of entry and at least 50 percent of all such shipments at nondesignated ports of entry where it has assigned wildlife inspectors. These goals, however, do not take into account such things as the (1) types of shipments that are being processed, (2) extensiveness of the inspections performed, and (3) number of illegal shipments that are intercepted. Moreover, it must also be recognized that, in its efforts to achieve its inspection mission, FWS relies on the cooperation of other federal agencies, including Customs and APHIS, which assist in the detection of illegal wildlife shipments, and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and the Department of Justice, which handle the prosecution of the cases resulting from violations detected by the wildlife inspection program. As such, the achievement of any of FWS\u2019 goals hinge, in part, on the degree of cooperation that FWS receives from these other agencies. Furthermore, any determinations as to whether the goals established are being achieved will have to be made using LEMIS data that are known to be inaccurate and incomplete\u2014shortcomings that FWS recognizes and has plans to address. Without outcome-oriented, performance-related goals and an accurate management information system to report progress toward achieving them, FWS management and the Congress are hindered in making informed decisions about how well the inspection program is accomplishing its mission and about the level of staff and other resources needed by the program.", "We believe that it may take some time for FWS to develop outcome-oriented, performance-related goals and an accurate information system with which it can measure progress toward achieving such goals. In the meantime, variances that currently exist in such things as the number of shipments processed, number of inspectors assigned to the specific designated and nondesignated ports of entry, number of shipments inspected, and number of inspections performed per inspector at the various ports of entry suggest that FWS is not making the most efficient and effective use of its limited resources. A comprehensive examination by FWS of the size of the inspection staff and the level of accompanying resources that should be devoted to each port would help the agency to more clearly define an effective wildlife inspection program.", "FWS\u2019 difficulties in accomplishing its inspection mission have caused some to suggest that other alternatives be explored, such as transferring the program to Customs, an agency with a larger, more widely dispersed inspection force. Those whom we contacted to obtain their views on this suggestion identified both advantages and disadvantages to such a move. For example, although the primary advantage of such a transfer is Customs\u2019 larger inspection force, many of those we spoke with believed that because of Customs\u2019 already heavy workload, a transfer could, in fact, diminish the attention now afforded wildlife shipments. If such a transfer is ever formally proposed, each of the advantages and disadvantages of moving the wildlife inspection program would have to be carefully considered by policymakers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the wildlife inspection program is better able to accomplish its mission and that its current resources are more efficiently and effectively used, we recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Director of FWS to:", "Develop outcome-oriented, performance-related goals that are indicative of an effective inspection program and take into account not only the number of shipments processed and inspected, but also such things as the extensiveness of the inspections performed and the results of those inspections.", "Give priority to the completion of FWS\u2019 current plans to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the information contained in LEMIS, including the information relating to (1) the levels and trends in wildlife trade; (2) port of entry inspection rates and inspector productivity; (3) results of inspections, including fines and penalties assessed; and (4) repeat wildlife trade violators.", "Conduct a comprehensive examination of the operations of each of the designated and the nondesignated ports of entry and the size and level of accompanying resources currently allocated to each of these ports, looking for ways in which the allocation of resources might be adjusted to respond to current needs at the specific ports and to improve the program\u2019s overall efficiency and effectiveness. Identify the principal reasons for the lack of more frequent and effective pursuit of wildlife inspection program violations and, in conjunction with the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and the Department of Justice, determine what measures can be taken, within existing resources and funding constraints, to make law enforcement efforts more efficient and effective.", "Proceed with plans to increase the user fees charged by the wildlife inspection program and apply the increased funding to those areas where resource needs have been identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Interior generally agreed with our recommendations to improve LEMIS, to proceed with plans to increase the fees charged for inspection services, and to develop outcome-oriented, performance-related goals that are indicative of an effective inspection program.", "Interior disagreed with our recommendation to examine the operations of the various ports of entry and look for ways in which the allocation of resources might be adjusted to respond to the current needs at the ports and to improve the program\u2019s overall efficiency and effectiveness. It did indicate, however, that workload factors have been used to justify increased resources at several ports of entry (namely, Los Angeles, Chicago, and U.S.-Mexico border ports) and that they would continue to be considered. Interior pointed out that any decision to reallocate existing resources must also factor in political and economic considerations and the fact that FWS has determined that it must maintain a minimum staffing presence at its designated ports to provide uninterrupted service. We agree that such factors should be a part of any reallocation considerations. Our analysis indicates, however, that the variances among the different ports of entry in terms of such things as the number of (1) inspectors assigned, (2) shipments processed, and (3) shipments inspected are significant enough to warrant additional scrutiny by FWS of its allocation of resources to the wildlife inspection program.", "Interior also disagreed with a recommendation in our draft report to conduct a study of the penalties and fines assessed as a result of violations detected by the wildlife inspection program, and then meet with the Office of the Solicitor and the Department of Justice to identify ways in which the parties might work better together in catching and prosecuting those who violate wildlife trade laws and treaties. Interior stated that it was not apparent how a study of the penalties and fines is relevant to identifying ways in which the enforcement and prosecution parties can work better together.", "In our opinion, the number and dollar amounts of the penalties and fines assessed as a result of FWS\u2019 wildlife inspection program is an important gauge of the effectiveness of the program. While it is unrealistic to expect every violation to result in a penalty or fine, we believe that FWS management should be concerned by the fact that few penalties and fines are currently being assessed for violations detected by the wildlife inspection program and that this lack of penalties and fines provides little or no deterrent to those who would otherwise be inclined to violate wildlife laws and treaties. Given the limited resources that FWS devotes to the wildlife inspection program, it is our opinion that FWS should attempt to get the most out of those resources. One such way would be for FWS\u2014armed with basic data on the numbers of inspections conducted, violations detected, and penalties and fines assessed for these violations\u2014to initiate discussions with the Office of the Solicitor and the Department of Justice that would seek to ensure a more efficient and effective wildlife inspection program. We have revised our recommendation to more specifically state the action that we believe is needed.", "Interior provided several technical clarifications, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate.

We were told that although wildlife is not emphasized at Customs (because of other priorities), Customs, in a limited manner, does look at wildlife shipments and includes some of them in its automated cargo system, which is accessible to FWS inspectors. Additionally, we were provided with several technical clarifications, which we incorporated into the report."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
