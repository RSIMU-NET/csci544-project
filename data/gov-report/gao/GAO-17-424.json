Lead exposure through drinking water is caused primarily by the corrosion of plumbing materials, such as pipes, that carry water from a water system to pipes in homes. EPA set national standards to reduce lead in drinking water with the LCR, which applies to all water systems providing drinking water to most of the U.S. population, except places where people do not remain for long, such as campgrounds. States generally have primary responsibility for enforcing the LCR, and data help EPA monitor states' and systems' compliance with the LCR.", "GAO was asked to review the issue of elevated lead in drinking water. Among other objectives, this report examines (1) what available EPA data show about LCR compliance among water systems and (2) factors that may contribute to LCR noncompliance. GAO analyzed EPA data on violations and enforcement of the LCR from July 1, 2011, through December 31, 2016, interviewed EPA officials in headquarters and the 10 regional offices; conducted a statistical analysis of the likelihood of reported LCR violations; and held discussion groups with a nonprobability sample of regulators representing 41 states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Available Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, reported by states, show that of the approximately 68,000 drinking water systems subject to the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), at least 10 percent had at least one open violation of the rule; however these and other data are not complete. When the LCR was promulgated in 1991, all water systems were required to collect information about the infrastructure delivering water to customers, including lead pipes (see figure). However, because the LCR does not require states to submit information on known lead pipes to EPA, the agency does not have national-level information about lead infrastructure. After the events in Flint, Michigan, and other cities, EPA asked states to collect information on the locations of lead pipes, and all but nine, which had such difficulties as finding historical documentation, indicated a plan or intent to fulfill the request. According to EPA guidance, knowledge of lead pipes is needed for studies of corrosion control. GAO reported in March 2013 that with limited funding for federal programs, the need to target such funds efficiently increases. By EPA requiring states to report data on lead pipes, key decision makers would have information about the nation's lead infrastructure.", "Through discussion groups, state regulators identified 29 factors that may contribute to water systems' noncompliance with the LCR. In conducting a statistical analysis using EPA data on selected factors, such as the size of the population served and type of source water, GAO found that such factors were associated with a higher likelihood of water systems having reported violations of the LCR. EPA's current approach to oversight of the LCR targets water systems with sample results that exceed the lead action level. While this approach is reasonable because such water systems have a documented lead exposure risk, EPA officials in 3 of the 10 regional offices told GAO that it is not sustainable over time because of limited resources. Under federal standards for internal control, management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. By developing a statistical analysis that incorporates multiple factors to identify water systems that might pose a higher likelihood for having reported violations of the LCR to supplement its current approach, EPA could better target its oversight to such water systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including for EPA to require states to report data on lead pipes and develop a statistical analysis on the likelihood of LCR violations to supplement its current oversight.

The severe adverse  health effects associated with even low levels of exposure to lead are  widely known by health experts. Lead poses the greatest risk to infants,  young children under the age of 6, and pregnant women because it can  cause learning and behavioral problems in children and premature birth in  pregnant women, among other physiological effects. Lead exposure  through the drinking water supply occurs primarily through the corrosion  of pipes that systems use to deliver water to customers, pipes inside of a  household or building, or plumbing fixtures. The total number of lead  pipes is unknown. However, according to estimates in an April 2016  study, there are at least 6.1 million homeowner- and water system-owned  pipes with lead that deliver drinking water to about 15 million to 22 million  people\u20145 to 7.5 percent of the nation\u2019s population. Industry estimates  indicate that the average cost to replace each of these pipes at about  $5,000, which would mean a total cost of at least an estimated $30 billion  nationwide.", "As part of the 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA),  Congress authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set   national standards to reduce lead in drinking water under a 1991  treatment technique rule, known as the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR).  Of the estimated 151,000 water systems operating in the United States,  the LCR applies to about 68,000 water systems (about 45 percent of all  water systems). The LCR does not apply to an estimated 83,000 water  systems (about 55 percent of all water systems) that provide water in a  place, such as a gas station or campground, where people do not remain  for long periods of time. Approximately 8,000 of the 68,000 water systems  are schools and daycare facilities with their own water supplies, according  to EPA. In total, the LCR applies to water systems serving about 312  million people, most of the U.S population. EPA has indicated that there  are no safe levels of lead in drinking water. Therefore, the LCR requires  water systems to monitor drinking water at customers\u2019 taps and, if lead  levels are higher than the LCR allows, to take additional actions to control  corrosion, inform the public, and in some circumstances replace lead  service lines under the systems\u2019 control. States generally have primary  responsibility for monitoring and enforcement of SDWA requirements,  including the LCR. According to EPA officials and documents, the LCR is  one of the most complex drinking water regulations under the SDWA. In  2016, the agency announced that it would revise the LCR and issue  proposed revisions in 2017 and a final revised rule in 2019.", "To help ensure public health and monitor states and water systems\u2019  compliance with the LCR, EPA must have access to reliable data. These  data include the inventory of water systems operating in the country, use  of treatment techniques, quality of drinking water, violations of LCR  requirements, and EPA and state enforcement actions. Generally, states  collect and manage these data in either a database provided by EPA or in  a database of their own design. States also periodically transfer  information from their databases to EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water  Information System (SDWIS/Fed). The data in SDWIS/Fed play a critical  role in helping EPA monitor states\u2019 and water systems\u2019 compliance, which  is a key component in how EPA performs its oversight role with respect to  the LCR.", "The events in Flint, Michigan, were not the first time in recent history that  drinking water contaminated with toxic levels of lead prompted questions  about the nationwide scope of the problem. In 2003, testing in the District  of Columbia revealed that more than 4,000 households in the city had  elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. We issued reports on the  District of Columbia, specifically, in 2005, and on the extent to which EPA  had sufficient data to oversee the implementation of the LCR, nationally,  in 2006. We found, among other things, that some aspects of EPA\u2019s  data on the LCR were not timely, accurate, or complete. EPA generally  agreed with our findings and recommendations. In response, EPA took  some steps to improve the data, as discussed later in the report.", "You asked us to review the issue of elevated lead in drinking water, and  this report is the first in a series to respond to your request. Our  objectives were to examine (1) what the available EPA data show about  compliance with and enforcement of the LCR among water systems,  including schools; (2) how EPA uses these data to monitor compliance;  and (3) factors, if any, that may contribute to water systems\u2019  noncompliance with the LCR.", "To examine what the available EPA data show about reported  compliance with and enforcement of the LCR, including among water  systems and schools (and day care centers) with their own water  supplies, we reviewed LCR data for community water systems and non- transient non-community water systems listed as active in EPA\u2019s  SDWIS/Fed database from July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016, because  the period provides the most recent available compliance data without a  change in the regulations. To assess the reliability, completeness, and  accuracy of LCR compliance data in SDWIS/Fed, we interviewed EPA  officials and reviewed EPA data reliability assessments, recent EPA file  reviews for selected states, a 2017 EPA OIG report on the reliability of  SDWIS/Fed compliance data, data verification reports and our past  reports on the reliability of the data in SDWIS/Fed. According to these  recent EPA assessments, the EPA OIG report, and our January 2006 and  June 2011 reports,  some of the data in the SDWIS/Fed database are  not complete. In part, because of the incompleteness of reported data on  sample results, violations, and enforcement actions we found the data to  be of undetermined reliability and we note specific limitations to the data  in the body of this report. In this report we describe the available data  about water systems\u2019 compliance with the LCR and EPA\u2019s enforcement  actions as they are reported in SDWIS/Fed.", "To examine how EPA uses these data to monitor compliance, we  interviewed officials from EPA headquarters and its 10 regional offices on  the agency\u2019s approach to enforcing the LCR. To identify any factors that  may contribute to noncompliance with the LCR, we conducted discussion  groups with a nonprobability sample of state drinking water regulators  representing 41 states and 1 territory. Findings from the discussion  groups cannot be generalized to all state regulators but provide illustrative  examples. We conducted a literature review of 31 studies about the  detection of lead in drinking water and violations of drinking water  regulations to identify factors associated with elevated concentrations of  lead in public drinking water, human exposure to lead in drinking water, or  violations of drinking water laws and regulations. We used the data in  SDWIS/Fed for 2 selected states\uf8e7Ohio and Texas\uf8e7to conduct a  statistical analysis that calculated a system\u2019s likelihood of a violation  using selected factors, such as the size of the population served and the  type of source water. Although some of the data in the SDWIS/Fed  database are not complete, we selected these 2 states because EPA  reviews of the completeness and accuracy of LCR data reported by these  states did not find significant discrepancies. We reviewed EPA\u2019s reviews  on the reliability of data the states provide to SDWIS/Fed and interviewed  EPA and state officials to determine that these 2 states had sufficiently  reliable data for our purposes of illustrating a statistical approach. We  compared EPA\u2019s use of these data to inform management decisions  against federal standards for internal control. Finally, we reviewed  federal regulations; EPA guidance to states and water systems, action  plans, memorandums, and letters; and other relevant documentation.  Appendix I contains a more detailed description of our objectives, scope,  and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to September  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

However, lead remains a significant  concern to public health because lead is persistent and can accumulate in  the body over time with long-lasting effects, particularly for children and  pregnant women. According to EPA documents, low levels of lead  exposure in children are linked to hyperactivity, anemia, lower intelligence  quotient (IQ), physical and learning disabilities, and slowed growth. In  pregnant women, lead can store in bones and be released as maternal  calcium used to form the bones of the fetus, reduce fetal growth, and  increase risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. For adults, lead can have  detrimental effects on cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive systems;  and, it can prompt memory loss. The presence of lead in the bloodstream  can disappear relatively quickly, but bones can retain the toxin for  decades.", "According to the National Institutes of Health and CDC documents,  medications can remove some lead from the body but cannot undo the  damage lead causes, although additional services may mitigate some of  the damage. Recognizing that vigilance and collaboration are necessary  to ensure that children negatively affected by lead exposure receive  services designed to compensate for lead\u2019s effect on the brain, and  behavior of children, some medical experts promote early-childhood  intervention, education, and other programs. According to CDC  documents, early intervention for children can help improve IQ scores,  academic readiness, and language development as well as decrease  placement in special education classes. For these reasons, EPA and  others recommend the prevention of lead exposure before it occurs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Water Systems Deliver Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["Water systems depend on distribution systems, both simple and complex,  composed of interconnected components to deliver drinking water from a  source to their customers. Source water can be either surface (streams,  rivers, and lakes) or ground (aquifers). As figure 1 illustrates, the  distribution system used to deliver water from the source can include a  network of pipes and other components. A distribution system comprises  water towers, pipes, pumps, and other components to deliver treated  water from treatment systems to consumers. Particularly among larger  water systems, distribution systems may contain thousands of miles of  pipes, including water mains.", "There are 1 million miles of drinking water mains in the country, according  to a 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers study. Service lines are  the smaller pipes that connect the water mains to homes and buildings  and can also include smaller pipes used for connecting a service line to  the water mains (e.g., called pigtail and gooseneck pipes). In contrast to  most other drinking water contaminants, lead is rarely found in the source  water. More commonly, lead enters drinking water after the water comes  into contact with water mains; service lines; smaller pipes that connect  the two; and other plumbing materials that contain lead, such as faucets  and water coolers. Schools and day care centers with their own water  supplies generally rely on well-water systems using groundwater to  deliver drinking water.", "According to the 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers study and  EPA documents, communities, both urban and rural, have aging and  deteriorating drinking water infrastructure, which, according to EPA  documents, can contribute to lead hazards in drinking water. Since the  early 1970s, when several medical studies confirmed that lead exposure  negatively impacts health, measures have been taken to reduce the  public\u2019s exposure to lead in drinking water, including the enactment of  amendments to the SDWA in 1986 and 1996, the enactment of the Lead  Contamination Control Act in 1988, the issuance of the LCR in 1991, and  amendments to state building codes prohibiting the use of lead pipes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Lead and Copper Rule", "paragraphs": ["The LCR generally requires water systems to minimize lead in drinking  water by controlling the corrosion of metals in the infrastructure they use  to deliver water and in household plumbing. EPA has stated that the  LCR is one of the most complicated drinking water regulations for states  to implement because of the need to control the corrosion of pipes and  plumbing fixtures as water is delivered to consumers. The corrosion of  pipes results from a chemical interaction between water and pipes that  wears the metal away and allows particles of metal to flake away over time. All large water systems (serving populations larger than 50,000) are  generally required to install corrosion control treatment. While the majority  of the U.S. population receives its drinking water from medium and large  water systems, most water systems are small.", "Characteristics of water can affect the occurrence and rate of corrosion.  For example, corrosion occurs more frequently in soft water\u2014water with  low concentrations of calcium and magnesium\u2014and also in acidic water,  or water with low pH. Water systems control corrosion by adjusting the  pH and alkalinity of water or by adding corrosion inhibitors. The LCR  establishes corrosion control as the required treatment technique for large  water systems and, for medium and small systems, the required  treatment technique when the federal lead action level is exceeded (also  known as an action level exceedance). Lead concentrations exceeding  an action level of 15 parts per billion, or 0.015 milligrams per liter (mg/L),  in over 10 percent of tap water samples (i.e., the 90th percentile level) are  an indicator that corrosion control is needed or is not working correctly.  A water system\u2019s 90th percentile sample result does not exceed the lead  action level if it is equal to or less than 15 parts per billion. As figure 2  illustrates, the LCR also requires water systems to identify locations  where lead may be present and periodically obtain tap water samples  from those locations (of which single-family homes are the highest  priority).", "Under the LCR, an action level exceedance requires the water system  and state to take a number of additional steps. Those additional steps  require that small and medium water systems install or modify corrosion  control treatment, and water systems of all sizes provide information  (known as public education) about the harmful effects of lead to  consumers and vulnerable populations (e.g., schools, if the water system  serves a school, and public health departments). Water systems are  also required to test and, if necessary, treat the source water. If, after  installing corrosion control and treating source water, a system continues  to have 90th percentile sample results that exceed the lead action level,  the LCR requires the water system to begin replacing lead service lines, if  they exist. In most communities, lead service lines are partially owned by  the water system and partially owned by the homeowner. The LCR allows  for a partial replacement when an owner of a home or building is unable  or unwilling to pay for replacement of the portion of the service line not  owned by the water system.", "In an October 2016 study, EPA noted that sample requirements under the  LCR are complex for many reasons, one reason being that it is the only  drinking water regulation in which homeowners or consumers collect the  drinking water samples. Water systems are in compliance with the LCR  when they follow the various federal requirements for collecting samples,  reporting, installing treatments, providing public education, and replacing  lead service lines; as well as when they follow any state requirements that  are more stringent than the federal requirements. States and EPA can  take several different types of enforcement actions when water systems  fail to complete requirements in these areas. Sample results that exceed  the lead action level do not by themselves constitute violations of the  LCR.", "The SDWA, as amended in 1996, requires EPA to review and revise, as  appropriate, each national primary drinking water regulation, including the  LCR, at least once every 6 years.

EPA initiated an extensive review of the LCR in 2004 after  widespread increases in lead levels were detected in the District of  Columbia\u2019s water following a water treatment change. EPA promulgated  short-term revisions and clarifications in 2007 and has continued working  on comprehensive revisions. In 2016, the agency announced that it would  revise the LCR and issue proposed revisions in 2017 and a final revised  rule in 2019.

Taking samples from homes is the only way that water  systems, states, and ultimately EPA can obtain the indicators needed to  determine whether corrosion control treatment is needed or if corrosion  control treatments already installed are working, in addition to other  treatment technique requirements. The third most frequent violation was  lead consumer notification, which states or water systems are to do in  writing, about the results of the samples taken from homes or buildings  they occupy regardless of the presence of lead in the samples taken,  known as lead consumer notice violations. These notifications are to  provide consumers with information about their drinking water sample  results so that they can determine what actions to take to reduce their  exposure to lead if lead is present.", "Of the approximately 68,000 water systems subject to the LCR,  approximately 7,000 schools and daycare centers make up about 10  percent.

We then found in June  2011 that the enforcement data, generally, in SDWIS/Fed were  incomplete. States and EPA can take a range of enforcement actions  both formal and informal. Formal enforcement actions include issuing  state administrative orders with or without penalties, filing state or federal  civil and criminal cases, and issuing emergency orders. Informal  enforcement actions include reminder notices of a violation, formal  notices of violation, public notification requests, and state referrals of  cases to EPA.

Water systems that must replace their lead service lines under the  LCR also must report their materials evaluations to their respective  states. In addition, a 1980 EPA regulation required community water  systems to identify, among other things, whether lead from piping, solder,  caulking, interior lining of distribution mains, alloys, and home plumbing  was present in their distribution system and report this information to the  state.

In the letter, EPA also noted that many states identified challenges in  identifying lead service lines but that improving knowledge of lead service  lines is important to ensure that water systems are (1) collecting drinking  water samples from valid high-risk locations, as required under the LCR,  (2) managing the risks associated with disruption of lead service lines,  and (3) providing information to customers on how to assess and mitigate  risks posed by lead.", "In written responses to EPA\u2019s letter, most (37) of the 50 states (or  primacy agencies) indicated that they had fulfilled or intended to fulfill  EPA\u2019s request to work with water systems to collect and make public  information about lead pipes. Four states indicated that they were  considering EPA\u2019s request. However, 9 states indicated that they would  not or did not intend to fulfill EPA\u2019s request because of challenges in  finding the historical documentation about lead pipes used to create  original sample plans or dedicating staff resources to do so. In addition, in  their responses to EPA\u2019s letter, 13 states noted that the LCR does not  require states to maintain information about water systems\u2019 lead pipes or  to provide the information to the public.

According to information on EPA\u2019s website,  small water systems can face unique managerial, financial and  operational challenges in consistently providing drinking water that meets  EPA standards and requirements. In 2016, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General reported that small water systems are less likely to have the  technical, managerial, and financial capacity to conduct actions that  would ensure safe drinking water. The SDWA requires that EPA assist  states in ensuring that water systems acquire and maintain technical,  managerial, and financial capacity.

By requiring,  in the upcoming LCR revision, that states report all 90th percentile  sample results for small systems in the SDWIS/Fed database, EPA would  have data to track the changes in lead levels over time among small  systems and would be better positioned to assist states in early  intervention for small water systems that are near the lead action level  where appropriate.

In addition, the  approach would allow, if necessary, states and EPA to have an  opportunity for early intervention. EPA officials said that previously  they had not systematically and uniformly analyzed all of the water  systems in their database with sample results that exceed the federal  lead action level or asked states, at any one time, to provide updates  on all of the water systems with sample results exceeding the action  level. Instead, EPA headquarters officials said that staff in the regional  offices generally had worked with individual states on individual cases  of water systems with sample results exceeding the action level as a  part of the agency\u2019s routine oversight efforts.

EPA officials we interviewed in some of the 10  regional offices said that meetings with state officials to discuss the  water systems that had exceeded the lead action level had been  beneficial because agency officials gained a better understanding of  how states understood and implemented the requirements of the  LCR. However, officials in 3 of the 10 regional offices said that they  would ask states to provide these updates less frequently because of  limited staff resources. EPA headquarters officials told us that an  additional outcome of this approach was insight, for EPA staff, into the  types of training state regulators may need about the implementation  of LCR requirements.", "The second part of EPA\u2019s approach, according to headquarters  officials, was to review state protocols and practices against all of the  requirements of the LCR to ensure that states were implementing the  rule, including protocols and procedures for using corrosion control  treatments. After reviewing state protocols and practices, EPA  requested that states take such actions as providing information on  their websites and documenting protocols and practices for greater  transparency. In addition, EPA staff in the 10 regional offices  conducted meetings with the state officials in their regions. Some of  these EPA officials also told us that the agency determined that  generally states were implementing the LCR appropriately.

We also  reviewed 31 studies and summarized the factors the authors identified.  Table 1 identifies the 10 factors state regulators most frequently  identified.", "During our discussion groups, state regulators provided examples of how  these factors contributed to noncompliance with the rule. For example,  regulators in 37 states said that the size of the population served by water  systems may influence noncompliance with the LCR. Regulators in 28 of  the 37 states said that small systems are more likely to have drinking  water sample results that exceed the federal action level, to be in  noncompliance, or to face challenges that may contribute to  noncompliance. Regulators in 5 states explained that this may be  because small systems are generally less likely to have operators with  the knowledge to properly collect samples or manage corrosion control  treatment. Regulators in 28 states said that the required LCR process for  collecting drinking water samples to test for lead levels may contribute to  noncompliance. Regulators in 19 of these 28 states said that collecting  the required number of samples is a challenge for water systems that can  lead to noncompliance, because homeowners are frequently not willing to  collect samples or, if they agree to collect samples, often collect them  improperly. For example, homeowners may sample from an infrequently  used faucet (e.g., outside spigot) instead of the required drinking water  tap. Regulators in 20 states also described how the type of water system  can lead to noncompliance. For example, they said that water systems for  which water management and treatment are not the primary missions,  such as schools, mobile home parks, and other entities, have challenges  complying with the LCR.", "These regulators also told us that the presence of multiple factors could,  together, contribute to violations of the LCR. For example, a regulator in  one state said that the presence of lead in the pipes, combined with  corrosive water, could lead to sample results that exceed the federal lead  action level for a water system. A 90th percentile sample result that  exceeds the lead action level is not by itself a violation. However, if the  same water system did not conduct the required corrosion control  treatment study for any reason, including because it lacked the financial  capacity to pay for the study, the system would be in violation of the  LCR.  Appendix III provides information on all of the factors that state  regulators in the 41 states and 1 territory identified in our discussions as  well as examples of how those factors, individually and together, may  contribute to violations of the LCR.", "The 31 academic studies we reviewed associated certain factors with  elevated concentrations of lead in public drinking water, human exposure  to lead in drinking water, or violations of drinking water laws and  regulations.

SDWIS/Fed does not include data on  such factors as the presence of lead service lines or technical,  managerial, and financial capacity.", "We were unable to develop a nationwide statistical model referred to as a  logistic regression analysis. A logistic regression analysis can identify  factors that are associated with a violation and can estimate a drinking  water system\u2019s likelihood of a violation based on these factors. We have  previously found that regression analysis can identify entities, regulated  by a federal program, that pose a higher likelihood for a particular  outcome. However, during our review of the reliability of EPA\u2019s data on  violations, we could not verify that the limitations in the completeness of  the data identified in our June 2011 report had been sufficiently  addressed, nationwide. Specifically, in June 2011, we found that EPA  had not been able, among other things, to resume the comprehensive  and routine data verification audits that would provide it with current  information on the completeness of the data states provide to  SDWIS/Fed. As a result, in June 2011, we recommended that EPA  resume data verification audits to routinely evaluate the quality of  selected drinking water data on health-based and monitoring violations  that the states provide to EPA. These audits should also evaluate the  quality of data on the enforcement actions that states and other primacy  agencies have taken to correct violations. EPA partially agreed with our  recommendation and stated that it has found that data verification audits  provide valuable information on data completeness but did not commit to  conducting such audits beyond 2011. Instead, EPA said that until the next  generation of SDWIS (SDWIS Prime) is deployed, thus enabling the  agency to view compliance monitoring data and compliance  determinations directly, it will consider using data verification audits to  evaluate data quality. As of October 2016, EPA reported that it has not  conducted another data verification audit.", "Because of the limitations of using SDWIS/Fed data to conduct a  nationwide analysis, we sought to use such data to conduct an analysis  for individual states to determine whether factors could predict the  likelihood that a water system would violate the LCR. As such, we used data from Ohio and Texas to examine the potential for developing a  statistical analysis to identify drinking water systems at higher likelihood  of having a reported violation. EPA found few or no discrepancies  between the LCR data in these state systems and in SDWIS/Fed for the  time period of our statistical analysis, 2013 to 2016. The results of our  analysis are not generalizable to other states.", "To conduct an analysis for the two states, we developed a series of  logistic regression models for these states using (1) LCR violations data  for Ohio and Texas in SDWIS/Fed for 2013 and 2014 and (2) the four  factors for which data were available in SDWIS/Fed (size of the  population served, ownership, source water, and water system type). Our  models estimated the likelihood that a water system in those two states  would have a reported violation of the LCR based on these factors. We  found that water systems with certain factors had a higher likelihood of  having a reported violation of the LCR than water systems without those  factors. For example, in both states, a water system serving 100 people  was more likely to have a reported violation of the LCR than a water  system serving 1,000 people. In addition, systems with a previous sample  result that exceeded the lead action level were more likely to have a  reported violation of the LCR than systems without a previous sample  result that exceeded the lead action level.", "We then tested the ability of our models to predict subsequent rates of  having reported violations. Specifically, we compared the estimates from  our models to violations that were actually reported in SDWIS/Fed in  2015 and 2016. We found that water systems that we identified as having  higher likelihoods of having a reported violation, based on our models,  had significantly higher rates of reported violations in 2015 and 2016. The  results of our analysis indicate that multiple factors, in addition to whether  a system had sample results that exceeded the lead action level, could be  used to predict water systems with a higher likelihood of having a  reported violation of the LCR.", "Our analysis suggests that a statistical analysis of EPA data could be  used to identify water systems with a higher likelihood of having a  reported violation of the LCR. However, we identified two key limitations,  among others, based on the state of the data in SDWIS/Fed as of  December 2016. The first was the quality of the data for the purposes of  conducting an analysis. We could not be confident in the specific results  of a nationwide or, for some states, a state-specific analysis, because we  did not have the necessary assurances of the accuracy and  completeness of the SDWIS/Fed data, issues about which we previously  reported in January 2006 and June 2011. EPA headquarters officials  told us in June 2011 and April 2016 that their upcoming SDWIS/Fed  upgrade, SDWIS Prime, could give the agency direct access to state  data. Having complete and accurate data for all states or a nationally  representative sample of states would allow for a nationwide analysis.", "The second limitation was that data are not available for many of the  factors identified by state regulators that may contribute to water systems\u2019  noncompliance with the LCR. Our analysis was limited to those four  factors for which states submit data to EPA\u2019s SDWIS/Fed. Because data  were unavailable for all potentially relevant factors, we were unable to  include information on the presence of lead pipes, lack of financial  capacity, and lack of technical capacity. EPA headquarters officials told  us that they were considering the development of indicators of capacity.  For example, these officials said that potential indicators suggesting a  drinking water system is challenged by capacity are the drinking water  system (1) not having raised rates in 20 years; (2) not having recently  used asset management; or (3) having experienced difficulty in retaining  trained operators. Data on the presence of lead pipes, financial capacity,  technical capacity, and other factors may allow for stronger logistic  regression models that more accurately identify water systems with a  higher likelihood for violations. Appendix V provides a technical  description of the statistical analysis we conducted.", "According to EPA, the agency promulgated the LCR to protect public  health by minimizing the levels of lead in the drinking water supply.  EPA\u2019s current approach for oversight of the LCR targets water systems  with sample results that exceed the lead action level. This approach is  reasonable because water systems that exceed the action level have a  known and documented lead exposure risk and are required under the  LCR to take actions that are considered health-based. This approach,  however, primarily incorporates one factor\uf8e7sample results that exceed the lead action level\uf8e7and does not include the potential of having  reported violations across all of the requirements of the LCR. In addition,  EPA officials we interviewed in 3 of the 10 regional offices said that they  do not have the resources to sustain the agency\u2019s current approach.  Under federal standards for internal control, management should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives.  Although EPA may not have the resources to continue the use of its  current approach of following up on all sample results that exceed the  lead action level, our analysis illustrates that EPA collects data that,  where complete and accurate, could be incorporated into a risk-based  analysis. For example, such an analysis could be used in individual states  or geographical areas, while EPA is taking steps to improve its data and  implement SDWIS Prime. A statistical, risk-based analysis, whether it is  used for individual states or nationwide, may provide EPA with an  additional tool by which it may be able to efficiently target its limited  resources for oversight of water systems and meet its goal of reducing  the risk of lead exposure.

EPA has  long acknowledged the challenges experienced by small water systems,  as evidenced in the data for samples that exceed the lead action level  and violations for taking samples as required and reporting sample  results. The upcoming revision of the LCR provides an opportunity for  EPA to require states to report all 90th percentile sample results for small  systems. By doing so, EPA would have data to track the changes in lead  levels over time among small systems and would be better positioned to  assist states in early intervention for small water systems that are near  the lead action level where appropriate.

Our objectives were to  examine (1) what the available EPA data show about compliance with  and enforcement of the LCR among water systems, including schools; (2)  how EPA uses these data to monitor compliance; and (3) factors, if any,  that may contribute to water systems\u2019 noncompliance with the LCR. We  compared our evidence on EPA\u2019s a use of these data for oversight of the  LCR to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.  According to these standards, internal control is a process by an entity\u2019s  oversight body, management, and other personnel that provides  reasonable assurance that the objectives of an entity will be achieved. An  effective internal control system increases the likelihood that an entity will  achieve its objectives. For this review, we used the standard for one of  the five components of internal control\uf8e7risk assessment\uf8e7as criteria.", "To examine what the EPA data show about reported compliance and  enforcement, we reviewed LCR data in EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water  Information System (SDWIS/Fed) for the time period July 1, 2011, to  December 31, 2016. We chose this time period because it provided the  most recent history of available compliance data without a change in the  regulations at the time of our analysis. The LCR data contained  information on 67,581 active community water systems and non-transient  non-community water systems, including those that were schools or  daycare centers with their own water supply. Table 2 provides the water  systems, by type and size, included in our analysis. The LCR divides  water systems into three broad categories: small, medium, and large.  Size is a factor in determining the number of samples that must be  collected as well as the applicability and timing of some of the LCR  requirements.", "We reviewed the available data on corrosion control, drinking water  sample results, violations of the requirements of the LCR, and state and  EPA enforcement actions. We also described the data by population  served/size, whether the water system was a school or daycare center,  and whether the water system was a community water system or a non- transient non-community water system, among other factors. We  analyzed data on sample results for a 3-year time period (from January  2014 to December 2016) and for a 5 1/2-year period (from July 2011 to  December 2016). EPA officials told us that they analyze sample data over  a 3-year period rather than yearly to ensure that the majority of water  systems will have submitted sample results. When presenting a  comparison of the sample data and the milestone data on corrosion  control, we used the 5 1/2-year period for both sets of data. For violations  data, we presented open violations as of December 2016. Violations are  considered open when the state has not determined that a water system  is in compliance with the specific requirement for which it received the  violation. Finally, we presented data on enforcement actions for a 5 1/2- year period (July 2011 through December 2016) to ensure that we  provided the most complete picture of the range of state and federal  actions taken and to avoid comparisons with the violations data.  According to a 2013 EPA compliance report, enforcement data, in any  one year, do not necessarily correlate with violations data. In addition,  the compliance report states that enforcement actions can be initiated  against violations that occurred in a previous year, one enforcement  action may address numerous violations at the same system; and it can  take several years for a system to return to compliance.", "We reviewed the data available in the SDWIS/Fed database and the  compliance requirements in the LCR to evaluate those aspects of the  LCR for which implementation data were available. We interviewed  officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Water and Office of Enforcement and  Compliance Assurance on the reliability, completeness and accuracy of  LCR data in SDWIS/Fed. In addition, we reviewed EPA data reliability  assessments, recent file reviews for selected states, a 2017 EPA OIG  report on the reliability of SDWIS/Fed sample data, data verification  reports and past GAO reports on the reliability of the data in SDWIS/Fed.  For example, EPA\u2019s file reviews in some states found that not all  violations data were reported to SDWIS/Fed, which could lead to  undercounting. In addition, some state regulators told us that samples  may be collected incorrectly by some homeowners, which could lead to  inaccurate sample results. EPA has stated on its website that the agency  acknowledges challenges related to the data in SDWIS/Fed, specifically  underreporting of some data by states. GAO has also reported on EPA\u2019s  challenges with SDWIS/Fed. Based on this, the compliance data in  SDWIS/Fed likely underreport the actual number of sample results that  exceed the lead action level, milestones, violations, and enforcement  actions, which we note in this report. Because of the incompleteness of  reported data on sample results, violations, and enforcement actions, and  because of concerns raised by state officials about sample data, we  found the data to be of undetermined reliability. For this review, we  describe the data about water systems\u2019 compliance with the LCR  compliance and EPA\u2019s enforcement actions as they are reported in  SDWIS/Fed for the purpose of providing a current assessment of EPA\u2019s  use of the data.", "To examine how EPA uses LCR data to monitor compliance we  conducted semistructured interviews with EPA officials. We used a  standard set of questions to interview officials in EPA\u2019s headquarters and  in each of the 10 regional offices. Our standard set of open-ended  questions for EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices asked about state actions  responding to EPA\u2019s requests about, among other things, implementation  of the LCR, the use of SDWIS/Fed data, enforcement tools, and  compliance with the LCR among water systems and schools. We  conducted in-person interviews with officials responsible for monitoring  compliance in states within EPA regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. We identified  these regions based on a 2016 survey that estimated that these regions  have the highest number of lead service lines. We spoke with officials in  EPA regions 6, 8, 9, and 10 on the telephone. Table 3 provides a list of  the EPA regions and the states under the regulatory jurisdiction of those  regions. Our in-person interviews with officials in EPA regions 1through 5  and 7 were in offices located in Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New  York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and  Lenexa, Kansas, respectively. In these cities, we also met with state  primacy agencies and local water systems and other local officials, when  possible, to obtain examples of compliance and enforcement practices  and implementation challenges. Specifically, we met with state drinking  water officials in Massachusetts and Georgia. We met with officials  representing local water systems in Atlanta, Boston, New York, Chicago,  and Kansas City, Missouri. In total, we held 10 interviews with EPA staff  in the regional offices and seven interviews with state and local officials in  the cities we visited. We also reviewed EPA policy documents that  outlined the agency\u2019s enforcement approach and documents related to  EPA\u2019s request that states take certain actions following the events in Flint,  Michigan. Finally, we reviewed federal regulations; EPA guidance to  states and water systems on how to implement the LCR; the 2016 action  plan; information on what constitutes a violation of the LCR, action plans,  and other relevant documents.", "To identify the factors that may influence water systems\u2019 risk of  noncompliance with the LCR, we conducted a content analysis of  information provided by state regulators in discussion groups. To assess  whether selected factors available in SDWIS/Fed could be used to predict  reported violations, we conducted a statistical analysis of EPA data to  develop an illustrative model. We conducted a literature review to identify  factors associated with elevated concentrations of lead in public drinking  water, human exposure to lead in drinking water, or violations of drinking  water laws and regulations.", "Discussion groups with state regulators. We conducted discussion  groups with a nonprobability sample of state drinking water regulators to  contribute to our understanding of the potential factors that may influence  noncompliance with the LCR. We invited regulators from all states and  territories to participate via email. In total, we conducted eight, 1-hour  discussion groups over the telephone in September and October 2016.  Regulators representing 41 states and 1 territory participated in these  discussion groups. Each discussion group had from 2 to 8 states or  territory, and each state or territory had a primary designated  spokesperson. During each discussion group, the GAO moderator asked  participants to list one or two factors that, in their experience, most  strongly influence a water system\u2019s ability to comply with the LCR. Each  state provided a list of factors. The moderator then asked participants to  elaborate on how the factors reported could influence compliance. When  necessary, the moderator asked probing questions to further clarify  participants\u2019 comments. Two or three analysts transcribed each session  and combined and reconciled notes to develop transcripts for each of the  discussion groups. We conducted a content analysis of the transcripts  from the eight discussion groups to identify the factors most frequently  reported by the participants in the groups. Two GAO analysts  independently classified each comment using qualitative analysis  software. The findings from these discussion groups may not be  generalizable to all state regulators. We provide a narrative description of  the results of our discussions with the state regulators in appendix III and  a technical description of the content analysis we conducted in appendix  IV.", "Statistical analysis. We conducted a statistical analysis to illustrate  whether predictive modeling could be used to identify water systems with  a higher likelihood of a reported violation of the LCR. To conduct our  analysis, we used the same data from EPA\u2019s SDWIS/Fed for systems  listed as active as of December 31, 2016 as mentioned above. We  selected two states\uf8e7Ohio and Texas\uf8e7because EPA\u2019s file reviews  indicated that there were not significant discrepancies during the scope  and time period of our analysis, which focused on 2013 to 2016, in the  LCR data reported by these states to SDWIS/Fed. We reviewed EPA\u2019s  2016 file reviews of data the states provide to SDWIS/Fed and  interviewed EPA and state officials for Texas and received written  responses to our questions from Ohio. For each of the sampled systems,  EPA reviewed state records to determine whether the state was correctly  identifying violations and reporting those violations to SDWIS/Fed.  Although, unlike EPA\u2019s previous reviews, EPA\u2019s 2016 file reviews are not  based on generalizable samples, they were conducted for a broad range  of drinking water systems in each of the states. Based on the results of  EPA\u2019s reviews, we determined that these two states had sufficiently  reliable data for our purposes of illustrating a statistical approach. The  results of our analysis for these two states are not generalizable to other  states. Our analysis included three steps. We first conducted a bivariate  analysis to determine whether the following four factors correspond to  violations of the LCR for 2013 to 2014: (1) size of the population served;  (2) water source (groundwater or surface water); (3) ownership (public or  private); and (4) whether the system is a community water system or non- transient, non-community water system. We also included the factor of  whether sample results exceeded the lead action level. We then  developed a series of multivariate logistic regression models. Specifically,  multivariate logistic regression modeling is statistical method for analyzing  the potential influence of each individual factor on the likelihood of a  binary outcome (e.g., a violation) while simultaneously accounting for the  potential influence of the other factors. We selected this type of model  because it could account for the factors simultaneously. Lastly, to test  whether our models could be used to identify systems with a higher  likelihood of a future violation, we compared the values generated by our  models to actual violations reported in the SDWIS/Fed data in 2015 to  2016. We provide a technical description of the statistical analysis we  conducted, including determinations about the reliability of the data and  the limitations of the analysis, in appendix V.", "Literature review. We reviewed studies concerning detection of lead in  drinking water and violation of drinking water regulations. These studies  were identified through searches by GAO research librarians for peer- reviewed materials in such databases as ProQuest, Scopus, Academic  One-File, and Web of Science. Librarians conducted searches using such  terms and phrases as lead and copper, water supply, drinking water, lead  exposure and lead poisoning alone and in combination with one another.  We also identified and reviewed relevant publications by trade groups,  think tanks, and other nongovernmental organization. We narrowed a  preliminary selection of results by reviewing abstracts and introductions,  where applicable. Based on that preliminary review, we determined that  31 sources fit within the scope of our engagement objectives. We then  reviewed the data and key findings of each of these 31 sources to  formulate and refine some hypotheses concerning violations of the LCR  and detection of lead in drinking water. The hypotheses were reviewed by  a GAO technical expert to ensure that they were sufficiently supported by  the cited corresponding research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Analysis of Available EPA Data on Reported Sample Results, Violations, and Enforcement for the Lead and Copper Rule", "paragraphs": ["Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from July 1, 2011, to  December 31, 2016, can provide information on compliance by water  systems and enforcement by states and EPA regarding the Lead and  Copper Rule (LCR). This appendix provides additional information from  our analysis of what the EPA data in the agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water  Information System (SDWIS/Fed) show about compliance with and  enforcement of the LCR. The LCR requires water systems to monitor  drinking water at customer taps, and if lead levels are elevated, take  additional actions to control corrosion, inform the public, and in some  circumstances replace lead service lines under the systems\u2019 control.  States generally have primary responsibility for monitoring and  enforcement of Safe Drinking Water Act requirements, including the  LCR.

In addition, a 2017  EPA Office of Inspector General report indicated that sample data,  specifically, are potentially underreported. In addition, some state  regulators with whom we interviewed in 2016 told us that homeowners  and water systems may take LCR samples improperly as we discuss in  this report.

The LCR requires water systems to identify locations where lead  may be present and periodically obtain tap water samples from those  locations (of which single-family homes are the highest priority). When a  water system\u2019s 90th percentile sample result for lead exceeds 15 parts  per billion, the system has exceeded the federal action level (also known  as an action level exceedance). Sample results that exceed the lead  action level do not by themselves constitute violations of the LCR.", "Under the LCR, an action level exceedance requires the water system  and state to take additional steps. Those additional steps require that  small and medium water systems install or modify corrosion control  treatment and water systems of all sizes provide information (known as  public education) about the harmful effects of lead to consumers and  vulnerable populations (such as schools if the water system serves a  school and public health departments). Water systems are also required  to test and, if necessary, treat the source water. If, after installing  corrosion control and treating source water, a system continues to have  90th percentile sample results that exceed the lead action level, the LCR  requires the water system to begin replacing its lead service lines, if they  exist.", "As part of our analysis, we grouped the 29 factors into seven broad  groups: (1) water system characteristics, (2) water system operations, (3)  characteristics of water, (4) sample procedures required to comply with  the LCR, (5) actions that states take to ensure water systems comply with  the LCR, (6) actions that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can  take to assist with compliance, and (7) features of the LCR regulation.

To identify the factors most frequently  identified by the state regulators as contributing to noncompliance, we  focused on those factors that were mentioned by regulators in at least 13  of the 41 states participating in the discussion groups (30 percent). Table  12 provides a description of each factor, the definition we used for our  analysis and the number of states in which officials mentioned the factor.", "State regulators who participated in the discussion groups explained how  each of these factors may contribute to noncompliance. In most  instances, regulators also described what they observed as relationships  between factors and how, together, multiple factors could contribute to  noncompliance.", "Size. Regulators in 37 states said that the size of the population  served by water systems may influence noncompliance with the LCR.  Regulators in 28 of the 37 states said that small systems (serving  populations of 3,300 and fewer) are more likely to have drinking water  sample results that exceed the federal action level, to be in  noncompliance, or face challenges that may lead to noncompliance.  Most of these regulators mentioned the size of a system and the  technical, managerial, or financial capacity of the system as factors  that, together, may influence noncompliance. For example,  regulators in 10 states said that small systems are more likely to  receive a violation because they are generally less likely to have  operators with the knowledge to properly collect samples (sample  collection) or manage corrosion control treatment (technical capacity)  or have the financial resources to pay for corrosion control treatment  or to hire professional help to do so (financial capacity). A regulator  from 1 state provided an example of a small water system in  noncompliance because it has a part-time operator with little training  on the rule and with other professional responsibilities, such as snow  removal and animal control, which prevent this operator from  providing drinking water test results to homeowners whose water was  tested within the required timeframe.", "Technical capacity. Regulators in 33 states said that the technical  capacity of water systems may influence noncompliance with the  LCR. Regulators in 18 of the 33 states said that water systems that do  not have personnel with the knowledge to adequately operate a  system or who understand the LCR are less likely to have the skill set  to interpret and implement the LCR appropriately.", "Sample collection. Regulators in 28 states said if systems fail to  collect drinking water samples, improperly collect samples, or have  other problems with collecting samples they may be out of compliance  with the LCR. For example, regulators in 9 of these 28 states said that  some water systems struggle to find enough homeowners willing to  collect water samples for testing and regulators in 3 states said that  this may cause the systems to collect samples from taps that are not  used for drinking water, contrary to the LCR. In addition, regulators in  14 states said that even when systems are able to find homeowners  willing to collect drinking water samples, the homeowners themselves  may collect the samples improperly. A regulator from 1 state provided  an example of a homeowner who was out of town for the weekend  and upon return collected a water sample from tap water that sat  stagnant for 4 days, which is problematic because the sample taken  should be representative of everyday use. Sample results that exceed  the lead action level do not by themselves constitute violations of the  LCR.", "Financial capacity. Regulators in 28 states said that water systems  that do not have sufficient financial resources will experience  challenges complying with the LCR, including paying for chemicals  and professional help needed to install corrosion control treatment.  For example, a regulator in 1 state said that a system without  adequate financial resources may not be able to pay for the required,  and often costly, corrosion control study.", "Presence of lead. Regulators in 23 states said that the presence of  lead in the pipes may influence noncompliance with the LCR.  Regulators in 9 of the 23 states said that the presence of lead in pipes  increases the likelihood that drinking water samples will exceed the  federal action level; and require a system to perform additional  actions. Regulators in 11 of the 23 states specifically said that a water  system with old infrastructure is more likely have lead service lines.  Regulators in 9 states identified the presence of lead service lines and  managerial capacity as factors that may work together. These  regulators said that water systems that maintain good records of the  materials in their distribution systems know about the presence of  lead service lines and may be better able to collect drinking water  samples from the appropriate locations.", "Managerial capacity. Regulators in 24 states said that the  managerial capacity of water systems may influence noncompliance  with the LCR. Regulators in 16 of the 24 states said that water  systems that do not have effective management structures and  practices will have problems keeping up with the rule requirements  and deadlines. Regulators in 6 states explained that proper data and  records management help systems comply with the LCR.", "Water chemistry. Regulators in 23 states said that the chemistry of  the water may influence noncompliance with the LCR. Regulators in  20 of the 23 states said that having corrosive water increases the  likelihood of samples that exceed the action level\u2014which is not a  violation\u2014and will require a system to perform additional actions. For  example, if these systems do not install corrosion control or manage it  properly\u2014for example, because the operator does not understand  water chemistry\u2014the system will get a violation, according to  regulators in 6 states.", "Corrosion control. Regulators in 16 states said that the corrosion  control may influence noncompliance with the LCR. Specifically,  regulators in 15 of the 16 states said that water systems that have  installed corrosion control treatment are more likely to be in  compliance with the LCR because corrosion control is the primary  method used to prevent lead from entering drinking water. A regulator  from 1 state said that despite the corrosive water that exists in that  state, water systems are not getting samples that exceed the action  level and are staying in compliance because they have corrosion  control installed. Regulators also discussed how the size of the  system and corrosion control, together, can influence compliance.  Regulators in 5 states said that large water systems are generally in  compliance with the LCR because the rule requires them to install  corrosion control treatment.", "Type. Regulators in 18 states said that the type of water system may  influence noncompliance with the LCR. Regulators in 14 of the 18  states said schools and daycare facilities with their own water  supplies experience challenges in complying with the LCR, and  regulators in 6 states explained that it is because their primary  mission is not water delivery and management. A regulator in 1 state  said that they had a school submit improper samples because school  officials collected samples after the summer break during which the  faucets had not been used for 6 weeks, thus not being representative  of normal drinking water use. Sample results that exceed the lead  action level do not by themselves constitute violations of the LCR.", "Source. Regulators in 14 states said that the source of drinking water  may influence noncompliance and offered a range of opinions as to  how corrosive or non-corrosive groundwater may influence actions.  State regulators frequently discussed source water, water chemistry,  and corrosion control as factors that presented themselves together.  State regulators in 4 states said that systems using ground water can  more easily comply with the LCR because ground water is non- corrosive compared to surface water. In contrast, regulators in 4  states said that the ground water in other parts of the country is more  corrosive. However, regulators in 5 states said that systems with  corrosive water sources are still able to comply when they properly  install and manage corrosion control treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Regulators Identified Additional Factors That May Influence Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["State regulators who participated in our discussion groups identified  additional factors that may contribute to water systems\u2019 noncompliance  with the LCR, though less frequently. These regulators cited factors such  as compliance with multiple drinking water rules, the number of samples  that systems are required to collect under the LCR, and the complexity of  the LCR. Table 13 describes each factor less frequently mentioned as  contributing to noncompliance, the definition of the factor, and the number  of states in which officials mentioned the factor. Some of these factors are  more specific attributes that may impact of some the 10 factors that were  most frequently identified by state regulators. For example, regulators told  us about several aspects of water (age, stability, and flow) that may  impact water chemistry.", "The regulators participating in our discussion groups provided examples  of these less frequently mentioned factors, below:", "Simultaneous compliance. Regulators in nine states said that  systems that have to simultaneously comply with multiple drinking  water regulations can lead to noncompliance with the LCR and  regulators in three of the nine states explained that this is because  changes to water treatment to address one problem can create  additional problems. For example, regulators in five states said that  systems that have to comply with a rule aimed at reducing drinking  water exposure to disinfection byproducts may require a reduction in  the pH level of their water, and this, in turn, may affect the  effectiveness of their control corrosion treatment. Much like other  factors, this causes samples results to exceed the federal action level  which subjects the water system to additional rule requirements.", "Lead and Copper Rule. Regulators in seven states said that aspects  of the LCR may influence noncompliance. Regulators in two of the  seven states said that the LCR does not require states to routinely  approve material surveys or for systems to update these surveys  periodically, which can prevent water systems from knowing if they  are collecting samples from high-risk sites. In addition, regulators in  four states said that the LCR allows too much time for systems to  complete requirements, such as the installation of corrosion control  treatment and the issuance of public education notices to consumers.  For example, a regulator in one state provided an example of a  system that started the process of installing corrosion control.  However, the system stopped the treatment installment because, as  allowed by the LCR, the system sampled the water again and did not  exceed the action level. Regulators in three of the states also said that  the LCR does not allow state regulators to invalidate samples that  they know were taken using poor practices at the sample site.,", "EPA guidance. Regulators in seven states said that EPA\u2019s guidance  may contribute to noncompliance, and according to regulators in four  states, this is because the guidance may not be clear which may  cause states and water systems to incorrectly implement the LCR. For  example, regulators in three states said that EPA guidance on sample  procedures and public education was confusing for states and water  systems because it is not clear about the timeframes that systems  should adhere to when repeating the collection of water samples or  providing public education to ensure that they conduct these actions  properly and in accordance with the LCR.", "Regulators also identified several additional factors that could lead to  noncompliance or to 90th percentile sample results over the action level  and thus additional requirements for water systems to implement, which  could increase the chances of a violation. For example, regulators  mentioned that the ownership of a water system could be a factor and  provided the example of privately-owned, small water systems with less  knowledgeable or available operators. Regulators also said that the age  of the water can interfere with corrosion control and that some systems  buying treated water are not doing any treatment themselves. Finally,  regulators in two states said that water systems that are geographically  isolated may not be able to access alternative water sources if their  existing source water is corrosive or to attract operators with the skills to  implement the LCR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators in 12 States Identified Operator Engagement, State Assistance and Local Support as Factors Helping Water Systems Comply with the LCR", "paragraphs": ["Regulators in 12 states specifically identified factors that they thought  helped water systems comply with the LCR (see table 14). Regulators in  7 states said that assistance from the states helps water systems comply  with the LCR by providing systems with information about the  requirements of the rule, training or technical assistance including using  state rural water associations. Regulators in 4 different states said that  the engagement of the water system with the state regulatory office\u2014for  example, through training\u2014places the system in a better position to  implement the LCR because they are gaining an understanding of the  requirements.

This allowed us to delete some factors and  incorporate them into other factors under which we determined they could  reasonably fit. For example, we determined that \u201cwater chemistry\u201d and  \u201cwater corrosivity\u201d were too closely related to be separate factors, so we  combined them. Our goal was to develop a list of complete, distinct and  mutually exclusive factors based on the information that participants  shared in the discussion groups.", "We took additional steps to ensure that we identified significant factors by  conducting a word frequency count in all of the discussion group  transcripts using a content analysis software package.

For the purposes of  analysis, we defined an individual comment to be a statement made by a  single individual. Across the eight discussion groups, there were a total of  225 such comments. Some comments were brief and covered a single  issue while others were extensive and covered multiple issues. The  analysts applied multiple classifications if statements covered a range of  factors. For example, a statement made by a specific drinking water  regulator could have been classified as relating to the source of the water  and the size of the system. The analysts only coded statements made in  response to the moderators\u2019 questions. The analysts did not code  statements that did not discuss factors or directly answer the moderators\u2019  questions. After independently coding the transcripts, we used software to  run an intercoder reliability report. The two analysts met on three  occasions to compare and discuss the coding results.

For example, in Ohio, nearly all non-transient, non-community  water systems used ground water as their primary source water, which  made it difficult to disentangle the unique effects of community water  systems from those of ground water systems. Therefore, we collapsed  non-community water systems using groundwater and non-community  water systems not using ground water into a single group for analysis. In  Texas, the relationship between the likelihood of a violation and size of  the population served shifted as the number of people served by a  system reached 3,300.

In Ohio, water systems were less likely to violate the  LCR as their size increased. In Texas, water systems were less likely to  violate the LCR as the size of their population increased to 3,300 but  were more likely to violate the LCR as the size of the population over  3,300 increased.

These three other factors were also  associated with the likelihood of a violation in some of our models, but the  direction, magnitude and the significance of these associations were not  consistent This could be the result of strong associations among the  factors, which would make it difficult for the models to precisely estimate  their association with violations. Because this imprecision, we do not  report the associations between these three factors and the likelihood of a  violation.

They did not  include other factors that might be important to predicting violations, such  as the treatment technique used by a drinking water system; the  presence of lead pipes in a community; or the technical, financial, and  managerial capacity of a drinking water system. Second, our models were  limited to the two states for which we could obtain reasonable assurances  of data reliability, and therefore, the results are not generalizable to other  states. While we found some commonalities in the factors that may  contribute to violations between the states, we also found several  differences between them, suggesting that specific factors may influence  violations differently in different states. Finally, while we took several  steps to confirm that the data for these states were sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of developing illustrative regression models to predict  violations, we cannot be confident that the inaccuracies and  incompleteness that we and EPA identified in June 2011 have been  addressed nationwide. Reliable and sufficient data for additional states  would increase the external validity of future analysis. Additionally, data  for additional explanatory variables mentioned in the literature and by  state regulators\uf8e7such as the presence of lead service lines and the  technical, financial, and managerial capacity of a system\uf8e7would allow for  a more fully specified model with the potential to increase the explanatory  power of those models. Taken together, reliable data for a broader  sample and a fuller range of explanatory variables could potentially  improve the usefulness of models predicting LCR violations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: EPA Guidance to the Public on Addressing Lead in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides information on its  website for the public on lead hazards in drinking water.
