The Council's actions to carry out its responsibilities include documenting requirements for the size and composition of the nuclear weapons stockpile and setting stockpile priorities. The Council also provides oversight of refurbishment programs through periodic program reviews and coordinates budget matters between DOD and NNSA to support the stockpile. However, the Council faces several challenges in carrying out its responsibilities. The Council's challenges include carrying out several new budget-related responsibilities, such as certifying to Congress whether the annual budget request for NNSA meets stockpile requirements; providing oversight for two more refurbishment programs than it has previously; and adjusting program priorities in response to budget pressures, such as delays and cost growth experienced by some NNSA nuclear weapons programs.", "The Council's actions to coordinate DOD's and NNSA's nuclear weapons stockpile responsibilities are generally consistent with most key practices for interagency collaboration, but the Council's actions are not fully consistent with those practices and related key considerations in two areas. First, key practices for interagency collaboration call for agencies to define their respective roles, responsibilities, and steps for decision making and to have a current written agreement on how they will collaborate. The Council does not have an up-to-date agreement that reflects the processes it uses to carry out its responsibilities. The 1997 memorandum of agreement between DOD and the Department of Energy (DOE) that is to guide the Council's efforts has not been updated, although the Council's responsibilities were expanded in 2013, and it does not define the roles, responsibilities, structure, and functions of the two support committees that conduct the Council's day-to-day operations. Council officials said they have not updated the agreement because they do not believe it is necessary and that doing so could restrict their flexibility by being too prescriptive. However, other officials said there has been confusion and disagreement over some Council processes such as certifying the budget request for NNSA and that updating the memorandum of agreement might improve the clarity and consistency of the Council's processes. Without an updated memorandum of agreement that describes Council processes, it may be difficult for the Council to provide greater clarity to support committee members on how their work is to be conducted. Second, a key consideration when implementing collaborative mechanisms is whether all relevant participants have been included in the effort. However, DOD and NNSA budget and program evaluation officials are not required to attend Council support committee meetings. DOD budget and program evaluation officials are invited and generally attend, but NNSA budget and program evaluation officials generally do not attend because they are invited at the discretion of NNSA support committee members. Without a requirement that both DOD and NNSA budget and program evaluation officials consistently attend all support committee meetings, the Council may be limited in its ability to manage and respond to unanticipated budget questions as they arise at meetings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD and DOE update the Council's 1997 memorandum of agreement to (1) describe Council processes and its two support committees' roles, responsibilities, structure, and functions and (2) require that DOD and NNSA budget and program evaluation officials attend all support committee meetings.

The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy  (DOE)\u2014through its National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014 share joint responsibility for managing aspects of the U.S. nuclear  weapons stockpile, which is composed of nuclear bombs and warheads.  DOD is generally responsible for establishing weapons requirements and  designing, producing, and operating the delivery systems for these  weapons. NNSA is generally responsible for developing nuclear weapons  technology and, in conjunction with DOD, maintaining and enhancing the  safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. DOD and  NNSA are currently undertaking an extensive, multifaceted effort to  modernize the nuclear enterprise, including delivery systems, the nuclear  weapons stockpile, and the research and production infrastructure that  supports the stockpile\u2014all of which are aging and being deployed beyond  their intended service lives.

The Council facilitates cooperation and coordination between DOD and  NNSA on nuclear weapons stockpile issues, reaches consensus on those  issues, and establishes priorities between DOD and NNSA to align their  efforts as they carry out their responsibilities for managing the U.S.  nuclear weapons stockpile.", "The Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear  Security Enterprise (hereafter referred to as the Congressional Advisory  Panel) reported in November 2014 that the Council has a central role to  play in creating an executable plan for the future nuclear weapons  stockpile. However, in recent years, questions have been raised about  the Council\u2019s effectiveness in carrying out its assigned role and  responsibilities. The House Armed Services Committee in particular has  noted that the Council has considered and approved a series of actions,  programs, and plans for the future of the U.S. nuclear weapons program  that have been affected by DOE\u2019s resource constraints and differing  priorities. In addition, the Congressional Advisory Panel reported in  November 2014 that the Council has struggled to set priorities, define the  nuclear enterprise\u2019s needs, and identify resources to support those  needs.", "The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a  provision that we assess the Council\u2019s role, responsibilities, and  effectiveness.

To determine how the Council carries out its statutory and  regulatory responsibilities and identify any challenges it faces in doing so,  we reviewed DOD, NNSA, and Council documents related to those  responsibilities, such as Council reports and decision memorandums, and  we interviewed DOD and NNSA officials. Specifically, we identified the  Council\u2019s statutory and regulatory responsibilities and asked Council staff  to respond to specific questions on a subset of those responsibilities  about the process and guidance used in carrying out each responsibility;  any resulting output and the recipient or recipients of that output; and any  challenges or limitations in carrying out the responsibility. We selected the  subset of responsibilities to ask the Council staff about based on whether  a responsibility was related to management of the nuclear weapons  stockpile or nuclear weapons refurbishment.  We corroborated the  Council staff\u2019s responses by reviewing documentation, such as Council  reports and decision memorandums.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Council\u2019s actions are consistent with  key practices for interagency collaboration, we reviewed documents that  described Council processes, including DOD\u2019s unofficial Nuclear Matters  Handbook and the Council\u2019s Procedural Guideline for the Phase 6.X  Process. We also reviewed a nonprobability sample of four programs  and activities in which the Council plays a role for use as examples of  Council processes in action. We selected our nonprobability sample by  first identifying the programs and activities in which the Council plays a  role and then grouping those programs and activities into three  categories: (1) weapon programs; (2) infrastructure-related activities; and  (3) other activities related to the Council\u2019s statutory responsibilities. We  then selected four programs and activities from those categories to  provide a cross section of the types of programs and activities the Council  oversees. Specifically, we selected the B61-12 life-extension program;  the W76-1 life-extension program; the plutonium strategy; and budget- related activities, such as the Council\u2019s certification of the annual budget  request for NNSA. We limited our review of each example we selected to  its latest decision cycle, to ensure that we focused on recent  implementation of Council processes. For each program or activity we  selected, we reviewed documentation of the Council\u2019s actions, such as  program briefings, decision memorandums, meeting minutes, and reports  and letters. We reviewed each selected program or activity in terms of the  processes the Council used to provide oversight of the program or  activity; we did not review the selected programs and activities  themselves. We compared the information we obtained from our review of  the Council\u2019s processes and their implementation against key practices  for implementing effective interagency collaboration that we identified in  October 2005. We also compared the information we obtained from our  review against key considerations when implementing collaborative  mechanisms that we identified in September 2012. We corroborated our  comparisons in interviews with DOD and NNSA officials.

The structure, membership, and  responsibilities of the Council are generally found in section 179 of Title  10, U.S. Code. A 1997 memorandum of agreement between DOD and  DOE identified several activities for the Council to perform in support of its  statutory responsibilities, including establishing support committees;  providing guidance to the support committees; and reviewing and acting  on recommendations on the nuclear weapons stockpile from the support  committees. The memorandum also states that the Council will  establish, and modify as necessary, its own procedures.", "The membership of the Council is established by statute. The Council  designates the voting members of its support committees, which include a  senior executive-level Standing and Safety Committee and a subordinate,  working-level Action Officers Group. The Council and its support  committees also include nonvoting participants\u2014referred to as observers  and technical advisors\u2014who attend meetings to provide their particular  expertise. For example, representatives from the NNSA laboratories  attend as technical advisors, and representatives from the Navy\u2019s  Strategic Systems Programs office may attend as observers. Figure 1  shows the membership of the Council and its support committees as of  March 2015, based on the unofficial Nuclear Matters Handbook and  information provided by the Council staff.", "According to DOD\u2019s unofficial Nuclear Matters Handbook and Council  staff, the Council conducts day-to-day operations and coordinates issues  through its hierarchy of support committees. The Action Officers Group  performs detailed analyses of issues and provides those analyses to the  Standing and Safety Committee, which reviews them and formulates  decision packages for final Council review and decision. An issue may be  sent to a lower-level committee if a higher-level committee determines  that further review and analysis are needed. Issues move to the next  higher or lower committee based on a consensus decision of the  members. Figure 2 illustrates the decision-making process of the Council  and its support committees, as described by the unofficial Nuclear  Matters Handbook and DOD and NNSA officials.", "According to DOD\u2019s unofficial Nuclear Matters Handbook and Council  staff, the frequency and timing of Council and support committee  meetings are intended to support this decision-making process. In  general, the Action Officers Group meets about twice a month. The  Standing and Safety Committee meets about once a month, after an  Action Officers Group meeting, so that it can receive results from the  Action Officers Group meetings. Likewise, the full Council also meets  about once a month, after the Standing and Safety Committee meeting,  so that the Council can receive the results from the Standing and Safety  Committee.", "A key function of the Council is to provide oversight of the refurbishment  of nuclear weapons. In 2000, the Council developed a standard  process\u2014called the Phase 6.X process\u2014which provides a joint  framework for refurbishing nuclear weapons in order to extend their  operational lives. The Phase 6.X process includes various program  review and decision points that require Council approval before moving  forward to the next phase. For example, the Procedural Guideline for the  Phase 6.X Process requires the program office to obtain the Council\u2019s  approval before beginning a feasibility study, development engineering, or  full-scale production phases.", "In October 2005, we identified key practices that can help enhance and  sustain collaboration among federal agencies. Among the practices we  identified were (1) defining and articulating a common outcome; (2)  establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; (3) identifying and  addressing needs by leveraging resources; (4) developing mechanisms to  monitor, evaluate, and report on results; (5) reinforcing agency  accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports;  (6) establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries; and (7) agreeing on roles and  responsibilities. In September 2012, we found that although collaborative  mechanisms differed in complexity and scope, they all benefited from  certain key practices, many of which we had identified in October 2005.  Accordingly, in our 2012 report, we built on our past work and identified  key issues to consider when implementing collaborative mechanisms.  Among the key considerations we identified were whether the  participating agencies documented their agreement regarding how they  will be collaborating; whether participating agencies developed ways to  continually update or monitor written agreements; and whether all  relevant participants had been included."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Council Carries Out Its Responsibilities in a Number of Ways but Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Council carries out its statutory and regulatory responsibilities in a  number of ways, including by developing requirements documents on the  size and composition of the nuclear weapons stockpile, providing  oversight of nuclear weapons refurbishment programs, and coordinating  budget matters to support the stockpile.

The  Council\u2019s actions include stockpile management (i.e., developing  requirements documents on the size and composition of the nuclear  weapons stockpile), providing oversight of weapons refurbishment  programs, and coordinating budget matters to support the stockpile. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 gave the Council  several new budget-related responsibilities, such as certifying to  Congress whether the annual budget request for NNSA meets stockpile  program requirements, and approving programming and budget matters  pertaining to nuclear weapons programs between DOD and DOE. Table  1 shows some of the Council\u2019s statutory responsibilities and the actions it  takes to carry out each of them, according to information and  documentation provided by the Council staff.", "In addition to these responsibilities, the Council is to assess the NNSA  Stockpile Stewardship Management Plan and determine whether the plan  supports the requirements of the National Security Strategy or the most  recent Quadrennial Defense Review and the Nuclear Posture Review.   According to DOD\u2019s unofficial Nuclear Matters Handbook, the Council  also is to coordinate the annual Joint Surety Report\u2014which assesses  nuclear weapon safety and security\u2014and send the report to the  Secretaries of Defense and Energy for signature.

According to DOD and NNSA officials,  these additional responsibilities require a significant amount of the  Council\u2019s time and reduce the time it has to focus on carrying out its  traditional stockpile responsibilities. In addition, DOD and NNSA officials  told us that requirements for implementing some of these new  responsibilities are not clear. For example, the DOD officials we spoke  with expressed confusion over what might constitute \u201ccertification\u201d of the  budget request for NNSA. The Council has met this annual responsibility  with a letter to the Senate and House Appropriations and Armed Services  Committees, as well as the President of the Senate and Speaker of the  House, explaining that the budget request for NNSA includes risks that  could increase if funding is reduced or if savings from NNSA initiatives  are not achieved. Though the Council has new budget-related  responsibilities, officials told us that while the Council can coordinate  across DOD and NNSA to revise plans and programs in response to  changes in budgets, funding, or cost estimates, it cannot direct the work  of DOD or NNSA and has no budget-development or formal approval  authority. For example, officials stated that while the Council is  responsible for certification of the budget request for NNSA, it does not  have the authority to direct changes to either DOD or NNSA\u2019s work or  formally approve their budgets.", "Another challenge the Council faces is planning and providing oversight  for more nuclear weapon refurbishment programs than it has in the past.  For example, in 2008, the Council provided oversight for two  refurbishment programs. As of November 2014, the Council is providing  oversight for four such programs and is planning for three additional  programs for different types of interoperable warheads. As a result,  according to Council staff, the Council\u2019s oversight role has increased and  it is challenged in working to adjust program priorities to align with  available resources.", "Finally, the Council has adjusted program priorities for the nuclear  weapons enterprise in response to budget pressures. For example, under  funding limitations resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011, as  amended, DOD estimates reductions in planned defense spending from  fiscal years 2012 through 2021 will exceed $1 trillion. NNSA has  similarly projected reductions in the level of spending it had planned for  the 5-year future years nuclear security program. Also, some NNSA  nuclear weapon programs have experienced delays and cost growth  during the past 5 years. For example, the cost estimate for one life  extension program has more than doubled since 2010. According to  NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Management Plan for Fiscal Year 2015  and DOD and NNSA officials, due to these increased costs and budget  constraints, the Council has needed to adjust program priorities for the  nuclear weapons enterprise by, for example, extending the date when the  first units will be produced for four programs. Further, the Council has  faced emerging issues\u2014such as the increased scope of one  refurbishment program\u2014that necessitated additional funding and  therefore an assessment of and decision on how such a change may  affect the long-term baseline plan.

According to these considerations, agencies that articulate  their agreements in formal documents can strengthen their commitment  to working collaboratively, and such written agreements are most  effective when they are regularly updated and monitored.", "The Council does not have an up-to-date written agreement or other  written guidance that reflects the general processes and procedures it  uses to carry out its responsibilities. DOD and DOE signed a 1997  memorandum of agreement to guide the Council\u2019s efforts. However, this  agreement has not been updated in almost 18 years, during which time  the Council\u2019s responsibilities have expanded\u2014particularly on budget- related issues\u2014and the fiscal environment in which the Council operates  has changed.

Some officials told us that, as a result, the processes  that the Council and its support committees follow can vary depending on  the preferences of officials in key positions and can change when the  officials holding those positions change. For example, DOD and NNSA  officials said that the frequency and regularity of Action Officers Group  meetings has varied depending on who was serving as the Executive  Secretary of the Standing and Safety Committee. Nor is such information  set out in other formal documents, with the exception of the Council\u2019s  process for overseeing nuclear weapon refurbishment programs, which is  documented in the Procedural Guideline for the Phase 6.X Process.

The Council began an effort to update that document in  2011, and that effort is ongoing as of March 2015.", "According to DOD and NNSA officials, the Council has not updated the  1997 memorandum of agreement or developed other formal guidance to  reflect the processes it will use to carry out its responsibilities, because  some officials do not believe it is necessary and want to preserve the  Council\u2019s flexibility in how it carries out its responsibilities by minimizing  written guidance. However, the Council could formally document its  general processes and procedures and still preserve some flexibility in  how it carries out its responsibilities. Some officials said that it could be  beneficial to update the memorandum of agreement to institutionalize the  processes the Council and its support committees will use to carry out the  Council\u2019s responsibilities because doing so might improve the clarity and  consistency of those processes regardless of who holds key positions in  the Council and its support committees.", "According to our prior work on key considerations when implementing  collaborative mechanisms, the action of two agencies articulating roles  and responsibilities into a written document can be a powerful tool for  collaboration, and doing so can codify a clear understanding of those  roles and responsibilities.

For example, officials  told us that there has been confusion over the process and means the  Council should use to \u201ccertify\u201d the budget request for NNSA and  disagreement over when and what budget information should be made  available to the Council for that purpose. According to key considerations,  clarity can come from agencies working together to define and agree on  their respective roles, responsibilities, and steps for decision making.  Documenting processes in this case would require DOD and NNSA to  first work together to come to agreement on what certification means,  what data should be assessed, and when that data should be provided to  the Council, and then to codify that agreement in writing.", "Similar documentation has been created for groups within DOD that,  while not interagency groups, share a structure analogous to the  Council\u2019s that involves collaboration among members drawn from across  different entities.

It also provides guidance  establishing two subgroups and identifying their membership,  responsibilities, and procedures. The guidance indicates that issues and  recommendations are to be coordinated in the subgroups before they are  presented to the board.

The DOD and NNSA budget and program evaluation  offices are relevant to the Council\u2019s efforts in light of the Council\u2019s new  budget-related responsibilities and the programmatic and fiscal  challenges it must take into account in setting priorities for the nuclear  weapons stockpile. However, these offices are not required to  consistently and routinely attend the meetings of the Council\u2019s Standing  and Safety Committee and its Action Officers Group.

However, if  representatives from both DOD\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s budget and program  evaluation offices do not consistently and routinely attend all Standing  and Safety Committee and Action Officers Group meetings, opportunities  to enlist their expertise may be lost if unanticipated budget issues arise  during meetings. For example, some DOD and NNSA officials told us that  it would be helpful to have budget and program evaluation officials  consistently attend and bring their perspective to support committee  meetings because many issues, in their view, ultimately come down to  cost and how to arrange priorities given budget constraints.", "In light of current fiscal constraints, growing refurbishment costs, and the  Council\u2019s new budget-related responsibilities, the Council\u2019s support  committees are dealing with budget and affordability issues more than  they have in the past. Without requiring the consistent and routine  participation of budget and program evaluation officials to provide their  expertise, the attendance of these officials is left to the discretion of the  inviting members, and the Council\u2019s support committees may be limited in  their ability to deal with budget and cost questions as they arise,  particularly when the issues on the agenda do not appear to be directly  budget-related. Also, the Council may be limited in its ability to carry out  its new budget-related responsibilities if DOD and NNSA budget and  program evaluation officials are not required to attend all meetings of the  Standing and Safety Committee and the Action Officers Group. Moreover,  requiring those officials\u2019 attendance would better position the Council to  address the recommendations of the Congressional Advisory Panel on  the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise, including aligning the  planning, resourcing, and execution of sustainment and modernization  programs for nuclear weapons and their supporting infrastructure with  DOD\u2019s delivery platforms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Council\u2019s important role as the focal point for interagency activities is  becoming more challenging as the nuclear weapons stockpile, delivery  systems, and infrastructure all age, while budgets remain constrained.  The Council has taken steps to coordinate programs across DOD and  DOE, but its actions are not fully consistent with some key practices and  considerations for interagency collaboration. Employing these key  practices would be an important step in improving DOD and NNSA  collaboration on the Council. For example, updating the 18-year old  memorandum of agreement to describe the general processes of the  Council and, in particular, the roles, responsibilities, structure, and  functions of its support committees\u2014without being overly prescriptive\u2014 would better position DOD and NNSA\u2019s collaborative efforts by providing  greater clarity on how the Council\u2019s work is to be conducted, especially  for the Council\u2019s new budget-related responsibilities. Also, requiring the  consistent and routine attendance of both DOD and NNSA budget and  program evaluation officials in all Standing and Safety Committee and  Action Officers Group meetings would better position DOD and NNSA to  consider how to carry out the Council\u2019s newer, budget-related  responsibilities, which are likely to grow in importance as the Council  begins providing oversight for more refurbishment programs and  continues to adjust priorities at a time when budgets are expected to  remain flat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance collaboration between DOD and NNSA, we recommend that  the Secretaries of Defense and Energy update the 1997 memorandum of  agreement for the Council, and, as part of this update, take the following  two actions: describe the roles, responsibilities, structure, and functions of the  Council\u2019s two support committees, how the Council and these groups  are to work together, and the general processes and time frames the  Council and its support committees should follow to carry out statutory  responsibilities and  include a requirement that budget and program evaluation officials  from both DOD and NNSA will consistently and routinely attend all  meetings of the Council\u2019s two support committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and NNSA for their review and  comment. In written comments, DOD generally agreed with both of our  recommendations but offered an alternative method of implementation.   NNSA agreed with both our recommendations and said it would work  collaboratively with the Council and DOD to update the memorandum of  agreement and, as part of this effort, ensure appropriate guidance is  issued to document requirements for the Council\u2019s two support  committees and for participation of budget and evaluation officials in  support committee meetings. DOD\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s written comments are  reproduced in appendixes IV and V, respectively. DOD also provided  technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. NNSA did not  provide technical comments.", "For our first recommendation, DOD agreed to update the 1997  memorandum of agreement for the Council. In its comments, DOD  proposed that once the memorandum of agreement was updated and  fully coordinated with all members of the Council, the Council Chairman  would issue a letter to the Council members documenting the roles and  responsibilities, structure, and functions of the Council\u2019s support  committees. DOD believed that this approach was more appropriate than  including that information in the high-level agreement between the  Secretaries of Defense and Energy. According to DOD\u2019s written  comments, this approach would preserve the Council\u2019s ability to quickly  respond to changing needs without the delay and inherent challenges of  renegotiating an interagency memorandum of agreement. We believe that  this is a reasonable approach and meets the intent of our  recommendation to institutionalize the roles, responsibilities, structure,  and functions of the Council\u2019s two support committees\u2014the Standing and  Safety Committee and the Action Officers Group\u2014in a formal document.", "For our second recommendation, DOD stated that the letter from the  Council Chairman that would be developed to address our first  recommendation would require that budget and program evaluation  officials from both DOD and NNSA consistently and routinely attend  meetings of the Council and its support committees. Such a requirement  would meet the intent of our recommendation by ensuring that the  expertise of budget and program evaluation officials would be available at  all Standing and Safety Committee and Action Officers Group meetings.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and  Administrator of NNSA.

To address  these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, agreements, and guidance  and interviewed officials from the Council; the Department of Defense  (DOD); the Department of Energy (DOE), including the National Nuclear  Security Administration (NNSA); and the Office of Management and  Budget. We also reviewed the November 2014 final report of the  Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security  Enterprise.", "To determine how the Council carries out its statutory and regulatory  responsibilities and identify any challenges it faces in doing so, we  reviewed DOD, NNSA, and Council documents related to those  responsibilities, such as Council reports and decision memorandums, and  we interviewed DOD and NNSA officials. Specifically, we identified the  Council\u2019s statutory and regulatory responsibilities and asked Council staff  to respond to specific questions on a subset of those responsibilities. We  selected the subset of responsibilities to ask the Council staff about  based on whether a responsibility was related to management of the  nuclear weapons stockpile or nuclear weapons refurbishment. For each  responsibility in our subset, we asked the Council staff about the process  and guidance used in carrying out the responsibility; any resulting output  and the recipient or recipients of that output; and any challenges or  limitations in carrying out the responsibility. We corroborated the Council  staff\u2019s responses by reviewing documentation, such as Council reports  and decision memorandums.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Council\u2019s actions are consistent with  key practices for interagency collaboration, we reviewed documents that  described Council processes, including the 1997 memorandum of  agreement between DOD and DOE; DOD\u2019s unofficial Nuclear Matters  Handbook; and the Council\u2019s Procedural Guideline for the Phase 6.X  Process and interviewed DOD and NNSA officials about the Council\u2019s  structure and processes. We also reviewed a nonprobability sample of  four programs and activities in which the Council plays a role, for use as  examples of Council processes in action. We selected our nonprobability  sample by first identifying the programs and activities in which the Council  plays a role and then grouping those programs and activities into three  categories: (1) weapon programs; (2) infrastructure-related activities; and  (3) other activities related to the Council\u2019s statutory responsibilities. We  then selected four programs and activities from those categories to  provide a cross-section of the types of programs and activities the Council  oversees. Specifically, we selected the B61-12 life-extension program;  the W76-1 life-extension program; the plutonium strategy; and budget- related activities, such as the Council\u2019s certification of the annual budget  request for NNSA and its adjustments to its long-term baseline plan for  the nuclear weapons enterprise in response to the budget effect of  emerging issues on the W88 Alteration 370 program. We limited our  review of each example we selected to its latest decision cycle, to ensure  that we focused on recent implementation of Council processes. For  each program or activity we selected, we reviewed documentation of the  Council\u2019s actions, such as program briefings, decision memorandums,  meeting minutes, and reports and letters. We reviewed each selected  program or activity in terms of the processes the Council used to provide  oversight of the program or activity; we did not review the selected  programs and activities themselves. We compared the information we  obtained from our review of the Council\u2019s processes and their  implementation against key practices for implementing effective  interagency collaboration that we identified in October 2005. We also  compared the information we obtained from our review against key  considerations when implementing collaborative mechanisms that we  identified in September 2012.
