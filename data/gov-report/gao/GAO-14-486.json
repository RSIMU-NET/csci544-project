These  management controls are vital to ensuring that DOD can effectively and  efficiently manage an undertaking with the size, complexity, and  significance of its business systems modernization, and minimize the  associated risks. Furthermore, we also recently reported that, in order to  better identify and address potential duplication, DOD needed to develop  supporting component architectures, align them with its corporate  architecture to complete the federated BEA, and leverage its federated  architecture to avoid investments that provide similar, but duplicative,  functionality in support of common DOD activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Addressed Most Provisions of the Act, but Needs to Continue Improving Its Investment Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made progress in addressing the provisions of the NDAA and  recommendations that we have made in recent years.

With  respect to aligning the Integrated Business Framework with the budget  process, officials stated that specific plans take time and coordination to  develop and implement. These officials noted that these efforts are  affected by the ongoing shift of responsibilities for business systems from  the Office of the DCMO to the DOD CIO. Notwithstanding the uncertainty  associated with this transition, until the department takes further steps to  align its business system investment review and budgeting processes, it  risks allocating resources to business system investments that might be  used more efficiently or effectively elsewhere across the department.

These officials added  that some systems may be important for the business environment  regardless of their relatively small dollar value. In addition, these officials  stated that the Integrated Business Framework calls for reviewing  systems as part of system portfolios, not as individual systems.

However, DCMO officials  found that 13 of the 15 selected had issues with their BEA compliance  assertions. Specifically, DCMO officials stated that they found that 9 of  the 13 had inconsistencies in the organizational execution plan or had  significantly incomplete compliance assertions in DOD\u2019s BEA Compliance  System, and 4 of the 15 were assessed as having other opportunities for  improvements. According to DOD officials, some of these concerns were  addressed prior to system certification. They further stated that no  systems were denied funding certification due to incomplete BEA  compliance assertions because the Office of the DCMO worked with the  components to address the issues to the satisfaction of the DBC prior to  certification. Where additional action was needed, action items were  created and DCMO is tracking the progress of these systems\u2019 efforts to  become compliant.", "The Office of the DCMO\u2019s validations of selected assessments are  important for helping to ensure that BEA assessments are accurate.  However, as demonstrated by these results, DOD needs to continue  working to ensure the quality of BEA assessments, as we have previously  recommended. Continued improvement in the BEA assessments will help  ensure that programs are being defined and implemented in a way that  facilitates interoperability and avoids duplication and overlap, which are  both goals of the BEA and the related investment management approach.", "According to DOD officials, in fiscal year 2014, nearly 100 percent of  certified and approved defense business systems asserted that business  process reengineering had been completed. Further, the Office of the  DCMO also validated a sample of assessments associated with these  systems. According to DOD\u2019s March 2014 report, this validation effort  showed that assertions were incomplete. Specifically, the DCMO selected  12 investments for validation, and the results of this effort were as follows:", "Four systems received a \u201cpositive\u201d rating, indicating that appropriate  business process reengineering was conducted.", "Four systems received a \u201cpositive with recommendations\u201d rating,  indicating that sufficient business process reengineering was  conducted but more could be done to improve the effort. DOD  recommended that the precertification authorities for these systems  ensure that appropriate business process reengineering compliance is  again assessed at the next milestone. For example, one system, the  Learning Management System, received a recommendation to  consider creating expected business outcomes, such as providing  career roadmaps to guide financial management employees in  planning and progressing in a DOD career. Further, another system,  the Next Generation Resource Management System did not provide  evidence of a change management plan, or documentation of the  resolution of the root causes identified in its \u201cto-be\u201d process models.", "Four systems received a \u201ccould not validate\u201d rating, indicating that the  business process reengineering assessment team was not able to  determine that a sufficient business process reengineering  assessment had been conducted. In these cases, DOD  recommended that the precertification authority ensure business  process reengineering assessment compliance is assessed at the  next acquisition milestone. For example, according to DOD officials,  the systems could not be validated because insufficient objective  evidence had been provided to substantiate their business process  reengineering assertions. According to the Office of the DCMO, three  of these four systems were in operations and maintenance, and it is  not often cost-effective to conduct business process reengineering  compliance reviews on investments in operations and maintenance.", "The need for improvement demonstrated by some of DCMO\u2019s selected  validations is consistent with our previous findings. Specifically, in May  2013 we reported on business process reengineering assertions of four  case study systems. All four assertions generally followed DOD\u2019s  business process reengineering guidance; however, we also found that  limited documentation of root cause analyses was provided for all four.  We have previously made recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s business  process reengineering-related efforts, including recommendations aimed  at the four systems we assessed in 2013.", "The Office of the DCMO\u2019s validations of selected systems\u2019 business  process reengineering assessments are important for helping to ensure  that sufficient business process reengineering is conducted.

For example, the act requires the BEA to include specific  information about data standards, policies and procedures, and  performance measures. In addition, the department seeks to use the BEA  to help guide, constrain, and enable interoperable business systems.  Moreover, we have previously emphasized that the BEA can be an  important tool for reducing potential overlap and duplication among DOD  business systems.", "As we reported in May 2013, the current version of the BEA\u2014Version  10.0\u2014 includes information aimed at meeting the act\u2019s requirements,  such as data standards; business rules to help ensure compliance with  the laws, regulations, and policies incorporated in the BEA; and  performance measures associated with the department\u2019s Strategic  Management Plan. However, as of April 2014, this version was still  missing other important content associated with achieving the  department\u2019s goal of using the BEA to guide, constrain, and enable  interoperable business systems. For example, the BEA was missing  information about business systems associated with each of the  architecture\u2019s business activities, and its business activities have not  been defined at a level that allows for more effective identification of  potential duplication and overlap. Adding such content is important for  various reasons, including improving the department\u2019s ability to use the  architecture as a tool for managing its business systems investments by  more effectively identifying areas of potential duplication and overlap.", "In addition, DOD has not yet demonstrated that the BEA has produced  business value for the department. According to the Director of  Investment Acquisition and Management and the Chief Architect,  previous versions of the BEA were designed to meet the requirements of  the act, but were not clearly focused on achieving business outcomes.  However, the act defines specific business outcomes that the BEA is  intended to support, such as integrating budget, accounting, and program  information and systems, and the department has defined additional BEA  goals, such as using the BEA to guide, constrain, and enable  interoperable business systems. These officials stated that in the future  they plan to use the BEA as a tool to better support interoperability, data  sharing, and reducing duplication. To help achieve this goal, according to  officials from the Office of the DCMO, DOD has established a process for  defining changes to the BEA that are intended to better support the  department\u2019s ability to achieve business outcomes, and they first used  this process for defining updates to BEA 10.0. More specifically, the  Office of the DCMO established a BEA configuration control board\u2014 composed of representatives from the military departments and other  departmental offices\u2014to make recommendations to the DBC on BEA  requirements and related content changes. Such a process may help the  department as it refines the architecture and seeks to achieve business  outcomes.", "Further, while DOD has established a tool that can assist in identifying  potential duplication and overlap among business systems even with the  current gaps in BEA content, the department has not demonstrated that it  has used this information to reduce duplication and overlap. The April  2013 investment management guidance and a January 2013  memorandum issued by the DCMO established a single BEA compliance  tool\u2014the BEA Compliance System\u2014to document system-level BEA  compliance assertions and required all business systems submitted for  certification and approval for fiscal year 2014 to use this tool.", "Officials from the Office of the DCMO stated that the results of BEA  compliance assessments conducted as part of the business system  certification and review process are available to staff across DOD to  review in making determinations about potential overlap and duplication.  For example, information provided by the department showed that, as of  February 2014, 120 systems performed activities associated with  maintaining asset information, 110 systems performed activities  associated with managing military health services, and 73 systems  performed activities associated with receiving and accepting a purchase  request. Officials from the Army and the Air Force stated that in fiscal  year 2014 they have begun to identify systems using BEA data that were  potentially duplicative. According to these officials, both the Army and the  Air Force have taken initial steps to phase out potentially duplicative  systems. However, the department has yet to demonstrate that it has  terminated these or other potentially duplicative programs that were  identified by using the BEA.", "Officials from the Office of the DCMO offered several reasons why the  BEA compliance process has yet to result in the elimination of potentially  duplicative systems. For example, officials stated that it is difficult for the  DBC to make such determinations because information presented to the  council is high level and only points to potential instances of overlap and  duplication, which would require additional research. Instead, these  officials said, precertification authorities at the component level are in the  best position to determine whether their systems are duplicative of other  systems. However, these precertification authorities are not required to  identify and assess potential overlap and duplication before asserting  compliance with the BEA. In addition, the BEA continues to lack important  content, such as additional information about business activities, that  would further assist in identifying potential duplication and overlap among  business systems. Continued improvements to DOD\u2019s BEA\u2014as we have  previously recommended\u2014and calling for more proactive identification  of potential overlap and duplication using information available in existing  tools can help the department use its BEA to identify and address  potential overlap and duplication among its billions of dollars in annual  defense business system investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enterprise Transition Plan Content Has Been Improved and Is Consistent with Portfolio- Based Investment Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["The act calls for the development of an ETP that implements the BEA and  covers all defense business systems and includes a listing of the  (1) new systems that are expected to be needed to complete the target  defense business systems computing environment, along with each  system\u2019s performance measures, financial resource needs, and  risks or challenges to integration into the BEA;  (2) legacy systems that will be phased out of the defense business  systems computing environment within 3 years, together with the  schedule for terminating those legacy systems; and  (3) existing systems that are part of the target defense business systems  computing environment, as well as a strategy for making the  modifications to those systems that will be needed to ensure that such  systems comply with the defense BEA, including time-phased milestones,  performance measures, and financial resource needs.", "The department\u2019s fiscal year 2014 ETP, which was issued in December  2013 and uses data as of October 1, 2013, includes information about  1,179 covered defense business systems, including 79 legacy systems,  or those that will be terminated within 36 months.

However, the department also stated  that our recommendation implies that it has not ensured that reviews  occur at an appropriate level. DOD noted that pre-certification authorities  are required to review the entire portfolio of investments before they are  presented to the DBC. The department added that these reviews enable  decision making, to include resourcing decisions at an organizational  level, which allows the DBC to focus on enterprise-level business issues  facing DOD. DOD also stated that, for fiscal year 2015, pre-certification  authorities will report the results of their review to the DBC, rather than  simply presenting their portfolio for certification.", "We acknowledge that DOD\u2019s guidance calls for reviews of investment  portfolios at multiple organizational levels, and our recommendation is not  intended to imply otherwise. Rather, its intent is to help ensure that DOD  establishes guidance and criteria for ensuring that detailed reviews of  individual systems occur at the appropriate levels within the department.  As described in this report, such an approach may involve establishing  investment review boards at multiple organizational levels. Such a tiered  review board approach would allow the DBC\u2014acting at the executive- level IRB for the department\u2014to focus its attention on more costly,  complex, or risky systems, while delegating detailed reviews of other  systems to lower organizational levels. By not using such an approach,  the department may not be able to ensure that the quality of the  information submitted for review is sufficient, and the associated  investment reviews may not be adequate for identifying and addressing  important issues associated with large-scale and costly systems.
