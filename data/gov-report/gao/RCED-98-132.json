The act provided for a three-phase program. Phase I is intended to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research idea. Work in phase II further develops the idea, taking into consideration such things as the idea\u2019s commercialization potential. Phase III generally involves the use of nonfederal funds for the commercial application of a technology or non-SBIR federal funds for continued R&D under government contracts.", "The Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 reauthorized the SBIR program through fiscal year 2000. The act emphasized the program\u2019s goal of increasing the private sector\u2019s commercialization of technologies and provided for further incremental increases in SBIR funding up to not less than 2.5 percent of agencies\u2019 extramural R&D budgets by fiscal year 1997. Moreover, the act directed SBA to modify its policy directive to reflect an increase in funding for eligible small businesses, that is, businesses with 500 or fewer employees. The funding was increased from $50,000 to $100,000 for phase I and from $500,000 to $750,000 for phase II, with adjustments once every 5 years for inflation and changes in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Appears That Agencies Are Adhering to Statutory Funding Requirements; However, the Definition of Extramural R&D on Which the Funding Levels Are Based May Not Be Consistently Applied", "paragraphs": ["The agencies\u2019 SBIR officials reported that they have adhered to the act\u2019s requirements that they not use SBIR funds to pay for the administrative costs of the program, such as salaries and expenses for support services used in processing awards.

For example, DOD reported that its laboratories and field organizations do not have the necessary funds to provide personnel to act as mentors to their SBIR contractors or engage in activities that could possibly increase the program\u2019s success in phase III. Similarly, NIH, NASA, and NSF have also reported problems in providing outreach for current and potential SBIR participants because of this funding restriction. According to NSF\u2019s SBIR official, this funding restriction has resulted in NSF\u2019s inability to provide SBIR participants with much-needed training in business skills. DOE has reported experiencing administrative problems that are attributed to cuts in the Department\u2019s administrative budget. DOE\u2019s SBIR officials reported that further cuts, without the lifting of the restrictions on the use of SBIR funds, would diminish their ability to complete award selections in a more timely fashion, respond to the needs of the program\u2019s constituents, and ensure that high-quality research is being performed.", "Although program officials believe that their agencies are adhering to statutory funding levels, some expressed concern because they feel that agencies are using different interpretations of the \u201cextramural budget\u201d definition. This may lead to incorrect calculations of their extramural research budgets. For example, according to DOD\u2019s SBIR program manager, all eight of DOD\u2019s participating military departments and defense agencies that make up DOD\u2019s SBIR program have differing views on what each considers an extramural activity and on the appropriate method for tracking extramural R&D obligations.

NSF\u2019s audit, which was performed by its Office of Inspector General (OIG), concluded that NSF was overestimating the size of its extramural R&D budget by including unallowable costs, such as ones for education, training, and overhead. NSF estimated that these unallowable costs totaled over $100 million. The OIG audit report concluded that the SBIR portion of NSF\u2019s extramural budget should be reduced by approximately $2.5 million. The OIG audit report further concluded that by excluding these \u201cunallowables,\u201d NSF will reduce the funds available for the SBIR program by approximately $13 million over a 5-year period. These funds could then be used for other purposes that further NSF\u2019s objectives.", "Likewise, NASA has completed a survey of fiscal year 1995 budget data and is currently reviewing fiscal year 1996 data at its various field centers.

Furthermore, NIH believes that having three funding cycles in each year has had a beneficial effect on applicants.", "While the effects of the review processes and funding cycles on the recipients\u2019 financial status and ability to commercialize projects were not specifically mentioned as problems, SBIR officials did state that some recipients had said that any interruption in funding awards, for whatever reason, affects them negatively. One SBIR program manager who did think that these were problems, stated that at DOD, most award recipients often have no way of paying their research teams during such a funding gap. As a result, ongoing research may be delayed, and the \u201ctime-to-market\u201d\u2014that is the length of time from the point when research is completed to the point when the results of the research are commercialized\u2014may be severely impaired, thus limiting a company\u2019s commercial potential. The DOD official said that time-to-market is of paramount importance in most high-tech industries\u2014so much so, that a new product that reaches the market a year late may be partly or mostly obsolete.", "Most of the participating SBIR agencies have established special programs and/or processes in an effort to mitigate any adverse effect(s) caused by funding gaps. One such effort is the Fast Track Program, employed at DOD, whereby phase I award recipients who are able to attract third-party funding are given the highest priority in the processing of phase II awards. At DOE and NIH, phase I award recipients are allowed to submit phase II applications prior to the completion of phase I. NASA has also taken steps to lessen any adverse impact on small businesses while applications are being processed. For example, NASA has established an electronic SBIR management system to reduce the total processing time for awards and is currently exploring the possibility of instituting a fast-track program similar to DOD\u2019s. Unlike the other participating federal agencies, NSF has not established any programs or procedures to mitigate the possible impacts of funding gaps on its SBIR participants. The reason for this, according to NSF, is that the agency\u2019s experience has been that phase I awardees, when given the choice, request more time to submit phase II applications, thus effectively increasing the funding gap by their own choosing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Phase III Participation Rates Continue at Previously Reported Levels, While Agencies\u2019 Commercialization Techniques Vary", "paragraphs": ["The third phase of SBIR projects is expected to result in commercialization or a continuation of the project\u2019s R&D. During this phase, additional federal funds or private-sector funds may be included, but additional SBIR funds may not be included. In 1991, we surveyed 2,090 phase II awards that had been made from 1984 through 1987. Our survey received responses on 1,457 awards\u2014a response rate of 77 percent\u2014and included questions that covered phase III activity. In 1996, DOD conducted its own survey, which closely followed our format, and also gathered information on phase III activity. DOD provides almost half of the total federal funding for SBIR, which amounted to over $500 million in fiscal year 1997. DOD\u2019s survey included all 2,828 of DOD\u2019s SBIR projects that received a phase II award from 1984 through 1992. DOD received 1,364 responses to this survey, for a response rate of 48 percent. SBA currently has a survey under way that also follows our format and will similarly cover phase III activity. This survey will include all projects that received a phase II award through 1993 and will cover all of the 10 SBIR agencies except DOD. Because of the SBA survey, we did not conduct our own; however, we did additional analyses of our 1991 survey information. We also performed our own analysis of DOD\u2019s survey data, which we obtained from the contractor.", "While analyzing the response data from our 1991 survey, we found that approximately half of the phase II awards were followed by phase III activity (e.g., sales or additional funding), while the other half had no phase III activity. (See table 2.) Overall, 515 respondents, or 35 percent, indicated that their projects had resulted in the sales of products or processes, while 691, or 47 percent, had received additional developmental funding. Out of total sales of $471 million that award recipients attributed to SBIR projects, most of that amount came from nonfederal customers\u201435 percent went to the federal government, while 64 percent was nonfederal. In the case of additional developmental funding, the ratios were somewhat consistent, since most of the funding, once again, came from nonfederal sources (76.5 percent) and the rest came from the federal government (23.6 percent).", "Our analysis of DOD\u2019s 1996 survey responses showed that phase III activity was occurring at rates similar to those in our survey. Our analysis of these responses showed that 653 projects, or 48 percent, reported that they were active in phase III at the time of DOD\u2019s survey, while the other half did not report any phase III activity. The respondents indicated that 442 awards, or 32 percent, had resulted in actual sales, while 588 reported that the awards had resulted in additional developmental funding. DOD\u2019s sales data broke down differently from the data in our survey results. The sales reported to DOD split almost evenly into federal (52.8 percent) and nonfederal (47.2 percent) customers. The sources of additional developmental funding were also about an even split between federal (48.8 percent) and nonfederal (51.2 percent) customers.", "Agencies are currently using various techniques to foster commercialization, although there is little or no empirical evidence suggesting how successful the particular techniques have been. For example, in an attempt to get those companies with the greatest potential for commercial success to the marketplace sooner, DOD has instituted a Fast Track Program, whereby companies that are able to attract outside commitments/capital for their research during phase I are given higher priority in receiving a phase II award. According to DOD\u2019s SBIR program manager, getting a product with commercial potential quickly to the marketplace is critical if the company is to be successful. The Fast Track Program not only helps speed these companies along this path but also helps them attract outside capital early and on better terms by allowing the companies to leverage SBIR funds. In 1996, for example, DOD\u2019s Fast Track participants were able to attract $25 million in outside investment. Companies that qualify for an award under the Fast Track Program can be granted a phase II contract without any interruption in funding.", "Additionally, DOD, in conjunction with NSF and SBA, sponsors three national SBIR conferences annually. These conferences introduce small businesses to SBIR and assist SBIR participants in the preparation of SBIR proposals, business planning, strategic partnering, market research, the protection of intellectual property, and other skills needed for the successful development and commercialization of SBIR technologies.", "DOE has employed a different technique aimed at increasing the commercial potential of SBIR participants. DOE\u2019s Commercialization Assistance Program provides phase II award recipients with individualized assistance in preparing business plans and developing presentation materials to potential partners or investors. This program culminates in a Commercialization Opportunity Forum, which helps link SBIR phase II award recipients with potential partners and investors.", "Although NSF\u2019s efforts to foster commercialization are limited in scope, the agency provides (1) its phase I award recipients with in-depth training on how to market to government agencies and (2) its phase I and II award recipients with instructional guides on how to commercialize their research. Similarly, NASA assists its SBIR participants through numerous workshops and forums that provide companies with information on how to expand their business. NASA also provides opportunities for SBIR companies to showcase their technologies to larger governmental and commercial audiences. For example, SBIR companies are encouraged to participate in NASA\u2019s American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conferences, Tech 200X annual shows, Space Technology and Applications International Forum, and Oshkosh Fly In. Moreover, NASA has established an SBIR homepage on the Internet to help promote its SBIR technologies and SBIR firms and has utilized several of its publications as a way for SBIR companies to make their technologies known to broader audiences.", "Unlike the other SBIR agency participants, NIH does not promote any particular techniques to foster commercialization.

In addition, the recipient of the most SBIR awards in each cycle was the same throughout all of the cycles.", "We compared the commercialization rates, as well as the rates at which projects received additional developmental funding, for the multiple-award recipients with those of the non-multiple-award recipients.
