For example, to implement a provision related to coordination, the Corps in September 2015 issued guidance emphasizing the importance of early coordination with other federal agencies to avoid delays later in the process. However, the Corps has not taken steps to address other provisions, such as one that calls for the Corps to establish a database to make publicly available information on the status of feasibility studies, citing resource constraints. The Corps does not have a plan to address these other provisions. A plan that includes resource estimates would better position the Corps to address the remaining acceleration provisions.", "The Corps regularly monitors feasibility studies and has conducted some reviews of its acceleration reforms, such as an analysis that found that some studies were too complex to complete within the agency's timing and cost requirements\u2014i.e., within 3 years and for less than $3 million. However, the Corps has not comprehensively evaluated the reforms' impacts. Corps officials and stakeholders expressed differing views on the reforms' impacts on the costs, time frames, and quality of feasibility studies. For example, many Corps officials GAO interviewed said the reforms' overall goals to reduce studies' cost and time frames were positive, but others raised concerns, such as that the $3 million cost limitation may not be realistic for different geographic areas. Corps officials said they have not conducted a comprehensive impact review in part because they are focused on monitoring ongoing studies. These officials said they see the value in conducting such a review as they complete more studies, but they have not developed a plan to do so. Developing an evaluation plan would help the Corps conduct a timely and effective review.", "The Corps has not maintained complete milestone data in its central data system for the 19 feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure). For example, 12 studies did not include data for one or more milestones. Corps officials said agency policy requires the entry of information on 10 key milestones in the agency's central data system. However, GAO found that the policy only explicitly requires that two of the key 10 milestones be entered into the agency's central data system. Without clarifying its policy to help ensure officials enter data on all milestones in the central data system, the Corps will not have complete data to efficiently monitor the progress of feasibility studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to the Department of Defense to direct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to (1) develop a plan with resource estimates to address the remaining WRRDA 2014 provisions, (2) develop a plan to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of the agency's acceleration reforms, and (3) clarify its policy to help ensure district officials enter data on required milestones for feasibility studies in its central data system.

This is due in part  to the length of time the Corps takes to complete feasibility studies, which  include analyses of the federal interest in as well as the costs, benefits,  and environmental impacts of the projects. Some feasibility studies have  taken more than a decade to complete. For example, a Corps feasibility  study reviewing the possible deepening of a navigation channel serving  ports in Texas and Louisiana was initiated in March 2000 and completed  in July 2011. In addition, a Corps feasibility study reviewing flood risk  management options for the Ala Wai canal watershed in Hawaii was  initiated in March 2001 and completed in December 2017.", "Recognizing the need to address lengthy time frames for its projects, the  Corps initiated changes in February 2012 aimed at improving and  streamlining feasibility studies, reducing their costs, and expediting their  completion. For example, the Corps established a policy that feasibility  studies are to be completed in less than 3 years, at a cost of not more  than $3 million, and with the ongoing involvement of all three  organizational levels of the Corps\u2014headquarters, divisions, and districts.  The Corps refers to this as the 3x3x3 rule. The Corps also instituted  changes in March 2012 in how it conducts risk management\u2014the  process of considering risks and taking steps to address those risks\u2014as  part of its feasibility study process. Specifically, Corps officials are to  consider the types of risks, as well as the likelihood and consequences of  those risks, when making decisions such as whether to conduct additional  analysis of a particular issue. A 2015 Corps document stated that  previously the Corps\u2019 senior leadership was involved at the end of a  feasibility study but since the 2012 changes is now involved early on to  understand risks and make related decisions.", "The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA  2014) was subsequently enacted and contains provisions related to,  among other things, accelerating the completion of, and improving public  transparency around, feasibility studies for which an environmental  impact statement (EIS) is conducted. For example, the Corps is required  to establish a database to make publicly available certain information on  the status and progress of its feasibility studies. WRRDA 2014 also  codified the Corps\u2019 3x3x3 rule. Given its own initiatives and the  provisions in WRRDA 2014, the Corps is engaged in a wide array of  reforms to the feasibility study process, which we refer to in this report as  acceleration reforms.", "The Corps collects information to manage its feasibility studies in its  central data system. In this system, the Corps maintains data on the  dates for key milestones, such as the date the Corps initiates the  feasibility study process.

This report examines the extent to  which the Corps has (1) addressed the WRRDA 2014 feasibility study  acceleration provisions, (2) reviewed the impact of its feasibility study  acceleration reforms, and (3) maintained complete milestone data for  feasibility studies in its central data system.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed the first 19 feasibility studies subject to  the WRRDA 2014 acceleration provisions. These include feasibility  studies that (1) were initiated after June 10, 2014, the date WRRDA 2014  was enacted, through August 15, 2018, and (2) for which an EIS is  prepared. We reviewed Corps guidance on the agency\u2019s process for  planning feasibility studies and other related documentation. We also  conducted an in-depth review of seven of these 19 feasibility studies. We  selected these seven feasibility studies because they represent different  types of water resources development projects, are at varying stages of  completion, and are geographically dispersed. The seven studies provide  illustrative examples but are not generalizable to all Corps\u2019 feasibility  studies subject to the WRRDA 2014 acceleration provisions. For each of  the seven studies, we reviewed project management plans and other  project documents, such as draft feasibility studies, if available. From  August 2018 through November 2018, we visited the Corps\u2019 four district  offices that led these seven studies to learn more about the status and  progress of each feasibility study and the Corps\u2019 coordination with other  federal agencies and nonfederal sponsors, among other things. We  interviewed Corps officials at the three divisions overseeing the districts  conducting the seven feasibility studies and representatives from  nonfederal sponsors for these studies. We also interviewed officials from  federal agencies, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the  National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).", "To examine the extent to which the Corps addressed the WRRDA 2014  feasibility study acceleration provisions, we reviewed the Corps\u2019  documentation related to the implementation of those provisions, such as  guidance and agency policies.

We interviewed Corps headquarters officials to learn  what, if any, (1) new policies were in place to help division and district  officials implement the reforms; and (2) review or analysis headquarters  officials had completed of the reforms\u2019 impacts on the cost, time frames,  or quality of feasibility studies. We compared this information with  guidance for program evaluation.", "To examine the extent to which the Corps has maintained complete  milestone data for feasibility studies in its central data system, we  reviewed the Corps\u2019 information on the status of the 19 feasibility studies  in our review. We also analyzed data from the Corps\u2019 central data system  on all feasibility studies with an EIS. We assessed the reliability of these  data by reviewing related documentation, conducting data testing for any  missing data, and interviewing knowledgeable Corps officials, among  other things. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of understanding which districts and divisions conducted  feasibility studies and for understanding the types of milestones that were  entered into the central data system. However, as discussed in this  report, we determined that the milestone data were not sufficiently reliable  for other purposes. We reviewed data for the 19 feasibility studies to  determine whether they conformed to the Corps\u2019 policy on what milestone  data should be in its data system.

The Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President, sets the strategic  direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall  supervision of functions relating to the Army\u2019s Civil Works Program. The  Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the  civil works and military missions. At the Corps level, the Civil Works  Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.;  eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices (see fig. 1).", "Corps headquarters primarily develops policies and guidance to  implement the agency\u2019s responsibilities and plans the direction of the  organization.

Feasibility studies  further investigate a water resources problem and make  recommendations on whether a project is in the federal interest, and if so,  how the problem should be addressed. Generally, the cost of a feasibility  study is shared between the Corps and a nonfederal sponsor, such as a  local port authority or a state agency.", "In 2012, the Corps began using a new approach to conducting feasibility  studies, referred to as SMART Planning. As part of this approach, Corps  officials are to use and document a risk-informed approach to decision- making. Specifically, Corps officials are to consider risks at each point in  the feasibility study process and balance the probability and  consequences associated with those risks with the time and costs needed  to avoid or mitigate risks through, for example, collecting additional data  or conducting additional analysis. By doing so, they are to conduct only  the additional analysis needed to make a decision at that point in the  process. At each step, Corps officials are to use an approach that  balances the level of detail, data collection, research, and associated  risks with what is necessary to deliver the feasibility study, and they are to  justify any additional work as the best course forward.", "The Corps\u2019 feasibility study process consists of four phases (scoping,  alternative evaluation and analysis, feasibility-level analysis, and Chief\u2019s  report) and a number of key milestones, such as identifying project  alternatives for further review (see fig. 3). The complete feasibility study  process is to take place within the statutory target time frame of less than  3 years (36 months). The Corps uses SMART Planning to help feasibility  studies meet the agency\u2019s 3x3x3 rule. Corps policy allows the Corps to  spend more money and take more time on an unusually complex  feasibility study if the district leading the study requests and receives an  exemption from headquarters or the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Civil Works. However, Corps policy indicates that such exemptions are  not routine and are to be granted only after careful consideration and  review by division and headquarters officials. In addition, WRRDA 2014,  as amended, provides that the Secretary of the Army may make an  exception by extending the timeline of a study if the Secretary determines  that the study is too complex to comply with the 3x3x3 rule. The Secretary  is not to extend the timeline for a feasibility study for a period of more  than 10 years, and any feasibility study that is not completed before that  date shall no longer be authorized. The act also requires the Secretary  to provide written notice to the Senate Committee on Environment and  Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure each time the Corps grants such an exception.", "The feasibility study process includes work the Corps undertakes to  satisfy requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  and other environmental statutes. Under NEPA, federal agencies are to  evaluate the potential effects of proposed projects on the environment.  When the Corps determines that a water resources development project  could have significant environmental effects, it must prepare an EIS.  The Corps issues a draft EIS as part of the overall draft feasibility report  for public and stakeholder review and issues a final EIS when it issues its  final feasibility report. Feasibility studies that require an EIS typically  represent larger and more complex studies than those that do not require  an EIS. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report,  Corps feasibility studies that are larger and more complex tend to require  additional funding and time when compared to less complex, smaller  studies. While the Corps does not publish information on the length of  time it takes to complete feasibility studies, our analysis of publicly  available data showed that the median time it took the Corps to complete  a feasibility study with an EIS was more than 7 years for those studies  completed from 2008 through 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Provisions for Accelerating Feasibility Studies", "paragraphs": ["WRRDA 2014 contains provisions related to, among other things,  accelerating the completion of feasibility studies for which an EIS is  prepared.

For example:  Issuance of a joint coordination guide. In September 2015, as a  result of the act and previous ongoing coordination efforts, the Corps,  NMFS, and FWS worked together to jointly issue a coordination guide  for conducting feasibility studies. The guide discusses the feasibility  study process in depth and emphasizes the importance of  substantive, early engagement among the three agencies to  successfully deliver projects and avoid delays later in the process that  may result from lingering disagreements among the agencies.", "Issuance of Corps guidance on WRRDA 2014 acceleration  provisions. In March 2018, the Corps issued guidance on how  officials should implement the WRRDA 2014 acceleration provisions  when conducting feasibility studies. This includes guidance on  implementing administrative changes such as deadlines for gathering  agency or public comments. It also includes guidance on coordination  within the agency as well as with other agencies and stakeholders,  such as nonfederal sponsors. For example, WRRDA 2014 provides  that the Corps is to make certain information available to other  agencies as early as practicable in the environmental review process.  The Corps\u2019 March 2018 guidance indicates that Corps officials are to  provide information on the (1) environmental and socioeconomic  resources located within the physical area associated with a feasibility  study, and (2) general locations of the different alternatives under  consideration. While the guidance was not issued for almost 4 years  after the enactment of WRRDA 2014, several Corps headquarters  and district officials said the Corps disseminated information on how  to implement the acceleration provisions to the districts in various  ways, such as through webinars and working with teams that had  initiated feasibility studies subject to the act\u2019s acceleration provisions.", "Many Corps headquarters, division, and district officials said that many of  the act\u2019s coordination and administration provisions are similar to long- standing practices they followed, based on requirements in other laws  such as NEPA. For example, according to many Corps headquarters,  division, and district officials, the WRRDA 2014 provision to develop a  coordinated environmental review process is generally consistent with  NEPA and its implementing regulations. According to a Corps  headquarters official, the WRRDA 2014 coordination provisions add  specificity to the Corps\u2019 existing practices by detailing which agencies to  involve in coordination efforts and when to involve them.", "The Corps also has taken steps to address one of the WRRDA 2014  provisions related to public transparency. Specifically, the Corps is to  annually prepare, and make publicly available, a list of feasibility studies  subject to the acceleration provisions that do not have adequate funding  to make substantial progress toward completion of the study. Corps  headquarters and district officials said that in the past the Corps funded  several hundred active feasibility studies at any given time. While this  allowed for many feasibility studies to remain active and make some  progress, it also made less funding available for individual feasibility  studies and slowed the progress of some studies, according to several  Corps officials. According to a February 2012 Corps policy memo, agency  leadership initiated a process to review all active feasibility studies to  determine which were the most viable for congressional funding. The  Corps re-scoped or deactivated the remainder of the feasibility studies.  Many Corps district and headquarters officials told us this allowed for  increased funding for and progress to be made on the feasibility studies  that remained active. As a result of the Corps\u2019 efforts, headquarters  officials said the number of active Corps feasibility studies decreased  from 653 in 2012 to 89 at the end of 2018. In addition, they said that  because active feasibility studies now have greater levels of funding, the  agency has not had to report any active feasibility studies that do not  have adequate funding.", "However, as of May 2019, the Corps has not addressed other WRRDA  2014 provisions related to public transparency and environmental review.  These include the following:", "Status and progress database. By June 2015, the Corps was to  establish and maintain an electronic database and, in coordination  with other federal and state agencies, issue reporting requirements to  make publicly available the status and progress regarding compliance  with applicable requirements of NEPA and other required approval or  action.", "Performance measurement. The Corps is to establish a program to  measure and report on progress made toward improving and  expediting the planning and environmental review process.", "Environmental review guidance. The Corps is to (1) prepare, in  consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality and other  federal agencies with jurisdiction over actions or resources that may  be impacted by a project, guidance documents that describe the  coordinated environmental review processes the Corps intends to use  to implement reforms for planning projects, and (2) issue guidance on  the use of programmatic approaches for the environmental review  process that carries out specified actions and meets specified  requirements.", "In other instances, the Corps has taken some initial steps but has not fully  addressed certain WRRDA 2014 provisions. Specifically, not later than  180 days after the act\u2019s enactment, the Corps was to survey the agency\u2019s  use of categorical exclusions in projects since 2005, publish a review of  that survey, and solicit requests from other federal agencies and project  sponsors for new categorical exclusions. By June 2015, the Corps was  to propose a new categorical exclusion if it identified a category of  activities that merited such action. As of May 2019, the Corps had  conducted an internal survey and solicited input through the Federal  Register on its procedures for implementing NEPA. However, Corps  headquarters officials said they had not published a review of its survey,  targeted requests for new categorical exclusions to other federal agencies  and nonfederal sponsors, or proposed new exclusions as merited.  Appendix II contains a more detailed summary of the WRRDA 2014  acceleration provisions, along with information on Corps actions to  address each provision.", "Corps headquarters officials identified resource constraints as the primary  reason for not addressing some public transparency and environmental  review provisions. For example, to develop environmental review  guidance, Corps headquarters officials told us that they would need to  conduct various steps, including drafting guidance, conducting  administrative review with other federal agencies, soliciting public  comment, and revising the guidance. Headquarters officials also said they  were involved in a similar effort with other federal agencies to develop  environmental review guidance in a publication called the 2015 Red  Book, an effort they characterized as labor intensive.", "In addition, to establish a database to publicly report on the status of its  feasibility studies, Corps headquarters officials said they would need to  stand up and maintain a website similar to the Federal Infrastructure  Permitting Dashboard for federal infrastructure projects. The Corps is  one of many agencies involved in the effort to create and maintain this  dashboard, and Corps headquarters officials said the effort was a  resource-intensive process. Corps headquarters officials said that while  they have not created the database required by WRRDA 2014, relevant  information is available through the agency\u2019s annual public reports on  active and recently completed feasibility studies\u2019 milestones and  schedules. Corps headquarters officials also said the status of feasibility  studies is often available on the Corps districts\u2019 websites. However, this  information is not easily accessible without knowing which district office is  responsible for a given feasibility study.", "While Corps officials identified resource constraints as the primary reason  for not addressing certain WRRDA 2014 provisions, they did not provide  specific estimates on the resources that the Corps would need to address  these provisions. In addition, the officials said they do not have a plan that  addresses how and when they intend to implement the provisions they  have yet to address. We have previously reported on leading practices for  sound planning and have found that implementation plans that include  resource estimates help ensure organizations achieve their goals and  objectives. Such a plan would better position the Corps to address the  remaining WRRDA 2014 provisions related to environmental review and  public transparency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Has Performed Some Review of Its Feasibility Study Acceleration Reforms but Has Not Conducted a Comprehensive Evaluation of Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The Corps monitors feasibility studies and has done some review of its  acceleration reforms but has not conducted a comprehensive evaluation  of the impacts of these reforms. In terms of monitoring, Corps policy  states that division and district leaders are responsible for monitoring  feasibility studies within their areas of responsibility. According to Corps  policy, districts are to prepare a quality control plan for each project to  ensure compliance with all technical and policy requirements, and  divisions are responsible for quality assurance by ensuring that districts  plan, design, and deliver quality projects on schedule and within budget.  Corps headquarters officials also said they monitor the progress of  feasibility studies during management meetings, during which they  discuss the cost and status of feasibility studies as well as the quality of  those studies; such meetings are largely led by Corps management or by  the Corps\u2019 Planning Advisory Board, which oversees the quality of  feasibility studies.", "In addition to monitoring individual feasibility studies, Corps headquarters  officials said they have conducted some broader reviews of how the  acceleration reforms are progressing. For example, they conducted a  trend analysis in October 2018 and again in April 2019 to identify the  reasons why some feasibility studies have received exceptions from the  timing and cost requirements of the 3x3x3 rule. These analyses, among  other things, identified that some studies were too complex to be  completed within 3 years or for less than $3 million, according to Corps  officials. Furthermore, based on their experiences with various reform  efforts, Corps officials said that they have been making real-time  enhancements. For example, based on input from the Corps\u2019 Planning  Advisory Board, Corps leadership has called for the agency to clarify its  updated approach to risk management, according to Corps officials.  These officials said each component within the Corps that is involved in  conducting feasibility studies is to issue internal guidance on its risk  management approach.", "However, Corps headquarters officials said the Corps has not conducted  a comprehensive evaluation of acceleration reforms to determine what  impacts the reforms have had and whether any modifications to those  reforms are needed. Corps and other agency officials and stakeholders  we interviewed differed in their views of the acceleration reforms\u2019 impacts  on the cost, time frames, and quality of feasibility studies:", "Cost and time frames for completing feasibility studies. Many  Corps officials said they agreed with the overall goals of reducing  costs and increasing the speed with which feasibility studies are  carried out. Some Corps headquarters and district officials said  SMART Planning and the 3x3x3 rule are changing the Corps\u2019 culture  around the amount of time and cost a feasibility study should take.  However, several Corps district and headquarters officials said some  Corps staff are experiencing difficulties with the cultural change  represented by SMART Planning and the 3x3x3 rule. For example, a  Corps district official said that in the past some Corps navigation  economists had one year to complete some modeling analyses for  feasibility studies, but they now are to complete such work in 90 days  due to the constraints of SMART Planning and the 3x3x3 rule, which  has been a difficult adjustment. In addition, many Corps headquarters,  division, and district officials raised concerns that the cost limitation of  $3 million may not be realistic given differences in cost across  geographic locations or the loss of spending value over time caused  by inflation.", "Quality of feasibility studies. Several Corps district officials we  interviewed said they like the Corps\u2019 new policy of involving other  agencies earlier in the process and with more frequency. They said  they believe this approach has improved coordination with other  agencies\u2014by, for example, inviting the other federal agencies to join  the Corps in a formal initiation meeting\u2014which can in turn improve the  overall quality of a feasibility study. However, some FWS and NMFS  officials said they would like to be more involved and have better  communication with the Corps than they currently do, such as  throughout the feasibility study process rather than just at the  beginning of a study and at the end when their formal review is  requested. Similarly, several Corps headquarters, district, and division  officials have commended the agency\u2019s new approach to risk  management and stated that they aim to provide partner agencies  with the information they need to conduct their work on the feasibility  study. However, many Corps, FWS, and NMFS officials and  nonfederal sponsors we interviewed said they were concerned that  this new approach might result in insufficient information for making  decisions, which could affect the quality of feasibility studies. For  example, for six of the seven studies that we reviewed, officials from  FWS and NMFS said it has become more difficult for them to provide  meaningful input on the feasibility study alternatives considered  because the Corps provides them with less detailed information than  in the past.", "Corps officials and other stakeholders we interviewed also expressed  concern about possible impacts of the 3x3x3 rule on the quality of  feasibility studies. For example, many Corps headquarters, division, and  district officials said that because the 3x3x3 rule puts constraints on costs  and time frames, if the scope of a feasibility study is not similarly reduced,  it can affect the study\u2019s quality. In addition, nonfederal sponsors for four of  the seven studies we examined expressed concerns with the 3x3x3 rule;  three of these four nonfederal sponsors said they believe that the Corps  is more focused on meeting the cost and schedule timelines than on the  needs or quality of the study.", "Senior Corps headquarters officials said they are confident that the cost  and duration of feasibility studies has decreased overall as a result of the  acceleration reforms but could not provide us with documentation to  support this observation. Specifically, officials said in March 2019 that  based on analysis they had recently conducted, most feasibility studies  are now being completed within 4 years and at a lower cost than  feasibility studies undertaken prior to implementation of the 3x3x3 rule.  While these results may not meet the 3x3x3 rule, officials said that these  feasibility studies were the first subject to the acceleration reforms and  may not depict the likelihood of future feasibility studies meeting the rule.  This is, in part, because Corps officials who are working on new feasibility  studies have the benefit of the past several years of experience working  with the SMART Planning process. Further, Corps officials said that they  do not have formal documentation summarizing how the acceleration  reforms have affected the quality of their feasibility studies overall, but  they monitor individual feasibility studies, as described earlier.", "According to Corps headquarters officials, the Corps has not conducted a  more comprehensive evaluation of the broader impacts of the  acceleration reforms because it has only completed a small number of  feasibility studies since 2012 under the acceleration reforms, and officials  are focused on monitoring their ongoing individual studies. These officials  said they see the value in conducting such an evaluation as they  complete more studies but that they have not developed formal plans to  do so.

In part to  assist district officials in conducting feasibility studies, Corps  headquarters officials created a template, which includes information on  nine of the 10 key milestones. In addition, a Corps district official said she  was unclear on the agency\u2019s expectations about which milestones to  enter into the central data system. Corps headquarters officials said they  contact district officials responsible for feasibility studies to obtain up-to- date information and ensure they understand the progress of each  feasibility study. While this may help to ensure accuracy and  completeness of milestone data on feasibility studies, several Corps  district officials said the process of responding to such data calls can be  time consuming and take them away from their core responsibilities.

These feasibility studies included those that (1) were initiated after  June 10, 2014, the date WRRDA 2014 was enacted, through August 15,  2018, and (2) for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is  prepared. We chose to review studies through August 15, 2018, because  after that date the Corps initiated several feasibility studies using funding  in a supplemental appropriation the Corps received in February 2018 to  conduct work in response to recent large hurricanes, and Corps officials  said they planned to use a somewhat different approach to conducting  these studies. For each study, we reviewed Corps guidance on the  agency\u2019s process for planning feasibility studies and other related  documentation. We examined information from the Corps on the progress  and status of the19 feasibility studies. We also reviewed information for  each feasibility study on the Corps\u2019 business line or program, the district  or division overseeing the study, and information on which studies had  received exceptions from the 3x3x3 rule.", "We also conducted a more in-depth review of seven of these 19 feasibility  studies. We selected these seven studies because they represent  different types of water resources development projects, were at varying  stages of completion, and are geographically dispersed. The seven  studies, and the Corps districts leading these studies, are:", "Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration (Galveston District);", "Houston Ship Channel Expansion Channel Improvement Project  (Galveston District);", "Matagorda Ship Channel (Galveston District);", "Gulf Intercoastal Waterway: Brazos River Floodgates and Colorado  River Locks Systems (Galveston District);", "Mississippi River Ship Channel, Gulf to Baton Rouge, Louisiana  General Reevaluation Report (New Orleans District);", "Sacramento River, General Reevaluation Report (Sacramento", "Port of Long Beach Deep Draft Navigation Improvements (Los  Angeles District).", "For each of these seven studies, we reviewed project management plans  and other project documents, such as draft feasibility studies, if available.  From August 2018 through November 2018, we visited the four district  offices that led these seven studies, including the Corps\u2019 Galveston, Los  Angeles, New Orleans, and Sacramento district offices. During these  visits, we discussed the status and progress of each of these feasibility  studies and the Corps\u2019 coordination with other federal agencies and  nonfederal sponsors, among other things. For each study, we interviewed  officials from nonfederal sponsors\u2014such as the state or local government  associated with individual studies\u2014and from federal partners\u2014including  the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries  Service (NMFS). We selected FWS and NMFS because of the important  role they play in reviewing environmental aspects of Corps feasibility  studies and their role in the 2015 joint publication on coordination. We  also interviewed Corps officials at the three divisions overseeing the  districts that conducted the feasibility studies we selected. This included  officials from the Corps\u2019 South Pacific, Mississippi Valley, and  Southwestern divisions. While the seven studies provide illustrative  examples, they are not generalizable to all of the Corps\u2019 feasibility studies  for which an EIS is prepared.", "We developed and used four standard sets of semi-structured interview  questions for the following groups: the (1) Corps district office officials  conducting the seven selected feasibility studies, (2) FWS and NMFS  officials working with the Corps on these studies, (3) Corps division  officials overseeing each study, and (4) nonfederal sponsors who worked  with the Corps on each study.", "To characterize the views of those we interviewed throughout the report,  we defined modifiers to quantify officials\u2019 views as follows:  \u201csome\u201d refers to responses from two to four Corps officials and/or  stakeholders;  \u201cseveral\u201d refers to responses from five to seven Corps officials and/or  stakeholders; and  \u201cmany\u201d refers to responses from eight or more Corps officials and/or  stakeholders.", "To examine the extent to which the Corps addressed the WRRDA 2014  feasibility study acceleration provisions, we compiled a list of the  provisions. We then reviewed the Corps\u2019 documentation related to the  implementation of these provisions, including agency guidance and  policies. We compared this information with the WRRDA 2014  acceleration provisions. To do this, we created categories for the  acceleration provisions and grouped the provisions by category.", "To examine the extent to which the Corps has reviewed the impact of its  acceleration reforms, we reviewed Corps policy, guidance, training, and  other documentation on implementation of those reforms. We use the  term acceleration reforms to refer to the requirements that new feasibility  studies are to be completed in less than 3 years and at a cost of not more  than $3 million, the Corps\u2019 risk management of feasibility studies through  its new SMART Planning process, and the WRRDA 2014 acceleration  provisions. We reviewed documentation from the Corps on the feasibility  studies that have received exceptions from the 3x3x3 rule. We  interviewed Corps headquarters officials to learn what, if any, (1) new  policies were in place to help division and district staff implement the  reforms; and (2) review or analysis headquarters officials had completed  of the impacts of the reforms on the cost, time frames, or quality of  feasibility studies. We also interviewed Corps districts and division  officials who were responsible for the seven studies about how the  acceleration reforms were working, as well as FWS and NMFS officials  and nonfederal sponsors about their views of the impacts of the new  processes on their work on these feasibility studies. We compared this  information with program evaluation guidance.", "To examine the extent to which the Corps has maintained complete  milestone data for feasibility studies in its central data system, we  obtained milestone data from the system for the 19 Corps feasibility  studies in our review. We analyzed the milestone data to determine which  milestone dates were in the system and then worked with Corps  headquarters officials to verify that information. We assessed the  reliability of these data by reviewing related documentation and  interviewing knowledgeable officials, among other things. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of understanding  which districts and divisions conducted feasibility studies and for  understanding the types of milestones that were entered into the central  data system. However, as discussed in this report, we determined that  the milestone data were not sufficiently reliable for other purposes. We  reviewed data for all feasibility studies in our review to determine whether  they conformed to Corps expectations on what milestone data should be  in the system.", "We estimated the median time it took the Corps to complete a feasibility  study for which an EIS was prepared. To do this, we obtained from the  Corps website the names of all feasibility studies completed with a Chief\u2019s  Report from July 2008 through June 2018 and the dates they were  completed. We verified with Corps headquarters officials that its list of  studies with a Chief\u2019s Report was current for that time frame. For each of  these feasibility studies, we then found the associated notice of intent to  complete an EIS as published in the Federal Register. While the date the  Corps filed a notice of intent to complete an EIS is not the initiation date  for the feasibility study, we used it as a proxy since Corps headquarters  officials said that, in the past, the notice of intent was filed soon after a  study was initiated. We calculated the time between the date the notice of  intent was filed and the date of the Chief\u2019s report to arrive at an estimate  of the amount of time the each feasibility study took to complete. We then  calculated the median time it took to complete these feasibility studies.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
