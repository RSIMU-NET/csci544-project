The HCTC equals 65 percent of the cost of qualified health coverage, which individuals can receive in advance--the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pays the credit to the qualifying health plan and the individual pays the remaining 35 percent--or by filing for the credit in their federal tax return. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the HCTC and examined, among other issues, how many individuals received it and factors influencing participation, and the type and cost of coverage they purchased. GAO obtained data from federal and state agencies and private health plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For 2003, 19,410 individuals received about $37 million in benefits from IRS for the HCTC for themselves and dependents, with 12,594 (65 percent) claiming the credit on their tax returns rather than receiving it in advance. As of July 2004, about 13,200 individuals were enrolled for the advance HCTC, the majority of whom were PBGC beneficiaries. The number receiving the HCTC remains a small portion of the workers and retirees initially identified as potentially eligible. For example, some potentially eligible individuals may have other health coverage that would disqualify them from receiving the HCTC. Several additional factors may have limited participation to date. First, the advance credit only became available beginning in August 2003. Second, the enrollment process is fragmented and complex and requires individuals to meet tax, labor, and health coverage criteria before they can become eligible. Third, eligible individuals must pay the entire premium for about 3 to 6 months while completing eligibility and enrollment requirements and until IRS's first payment is made on behalf of these individuals. Fourth, the health coverage may not be affordable both in terms of an individual's ability to pay the entire premium amount while waiting to receive the advance HCTC and the ability to pay the 35 percent share once payment starts. Individuals can purchase one of several types of qualifying coverage for the HCTC: the coverage they had through their previous employer or insurance coverage options designated by states (primarily high-risk pools or arrangements with insurers). More than half of recipients chose coverage from their previous employer for the advance HCTC and another 40 percent of advance HCTC recipients enrolled in state-designated coverage options, which were available in 35 states and the District of Columbia as of July 2004. The average monthly premiums (representing both the individual and federal shares) for individuals receiving the advance HCTC were $480 for TAA recipients and $661 for PBGC beneficiaries as of April 2004. The tax credit resulted in an average monthly individual share of $168 for TAA recipients and $231 for PBGC beneficiaries. The premiums paid by advance credit recipients varied widely depending on the coverage purchased, including the type of health plan and the number of individuals covered. The cost of HCTC coverage also was affected by the premium-setting practices of qualified health plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Reform Act of 2002 created a  health coverage tax credit (HCTC) for certain workers who are eligible to  receive income support benefits under the TAA program because their  jobs were lost due to foreign competition and for certain retirees whose  pensions from a former employer were terminated and are now paid by  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).1, 2 The HCTC equals   65 percent of the premium for qualified health coverage.

TAA recipients. These are individuals who lost their jobs due to  imports from or a shift in production to certain foreign countries. For  workers to be eligible for TAA, Labor must certify petitions, filed by or  on behalf of an employee group, indicating that the workers lost  employment as a result of foreign competition. Once Labor has  certified the petition, state workforce agencies determine individual  worker eligibility for TAA benefits. To be eligible for the HCTC, TAA- eligible workers must first be eligible for a trade readjustment  allowance, which extends income support after unemployment  insurance is exhausted, and as a condition of receiving this income  support must enroll in training to develop job skills for reemployment,  or must receive a waiver from training. Because the trade  readjustment allowance is not available to eligible workers until 60 or  more days after the employee group files a petition to receive TAA  certification from Labor, trade-affected workers cannot become  eligible for the HCTC until this time.  2.  Alternative trade adjustment assistance (ATAA) recipients.  Individuals who qualify for this assistance have lost their jobs as a  result of trade-related layoffs and found new jobs within 26 weeks at  lower pay and earn $50,000 or less in their new jobs. The ATAA  program, initiated in August 2003, provides certain workers who are  aged 50 and over and lacking transferable job skills with a wage  subsidy to help offset this salary reduction. Labor must certify that an  employee group lost employment as a result of foreign competition  and that ATAA applicants are included in this group. State workforce  agencies are responsible for determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for  ATAA benefits.  3.  PBGC beneficiaries. These individuals receive payments from PBGC  because their pension plan was terminated when their former  employer went bankrupt or experienced other severe financial  difficulties. To be eligible for the HCTC, PBGC beneficiaries must be  aged 55 or older and be either currently receiving benefits or have  received a lump sum payment from PBGC after August 5, 2002.

Each entity performed a discrete part of the eligibility  determination and enrollment process, without any single entity being  responsible for overall coordination. In four of the eight states we  reviewed, workforce officials reported that displaced workers seeking  help with the advance HCTC often had to make multiple calls to different  federal and state agencies.

In our  survey of state workforce agencies conducted in March 2004, 30 states  responded that TAA recipients had difficulty receiving the HCTC, and 17  of these 30 states reported that it took too long for eligible individuals to  receive the advance HCTC because of the way the enrollment process was  structured. The multiagency, multistep process for eligibility  determination and enrollment resulted in a significant gap between the  time individuals lost employment or their retirement plan was terminated  and the time they began receiving the advance HCTC. It typically took  from 4 to 6 months for newly displaced trade-affected workers to become  eligible for and receive the first advance payment. (See fig. 3.) For new  PBGC beneficiaries, the time required to become eligible for and receive  the first advance payment typically was 3 to 6 months.", "The elapsed time in becoming eligible and enrolling for the advance HCTC  also meant that in some instances individuals potentially eligible for the  HCTC were required to make certain decisions that would affect future  health coverage for themselves or their spouse before they knew whether  they would be eligible to receive the advance HCTC. For example, some  displaced workers are offered the option of paying for COBRA coverage at  the time of separation from their employers, and individuals who enroll in  COBRA may use the advance HCTC to pay 65 percent of their COBRA  premiums once they have completed the advance HCTC enrollment  process, which typically can take 3 to 6 months. Eligible individuals who  decline COBRA coverage\u2014such as for affordability concerns\u2014or do not  have COBRA as an option and become uninsured for more than 63 days  risk losing guaranteed access to state-qualified health coverage and other  consumer protections. Because it typically takes 3 to 6 months after  losing employment before beginning to receive the advance HCTC,  maintaining coverage for this 63-day period can be very expensive for  displaced workers, and some may opt not to pay for this coverage in part  because they have difficulty affording it. In our survey of state workforce  agencies, 20 of the 30 states that said that TAA recipients had difficulty  receiving the HCTC reported that breaks in coverage of 63 days or more  are causing individuals to lose access to one or more consumer  protections, such as guaranteed access to coverage or no preexisting  condition exclusions. However, officials we interviewed from five state- qualified HCTC health plans reported that they have voluntarily extended  one or more consumer protections to individuals with more than a 63-day  break in coverage, for example offering all HCTC applicants guaranteed  access to coverage and in some cases waiving preexisting condition  exclusions for enrollees. Some of these health plan officials indicated that  the decision to offer all HCTC applicants the same consumer protections  was made for ease of administration, and this practice may be revoked in  the future at the discretion of the plan.", "State, health plan, and union officials also expressed concern about gaps  in HCTC program eligibility rules that can affect the spouses and other  dependents of PBGC beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare. Specifically,  when a PBGC beneficiary enrolls in Medicare, the beneficiary loses  eligibility for the HCTC. According to current eligibility rules, the spouses  and other dependents of these individuals also lose eligibility for the HCTC  even if they are not yet eligible for Medicare. A union official reported that  when some PBGC beneficiaries attended an HCTC information session  and became aware of this rule, they expressed reservations about  enrolling in the HCTC, stating that they needed more time to think about  whether to apply.", "According to state workforce officials, health plan officials, and union  representatives we contacted, the affordability of qualified HCTC coverage  was another factor affecting participation rates. HCTC-eligible individuals  have either lost employment, often involving a reduction in income, or  retired and are receiving a fixed pension from PBGC. Research indicates  that as premiums consume an increasing share of income, participation  rates decline. For example, one study found that, among populations with  incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, more than half of  the target population would participate when premiums represent 1  percent of income, but only one-sixth would participate when premiums  represent 5 percent of income.", "The affordability of qualified health coverage options can be problematic  even with the HCTC. During the 1- to 3-month period before the health  plan receives the first premium payment from the HCTC program, HCTC  enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of the premium out of pocket,  which for a single person would represent 36 percent and for two persons  would represent 72 percent of the average monthly unemployment  insurance benefit of about $1,128. The ongoing 35 percent share of the  average HCTC premiums in mid-2004 for a health plan covering a single  individual and a plan covering a single individual and one other family  member would have required 13 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of  the average monthly unemployment insurance benefit. In addition to these  premium costs, HCTC enrollees must pay any deductibles, coinsurance, or  copayments that are required by their health plan.", "In our survey of state workforce agencies, 24 of 30 states reporting that  TAA recipients had difficulty receiving the HCTC said that the ability to  pay premiums while waiting to receive the advance HCTC was a factor  contributing to this difficulty. In addition, 22 of the 30 states indicated that  the lack of affordable health coverage was a reason individuals may be  having difficulty participating in HCTC. The state workforce, health plan,  and union officials we interviewed reported that, even with a 65 percent  subsidy, the remaining 35 percent share might cost too much to be  affordable for many displaced workers and retirees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Majority of Advance HCTC Enrollees Purchased COBRA; Benefits and Costs Varied with Type of Qualified Coverage", "paragraphs": ["From August 2003 through April 2004, 60 percent of advance HCTC  enrollees obtained coverage through automatically qualified health plans,  primarily COBRA, and 40 percent of individuals receiving the advance  HCTC purchased coverage through a state-qualified plan.

State workforce and insurance department  officials in California reported that because no health plans in the state  had agreed to participate in the HCTC program, potentially eligible  individuals without access to COBRA or another automatically qualified  coverage option were unable to use the HCTC because they could not  purchase qualified coverage.", "In the 15 states that did not make a state-qualified HCTC plan available,  some potentially eligible individuals may not have been able to use the  HCTC to purchase automatically qualified coverage. Although the extent  to which this has occurred is unknown, there are several reasons why  potentially eligible individuals in these states may be unable to receive the  HCTC. First, if a former employer discontinued its employee health  coverage, individuals potentially eligible for the HCTC would not likely  have access to a COBRA plan. According to a Commonwealth Fund study,  federal officials estimate that between 40 percent and 60 percent of  individuals eligible to receive the HCTC likely do not have access to  COBRA coverage. In addition, individuals who have COBRA coverage  and are eligible to receive the HCTC for longer than the 18 to 36 months  that COBRA is available will also need to enroll in another form of  qualified coverage when their COBRA benefits expire in order to maintain  the HCTC. Second, individuals with coverage through their spouses\u2019  employer may not qualify for the HCTC because many companies that  offer health coverage contribute more than 50 percent toward the cost of  their workers\u2019 health coverage premium\u2014both for the cost of coverage for  an individual worker and for the cost of family coverage. In 2003, for  example, the average percentage of total premiums paid by employers for  family coverage was 73 percent. Third, HCTC program office officials  reported that only a small percentage of individuals were likely to have  purchased coverage in the individual market at least 30 days prior to the  separation from employment that resulted in their becoming eligible for  TAA benefits or PBGC payments.

Although most state-qualified health plans had not  analyzed the extent to which HCTC recipients utilize services, preliminary  evidence suggested that insurers have not found the majority of these  individuals to be in poor health.", "Health plans\u2019 premium-setting practices depended on the type of state- qualified coverage offered. In four of the six states we reviewed where  state-qualified HCTC coverage was provided through arrangements with  insurers offering individual market plans (Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio,  and Texas), insurers took each applicant\u2019s health status and medical  history into account when determining premiums, a process known as  medical underwriting. The other two states (New York and Pennsylvania)  charged the same rates for all enrollees. High-risk pools in the states we  reviewed generally charged enrollees different rates based on their age  (Illinois, Maryland, Texas), gender (Illinois, Texas), or county of residence  (Illinois, Texas). One high-risk pool (Texas) also charged tobacco users  higher premiums than nontobacco users.", "Unlike COBRA or other group market coverage, where premiums are  based on the history of medical costs and demographic characteristics  associated with a group of individuals who are employees of a company or  related companies, eligibility and premiums in the individual market in  many states are based largely on each individual\u2019s health status and risk  characteristics. Typically, the extent to which insurers selling coverage in  the individual market can raise premiums for older individuals or those  with existing health conditions is determined by each state. While the  premiums charged by insurers selling coverage in the individual market  may vary substantially, the premiums charged by state high-risk pools are  generally set between 125 percent and 200 percent of the standard  premium that an individual in good health would typically pay for  coverage in the individual market. Regardless of health status, HCTC  recipients purchasing COBRA coverage would be charged the same rate as  the rest of the employee group, while those purchasing coverage through a  high-risk pool would pay from 125 percent to 200 percent of the standard  premium charged to healthy individuals. HCTC recipients purchasing  coverage through an arrangement with an insurer would likely be charged  varying premiums based on their health status and other demographic  characteristics, with some unhealthy, high-risk individuals paying more,  and in some cases substantially more, than 200 percent of the rates  charged to individuals in good health. For example, in one state we  reviewed, the insurer offering qualifying coverage to HCTC recipients  charged individuals rated in their poorest health category 580 percent of  the premium charged to those rated in their healthiest category.", "For state-qualified HCTC insurers, particularly those in the individual  market, having to provide guaranteed issue coverage to certain HCTC  recipients presents additional risk. For example, if an individual applicant  with 3 months of prior creditable coverage has a costly chronic medical  condition, such as juvenile-onset diabetes or heart disease, which would  otherwise typically result in that applicant being denied coverage, the cost  to the insurer may outweigh the premium paid, resulting in a loss to the  insurer. To compensate for this additional risk posed by the guaranteed  issue requirement, federal officials have granted permission for state- qualified HCTC health plans to charge higher premiums to individuals  rated in the poorest health categories\u2014individuals who would otherwise  be turned down for coverage\u2014as long as the additional premiums are  actuarially justified and pass state insurance department review.", "One insurer we interviewed that sold state-qualified coverage in multiple  states, including one of the states we reviewed, used differing practices in  setting premiums for HCTC recipients in these states. In the state we  reviewed, this insurer reported that it had originally planned to offer  coverage on a guaranteed issue basis to all HCTC enrollees, regardless of  whether they had 3 months of prior creditable coverage, and to  automatically charge them 200 percent of the standard premium that it  would typically charge a healthy applicant. After the state department of  insurance rejected this premium-setting practice, the health plan set up a  two-tier pricing system whereby healthier individuals who passed medical  underwriting were charged the standard premium, while those who did  not pass underwriting were charged 200 percent of this rate. Although this  insurer modified its pricing method in the state we reviewed, the insurer  said that it continued to automatically charge all HCTC recipients a higher- than-standard premium in two other states where it sold state-qualified  coverage. Thus, although the guaranteed issue provision ensures that  qualified individuals will have access to HCTC coverage, regardless of age  or health status, it also means that the healthiest HCTC recipients may pay  more for such coverage than they otherwise would in the individual  market without guaranteed issue. Without this consumer protection,  however, HCTC recipients with certain preexisting medical conditions  would likely be unable to purchase coverage from state-qualified health  insurers selling individual market health plans.", "Two states we reviewed (Maryland and Texas) offered state-qualified  HCTC coverage through both the state high-risk pool and through an  arrangement with an insurer. Because of the way health plans in these  states set premiums, less healthy HCTC recipients were likely to find the  high-risk pool coverage to be the less expensive of the two state-qualified  options, while healthier HCTC recipients were generally able to purchase  less expensive coverage through the arrangement with an insurer. For  example:  In Maryland, the health plan offered through an arrangement with an  insurer charged less healthy HCTC recipients 200 percent of the standard  premium typically charged an applicant in good health, whereas the state  high-risk pool charged all applicants 150 percent of the standard rate.  In Texas, high-risk pool rates were set at 200 percent of the standard  premium, while the state-qualified HCTC plan offered through an  arrangement with an insurer charged HCTC recipients rated in the poorest  health category 4.7 times as much as those rated in the average health  category and 5.8 times as much as those rated in the healthiest category.", "Most of the state-qualified plans in the seven states we reviewed that had  such plans reported that they have not analyzed the extent to which HCTC  recipients utilize services, which would be one indicator of the health  status of the population receiving the HCTC.

As of May 2004,  HCTC program officials reported that this screening had prevented about  8,000 ineligible individuals from improperly claiming the end-of-year HCTC  on their 2003 tax returns. However, this prescreening only identified  whether an individual was potentially eligible for the HCTC at any time  during the year, not the specific month or months in which he or she might  have been eligible. IRS provided tax professionals with information about  the HCTC and mailed each individual who was identified as potentially  eligible for the credit in 2003 information about how to claim the end-of- year HCTC. Additionally, the IRS tax form used to claim the end-of-year  HCTC was revised to include clearer instructions to help filers determine  whether they were eligible for the credit, and individuals were required to  attach copies of invoices and payments for each month in 2003 for which  they claimed the end-of-year HCTC. This procedure does not, however,  ensure that the individual purchased qualified health coverage. Therefore,  potentially eligible individuals could have claimed the end-of-year HCTC in  2003 for more months than they should have or for coverage that did not  qualify for the credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCTC Program Office Adapted Policies and Procedures to Resolve Some but Not All Advance HCTC Implementation Issues", "paragraphs": ["Advance HCTC payment and implementation issues prompted the HCTC  program to change some of its procedures, but not all issues have been  resolved. One such payment issue for which the HCTC program adapted  its procedures was the refusal of some automatically qualified health plans  to accept the advance HCTC from IRS. HCTC program officials reported  that certain health plans refused to accept payments from IRS, primarily  because they found the process to register to receive advance payments  burdensome or they did not want to receive electronic payments.  According to these officials, health plans had to register in the primary  vendor database for the federal government\u2014the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR)\u2014and accept electronic payments in order to receive  advance HCTC payments. The CCR requirement was reported to cause  delays, and some plans, especially smaller ones, refused to accept  electronic payments or did not have the necessary systems to process  them. To encourage health plans to participate, the HCTC program office  changed its registration process for health plans\u2014it no longer requires  plans to register with the CCR\u2014and now issues paper checks if a health  plan will not accept electronic payments. HCTC program officials reported  that these changes have prompted some plans to agree to participate.  However, as of June 2004, 211 health plans still refused to participate.  Most of these were COBRA plans that covered few HCTC-eligible  individuals. Because these 211 plans refused to accept payments, about  447 individuals who had tried to enroll for the advance HCTC had to wait  until the end of the year to claim the HCTC. Officials from two COBRA  plans told us why their plans did not accept advance payments: an official  from one plan stated that too few individuals qualify for the HCTC for the  plan to consider participating, while an official from another plan was  concerned that the advance HCTC would encourage less healthy  individuals to retain coverage and that this would result in financial losses  for the plan. Nevertheless, a total of more than 600 health plans covering  more than 13,000 individuals have agreed to receive the advance HCTC as  of June 2004.", "An unresolved payment issue identified by 3 of the 10 state-qualified plans  we contacted in the states we reviewed was the receipt of incorrect  advance HCTC payments from IRS when premiums change. While officials  from most of the state-qualified plans we interviewed (6 of 10) reported  that either they did not experience any problems with advance HCTC  payments or that any problems they experienced had been resolved, the  most common unresolved issue, reported by officials from three of the  plans that identified ongoing issues, dealt with the receipt of incorrect  payments when premiums changed. This problem was attributed largely to  the time it takes for HCTC enrollees to notify the HCTC program of the  new premium and for the HCTC program to adjust the allowable premium  amount. For example, one plan reported that payments from IRS are  incorrect\u2014usually less than the required amount\u2014for a couple of months  after a premium change. To mitigate this problem, two officials from state- qualified plans suggested that the health plan, rather than the HCTC  enrollee, notify the HCTC program of premium changes. Officials from two  COBRA plan administrators that had a large number of advance HCTC  enrollees stated that they did report premium changes directly to the  HCTC program. However, HCTC program officials reported that some  plans prefer not to report the changes to HCTC because it is outside their  normal procedures or they have few members receiving the advance  HCTC.", "An implementation issue affecting enrollees, for which the HCTC program  revised its procedures, concerned how the program office responded to  enrollees\u2019 payments that were less than the requested amount or late.  According to HCTC program officials, between August 2003 and February  2004, more than 1,700 individuals who had enrolled for the advance HCTC  were terminated temporarily from the advance HCTC because their  payments to IRS were less than their 35 percent share or they were late.  Approximately 55 percent of the individuals who were terminated  subsequently reenrolled for the advance HCTC. HCTC program officials  noted that the initial billing and payment procedures generated numerous  calls to the customer service center because individuals received multiple  invoices for their 35 percent premium amount, some of which they  received late because of mail delivery problems. To mitigate this confusion  and the burden of reenrolling individuals who had been dropped, the  HCTC program office changed its billing and payment procedures in  March 2004. Under the revised procedures, only one invoice would be sent  each month and, instead of terminating individuals whose payments were  less than the required amount, the HCTC program office would add a 65  percent HCTC proportional to the payment they receive and forward this  amount to the health plan. The HCTC enrollee would be responsible for  paying any outstanding difference to the health plan directly. HCTC  program officials told us that since making these changes, no advance  HCTC enrollee has been terminated as a result of payments that were less  than the required amount or late. Additionally, officials we interviewed  from five of the health plans in the states we reviewed reported that they  were lenient in applying their payment rules to ensure that plan members  did not lose coverage as a result of problems with the advance HCTC. For  example, an official from one health plan reported that the plan had  extended from 30 to 90 days the grace period for advance HCTC members  to pay their monthly premiums.", "The HCTC program office has also changed its procedures to address the  receipt of incomplete lists of potentially eligible individuals from state  workforce agencies. HCTC program officials reported that the lists state  workforce agencies provide on which the HCTC program office relies to  determine eligibility for the advance HCTC were incomplete for many  states and that verifying that individuals remained eligible for the advance  HCTC was time consuming. Some states also reported problems with  transmitting these data to IRS. Ohio, for example, reported that the HCTC  program office does not always receive all of the names of potentially  eligible individuals that it sends. HCTC program officials reported that  from October 2003 through March 2004, the lists of TAA recipients  potentially eligible to receive the HCTC submitted by about one-third to  more than one-half of states (16 states to 28 states) failed to include the  names of all eligible TAA recipients. Since October 2003, the HCTC  program office has audited these states\u2019 lists and asked the workforce  agencies to confirm that their transmissions were correct if any of the  individuals enrolled to receive the advance HCTC from the previous  month failed to reappear as eligible. During the first 6 months in which the  HCTC program office performed these audits, it identified 2,984  individuals who were enrolled to receive the advance HCTC in a previous  month but whose names dropped from the state lists in the current month.  The state workforce agencies determined that approximately 55 percent  (or 1,648) of these individuals were still eligible for the advance HCTC and  that their names should not have been dropped from the list. Thus,  without this audit process these individuals would have erroneously lost  eligibility for the advance HCTC. However, HCTC program and Labor  officials reported that this verification process is a burden on HCTC  program staff and the states.", "HCTC program officials reported that they did not track advance payment  errors that occurred as a result of mistakes made by IRS. While these  officials acknowledged that some mistakes did occur, such as late  payments or accounting errors, they said that the majority of payments  were timely and accurate and that problems were resolved at the time they  occurred. Likewise, most officials from health plans we spoke with  reported few problems with IRS\u2019s payments; problems identified included  payments containing incorrect identification numbers or payments for  incorrect amounts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCTC Program Office Used Contractors to Implement and Perform Most Program Functions", "paragraphs": ["IRS established the HCTC program office with primary responsibility for  overseeing and coordinating efforts for the HCTC. The HCTC program  office is responsible for resolving operational and legal issues and  monitoring the overall progress of the HCTC on a day-to-day basis. An  executive steering committee, composed of affected federal agencies and  contractors, also was established to provide guidance to the HCTC  program office. The majority of officials on the HCTC program\u2019s executive  steering committee are IRS or Treasury officials. High-level officials from  each of the other federal agencies involved with the HCTC\u2014Labor, HHS,  and PBGC\u2014as well as the IRS and Treasury officials are voting members.

This committee meets monthly to provide guidance on  policy, legal, and programmatic issues.", "To meet the implementation date for the advance HCTC, IRS relied on  contractors. According to HCTC program officials, IRS staff work closely  with contractor staff and oversee their work on an ongoing basis. For  example, within the HCTC program office are six project teams, each of  which is managed by a senior-level IRS staff person. Paired with each  senior-level IRS staff person is a senior contractor staff person, and most  of the staff performing specific operational tasks for the HCTC are from  the contractor. While the senior IRS and contractor staff share  responsibility for their project team\u2019s work, the IRS staff person  establishes the direction of the work on the basis of the HCTC program\u2019s  strategic plan, sets priorities, and brings knowledge about IRS\u2019s processes  to the team. IRS and contractor staff responsibilities are also clarified in  the contract documents. For example, IRS contract documents state that  the government responsibilities include defining the rules under which the  program will function and that the primary contractor\u2019s responsibilities  include designing and administering the HCTC program according to these  rules. IRS officials in the HCTC program reported that close collaboration  between government and contractor staff helped them implement the  advance HCTC in a timely manner.", "Officials from IRS\u2019s contracting office reported that oversight of the  primary HCTC contractor responsible for developing and maintaining  much of the HCTC program office\u2019s infrastructure is conducted in several  ways. IRS contracting officers include direction on how work is to be  completed in work requests, as well as reporting requirements and  deliverables. For example, one work request required the contractor to  report daily on the handling of calls received by the call center for a few  months in 2003. IRS staff in the specific area where the work is to be done  review and approve each work request under the contract, monitor the  contractor\u2019s work, and make recommendations to the contracting official  regarding whether the completed work is acceptable. Additionally, IRS  contracting officials reported that they review monthly status reports, cost  documents, and deliverables submitted by the primary contractor.  However, the HCTC program office has not instituted performance  measures and is currently working on draft measures and preliminary  goals for fiscal year 2005.", "To implement and administer the advance HCTC, Congress appropriated  $70 million to IRS for fiscal year 2003, which will remain available through  fiscal year 2004, and $35 million for fiscal year 2004, available through  fiscal year 2005. HCTC program officials expected that costs to  administer the HCTC program\u2014from the time that work by the primary  contractor began in February 2003 through June 2005\u2014would be about  $116 million. These costs, broken down by major activities, included  about $33 million for design and development work during February 2003  through April 2004. Implementation costs to establish the systems that  would be used on an ongoing basis and costs to administer the advance  HCTC for the first 9 months it was available were reported to be about $36  million for May 2003 through April 2004. In May and June 2004, the HCTC  program office engaged in a planning process during which it restructured  its operations and determined how it would transition from  implementation activities to operating activities. Costs to reorganize and  administer the HCTC during this 2-month transition period were expected  to be about $6 million. After transitioning to operating activity levels,  officials expected that costs for the HCTC would be about $40 million for  the year July 2004 through June 2005, and IRS officials reported that they  are identifying ways to further lower operating costs. Included in this $40  million are about $32 million for operating costs and about $8 million for  program enhancements such as software updates. In total, the majority (at  least $97 million) of the approximately $116 million to administer the  HCTC\u2014from its early 2003 start-up through mid-2005 operations\u2014was  expected to be paid to IRS\u2019s contractors. (See table 8.)", "From start-up through June 2004, IRS\u2019s primary contractor was  responsible for most of the work for the HCTC. The contractor\u2019s  responsibilities during this time included assisting in the development of  eligibility and payment processing policies and procedures, maintaining  and operating the program office, and establishing a call center. While IRS  had an average of 9 full-time-equivalent staff assigned during this time to  design, develop, implement, and transition the HCTC program to ongoing  operational service levels, the primary contractor had an average of 243  full-time-equivalent staff working on these activities.", "Starting July 1, 2004, HCTC program officials expected that operating and  enhancement costs for the next 12 months would be about $40 million.  This figure also reflects a decrease in contractor staff. These costs reflect  a reduction in service levels and IRS\u2019s assumption of more of the  administrative responsibilities for the HCTC. HCTC program officials  stated that reduced service levels means that, for example, the HCTC  program will focus on responding to issues raised by health plans rather  than providing as much individual-level outreach to health plans as they  had in the past. IRS\u2019s primary contractor is expected to continue to  perform the majority of work for the HCTC, and officials reported that  there would be a decrease in the amount of work done by the contractor,  with contractor staffing to decrease to 167 full-time-equivalents.

The pilot was tested in Maryland  and Virginia and involved three activities. First, the HCTC program began  asking individuals in these states when they applied for the credit to  consent to the HCTC program sharing certain private enrollment  information with state officials, such as names, addresses, and enrollment  status. According to the HCTC program, most individuals (80 percent) in  these states consented to this at the time of enrollment. The HCTC  program office then sent a report to states weekly showing HCTC  enrollment status, contact information, Social Security number, and  eligibility type for all TAA recipients and PBGC beneficiaries who had  consented to disclosure of this information. Pilot states were encouraged  to use this information as a tool for outreach and for determining an  individual\u2019s eligibility for bridge grant payments. Second, the HCTC  program office offered support to states in promoting their bridge grant  program to potentially eligible individuals. Third, the HCTC program office  provided ad hoc support to bridge grant states on questions regarding  HCTC eligibility and enrollment. Virginia reported that it used the consent  reports to conduct outreach such as mailing application forms to potential  eligibles, as well as to monitor enrollment status to avoid potential  overpayments. Maryland used the consent reports to contact prescreened  PBGC beneficiaries and offered them bridge services, including mailing  out application packages, and Maryland officials said that the pilot  experience helped improve federal and state coordination. The HCTC  program and Labor have agreed to expand the bridge grant pilot to other  states.", "In response to our survey of state workforce agencies in March 2004,  officials cited a variety of reasons to explain why they did not apply for  bridge or infrastructure national emergency grants. For example, officials  in two-thirds of the states that did not apply for the bridge grants said that  they did not have systems in place to implement the grant. The rest of the  states cited a variety of reasons for not applying, including difficulty with  the grant application process, insufficient TAA workers or activity, no  need for the funding, and prohibitive administrative costs. One state  indicated that it was hesitant to assist individuals with obtaining health  coverage because it was unable to make decisions about health insurance  coverage.

(See app. V for a  list of high-risk pool awards to states.)", "According to a CMS official, one reason more states did not apply for high- risk pool seed grants was that states\u2019 fiscal concerns made them reluctant  to take on the ongoing financial obligations of a new high-risk pool, which  typically enrolls individuals with a history of high medical costs, incurs  costs potentially higher than the premiums received from enrollees, and  requires subsidization from taxes on local insurers or other revenue  sources. CMS officials also said that several states that had high-risk pools  were not eligible for the high-risk pool operating grant because they did  not meet the eligibility criteria. The operating grant is available only to  qualified high-risk pools that meet certain eligibility criteria, and the award  amounts are based on the number of uninsured individuals in each state.  In addition to meeting the criteria for a qualified high-risk pool contained  in the Public Health Services Act, eligibility criteria for receipt of the  grant included restrictions on the premiums charged, the number of plan  choices available to enrollees, and the availability of mechanisms to fund  ongoing losses incurred by the pool. California and Texas, where the  numbers of uninsured people are among the highest in the nation and  therefore would have been eligible for proportionately larger shares of the  grant funds, were among the states that did not meet these criteria.  California did not qualify because its high-risk pool did not meet the  qualified high-risk pool requirement that eligible individuals have  immediate access to the pool, and Texas did not qualify because the  premiums for its high-risk pool were set above the allowable limits.

The  establishment of the HCTC within 1 year of enactment, including  development of a new mechanism for paying the HCTC directly to  hundreds of health plans on behalf of enrollees in advance of the premium  due date, resulted from the collaborative efforts of multiple federal and  state agencies and private health plans. As implementation issues arose\u2014 such as certain health plans\u2019 reluctance to participate, some initial  payment problems, and ineligible individuals receiving the end-of-year  credit in 2002\u2014the IRS-based HCTC program office worked with other  federal, state, and private stakeholders and adapted its policies and  processes to address these and other issues.", "Despite these efforts, the number of individuals receiving the HCTC to  date continues to be a smaller portion of those potentially eligible than  many stakeholders had expected and some implementation issues remain  unresolved. A major factor cited by many state and health plan officials as  a reason for lower than expected enrollment was the affordability of  coverage, as some eligible individuals may find it difficult to pay the entire  premium for 3 to 6 months to maintain coverage until they receive the  advance HCTC, and even the 35 percent share of premiums, once the  HCTC covers remaining premium costs can represent a high proportion of  income, particularly for displaced workers or retirees. Further, while the  advance payment option was intended to make the HCTC attractive for  eligible individuals by minimizing their out-of-pocket payments, most  HCTC recipients in 2003 did not use this option. Instead, the majority of  recipients opted to receive the HCTC by claiming the credit on their year- end tax forms. State, health plan, and union officials told us that the  complexity of the eligibility determination and enrollment process  contributed to the lower than expected usage of the advance payment  option. For example,    The multitude of tax, labor, and health coverage requirements related to  the HCTC are challenging for workers and retirees to navigate. Potentially  eligible individuals must often contact multiple federal, state, and private  entities to obtain the information they need to enroll. While the HCTC  program office offers information to potentially eligible individuals  through its call center, this resource begins after individuals have been  identified by states or PBGC as potentially eligible and often after  individuals have already made decisions about maintaining, changing, or  dropping health coverage.  Individuals who have more than a 63-day break in continuous health  coverage may lose federal consumer protections guaranteed in the TAA  Reform Act, such as guaranteed acceptance by a health plan and coverage  for their preexisting medical conditions. Given that it takes 3 to 6 months  to become eligible for and receive the advance HCTC, during which time  the individual is responsible for the full premium amount, some  individuals may lose these consumer protections if they do not maintain  coverage during this time.", "To receive the HCTC, the TAA Reform Act requires that an individual must  meet certain trade readjustment allowance eligibility requirements,  including (1) waiting 60 days or more from the time that a petition to  certify that workers were displaced due to trade is submitted to Labor, and  (2) complying with the requirement to obtain reemployment training or  obtain a waiver from training each month. State workforce agencies  contend that granting these waivers to facilitate eligibility for the HCTC is  an added administrative burden that further complicates enrollment in the  HCTC.", "Lists from state workforce agencies used to verify individuals\u2019 eligibility  were sometimes incomplete, causing individuals to lose access to the  advance HCTC if their names were erroneously dropped.

Comments from the federal  agencies are reprinted in appendixes VI through IX.", "Regarding our recommendation that Labor, IRS, CMS, and PBGC work  together to develop a centralized resource to help individuals understand  the eligibility requirements for the HCTC, IRS agreed with our  recommendation and highlighted efforts it has made to date to provide a  centralized resource, including developing informational documents for  individuals and states, making information available on its Web site, and  establishing a call center. Labor agreed on the importance of providing  individuals with information about the HCTC and highlighted certain  actions it had taken to provide information and training to state workforce  agencies and other interested parties such as businesses and unions. Labor  also suggested reviewing and evaluating the quality of the existing  information before taking further actions. PBGC commented that it would  coordinate with the other agencies to address this recommendation, and  CMS deferred to IRS as the lead in HCTC outreach and education. While  we recognize that agencies have made efforts to provide individuals with  information about the HCTC, we noted in the draft report that  individualized assistance is not available until after individuals may have  already made decisions that affect their eligibility for the HCTC. Thus,  while a review of existing resources may be helpful, we have added to our  recommendation the need for a centralized resource that provides  individualized information and assistance earlier than it is currently  available.", "Regarding our recommendation for IRS to evaluate whether any reduced  service levels will affect individuals\u2019 and health plans\u2019 satisfaction, IRS  stated that the agency cannot at this time systematically measure  customer satisfaction. In response to our recommendation, however, IRS  stated that it would include questions in future surveys or other research  to elicit an indication of changes in satisfaction.", "In response to our recommendation that IRS and Labor improve the  quality of eligibility information provided by the states, IRS agreed that the  information provided by states continues to present a challenge. IRS noted  that, although it does not have authority over states to implement  solutions to problems with the eligibility lists, it will work with Labor to  develop a plan for improving the accuracy of these data. Labor agreed with  our recommendation and highlighted the burden the audits placed on  states and agreed to continue to work with IRS to improve the quality of  the data.", "In response to our recommendation that IRS encourage health plans to  provide notifications of premium changes directly to the HCTC program  office, IRS agreed to develop an action plan to make this change. IRS  noted that it would likely phase in this change because of the number of  plans and individuals affected.", "IRS and PBGC agreed with our recommendation that PBGC work with IRS  to report to Congress the number of PBGC beneficiaries who turn 65 and  lose eligibility for the HCTC even though their spouse or dependent may  still need HCTC coverage. Additionally, PBGC suggested that IRS, as the  lead agency for the HCTC, submit the recommended information to  Congress. IRS noted that some estimates may be necessary because not all  data elements are readily available to IRS or PBGC.", "In addition to its comments on our recommendations, IRS stated that the  HCTC presented significant new responsibilities for IRS and that  challenges remain. IRS reported it is continuing to identify ways to  improve the operation of the HCTC program, decrease administrative  costs, and obtain data about those who receive the HCTC in order to make  outreach activities more effective. IRS stated that it is working to shorten  the period of time required before an individual receives the advance  HCTC. It noted, however, that the first 3 months of the 3- to 6-month  period we identified for this process relates to TAA certification  requirements, and that amending these requirements may have broader  implications than just for the HCTC program. Additionally, regarding our  statement that the benefits offered by qualified health plans across states  differ widely, IRS noted that the coverage available for the HCTC is  dependent on decisions made by the states and the plans that volunteer to  participate. IRS stated that it hopes to obtain data that will enable a better  understanding of the health status and other characteristics of HCTC  enrollees to help alleviate health plans\u2019 uncertainty about health care costs  of HCTC individuals compared to others and to encourage more health  plans to participate in the advance HCTC program.", "IRS and Labor and officials from Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  and Texas also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  date.

Another 3 states\u2014Arizona,  Idaho, and Washington\u2014had designated state-qualified plans, but these  plans were not yet open to enrollment as of July 2004. Most of the 36 states  that made state-qualified coverage available chose to provide this coverage  through arrangements with insurers or through state high risk-pools, and 3  states designated both their high-risk pool and an arrangement with an  insurer as state-qualified coverage. Thirteen states designated mini- COBRA coverage\u2014state-based continuation coverage pertaining to  insurers providing coverage to plans maintained by employers with fewer  than 20 employees. Mini-COBRA coverage was the sole state-qualified  coverage option available to HCTC recipients in 4 states (see table 10).  According to federal officials, only a small percentage of Trade  Adjustment Assistance (TAA) recipients and Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (PBGC) beneficiaries eligible to receive the HCTC likely had  access to mini-COBRA coverage, as few of these individuals formerly  worked for an employer with fewer than 20 employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Variation in Benefits Across State-Qualified Health Plans in Seven States", "paragraphs": ["The benefits offered to HCTC recipients varied across coverage types and  from plan to plan. COBRA benefits, which were typically identical to the  benefits provided to working individuals covered by the employer\u2019s group  market health plan, generally included lower deductibles than high-risk  pools and more comprehensive benefits and lower deductibles than state- qualified arrangements with insurers in the seven states we reviewed that  had state-qualified plans.", "The majority of state-qualified plans in the states we reviewed were  preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, although health maintenance  organization (HMO), exclusive provider organizations (EPO), unrestricted  fee for service (FFS), and point of service (POS) plans were available in  some states. According to a national employer benefits survey, PPO  health plans offered by employers in 2003 generally included an average  annual deductible for services provided within the health plan\u2019s preferred  provider network of $275. Table 11 shows that most of the state-qualified  health plans in the states we reviewed offered a choice among deductible  amounts, ranging from $0 to $5,000, and that HCTC recipients generally  selected the lowest deductibles available, typically $1,000 or less.", "We reviewed these state-qualified health plans for the extent of the  benefits they offered with regard to maternity care, mental health care,  and prescription drugs. The extent to which maternity benefits were  covered by state-qualified plans in the states we reviewed is shown in table  12. Employer-sponsored plans typically provided coverage for maternity  benefits because the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act required  employers with 15 or more employees to cover expenses for maternity  services on the same basis as coverage for other medical conditions. Only  one state-qualified plan in the states we reviewed did not provide coverage  for maternity benefits, and three state-qualified health plans offered  maternity coverage that was available as an optional benefit with an  additional premium charge.", "The mental health benefits offered by state-qualified health plans in the  states we reviewed are summarized in table 13. A national survey of health  benefits offered by employers in 2003 reported that 99 percent of employer  PPO plans provided coverage for both inpatient and outpatient mental  health services, and the majority of these plans provided coverage for at  least 21 days of inpatient care and 21 outpatient visits per year. In  comparison, two state-qualified health plans in a state we reviewed did not  provide any coverage for mental health benefits, and one health plan in  another state we reviewed limited coverage of mental health benefits to 10  inpatient days and 10 outpatient visits per year. State-qualified plans in  three states required enrollees to pay 50 percent of the cost of outpatient  mental health visits. Two state-qualified health plans in one state limited  coverage to certain mental disorders.", "Prescription drug benefits offered by state-qualified health plans in the  states we reviewed are summarized in table 14. According to a national  survey of employer-sponsored health benefits, 99 percent of employer PPO  plans provided coverage for prescription drugs in 2003, and 92 percent of  all employer-sponsored plans did not require a separate prescription drug  deductible. The average copayments for prescription drugs reported in  this survey were $9 for generic products, $19 for brand-name products that  the plan designated as preferred, and $29 for brand-name products that the  plan did not designate as preferred. All but one of the state-qualified plans  in the states we reviewed included coverage for prescription drugs, and  the one plan that did not include such coverage offered it as an optional  benefit available for an additional premium charge. State-qualified plans in  three states we reviewed required a separate annual deductible for  prescription drugs, ranging from $100 to $250.
