Five large-scale U.S. liquefaction facilities\u2014necessary for conversion of natural gas to liquefied natural gas (LNG) (see fig. below)\u2014are under construction with a projected capacity to export more than 12 percent of U.S. natural gas production in 2020. According to representatives from these five facilities, their liquefaction capacity has already been sold mainly through 20-year contracts and their customers are responsible for transporting the LNG to export markets. Based on estimates from these liquefaction facilities, transport of the full capacity of these liquefaction facilities will require about 100 or more LNG carriers. Currently operating LNG carriers are nearly all foreign built and operated. LNG carriers have not been built in the United States since before 1980, and no LNG carriers are currently registered under the U.S. flag.", "The proposed requirement to transport exports of LNG via U.S.-built-and-flagged carriers could expand employment for U.S. mariners and shipbuilders if it does not reduce the expected demand for U.S. LNG. According to representatives of U.S. mariner groups, between 4,000 and 5,200 mariners would be needed to operate the estimated 100 LNG carriers needed to transport the five U.S. facilities' full capacity of LNG once the five are fully operational. Based on the current capacity of U.S. shipyards we spoke with, building 100 carriers would likely take over 30 years, with employment in U.S. shipyards increasing somewhat or becoming more stable, according to shipyard representatives. Department of Defense (DOD) officials also indicated that any policy or requirement that increases and stabilizes jobs in the U.S. maritime industry could support military readiness. However, according to industry representatives, U.S. carriers would cost about two to three times as much as similar carriers built in Korean shipyards and would be more expensive to operate. Based on GAO analysis, these costs would increase the cost of transporting LNG from the United States, decrease the competitiveness of U.S. LNG in the world market, and may, in turn, reduce demand for U.S. LNG. The extent of these effects depends on customers' circumstances and business decisions. For example, several stakeholders told us implementing the proposed requirement may prompt customers to attempt to modify, renegotiate, or terminate their existing contracts for liquefaction. Additionally, limited availability of U.S. carriers in the early years of construction may decrease the amount of LNG that could be exported from the United States for a period of time, leading customers to seek alternate sources. Further, a reduction in the level of expected U.S. LNG exports could impact the broader U.S. economy, including potential job and profit losses in the oil and gas sector."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Worldwide, trade of liquefied natural gas (LNG)\u2014that is, natural gas that  has been liquefied for the purposes of storage and transportation\u2014has  the potential to increase from about 241-million tons annually in 2014 to  about 424-million tons by 2020, according to the International Gas  Union.

To describe stakeholder views on the extent to which the  requirement of U.S.-flagged-and-built vessels for LNG exports could  affect domestic jobs in the maritime, shipbuilding, and other related  sectors, we obtained and analyzed the views of selected maritime- industry stakeholders, as well as related documents they provided on the  capability and capacity of U.S. shipbuilders and estimated costs and  requirements to build and operate LNG carriers.

We selected  maritime stakeholders (including shipbuilders, mariner unions, and  shipping companies) for interview based on recommendations from  government and industry stakeholders and their capacity to provide  services related to LNG carrier construction and operation. For instance,  we selected the ship broker and ship operator based on the fact that they  are currently involved in shipping LNG.

To  illustrate the cost impact of a U.S.-flagged-and-built carrier requirement  for LNG exports, if all other factors remain equal, we developed a set of  hypothetical assumptions based on discussions with industry  stakeholders, a 2011 MARAD report on the costs of operating U.S.- flagged vessels, and economic theory. For the purposes of estimating  the potential costs of the proposed requirement, we made what we  believe to be conservative estimates, including estimates of the cost of  building LNG carriers in the United States and the costs of operating  those carriers, in order to ensure that we do not overstate those potential  cost effects. Due to the hypothetical nature of the proposed requirement  as well as challenges related to predicting market outcomes, the  estimated cost impacts are meant to be solely illustrative and should not  be taken as a prediction.

For  decades the United States has been a net importer of natural gas, and as  recently as just a few years ago the prospects that the U.S. would  become a net exporter in this market seemed doubtful. For example,  EIA\u2019s Annual Energy Outlook 2011 did not have any projections for net  exports of natural gas by the United States, but the next year\u2019s Energy  Outlook did show projected exports and those projections in more recent  years have risen.", "According to EIA, this evolution in the U.S. natural gas industry relates to  the discovery of more energy resources as well as advances in hydraulic- fracturing and horizontal-drilling technologies. Moreover, studies we  reviewed noted that the pricing of natural gas in many other regions of the  world has traditionally been linked to oil prices, while in the U.S. prices  are set based on supply and demand conditions in North America.  Economic theory suggests that these differing price mechanisms in  various regions of the world have encouraged some companies to invest  in U.S. natural-gas liquefaction and export facilities with the intent to  profitably sell U.S. natural gas in other regions where natural gas prices  have generally been higher, particularly when oil prices are high. More  recently, however, DOE officials told us that as the LNG export market  has developed, oil-linked pricing is coming under pressure as buyers are  benefiting from more options and demanding more flexibility in their  purchases. Nevertheless, demand for natural gas is expected to be  strong with growing demand in the coming years.", "Beyond the cost of natural gas, there are other key costs that are  important in determining U.S. competitiveness in the LNG export market.  Unlike the transport of natural gas by pipeline, the transport of LNG  requires the product to be stored and transported at extremely low  temperatures, necessitating LNG carriers to have expensive technology  to accommodate such cold-storage transport. In terms of transportation  costs, the United States does not have an advantage over some other  sources of natural gas or LNG for the large importing countries in Europe  and Asia. For example, according to a study we reviewed as of now,  much of Europe is supplied with natural gas by pipeline. As a result, LNG  from the United States is less likely to be an economical source of natural  gas to that region under many possible market conditions. While some  Asian markets\u2014notably Japan and Korea\u2014have little pipeline gas  supply, exports from planned liquefaction facilities in Australia and East  African countries will have a proximity advantage (that is, shorter and thus  likely less expensive transportation) to Asian countries over the United  States. As such, according to economic reasoning, the question of the  extent to which a cost advantage in gas supply is offset by cost  disadvantages in transport plays an important role in determining U.S.  competitiveness in the world LNG market.", "Recent investments in liquefaction facilities are an important indicator that  market conditions are such that the United States is expected to be  competitive in the market for LNG exports. Despite higher transportation  costs for U.S. LNG as compared to LNG from other countries into key  export markets in Asia, investors were willing to commit substantial  resources to develop the liquefaction facilities needed for that trade, as  evidenced by their construction. In particular, five large scale liquefaction  facilities are currently under construction in the United States, with one  facility expected to come online by the end of 2015 and all five facilities  expected to be operational within about 3 years (see table 2).  The total  daily capacity of these five facilities is nearly 10-billion cubic feet (bcf) of  natural gas, which constitutes about 12.4 percent of expected U.S.  natural gas production  and approximately 18.1 percent of the world\u2019s  expected LNG capacity in 2020.  The business model used by the U.S.  facilities currently under construction has helped to increase the business  certainty of the liquefaction facilities, likely increasing their ability to obtain  financing. In particular, according to representatives from the five  facilities, the liquefaction capacity being built in the United States has  been contracted out under 20-year contracts to buyers\u2014mostly importers  in Asian countries. Further, these contracts specify that buyers must pay  for liquefaction services provided by the specific facility whether or not  they choose to use all the capacity for which they contracted (that is,  regardless of the amount of gas the customer chooses to have liquefied).", "Investments in facility construction, and the contracting of the associated  capacity, have helped to position the United States as an emerging LNG  exporter. Based on discussions with DOE officials, liquefaction facilities,  and economic consulting firms, the expected level of U.S. exports over  the next several years is tied, among other things, to the amount of  liquefaction capacity of these five facilities. However, the fact that,  according to liquefaction facility representatives, the liquefaction capacity  is already under contract and liquefaction facilities are expected to  receive payments for their full capacity does not mean that the capacity  will necessarily be fully used all the time. Volatility in world market  conditions may at times cause capacity to be underutilized due, for  example, to periods of reduced demand such as during a recession.  Moreover, other world suppliers are expected to enter the market over the  next several years, and this could reduce the relative attractiveness of  U.S. LNG. Even customers that have already purchased liquefaction  capacity may choose not to use all the capacity for which they contracted  from U.S. liquefaction facilities if new supply sources are more  economical. As a result, some market uncertainty exists as to whether the  full U.S. LNG capacity from the five facilities will, in fact, be exported over  the next 20 years, even though liquefaction facility representatives stated  that capacity is already under contract.", "Additional uncertainties regarding U.S. exports of LNG relate to whether  more capacity for liquefaction is likely to be developed beyond the  capacity currently under construction. A number of additional liquefaction  facilities have applied for approval from DOE and FERC in the past few  years, and, as of September 2015, DOE has approved more than 30  companies to export LNG from large-scale liquefaction facilities.  However, based on current demand, representatives from liquefaction  facilities told us that it is unlikely that some of those additional facilities will  ever be built. Thus, while confidence regarding U.S. exports in the next  few years under expected market conditions is driven primarily by the  capacity commitments in liquefaction capability, longer-term forecasts are  more uncertain due to unknowns regarding macroeconomic conditions,  increased exports by other countries, as well as whether additional  liquefaction capacity will be profitable to develop."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customers of U.S. LNG Have Responsibility for Transporting LNG from Liquefaction Facilities", "paragraphs": ["According to representatives from the liquefaction facilities we spoke with,  under current business models and contracts, the costs associated with  importing LNG (including, for example, feed gas, liquefaction services,  and transportation) are separate, and U.S. liquefaction facilities have no  responsibility for shipping LNG. According to representatives at all five  U.S. liquefaction facilities, customers take possession of the LNG at each  facility\u2019s loading terminal, and customers arrange for LNG carriers to  transport the LNG at their own expense. For example, representatives  from one liquefaction facility explained that their customers may contract  for the services of existing LNG carriers on long-term charters or may  contract for construction of new carriers to transport U.S. LNG exports.

According to Coast Guard  officials and representatives from mariner unions we spoke with, LNG  carriers typically require about 20 to 26 mariners to operate, depending  on the type of propulsion system used in the vessel. According to  representatives from mariner unions, this number is a fairly average crew  size for a large ship; in comparison, the average container ship requires  about 20 mariners.

In the shipping industry, there are minimum experience  requirements for working on LNG carriers, as discussed below.  Representatives from mariner unions we spoke with stated that the U.S.  maritime industry has the capacity to accommodate the potential demand  for LNG carrier crews and recruiting mariners would not be an issue.  However, based on requirements for obtaining necessary credentials,  ensuring officers and unlicensed mariners have sufficient experience and  training could take years. According to a representative from one mariner  union we spoke with, unlicensed mariners need to complete a one-week  LNG-carrier training class. However, qualification for employment on LNG  carriers also requires experience working on an LNG carrier. For  example, Coast Guard requirements for a \u201ctankerman\u201d credential  (certification required to work on a tank vessel, including LNG carriers)  include at least 90 days of experience as well as at least 10 loadings or  unloadings of liquid cargo while working on the tanker.  According to  Coast Guard officials, currently there about 300 U.S. mariners holding a  national endorsement as Tankerman\u2010PIC (person in charge) that is valid  for liquefied gas tank vessels. For an LNG carrier, the latter requirement  could take 10 months or more to satisfy. According to representatives  from a shipping brokerage company we spoke with, it could also be  difficult for U.S. mariners to gain the necessary experience aboard a  foreign-flagged LNG carrier (necessary due to the current lack of U.S.- flagged LNG carriers) because of the relatively higher costs associated  with U.S. unlicensed mariners\u2014discussed later in this report\u2014compared  with available foreign mariner crews competing for those jobs.", "Increased employment opportunities for U.S. mariners, if they did occur,  could have benefits related to military readiness. DOD and MARAD  officials told us that any action that increases the number of U.S. mariners  available to operate the reserve sealift fleet is beneficial. However, we  found in August 2015 that while MARAD has stated that there is a need  for additional mariners for military purposes DOD has had a sufficient  number of mariners to meet its past needs.  In fact, we found that  according to Coast Guard data, the number of mariners potentially  qualified to operate the reserve sealift fleet has increased, from 37,702 in  2008 to 54,953 in 2014. While MARAD estimates that only 11,280 of  those mariners are available, we found that MARAD had not fully  analyzed the availability of mariners for a prolonged activation, and we  recommended MARAD conduct a full analysis.

In order to license this technology,  shipyards must pay a licensing fee and successfully complete a  qualification process, which includes building a mock-up of the  containment system, to be certified to build the containment system.  Although some U.S. shipyards are currently gaining experience building  LNG-powered vessels, shipbuilders and others we spoke with stated that  this experience is not comparable to building the large containment  systems required for transporting LNG for trade. Specifically, LNG- powered vessels use containment systems with a capacity of about 900  cubic meters. These systems are generally purchased overseas and  welded onto the vessel. Conversely, according to shipbuilders, LNG  carriers have larger containment systems, with approximately 170,000  cubic meter capacity, that must be constructed within the carrier.", "Based on information from shipbuilders, we found that construction of  LNG carriers in U.S. shipyards presents several challenges that could  likely mean higher costs and longer lead and construction times than  those for Korean shipyards, which currently build most LNG carriers:", "Shipyard infrastructure: Only two of the three shipyards in our  review currently have docks long enough to accommodate  construction of the LNG carriers necessary for international trade  (approximately 1,000 feet long) without substantial capital  improvements.", "Availability: The two shipyards with docks large enough to build  these LNG carriers currently have vessel orders that take up their  shipbuilding capacity through approximately 2018, after which  representatives stated they may be available for building LNG  carriers. However, we believe that given the limited dock space,  orders they may receive in the near term for other types of vessels  may delay future construction of LNG carriers.", "Timeline: Representatives from those two shipyards with docks long  enough to build LNG carriers estimated that it would take about 4 to 5  years to build an LNG carrier from the time of initial contact with a  buyer. According to one representative, the process of building  capacity, preparing for construction, and constructing the first LNG  carrier would include: development of carrier specifications, qualification to build the LNG containment system, detailed design of the carrier, construction of the carrier,  installation of the containment system, and final testing of the carrier and containment system.", "Productivity: Representatives from those two shipyards stated their  shipyard can produce one and two large vessels a year, respectively.  Based on these rates, we estimate it would take over 30 years to build  the 100-carrier fleet potentially needed for U.S. exports. These  shipyard representatives stated that as more carriers are built,  efficiency may increase and construction may gain speed. Increased  efficiency might somewhat reduce the number of years it would take  to provide an adequate fleet for this trade.

According to industry representatives we spoke with, new LNG  carriers built in Korean shipyards, where the majority of LNG carriers are  currently built, are generally priced from $200 to $225 million. Currently,  no U.S. shipyards build LNG carriers, so there are no actual carrier prices  for comparison. However, representatives from the three U.S. shipyards  we spoke with estimated that U.S.-built carriers would cost about two to  three times as much as similar carriers built in Korean shipyards,  depending on factors such as volume.  Based on this range cited by U.S.  shipyards, the cost of U.S.-built LNG carriers could range from $400 to  $675 million. Another factor that contributes to cost differences between  U.S. and Korean shipyards, according to representatives from a shipping  brokerage company we spoke with, is that Korean shipyards have made  capital investments in equipment that increases efficiency such as cranes  that can lift 2,000-4,000 tons, compared to cranes in U.S. shipyards that  can lift 600 tons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "If LNG Customers Contract to Purchase U.S.-Built Carriers, Construction of Those LNG Carriers Could Provide Employment in U.S. Shipyards, according to Shipyard Representatives", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the two U.S. shipyards with sufficient dock space stated that  hiring of U.S. shipyard workers would depend on the number of LNG  carriers ordered and would rely in part on foreign workers.

However, if  they had contracts for a larger number of carriers, they would likely hire  fewer Korean workers, who would gradually be transitioned out as U.S.  workers were trained to complete the work. A representative from the  second shipyard stated that the skills needed to build the LNG  containment system do not exist in their current workforce, so for an order  of two LNG carriers, they would likely hire skilled foreign shipyard workers  to do the work in order to mitigate risk and increase schedule  predictability, even if the costs of employing a foreign workforce may be  slightly higher than using U.S. workers. Representatives also stated that  they would be unlikely to increase capacity by opening another shipyard  to build LNG carriers alongside other vessels, so they might not hire any  additional new workers.

Based  on employment estimating tools from BLS, construction of a $450-million  ship (as noted above, a conservative estimate of the cost to build an LNG  carrier in the United States) is associated with 1,675 jobs in the  shipbuilding industry. However there are a number of caveats associated  with this estimate. For example, the numbers in BLS\u2019s estimates  represent averages for all types of ship and boat building, and are not  specific to LNG carriers. Additionally, the number of shipbuilding workers  would likely remain steady across the production of multiple ships over  time, so it would not provide new jobs for every additional carrier ordered.

Representatives from  liquefaction companies, shipping companies, and an economic consulting  company we spoke with currently expect U.S. LNG exports from the  United States over the coming years to be transported on carriers built in  foreign countries\u2014primarily Korea and Japan.

Our conversations with the 3 shipbuilders and 2  shipping companies have suggested that the purchase price of a U.S.- built LNG carrier is likely to be at least double\u2014and could be significantly  more\u2014the cost of an LNG carrier constructed in South Korea. In addition,  operating costs for U.S.-flagged carriers would be higher than for  internationally flagged carriers. According to a 2011 MARAD study, U.S.  crews are generally more highly paid than international crews and certain  other operating costs associated with U.S. flagging requirements, such as  insurance costs, are also higher. The study found that operations costs of  U.S.-flagged vessels of various types were, on average, about 2.7 times  that of foreign-flagged carriers. However, based on our discussions with  one mariner union, the differential for the costs of crewing U.S-flagged  LNG carriers compared to international carriers may be less than the cost  differential for the types of vessels MARAD surveyed. This is because,  according to three mariner unions we spoke with, LNG carriers require  more highly skilled mariners, so crew costs for international LNG carriers  are generally higher than crew costs on other types of ocean-going  vessels.", "The higher costs of building and operating U.S. LNG carriers may make it  more challenging for shippers to obtain financing for construction of U.S.- built carriers than for carriers built in other countries. A critical question  regarding any large capital project is whether potential investors believe  that the asset will be profitable enough to warrant the investment,  particularly if financial returns carry substantial risk. To better understand  the cost implications of a requirement that U.S. LNG exports be carried  on U.S.-built-and-flagged carriers, we conducted an analysis designed to  develop a general estimate of the additional shipping revenues that  investors must believe will be earned over the life of the investment to  provide reasonable certainty that the investment is financially viable.   Although we do not have data to conduct a detailed estimate, by making  some hypothetical assumptions we are able to provide an illustration of  the potential cost impact of a U.S.-built-and-flagged carrier requirement  for LNG exports, if all other factors remain equal.

This suggests an annual capacity of over 23-trillion  British thermal units (Btu) of energy per LNG export carrier.", "We found that, under these assumptions, the additional transportation  costs associated with a U.S.-built-and-flagged LNG carrier would be  roughly $0.73 per MMBtu of delivered energy product. Based on our  discussions with U.S. liquefaction companies, we understand that an  estimated shipping rate for LNG from the U.S. to market destinations in  Asia is roughly $3.00 per MMBtu under the status quo market  environment, suggesting that a requirement for U.S.-built-and-flagged  carriers to transport U.S. LNG would be associated with about 24-percent  higher shipping rates if all of the additional cost were passed on to the  buyer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Transportation Costs Would Reduce U.S. Competitiveness in the LNG Market", "paragraphs": ["Higher shipping rates likely associated with U.S.-built-and-flagged carriers  would decrease the competitiveness of U.S. LNG, but the extent to which  this would occur and its effects are uncertain. As we have noted, world  supply and demand conditions determine the extent to which there is a  market for U.S. LNG exports, and those conditions would be affected by  higher shipping costs for U.S. LNG exports. The increase in shipping  costs may increase the delivered price for U.S. LNG relative to non-US  LNG and other energy sources. A higher relative price may in turn reduce  demand for U.S LNG. However, it is difficult to know the extent to which  these added costs would affect U.S. LNG exports because of the variety  of additional supply and demand factors that may also affect purchasers\u2019  decisions.", "First, leaving aside the higher cost of U.S. LNG to purchasers, the  shipyard capacity in the United States could present a major limiting  factor for accommodating U.S. exports under a U.S.-built-and-flagged  requirement. As we noted earlier, the U.S. shipbuilding industry does not  have the capacity to build the carriers needed for the expected level of  this trade in the near term so it will take many years for enough carriers to  be built to service the expected level of exports. As such, the manner in  which any U.S.-built requirement is implemented would be a critical  element in the market consequence of this requirement. If U.S.-built  carriers were required within, for example, 5 years of the requirement\u2019s  passage, total carrier capacity available to ship LNG would itself be a  major limiting factor for exports. Because capacity would likely only be  able to come online gradually over more than 3 decades, limited LNG  would likely be exported for some period of time, requiring purchasers to  import from other sources in the early and intermediate years. This  reduction in the currently planned exports of U.S. LNG may cause the  U.S. export industry to not develop as currently planned\u2014particularly if  liquefaction facilities were unable to enforce provisions of their contracts  that require them to pay regardless of services used (see further  discussion below). Moreover, in the interim years, importers may be  developing new sources for their product and contracting for long-term  purchases from these other suppliers. Such circumstances would likely  undermine any substantial development of U.S. exports. However, the  ability to reflag international carriers to the U.S. flag might be able to  occur in a more timely fashion such that this ability to reflag could mitigate  a substantial impact on exports related to LNG carrier availability if the  requirement for U.S.-built carriers were phased in over a longer term.", "A second factor that may influence the market effect of this requirement  relates to customers\u2019 existing financial commitments. As discussed  previously, according to representatives of liquefaction facilities, all of the  LNG liquefaction capacity for U.S. exports is already committed under 20- year contracts\u2014that is, customers have already agreed to pay for  liquefaction services for a long period of time whether they fully use the  service or not. Additionally, according to liquefaction companies we spoke  with, some of these customers have contracted to lease foreign-built  carriers on a long-term basis and/or have contracted for the construction  of new carriers in foreign shipyards for the transport of U.S. LNG. These  existing financial commitments may constrain the manner in which these  purchasers can adjust their business plans in response to a U.S. carrier  requirement.", "Several stakeholders told us that implementation of the proposed  requirement and associated increases in transportation costs could  prompt customers to attempt to modify, renegotiate, or terminate their  liquefaction contracts. Specifically, according to two liquefaction  companies and a representative from an economic research and  consulting company, customers might try to excuse their contractual  obligations by invoking contract law doctrines such as force majeure  (generally defined as unforeseeable circumstances outside the control of  the contract parties that prevent compliance with a contract) or  impracticability (generally defined as where contract performance of an  act  can only be rendered at excessive or  unreasonable difficulty). While the outcome of such potential litigation is  uncertain, any litigation could create delays and add to market  uncertainty, which may, in turn, reduce the market for U.S. LNG. If  customers are able to modify, renegotiate, or terminate these contracts,  the liquefaction facilities would likely experience reduced profits, which  might adversely affect their operations.", "Similarly, purchasers would need to be able to finance the U.S.-built LNG  carriers to be able to continue their plans to purchase U.S. LNG. As we  noted, the increased cost of U.S.-built vessels could make it more  challenging to finance these vessels. Moreover, existing commitments to  lease or contract for foreign-built tankers could add an additional  obstacle. If customers are not able to modify, renegotiate, or terminate  contracts for leased tankers or for the building of new tankers in foreign  shipyards, customers\u2019 ability to purchase U.S. LNG may be constrained  because they may not be able to finance additional tankers built in the  United States.

Reduced or eliminated exports would  render some or all of the capacity in liquefaction facilities unnecessary, so  some jobs that have been or are expected to be created in these facilities  would be lost. For example, representatives from one facility stated that  they expect to employ more than 200 individuals once the facility  becomes operational. Further, if contracts for the purchase of liquefaction  were modified, renegotiated, or terminated by customers (for example,  through the litigation process or through default), these facilities could be  less profitable, which could lead to financial implications for their  investors. Further, as discussed above, the potential gain in jobs in the  shipbuilding and mariner occupations that the carrier requirement would  be designed to promote might not be fully realized if U.S. LNG exports  were reduced. If, for example, the market for U.S. LNG were eliminated,  no LNG carriers would need to be built in the United States.", "In addition, in the gas extraction industry, any reduction in exports would  likely cause a small loss in the number of jobs, since there would be  reduced demand for natural gas supplies.  Another possible effect of  reduced U.S. exports would be reduced revenues for oil and gas  companies involved in energy extraction, which could have a further  effect of reduced investments by these companies.

We identified economic  research and consulting firms for interviews based on work they  performed relevant to this topic. We determined that reports issued by  those companies were reliable for our purposes based on our reading of  the methods and analysis used as described in their published reports.

To  describe stakeholder views on the extent to which the requirement of  U.S.-flagged-and-built carriers for LNG exports would affect jobs in the  maritime, shipbuilding, and other related sectors, we collected and  analyzed information on the capability and capacity of U.S. shipbuilders  and estimated costs and requirements to build and operate LNG carriers  based on documentary and testimonial evidence from selected maritime  industry stakeholders. These stakeholders include representatives of  three shipbuilding companies; two shipping companies (one shipbroker  and one LNG carrier operator); the four major marine officer and  unlicensed mariner unions in the United States; and officials from DOE,  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Maritime Administration (MARAD),  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S Coast Guard, and Department of  Labor (DOL). We selected maritime stakeholders (including shipbuilders,  mariner unions, and shipping companies) for interview based on  recommendations from government and industry stakeholders and  capacity to provide services related to LNG carrier construction and  operation. For instance, we selected the shipping companies based on  the fact that they are currently involved in shipping LNG. We selected  U.S. shipbuilders from a list of 11 large and active shipbuilding companies  in the United States as of April 2015 based on their stated interest and  capacity to build LNG carriers.

This suggests an annual capacity of just over 23 million  MMBtu of energy per LNG export carrier.", "For the purposes of estimating the potential costs of the proposed  requirement, we made what we believe to be conservative estimates,  including estimates of the cost of building LNG carriers in the United  States and the costs of operating those carriers, in order to ensure that  we do not overstate those potential cost effects. Due to the hypothetical  nature of the proposed requirement as well as challenges related to  predicting market outcomes, the estimated cost impacts are meant to be  solely illustrative and should not be taken as a prediction. We interviewed  U.S. Trade Representative officials and industry stakeholders regarding  potential implications for U.S. trade. Additionally, we interviewed the U.S.  Coast Guard and selected (as described above) U.S. LNG liquefaction  companies and shipping companies regarding potential security  implications for LNG customers related to transporting LNG via U.S.- flagged-and-built carriers.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Catherine Colwell, Assistant Director;  Amy Abramowitz; Pedro Almoguera; Ben Bolitzer; Ken Bombara; Brian  Chung; Katie Hamer; Geoff Hamilton; Delwen Jones; Sara Ann  Moessbauer; Josh Ormond; and Oliver Richard made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
