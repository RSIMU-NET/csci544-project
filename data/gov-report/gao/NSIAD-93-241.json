The DOPMA legislation outlines standards and procedures relating to the appointment, promotion, separation and retirement of officers in the armed forces. For example, it stipulates how long officers of various ranks may remain on active duty beyond normal retirement eligibility at 20 years. It also prescribes the number of officers each service is authorized in each of the senior ranks from the 0-4 to the 0-6 pay grades, a number that will vary depending on officer end strengths authorized by the Congress.", "Central to DOPMA is the up-or-out promotion system in which officers generally advance in groups or cohorts originally determined by the year of their commissioning and compete for promotion against other members of the group at set years or zones of consideration for each paygrade. For example, an officer commissioned in 1983 would normally be considered for promotion to paygrade 0-4 in 1993, at the year 10 mark along with other officers in that year group or cohort. Under the DOPMA system, a select group of the 0-3 officers from a particular cohort can be considered for promotion \u201cbelow the zone,\u201d that is at year 9 (or earlier in selected instances) along with members from that year\u2019s cohort of officers.

Of those opting for the financial incentive separations in fiscal year 1992, 87 percent chose SSB. DOD officials expect this trend to continue.

However, each of the services has used the incentives in varying degrees to achieve downsizing objectives as well as to shape its officer and enlisted forces.", "Army officials explained that the Army has offered the incentives to all eligible officers, except for those in the medical skills area. In some instances, the Army has offered the incentives to officers in certain year groups; this was predicated on the knowledge that if sufficient numbers of persons did not elect to accept the incentives, a RIF would be required. During fiscal year 1993, the Army targeted officers in pay grade 0-3 who were in year groups 1983 and 1984; in fiscal year 1994, it expects to target 0-3s in year group 1985. The Army will also offer the incentives to officers who fail their first board consideration for promotion to 0-4 during the respective fiscal years.", "The Navy did not begin using the incentives for its officers until fiscal year 1993, when it offered them to various officer communities within pay grades 0-3 and 0-4. In fiscal year 1994, the Navy plans to offer the incentives to various officer communities in pay grades 0-3 through 0-5. The Marine Corps originally targeted officers in overstrength specialties in pay grade 0-4 to improve promotion flows. In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, it has offered and expects to continue offering incentives to persons in the 0-3 pay grade as well. The Air Force has made offers to most of its 0-3s and 0-4s, except pilots. In fiscal year 1994, the Air Force is planning to target its 0-4s, including pilots.", "In terms of enlisted personnel, all of the services are using the incentives to help reduce personnel in overstrength skill areas and in other areas in some cases. The Army has offered the incentives to enlisted members in over-strength skills and to members who are subject to separation under changing policies limiting how long personnel can remain on active duty without being promoted. The Navy originally used the incentives to target mid-grade (pay grades E-5 and E-6) members in overstrength specialties, and in fiscal year 1994, it is expanding the eligibility to target overstrength specialties in pay grades E-4 through E-9. The Marine Corps has used the incentives to target enlisted members who were in skill areas no longer needed and to reduce overstrength areas. The Air Force initially offered the incentives primarily to mid-grade (pay grades E-4 and E-5) personnel who had more than 9 years of service and were in less critical skill areas, but for fiscal year 1994, it plans to target personnel in pay grade E-5. It also plans to open up the eligibility criteria incrementally, as necessary.", "The services\u2019 use of these incentives accounted for 13 percent of overall service separations in fiscal year 1992, and their use is expected to account for 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. According to OSD, the decreasing numbers in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 reflect the fact that most persons interested in the incentives have taken them and that the base of eligible personnel is lessening. The base of eligible persons grows smaller each year since a service member must have had between 6 and 20 years of service as of December 5, 1991, when the legislation became law. Thus, the total population of potentially eligible personnel is decreasing yearly. Additionally, this legislation only authorizes the use of these incentives through fiscal year 1995. As of now, the Navy is projecting that its 0-3 officer population in the 1987 year group is in excess of requirements. Regardless of additional reductions in authorized end-strength levels resulting from the recent Bottom-up Review, the 1987 year group contains approximately 2,000 officers more than DOPMA 0-4 limitations will allow to be promoted without causing an imbalance. This means that around fiscal year 1996 the Navy will be faced with either implementing RIF actions or seeking temporary legislative waivers to DOPMA grade tables to permit the promotion of a greater number of personnel than would otherwise occur.
