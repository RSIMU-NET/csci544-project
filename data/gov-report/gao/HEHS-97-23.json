HCFA does review HMO marketing and informational materials to prevent false or misleading claims and to ensure that certain provider access restrictions are noted.

The following complaint to HCFA about a Miami HMO illustrates beneficiary confusion over HMO restrictions.", "CareFlorida marketed its plan to an 81-year-old woman who subsequently enrolled in the plan effective February 1994, although she traveled regularly to a distant state. In her first months of membership, she visited her doctor, who was with the HMO. When she later visited a non-network physician who had also been her regular provider, Medicare denied her claims. She then requested to disenroll and told HCFA that if she had understood the requirement to visit specific providers, she would not have enrolled in the HMO. HCFA disenrolled the beneficiary from the plan effective with her use of non-network providers. This left her responsible for about $700 in out-of-plan charges.", "Other typical misunderstandings cited by HCFA staff and local insurance counselors include not understanding restrictions on access to specialists or other services nor restrictions to a specific medical group in an HMO\u2019s provider network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some HMO Sales Practices Are Clearly Abusive", "paragraphs": ["Medicare regulations prohibit certain marketing practices, such as activities that mislead, confuse, or misrepresent; door-to-door solicitation; and gifts or payments used to influence enrollment decisions.

Although HCFA staff could not measure the frequency of sales abuses, they expressed concern about continuing complaints of apparent abuses by sales agents.", "A recurring complaint, according to HCFA staff, is from beneficiaries whose signatures on enrollment forms are acquired under false pretenses. Many of these beneficiaries mistakenly believed that the form they signed\u2014actually an enrollment form\u2014was a request for more information or that it confirmed attendance at a sales presentation. In 1991, HCFA investigated the marketing practices of an HMO after receiving complaints and noting a high rate of retroactive disenrollments. The complaints alleged that sales agents were asking beneficiaries to sign a form indicating the agent had made a presentation. In fact, the document was an enrollment form.", "A recent case documented by HCFA staff is one in which at least 20 beneficiaries were inappropriately enrolled in an HMO after attending the same sales seminar in August 1995. The beneficiaries thought they were signing up to receive more information but later discovered the sales agent had enrolled them in the plan.", "In other cases, beneficiaries\u2019 signatures were forged. In January 1995, for example, a beneficiary was notified by his medical group before an appointment that he was now enrolled in another plan. The beneficiary had no idea how this could be as he had not intended to change plans.

In 1988, 1991, and 1995, we reported on the agency\u2019s pattern of ineffective oversight of HMOs violating Medicare requirements for marketing, beneficiary appeal rights, and quality assurance. Table 3.2 illustrates the weakness of HCFA\u2019s responses in addressing one Florida HMO\u2019s persistent problems.

However, HCFA does not routinely and systematically analyze these data. HCFA has uncovered problems with HMOs\u2019 sales operations during routine visits to monitor contract compliance or when regional staff have noticed an unusual amount of complaints or disenrollments.", "The HHS OIG recently recommended that systematically developed disenrollment data be used in conjunction with surveys of beneficiaries to improve HCFA\u2019s monitoring of HMOs. The OIG found that higher disenrollment rates correlated with higher beneficiary survey responses of poor service. Enrollees who said they got poor service and whose complaints were not taken seriously were more likely to come from HMOs with higher disenrollment rates. In contrast to the other surveyed HMOs, those with the five highest disenrollment rates were 1.5 times more likely to have beneficiaries report poor service (18 percent versus 12 percent).", "Although HCFA can identify HMOs with sales and marketing problems, it lacks the information to identify specific sales agents who might be at fault. HCFA does not routinely require HMOs to match disenrollment and complaint statistics to individual sales agents. In fact, HCFA made clear in 1991 that oversight standards for sales agents dealing with Medicare beneficiaries would be left largely to the states. States\u2019 regulation and oversight of sales agents vary, although 32 states require HMO sales agents to be licensed. Representatives of the Florida Department of Insurance and its HMO monitoring unit said their oversight, beyond agent licensing, consisted of responding to specific complaints. One official commented that sales agents have to do something egregious to have their licenses revoked.", "HCFA\u2019s HMO manual suggests specific practices that HMOs could employ to minimize marketing problems. These suggestions include verifying an applicant\u2019s intent to enroll through someone independent of the sales agent, using rapid disenrollment data to identify agents whose enrollees have unusually high rates, and basing commissions and bonuses on sustained enrollment. HCFA staff said that some plans have implemented sales oversight like that suggested by HCFA, but others have not. Regional staff noted that plans are more likely to implement HCFA suggestions if they are trying to get approval for a contract application or service area expansion. Some HCFA regions have succeeded more than others in getting HMOs to improve their oversight of marketing agents.", "Publishing disenrollment data could encourage problem HMOs to reform their sales practices and more closely monitor their agents. Agents\u2019 compensation often includes incentives such as commissions for each beneficiary they enroll. HMOs could structure their compensation to give agents a greater incentive to adequately inform beneficiaries about managed care in general and their plan in particular. For example, some HMOs pay commissions on the basis of a beneficiary\u2019s remaining enrolled for a certain number of months. Several HMOs expressed concern that they did not know how their disenrollment rates compared with those of their competitors. Plan managers have told HCFA staff and us that comparative disenrollment information is useful performance feedback.", "Medicare HMOs do not compete on the basis of retention rates (low disenrollment rates) because these rates are not publicized.

In contrast, other large purchasers\u2014including the federal government for its employees\u2014ease their beneficiaries\u2019 decision-making by providing summary charts comparing plans.", "In addition, by not providing consumers with comparative information, Medicare fails to capitalize on market forces and complement HCFA\u2019s regulatory approach to seeking good HMO performance. In an ideal market, informed consumers prod competitors to offer the best value. Without good comparative information, however, consumers are less able to determine the best value. HMOs have less incentive to compete on service to beneficiaries when satisfaction or other indicators of performance are not published. Wide distribution of HMO-specific disenrollment and other data could make Medicare\u2019s HMO markets more like an ideal market and better ensure that consumers\u2019 interests are served.", "HCFA could also make better use of indicators to improve its oversight of HMOs. By establishing benchmarks and measuring HMOs\u2019 performance against them, HCFA could focus on plans whose statistics indicate potential problems\u2014for example, on HMOs with high disenrollment rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In August 1995, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS direct the HCFA Administrator to develop a new, more consumer-oriented strategy for administering Medicare\u2019s HMO program.

Although HCFA has announced plans to gather new data, it has no plans to analyze and distribute to beneficiaries the data on HMOs it currently collects. Therefore, we are both renewing our previous recommendations and recommending specific steps that the Secretary of HHS should take to help Medicare beneficiaries make informed health care decisions.", "The Secretary should direct the HCFA Administrator to require standard formats and terminology for important aspects of HMOs\u2019 informational materials for beneficiaries, including benefits descriptions; require that all literature distributed by Medicare HMOs follow these produce benefit and cost comparison charts with all Medicare options available for each market area; and widely publicize the availability of the charts to all beneficiaries in markets served by Medicare HMOs and ensure that beneficiaries considering an HMO are notified of the charts\u2019 availability.", "The Secretary should also direct the HCFA Administrator to annually analyze, compare, and distribute widely HMOs\u2019 voluntary disenrollment rates, including cancellations, disenrollment within 3 months, disenrollment after 12 months, total disenrollment, retroactive disenrollment, and rate of return to fee for service; rate of inquiries and complaints per thousand enrollees; and summary results of HCFA\u2019s monitoring visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["HHS agreed that \u201cMedicare beneficiaries need more information and that informed beneficiaries can hold plans accountable for the quality of care.\u201d HHS noted several HCFA initiatives that will eventually yield information to help beneficiaries choose plans right for their needs. We believe that these initiatives move in the right direction but that HCFA could do more for beneficiaries with information the agency already collects. The full text of HHS\u2019 comments appears in appendix III.", "HHS outlined HCFA\u2019s efforts to produce HMO comparison charts that will initially contain HMO costs and benefits and later may also include other plan-specific information\u2014such as the results of HMOs\u2019 satisfaction surveys. HCFA expects advocates and insurance counselors, not beneficiaries, to be the primary users of this information. HCFA plans to make the charts \u201cavailable to any individual or organization with electronic access.\u201d Information in an electronic form can easily be updated\u2014a distinct advantage in a market that is evolving as quickly as Medicare HMOs.

The guideline, to be implemented beginning in January 1997, will detail specific content areas to be covered in all Medicare HMO marketing materials. The guideline, as currently drafted, however, will not require standard formats or terminology and thus may not alleviate many of the difficulties beneficiaries now face when comparing HMOs\u2019 marketing materials.", "Regarding our recommendation that disenrollment data be made available to beneficiaries, HHS stated that HCFA is evaluating different ways to express and present disenrollment rates. HHS cautioned that a careful analysis of disenrollment is necessary before meaningful conclusions can be drawn. We did not find such an analysis to be difficult or overly time consuming. Our recommendation is to publish disenrollment rates and let beneficiaries decide if, as we found in Los Angeles, a 42-percent annual disenrollment rate is meaningful in a market where competing HMOs have disenrollment rates of 4 percent.", "In short, HHS stated that HMO-specific information currently collected by HCFA could not be made publicly available until additional evaluation, data analysis, or development of data systems are complete. Even after this work is completed, however, the agency has no plans to distribute HMO-specific information directly to beneficiaries or ensure that they know such information is available.
