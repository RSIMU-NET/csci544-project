You also asked us to examine the European Union (EU), Canadian, and Japanese use of quotas under MFA and ATC and their processes for imposing quotas. In addition, you asked us to describe the safeguard process administered by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the U.S. textile and apparel (clothing) industries, including yarn, fabric, apparel, and a variety of home furnishings and industrial products, have faced intense competition in the U.S. marketplace from countries with low labor costs. Textile and apparel imports represented  7 percent of total U.S. imports in 1994. In that same year, there was a $34-billion trade deficit in textile and apparel products. (See app. I for data concerning the U.S. textile and apparel industries.)", "CITA is chaired by the Department of Commerce and composed of representatives from the Departments of State, Labor, and the Treasury; and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). CITA was established in 1972 to supervise the implementation of all U.S. international textile agreements. (See app. II for a discussion of CITA\u2019s role.) One of CITA\u2019s main functions is to decide whether and when to impose quotas on textile and apparel products. Because these products have historically been vulnerable to low-priced imports, textile and apparel trade has not been subject to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) disciplines (practices). Rather, textile trade has been primarily governed by successive multilateral agreements that set forth a separate framework of rules, including the authority to impose quotas.", "From 1974 though 1994, CITA supervised the U.S. implementation of MFA, which governed worldwide textile trade and sought to provide for its sustained, orderly expansion. Among other things, under MFA, the United States entered into a number of bilateral agreements containing negotiated textile import quota levels. MFA also contained a \u201csafeguard\u201d provision, which allowed importing countries to impose unilateral quotas when it determined that imports were causing actual or threatened serious damage to the U.S. domestic market based on factors specified in MFA. CITA is now responsible for supervising the U.S. implementation of ATC. Along with continuing its role of implementing textile agreements, under ATC, CITA is to supervise a 10-year phaseout of textile and apparel quotas in four stages ending in 2005. ATC will have a major long-term impact on the U.S. textile and apparel industry by integrating all textile products into GATT rules and disciplines.", "During the first stage (1995-97), virtually no products currently under quota are to be integrated into GATT trade rules by any of the major importing countries. That is, the products integrated in the first stage are products that have never been under quota. The U.S. Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) accompanying the Uruguay Round implementing legislation provided that CITA would ensure that integration of the most sensitive products would be deferred until the end of the 10-year period. In fact, under the U.S. integration schedule, 89 percent of all U.S. apparel products (apparel products are considered sensitive), 47 percent of all textile products (textile products are considered less sensitive), and 67 percent of textile and apparel products combined, under quota in 1990, will not be integrated until the final stage in 2005. Importer and retailer representatives have referred to the final stage as \u201cthe cliff,\u201d because of the potential shock to the U.S. domestic market when a majority of textile and apparel quotas will be lifted at one time.", "During the 10-year transition period, the United States may impose a temporary quota on another World Trade Organization (WTO) member country under ATC only through the use of a \u201ctransitional safeguard.\u201d This safeguard applies to products not yet integrated into GATT rules. After determining that imports of a particular product are causing \u201cserious damage or actual threat thereof\u201d to domestic producers, CITA issues a \u201ccall,\u201d or a request for consultations to discuss the matter with an exporting country believed to be causing the damage. Following the consultations, CITA may impose a quota\u2014with or without the agreement of the exporting country. (See app. III for detailed information on ATC and MFA.)", "As of May 1996, CITA had 884 quotas in place on individual textile and apparel categories. These quotas covered 44 countries and 123 out of 148 CITA categories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CITA\u2019s Authority, Functions, Resources, and Costs", "paragraphs": ["CITA has broad authority to carry out its main function of regulating textile imports on behalf of the United States through implementing textile agreements, including determining the existence of serious damage to support a safeguard action. This mandate remains the same under ATC as it was under MFA.", "The U.S. Constitution vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce between the United States and foreign nations. In the case of textiles and apparel, Congress has granted to the President extraordinary discretion to regulate U.S. imports. The President, in turn, has delegated authority for implementing textile agreements to CITA. Neither Congress, nor the President since 1989, has provided procedural requirements to guide CITA in making its safeguard determinations. Moreover, CITA\u2019s decisions are conclusive and are not reviewed or approved by other executive branch officials. Finally, given that CITA has been allowed significant discretion to regulate textile imports, courts have held that CITA\u2019s serious damage determinations and the underlying reasoning for those determinations are not subject to judicial scrutiny.", "According to CITA officials, CITA\u2019s primary function under ATC is to \u201censure that there is a gradual and orderly liberalization of trade which will allow U.S. companies sufficient time to further modernize and prepare for greater international competition.\u201d During the 10-year transition period, CITA can issue calls under the ATC transitional safeguard mechanism. Bilateral agreements in place with WTO members under MFA are now folded into ATC, obviating the need for CITA to renegotiate these agreements.", "CITA is expected also to continue performing many other pre-ATC functions. The committee will continue to participate in negotiations (led by USTR) for bilateral quota agreements with non-WTO member countries. It also has a role in efforts aimed at preventing the illegal routing of textile and apparel imports through third countries (transshipment violations) and commenting on regulations concerning the origin of textile and apparel products.", "CITA has no budget of its own, but portions of the individual budgets of the five principal agencies related to CITA functions added up to $3.6 million in fiscal year 1995. The Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) has a staff of 41, 33 of whom support CITA\u2019s operations, monitoring and analyzing textile trade and production data. About  17 percent (or $2.8 million) of OTEXA\u2019s budget supports CITA operations.OTEXA\u2019s resources and costs remained constant between fiscal years 1994 and 1995, the first year of ATC. CITA does not expect to undergo any significant reduction in its work load in the near term due specifically to the 10-year quota phaseout, according to representatives of the five CITA agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decision-making Process for Imposing Quotas", "paragraphs": ["CITA is proactive in determining whether to impose a quota, relying heavily on OTEXA\u2019s continuous monitoring and analysis of trade and economic data as a source for its information. OTEXA\u2019s data monitoring generally provides the impetus for CITA to issue a call. Although OTEXA considers an array of data, it focuses primarily on two factors: a surge in imports and a decline in domestic production. OTEXA also examines some other economic factors listed in ATC, including domestic employment, prices, and market share. Under U.S. law, CITA does not have procedural requirements it must follow to determine whether to make a call. To date, CITA has not published guidelines or documented procedures that describe its decision-making process for imposing quotas.", "Once OTEXA\u2019s analysis identifies a potential case of serious damage, OTEXA may contact domestic producers to obtain additional information on the effect of imports on the domestic industry. OTEXA then prepares a proposal (also known as a \u201cstatement of serious damage or actual threat thereof\u201d and referred to hereafter as a \u201cmarket statement\u201d) for CITA to request consultations with an exporting country. The proposal serves as the basis for CITA to vote on whether to request consultations with a foreign government.", "According to CITA officials, the committee currently uses majority voting to make decisions on calls. Generally speaking, each CITA agency considers the need for import restraints while taking into account the concerns of U.S. industry, workers, importers and retailers, consumers. However, each agency brings a unique perspective to the decision process. Commerce and Labor consider the interests of textile and apparel producers and workers, State evaluates U.S. foreign policy concerns, and the Treasury analyzes the net economic benefit to consumers, producers, and importers and retailers. (The Treasury is also concerned with the appropriateness and enforceability of CITA recommendations and directives.) Some balancing of views is provided by USTR. In theory, if CITA decided by consensus, one CITA principal would have the ability to block a request for consultation. For example, CITA principals did not reach consensus on 64, or about 30 percent, of the 204 votes taken on whether to impose a quota from 1990 through 1995, since these votes were not unanimous. CITA is not required to publish its voting records or minutes of its monthly meetings, and it does not do so.", "If CITA votes in favor of issuing a call, the committee requests consultations with the exporting country through diplomatic note to impose a quota. Under ATC, once the exporting country receives the note, the two governments have 60 days to consult. No quota is put in place during the consultation period.", "Once CITA contacts the exporting country to request consultations, OTEXA publishes in the Federal Register details of the request, a summary of the market statement supporting the call, and a request for written comments from interested parties. Before the consultations take place, CITA also notifies and generally schedules meetings with both U.S domestic producers and importers and retailers to brief them and obtain their input.", "For a number of years, importers and retailers have advocated the use of open, public hearings that would allow for public comment before CITA makes a decision on whether to call a foreign government. Importers and retailers currently have an opportunity to provide input after CITA requests consultations with a foreign government but not to comment before a call is made. However, according to CITA officials, if importers and retailers were notified before a call is made, imports might surge further as firms attempt to import products before a quota is applied, and domestic producers might subsequently be hurt. Although importers and retailers maintain that they would not have enough time to place an import order and thereby enhance an import surge, CITA officials have not been convinced by this argument.", "U.S. importers and retailers and domestic producers also disagree about the amount of information OTEXA provides them about consultations after the call is made. Importers and retailers said they are not provided with as much information as domestic producers about upcoming consultations; on the other hand, domestic producers said that, in their view, importers and retailers receive additional information from the foreign exporting country involved in the consultations. CITA does not keep written records of its meetings or contacts with industry representatives, so the amount of information provided to domestic producers and the importer and retailing community cannot be determined. (See app. IV for further information on CITA\u2019s decision-making process.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CITA\u2019s Data Sources", "paragraphs": ["In deciding whether to impose quotas, CITA uses government statistics collected by the U.S. Customs Service, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These statistics are subject to the internal quality control processes of the three agencies. OTEXA officials attempt to match these data, including production, domestic price, and employment data, to CITA\u2019s product categories. However, because Customs, Census, and BLS use different methods to collect their data, some compatibility problems occur when OTEXA attempts to make this match. CITA\u2019s textile and apparel categories consist of combinations of International Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes, but not all of the previously mentioned government agencies collect the data under an HTS-based system.", "While Customs collects import data using HTS, the Census Bureau collects production and domestic price data using Census\u2019 product descriptions. BLS collects employment data using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) product codes. We found that OTEXA can match the production data with a high degree of accuracy, but for price and employment data this matching is necessarily done with a much lesser degree of accuracy. Therefore, while import and production data were generally reliable and valid, price and employment data may only provide OTEXA with broad indications of trends in the domestic textile and apparel industries. (See app. V for more information on OTEXA\u2019s data collection.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How CITA Uses Data to Support Calls", "paragraphs": ["In the 166 market statements we examined for calls CITA issued between 1990 and 1995, we found that the committee relied primarily on data contained in OTEXA market statements for evidence of import surges and production declines, and to a lesser degree on price and employment data. CITA officials told us that they exercise considerable judgment, treat their determinations on a case-by-case basis, and apply no specific numerical threshold (such as a minimum increase in imports or a minimum decline in production) in making their decisions.", "Our review of import increases and production falls in the 166 market statements indicated the following:", "CITA issued calls when production declined by a median of 6.4 percent during the most recent period for which this data were available, while comparable yearly imports of a particular category of textiles or apparel increased by a median of 9.6 percent. The most recent median import increase was 17.6 percent. The change in the most recent import data ranged from a decrease of 15 percent to an increase of 195 percent. The change in domestic production ranged from a decrease of 51 percent to an increase of 25 percent.", "CITA did not issue calls in some cases where there were import increases and production falls. In examining annual import and production data between 1992 and 1994 for 94 CITA categories, including categories both called and not called, no calls were made in 21 instances where yearly production fell in a category by more than 5 percent and yearly imports rose in a category by 5 percent or more.", "CITA issued some calls when either domestic production fell or import increases were fairly small. For example, 26 percent of the calls occurred when the most recent year\u2019s production declines were less than 2 percent; 20 percent of the calls occurred when the most recent year\u2019s import increases were less than 2 percent. Both small production declines and small import increases occurred at the same time in less than 4 percent of the calls.", "CITA requested consultations with countries whose imports of the product in question represented a median of 2.5 percent of total U.S. imports of that commodity in the most recent 12 months for which data were available. The percent of total imports from individual countries ranged from 0.09 percent to 84 percent.", "In the 166 market statements we reviewed, CITA assumed a causal link between import rises and production falls because, according to OTEXA officials, this link is extremely difficult to prove. CITA also assumed in the market statements that textile and apparel imported products falling under the same CITA product category were like and/or competitive products to those being produced by domestic manufacturers of items under that category. However, we found that the HTS codes under some CITA categories represent varied products. Since CITA imposes quotas at the category level, all of the items under that category then become the product subject to quota. For example, in a 1995 call, CITA requested consultations with India over imports of category 435\u2014women\u2019s and girls\u2019 wool coats\u2014and imposed a quota. Category 435 includes suit-type jackets as well as overcoats and ski jackets. Thus, the quota was imposed not only on wool coats but also on suit-type jackets and ski jackets. (CITA later rescinded the restraint.) The producer prices of some HTS codes within CITA categories also varied, illustrating that the products may not be like and/or directly competitive.

Under ATC, all safeguard decisions are to be reviewed by a newly created international Textiles Monitoring Body in Geneva, consisting of representatives from 10 countries, including the United States. TMB supervises the implementation of ATC. Among other responsibilities, TMB conducts examinations of all safeguard actions, including those involving disputes and those resulting in agreements, and makes appropriate recommendations. To date, TMB has completed its review of seven of the U.S. calls (where initially no agreement was reached with the exporting country) and found that the United States had demonstrated the threat of serious damage to domestic industry attributable to the called country in one case. In three cases, TMB found that the United States had not demonstrated serious damage to its domestic industry, and the United States subsequently rescinded the quotas; in three other cases, TMB could not reach consensus.", "TMB has not published details about the reasons for its recommendations, but some individual TMB members expressed concerns to us about the nature and timing of the 1995 U.S. calls (as of May 1996, the United States was the only country that had imposed quotas under ATC). Some TMB members told us that they considered ATC a liberalizing agreement and, thus, had not expected over 20 calls early in its first year. Although 28 calls was not unusually large compared to the number of calls made in previous years under MFA, some TMB members were concerned that the United States was treating calls under ATC as \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d", "In addition, individual TMB members we interviewed questioned how the United States used data to justify its calls. For example, they questioned (1) whether in some cases import increases had been \u201csharp and substantial\u201d as required under ATC, (2) why changes occurred in the direction of data levels\u2014in one case in U.S. domestic production levels and in another case in U.S. employment levels\u2014between the consultation period and the TMB review, (3) whether the United States had adequately considered the exporting country\u2019s world market share of the products in question, and (4) whether reimports under the U.S. Special Access Program could damage U.S. producers. In addition, some TMB members wanted to see more evidence that the United States had considered the extent to which the domestic producers being damaged by imports were producing like and/or competitive products.

However, the Canadian and EU processes for making safeguard calls differ from the U.S. safeguard process in several ways. For example, the EU\u2019s decisions to request consultations to impose quotas have been initiated by complaints from domestic producers rather than based on their own governments\u2019 monitoring efforts. While importers and retailers can lobby the EU Commission, which chairs the intergovernmental committee responsible for setting quotas, they are not notified officially when a call is being considered. The Canadian government monitors trade flows and initiates safeguard actions. If the government intends to make a call, it notifies Canadian manufacturers, retailers, and importers and allows them to comment 2 to 3 weeks before issuing the call. In addition, Canadian and EU officials stated that they are not concerned about possible import surges before a call is made, for various reasons.

Like MFA, ATC affords countries broad discretion in choosing among listed (similar but not identical) factors to be considered as well as the weight, if any, to be given any one factor. Neither agreement provides guidance on how the criteria are to be applied. For example, ATC and MFA do not specify a minimum increase in imports or a minimum decrease in domestic production to justify imposing a quota. The primary difference between the two safeguard standards is that ATC requires a finding that total imports of the product are causing serious damage or actual threat thereof, while no such finding was required by MFA.

For example, the Chief Textile Negotiator told us that even if a country\u2019s exports to the EU had increased over 500 percent, the EU would not impose quotas if the Commission determined that the import increase was due to a growth in demand for a product not produced by EU manufacturers. Such a situation occurred several years ago when EU producers were slow to react to changes in European apparel fashion trends. The Chief Textile Negotiator emphasized that the relationship between imports, domestic production, demand, and prices is critical to whether a call is made\u2014not, for example, only an increase in imports or decrease in production. He also stated that while the EU does not have any specific threshold levels, in practice, calls under MFA were not made if imports of a good from a country had risen less than 25 percent and if domestic production had fallen less than 20 percent.", "Based on the information provided by the petitioner, the Textile Inter-Service Committee decides whether the complaint has sufficient merit to be passed on to member state representatives.

This committee, chaired by the EU Commission, includes representatives from each of the 15 member states (one from each member\u2019s import licensing department and one from each member\u2019s trade department). Committee members review the complaint and make comments regarding its validity.

Throughout our report we repeatedly highlight the flexibility granted to CITA in safeguarding U.S. textile and apparel products. 2. We disagree with CITA\u2019s comment that we did not analyze the most recent import data, given that we refer to these data several times in our report. On page 4, we note that the most recent median import increase was 17.6 percent, a point we develop in footnote 9 and repeat on page 10. On page 55, we also explain that import data is more current than production data, and subsequently present the most recent import data, year by year, in table VI.2.", "The median represents the best descriptive statistic for the data elements we considered (see fn. 7, p. 55, for a more technical explanation of this point), and we used medians to summarize the output of CITA\u2019s deliberations, variable by variable, for each of the 6 years we considered. In order to provide more information regarding these statistics, we also present the ranges around some medians (for example, on pp. 4 and 54) and breakdowns on the number of import and production calls that fell below particular thresholds (on pp. 10 and 56-57).

For example, about 25 percent of the categories called affected suppliers whose combined imports were less than 2 percent of U.S. imports of that category. 4. We state on page 33 that ATC allows the \u201cfreedom to choose which products to integrate at each stage.\u201d We do not imply in our report that the U.S. integration schedule was inconsistent with ATC.

We believe our discussion of TMB member views on pages. 63-64 and 66-67 is appropriately qualified. 6. Regarding the comment pertaining to page 7, we recognize that ultimately the United States, through USTR, consults with foreign governments. However, it is CITA\u2019s responsibility to decide whether consultations should be requested. 7. See our discussion of the liberalizing effects of ATC, on page 34. 8. We state on page 2 that CITA is a committee with representation from five different agencies and on page 6 that CITA has no budget of its own. We reported fiscal year 1995 data because we wanted to examine fiscal year data for a full year for all CITA agencies, and the costs of several agencies are not known until the end of the fiscal year.

In addition, our interviews with CITA officials indicate that consultation with higher-level officials occurs infrequently. 11. See our description of the call process in appendix IV. 12. ATC does not contain procedural requirements detailing how individual countries make these determinations. We believe we have adequately described the substantive requirements of ATC in appendix III. 13. Our 1983 report found that CITA made decisions on the basis of consensus; this point was not refuted by CITA officials at the time. More recently, a former CITA Chairman told us that prior to 1983, CITA operated on a consensus basis. 14. We believe that our analysis is an accurate characterization of CITA\u2019s use of data to make safeguard decisions. (See comment 2.) Our review of all 166 market statements found that CITA bases its recommendations for safeguards almost exclusively on changes in imports and production. While other factors were sometimes mentioned, the basis for the calls always rested with changes in imports and production (see pp. 6 and 53). Even in 1995, after more data were included in the market statements, this remained the case. We note the importance of import and production data on pages 6 and 53 of our report.", "We focused on comparable import and production data precisely because of the need to demonstrate that import surges harm U.S. industry. While CITA states it \u201cshould be apparent\u201d that increased imports displace domestic production, its own data show this is not always the case. For example, import and production data for all CITA categories show many instances where imports and production both rose or fell for the same category during the same time periods.", "Our main point regarding calls with fairly small changes in production and imports is that although some calls were supported by either a small recent production decline or a small import increase, very few were supported by both a small production decline and a small import increase (see p. 56). This point remains true no matter what time periods we considered, including the most recent import data that CITA states is \u201ckey\u201d in its decision-making process.", "In our analysis of CITA\u2019s data use, we considered all data elements that CITA cites. For example, we present data on domestic market share for 1990-95 (see p. 56). Although we considered partial year data, we concentrated on the year-ending data to avoid distortions that might result from products imported on a seasonal basis. We could not consider data on productivity, capacity utilization, inventories, profits, and investment because CITA provided these data in its market statements only on an ad hoc basis. Moreover, the data was based on anecdotal information. Finally, we did not analyze CITA\u2019s data on domestic prices, employment, and wages because of the data\u2019s serious limitations at the category level. We explain these limitations in appendix V. 15. We cannot respond to this comment without more specific information. (Also see comment 2.) 16. We point out on page 10 that CITA assumes that imports and domestically produced goods within a given CITA category are substitutes. As noted in footnote 3 of appendix VI, OTEXA officials told us that they had not empirically examined the relationship between imports and domestic production. It is standard practice in economic analysis to examine the degree to which the products under study are substitutable for one another. 17. We did not recommend increasing the number of CITA categories. We point out that in some cases, a consequence of reducing over 4,000 HTS codes into 148 CITA categories is that some categories may contain products that do not appear to be like products. This has a direct bearing on the issue of whether or not changes in imports cause changes in domestic production. If the imports in question have different characteristics than domestically produced goods, the goods would be unlikely to compete with each other in the same market, weakening the assumption that changes in all imports in a CITA category cause changes in domestic production. 18. We believe our characterization of TMB rulings is accurate. 19. Footnote deleted. 20. As indicated on page 30, our discussion is not intended to include an exhaustive list of CITA\u2019s functions related to non-ATC work.", "21. Our graphic is not intended to imply that these are steps, but as noted, are elements required for imposing safeguards under ATC. 22. We believe our footnote adequately describes OTEXA\u2019s analysis under MFA and ATC. As we note in comment 2, we based our analysis on the information provided in the market statements. CITA did not provide us with any additional data or analysis to supplement the market statements. 23. Our determination that 28 calls were made when production had risen in the most recent year (indicated in table VI.4) is based on data in market statements produced and available to CITA at the time CITA issued the calls. (See also comment 2.) 24. On page 59, we present one example from CITA\u2019s commentary (out of three examples provided by CITA) on the differences in prices within categories. All three examples presented similar scenarios. We determined that the example we chose provided the best illustration of the issue in question. 25. Table VII.1 presents data that CITA examines in order to support the two necessary conditions under ATC for a call: (1) total category imports are rising at a sharp and substantial rate and (2) domestic industry is being injured as a result. In addition to determining that a call is warranted under ATC, the importing country determines that individual countries are responsible for the increase in total category imports. To make such a determination, we believe the more relevant variable is country imports as a percentage of total category imports because it serves as a base-line. For example, a 20-percent increase in in country imports from a base-line of 2 percent is less significant than a 20-percent increase in country imports from a base-line of 10 percent. 26. See table note, page 70. 27. We were not given access to documents explaining why calls were not made. We note that imports from Egypt had risen and that Egypt was a larger supplier than some countries that were subject to quotas, yet Egypt was not called. 28.
