However, the policy does not set thresholds for perstempo, which includes time away from home for exercises and training in addition to deployment. Service members are sometimes away from home for long periods for training, exercises, or other activities. For example, Air Force officials told GAO that F-16 pilots participate in multiple exercises every year that require them to spend significant time away from home. The Navy and SOCOM set specific and measurable perstempo thresholds in policy in 2014 and 2016, respectively. However, the other services either are not enforcing or have not established specific and measurable perstempo thresholds in their policies. DOD has maintained the waiver of statutory perstempo thresholds since 2001, and officials have cited the effect of the high pace of operations and training on service members; however, DOD has not taken action to focus attention on the management of perstempo thresholds within the services and department-wide. Unless DOD ensures that perstempo thresholds are established and followed while statutory thresholds are waived, DOD will be unable to judge whether service members are spending too much total time away from home and, if so, whether this has resulted in any associated effects on military readiness.", "DOD does not have reliable data to monitor perstempo because the data are incomplete.

In 1999, Congress addressed the pace of military  operations at that time by codifying thresholds for the amount of time  individual service members serve on duty away from their homes\u2014known  as \u201cpersonnel tempo\u201d or \u201cperstempo.\u201d The 1999 law required the  Secretary of each military department to provide extra pay for service  members who exceeded a certain threshold, required senior Department  of Defense (DOD) officials to provide approval for service members to  exceed these thresholds, and required the Secretary of each military  department to record the number of perstempo days for each service  member. However, in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist  attacks, the Deputy Secretary of Defense exercised a provision in the law  and issued a memorandum in October 2001 that waived the perstempo  thresholds and the requirement that senior DOD officials provide approval  when service members exceed the perstempo thresholds.", "While senior DOD leaders have kept the waiver in place, they have also  expressed concern that the high pace of military operations has had a  negative effect on readiness. For example, in June 2017, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that since September 11, 2001, the U.S.  military has had an extraordinarily high pace of operations, which has had  a negative effect on readiness. In February 2017, the Vice Chief of Staff  of the Army testified in a congressional hearing that the pace of  operations has had a negative effect on the Army\u2019s readiness including  the readiness of Brigade Combat Teams and Combat Aviation Brigades.", "In November 2017, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations of the Air  Force testified that 26 years of operations had taken a toll on Air Force  personnel, which has affected the Air Force\u2019s readiness. In May 2017,  the Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM)  testified that managing the pace of operations was essential to enabling  special forces to maintain their readiness. Finally, in September 2017, in  a testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the  Navy ship collisions that occurred earlier that year, the Chief of Naval  Operations explained\u2014and later investigations by the Navy confirmed\u2014 that the pace of operations had contributed to deadly accidents in the  Pacific.", "Title 10 of the U.S. Code requires the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness to monitor the tempo of the armed forces, and  DOD guidance requires the military services to track perstempo data.

While DOD has made considerable  efforts to manage operational tempo for units, managing the impact of  perstempo on individual service members has been a long-standing issue  for DOD. Our work has shown that the department has faced challenges  establishing perstempo-related policies; determining the time individual  service members should spend away from home; and managing  perstempo data, as discussed later in the report.", "Senate Report 114-255, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for us to  address the root causes of degraded readiness, including reviewing the  way DOD has managed perstempo in mobilizing and deploying its  forces. This report assesses the extent to which DOD, the services, and  SOCOM have (1) policies in place with specific and measurable  thresholds on perstempo and (2) reliable data to monitor perstempo.", "For both objectives, we interviewed officials responsible for perstempo  policies and data in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, the Office of Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, personnel and operations offices at the military services\u2019  headquarters, SOCOM, and the Defense Manpower Data Center.

We reviewed policies issued by the services and SOCOM  because each of these organizations is responsible for tracking and  reporting the amount of time service members serve away from home.  We also analyzed statements that senior DOD leaders have made in  congressional hearings about the relationship between perstempo,  operational tempo, and readiness.", "For objective two, we assessed the reliability of perstempo data from the  Defense Manpower Data Center, which maintains a centralized database  of perstempo data. We obtained and analyzed perstempo data from the  Defense Manpower Data Center for active duty military personnel from  the four military services for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. We selected  this time period to maximize the amount of available data for us to  determine trends in rates of perstempo. To conduct reliability  assessments, we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed  agency officials, including those who attempted but were not able to use  perstempo data in their analyses. We also analyzed the perstempo data  provided by the Defense Manpower and Data Center to identify the  number and percentage of records that were missing entries. Although  these analyses showed that the perstempo data were incomplete, we  found that they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of providing a  conservative estimate of the minimum number of service members with  high rates of perstempo. Further, we analyzed perstempo data from the  Navy to determine whether the Navy\u2019s data corresponded with the  perstempo data maintained by the Defense Manpower and Data Center.  We found that the Navy\u2019s perstempo data were also incomplete but were  sufficiently reliable to provide a conservative estimate of the minimum  number of Navy personnel with high rates of perstempo. To mitigate the  limitations in both sets of perstempo data, we present perstempo  statistics rounded to the nearest thousands rather than the actual  statistics we calculated from the data.", "In addition, we analyzed the reliability of the Navy\u2019s perstempo waiver  data, and data from the Defense Manpower Data Center on the number  of service members who did not have a perstempo record but participated  in a perstempo event. To assess the Navy\u2019s perstempo waiver data, we  compared data collected by the Navy on the number of personnel who  obtained a waiver to exceed the Navy\u2019s perstempo threshold to data from  the Defense Manpower Data Center showing the number of Navy  personnel with high rates of perstempo to determine if the Navy waiver  data were complete. We found that these data were incomplete, but were  sufficiently reliable to provide a conservative estimate of the minimum  number of Navy personnel who had obtained a waiver to exceed the  Navy\u2019s perstempo threshold. To mitigate the limitations in the Navy\u2019s  perstempo waiver data, we present data rounded to the nearest  thousands rather than the actual data. Finally, we assessed the reliability  of data provided by the Defense Manpower Data Center that indicated the  number of individuals who deployed in fiscal years 2014-2016 and should  have had a perstempo record. To obtain these data, the Defense  Manpower Data Center compared data from DOD\u2019s Contingency  Tracking System with the perstempo database for fiscal years 2014  through 2016 to identify missing records. We assessed the reliability of  the relevant portions of the Contingency Tracking System and the  perstempo database needed to complete this analysis. We also reviewed  documentation of the analysis and interviewed the analysts who  performed the work. We concluded that the underlying data were  sufficiently reliable and the analysis was appropriate for reporting the  number of persons who participated in a perstempo event but did not  have a perstempo record for this time period.", "We used the perstempo data we obtained from the Defense Manpower  Data Center to calculate the time service members served away from  home in fiscal year 2016. We calculated data for fiscal year 2016 because  these were the most recent data available for a complete fiscal year at the  time we conducted our review. To calculate the time service members  served away from home, we included time they served on operational  deployments, exercises, unit or home station training, and mission  support temporary duty.

The law also requires the  Secretary of Defense or a delegated official to approve when service  members exceed these thresholds, and requires DOD to establish a  system for tracking and recording the number of deployment perstempo  days for each member of the armed forces. Additionally, DOD obtained  the statutory authority to pay service members an allowance for lengthy  or numerous deployment perstempo events. Congress authorized DOD  to waive the deployment perstempo thresholds and recordkeeping  requirement, which in turn would prohibit the payment of high-deployment  allowances, if the department found that the waiver is necessary in the  interests of national security.

Further, we  reported that it was difficult for DOD to determine the amount of  perstempo time for military personnel for multiple reasons, including that  the services had different systems for tracking deployments. We  recommended that DOD (1) issue guidance on managing perstempo that  states whether each service should have a goal for the maximum  perstempo time for personnel and (2) issue regulations defining the  minimum perstempo data that each service must collect and maintain.  DOD concurred with these recommendations and, as we noted earlier,  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued  DOD Instruction 1336.5 in 2001 that described policy, responsibilities,  procedures, and information requirements for perstempo reporting.

We also reported that DOD implementation and oversight of department-wide  readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound  planning.

Specifically, a 2013  memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness states that individual service members should not be deployed  longer than they are at their home station. However, the memorandum  describes perstempo only in general terms\u2014stating that individual service  members should not serve extended periods of time away from their  homestation unless required by operational necessity.

SOCOM\u2019s  policy memorandum also clarified that the threshold applies to both  deployment perstempo events (e.g., operational deployments and  exercises) and non-deployment perstempo events (e.g., serving as a  student or trainee at a school and performing administrative, guard, or  detail duties in garrison at the service member\u2019s permanent duty  station).", "In contrast, the Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps are either not  enforcing or have not established a specific and measurable perstempo  threshold in their policies.

The regulation  updated the Army\u2019s policy to include a perstempo threshold. The  regulation also defined the events that could be counted toward that  threshold and included a provision for the Army to manage its  personnel to that threshold. However, Army headquarters officials told  us that the Army is not enforcing this perstempo threshold and that  the Army only added these provisions to emphasize that collecting  perstempo data was a priority. According to the Army regulation, the  Secretary of the Army may suspend the applicability of this perstempo  program in the interest of national security, but Army headquarters  officials told us that the Secretary of the Army had not suspended the  perstempo program and the officials could not provide any official  action that suspended the requirement.", "Air Force: The Air Force does not have a specific and measurable  perstempo threshold in policy. An Air Force personnel instruction  states that the Air Force considers service members who spend more  than 120 days on temporary duty to have a high perstempo.  However, Air Force headquarters officials told us that this policy does  not establish a threshold for the amount of time that Air Force  personnel may serve away from their homestation and that the Air  Force does not require units to manage the assignments of their  personnel to ensure that they do not spend more than 120 days on  temporary duty. Air Force headquarters officials told us that they did  not think they needed to include thresholds for perstempo in Air Force  policies expressed in specific, measurable terms because the Air  Force relies on unit commanders to manage the perstempo of  individual service members and they believed that a perstempo  threshold would affect a small number of their service members.", "Marine Corps: The Marine Corps also does not have a specific and  measurable perstempo threshold in its policy, but its policy accounts  for perstempo time in determining individual service members\u2019  eligibility for overseas deployments, among other things. For  example, Marine Corps Order 1300.8 adjusts and delays the date that  service members are scheduled to deploy overseas by the amount of  perstempo time accrued for those service members. The Marine  Corps also issued an administrative message directing unit  commanders to manage the perstempo of individual service  members. However, neither of these policies establishes a specific  and measurable perstempo threshold.

Such activities can take service members  away from home for long periods. For example, Air Force officials told us  that F-16 pilots spend considerable amounts of time participating in  multiple exercises every year that require them to spend significant time  away from their homestation. Similarly, a 2011 study conducted by CNA  found that perstempo was very high for service members in the III Marine  Expeditionary Force in Okinawa and Hawaii because of the number of  exercises in which those service members participated. In particular, the  study found that service members in the III Marine Expeditionary Force  participate in over 70 exercises and training events per year. Additionally,  relying on unit commanders to monitor the perstempo of service members  without providing specific and measurable guidance leaves it to the  interpretation of unit commanders to define excessive time away.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should define objectives in specific and measurable terms  to enable it to identify risks to achieving those objectives. The standards  also state that specific terms are those that are fully and clearly set forth  so they can be easily understood, and measurable terms are those that  allow for the assessment of performance toward achieving objectives. As  we reported in 2007, shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks, DOD  shifted its focus away from collecting and maintaining perstempo data  and began focusing on collecting and maintaining data to track  deployments related to major operations, which does not include the full  range of perstempo events. DOD continued this focus on managing  deployments versus perstempo in its issuance of the 2013 memorandum.", "Furthermore, even as it has continued to waive the statutory perstempo  thresholds and cited the effect of the high pace of operations and training  on service members, DOD has not taken action to focus attention on the  management of perstempo thresholds within the services and DOD. As a  result, the services have taken differing approaches, with the Army, the  Air Force, and the Marine Corps having no specific and measurable  thresholds. Through providing specific and measurable department-wide  perstempo thresholds in DOD guidance or directing the services and  SOCOM to establish and follow service-specific thresholds for its service  members, DOD will be better able to judge whether service members are  spending too much total time away from home and, if so, whether there  have been any associated effects on military readiness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Services Do Not Have Reliable Data to Monitor Perstempo", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have reliable perstempo data, which limits its ability to  effectively monitor perstempo across the department.

For example, a December  2017 Defense Manpower Data Center analysis indicated that perstempo  data are missing records for at least 145,000 individuals that deployed in  fiscal years 2014-2016. In addition, officials from the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation told us that they attempted to  analyze the effects of high rates of perstempo on unit readiness in 2016  but that they were unable to draw conclusions from the analysis because,  among other things, the perstempo data were incomplete. Officials  explained that certain events were not captured in the perstempo data  consistently, such as Army rotations to a combined training center. Senior  service officials also told us that the analysis had limited usefulness due  to unreliable data.", "Although data are incomplete, our analysis of available data indicates that  tens of thousands of service personnel experienced high rates of  perstempo in fiscal year 2016. Because the perstempo policies vary  widely, we anchored our analysis to the 220 days in a 365-day period  identified in the currently waived statutory threshold. Using that  benchmark, we estimate that at least 51,000 service personnel spent  more than 7 months away from their homestation in fiscal year 2016 (see  table 1).", "Moreover, we believe these numbers may be far higher because our  analysis is limited by incomplete perstempo data as stated above.  Additionally, our estimate likely understates the number of  servicemembers as we excluded records from our analysis because they  were missing an end date in the data system for the perstempo event.", "Further, we found that the perstempo records we analyzed for fiscal years  2012 through 2016 were also missing other information, which limits the  utility of the data for users and decision makers. For example, we found  that 30 percent of perstempo records for fiscal years 2012 through 2016  were missing information that identifies the service member\u2019s occupation,  14 percent were missing information that identifies the purpose of the  perstempo event, and 8 percent were missing information that identifies  the category of perstempo event.", "Incomplete and unreliable data have presented management problems,  particularly for the Navy and SOCOM as they have sought to manage the  perstempo of their service members. For example, a Naval Personnel  Command official who oversees the Navy\u2019s perstempo program told us  that the 18,000 Navy personnel with more than 220 perstempo days in  fiscal year 2016\u2014that we estimated using Defense Manpower Data  Center data\u2014likely significantly understates the actual number of Navy  personnel with high rates of perstempo.

Officials from the Navy and Defense Manpower Data  Center were unable to explain the discrepancy. Moreover, Navy officials  told us that the Navy oversees perstempo by requiring subordinate  commands to obtain waivers when service members exceed 220 days in  a year. However, the Navy had waivers for about 6,000 personnel in  2016, or only about one-fifth of the personnel the Navy\u2019s own data  indicated were gone more than 220 days. To address this, the Navy  Personnel Command official told us that the Navy plans to establish an  automated system to verify that Navy service members who have  exceeded the Navy\u2019s 220-day perstempo threshold have a waiver.", "In addition, a SOCOM headquarters official told us that the command  does not have reliable perstempo data on its service members because  of limitations in the command\u2019s information technology system. As a  result, SOCOM does not currently have the ability to determine whether  its units are adhering to the SOCOM perstempo threshold. The official  told us that SOCOM is working to address the problem with this  information technology system.", "We previously reported on challenges DOD has had with collecting  reliable perstempo data in 1996 and 2007. While the department has  made some progress, the reliability of perstempo data has remained a  persistent challenge for the department. In 1996, we reported that DOD  could not measure the increase in time away from home because no  department-wide data system existed to track it. DOD generally agreed  with our findings and recommendations and indicated that it had taken,  and would continue to take, initiatives to manage perstempo. In 2007, we  reported that Army and Marine Corps perstempo data were inaccurate  and incomplete because of the lack of quality controls. We  recommended that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness provide guidance directing the Army and Marine Corps to  develop quality control procedures for validating the accuracy of the  perstempo data they collect and report to the Defense Manpower Data  Center. The department concurred with the recommendation and issued  an instruction in 2009 that required the services to report perstempo data  to the Defense Manpower Data Center. However, the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has not fully implemented our  recommendation because the instruction did not direct the Army and  Marine Corps to develop quality control procedures for validating the  accuracy of their perstempo data.", "The Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should use quality information to achieve its objectives and  that such information should be complete and accurate. The underlying  reason that perstempo data are not reliable is that DOD has not  emphasized the collection of complete and reliable perstempo data.  Specifically, an official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness told us that the office last reviewed  perstempo data in 2012 and, at that time, determined that these data  were not fully reliable. The official also told us that to address this  challenge the office reiterated the requirement that the services must  collect perstempo data in its 2013 memorandum, but the memorandum  did not emphasize that the perstempo data collected should be complete  and reliable. Without taking steps to improve the quality of its perstempo  data, DOD will be limited in its ability to assess the amount of time service  members are serving away from home for all perstempo events and use  that information to assist them in monitoring and gauging the stress on  the force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the years since 2001, senior DOD leaders have expressed concern  about the impact of a high pace of military operations and the high pace  has continued for portions of the force. DOD has taken steps to limit  operational deployments for individual service members, but has been  less focused on the impact of total time away from home on personnel,  commonly called perstempo. Total time away from home includes the  training and other activities that can take service members away from  home for long periods.", "DOD has two primary and long-standing challenges in managing  perstempo: setting clear policy and gathering reliable data. First, DOD  has not established a perstempo policy with specific and measurable  thresholds even as it has waived a statutory requirement that sets such  thresholds. In the absence of clear and specific guidance, the Navy and  SOCOM have set their own thresholds. By contrast, the Army set a  threshold but does not enforce it and the limits for Air Force and Marine  Corps service members are unclear. Unless DOD ensures that  perstempo thresholds are established and followed across the  department in specific and measurable terms, DOD will be unable to  judge when individual service members are spending too much time away  from home. Second, perstempo data are unreliable across the  department\u2014primarily because they are incomplete\u2014but high perstempo  is affecting tens of thousands of personnel. For example, available data  indicate that at least 51,000 active duty personnel spent more than 7  months per year away from home in fiscal year 2016, and the number  may be considerably higher. Incomplete perstempo data are a persistent  problem that continues to hamper efforts to oversee the impact of time on  duty away from home on individual service members. Until DOD and the  military services take steps to emphasize the collection of complete and  reliable perstempo data, DOD will be limited in its ability to oversee the  time its personnel are spending away from home or gauge the stress on  the force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations to DOD.", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in conjunction with the Secretaries  of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine  Corps; and the Commanding General of SOCOM, clarify its guidance on  perstempo thresholds as long as the statutory thresholds are waived by  either establishing specific and measurable department-wide perstempo  thresholds in DOD policy or ensuring that the Army, the Air Force, and the  Marine Corps establish and follow their own service-specific guidance on  thresholds.
