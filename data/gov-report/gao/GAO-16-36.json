This report evaluates the extent to which (1) ARNG has provided oversight of its recruiting process; (2) ARNG met its goals for recruiting, completion of initial military training, and initial term of service; and (3) OSD, Department of the Army, and ARNG have conducted oversight of ARNG's enlistment financial incentives programs. For this work, GAO reviewed DOD and ARNG recruiting policy and procedures and interviewed cognizant officials. GAO analyzed data on recruiting from FY2010 through FY2014, training from FY2011 through FY2014, and initial term of service for FY2015. GAO visited four states representing a range of size and locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army National Guard (ARNG) has taken steps to increase oversight of its recruiting process primarily conducted by recruiters dispersed at the state-level but has not established a permanent program to monitor state-level recruiting activities. In June 2014, the ARNG created a Recruiting Standards Branch that has started to conduct inspections of state offices. The Recruiting Standards branch completed inspections in 16 states from October 2014 through July 2015 and found that 2 states did not achieve full compliance in their inspections. However, this is not a permanent program, and ARNG officials stated that they are using positions to staff it intended for use in other areas. The ARNG is seeking approval for permanent staff by early 2017 to continue its oversight. Continued monitoring of state-level recruiting activities, such as through a permanent recruiting standards branch, will be important to ARNG's oversight functions.", "The ARNG had mixed results in meeting its overall recruiting goals and nearly met its goals for initial military training; however, the ARNG does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service or military obligation. The ARNG met its recruiting goals in 2 of the 5 years from fiscal years (FY) 2010 through 2014. While the ARNG nearly met its goals for training completion from FY 2011 through 2014, GAO found that the ARNG does not have complete, consistent, and valid data on why soldiers do not complete training and when they separate during training. Without consistent, complete, and valid data, decision makers do not have information to determine why a higher number of soldiers are not completing training. The ARNG also does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service. GAO's analysis shows that about 40 percent of enlisted soldiers who joined the ARNG from FY 2001 through 2007 did not complete their initial term of service. Without tracking completion of initial term of service, ARNG officials cannot assess whether their programs are effective in meeting personnel requirements and do not have visibility to ensure the ARNG is maximizing its investment in its soldiers.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Department of the Army (Army), and ARNG have not fully conducted their oversight responsibilities of ARNG enlistment financial-incentives programs. OSD has not enforced a requirement that ARNG report incentives obligated through the ARNG incentives programs. Further, although Army and National Guard regulations require evaluations of the effectiveness of the ARNG financial incentives programs, the Army and ARNG have not evaluated and documented the effectiveness of the programs. Without evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of ARNG incentives programs, officials may not know whether changes are needed for effective use of incentives or they may determine that certain financial incentives are not needed. Moreover, the ARNG has not ensured that recruiters have an understanding of available financial incentives. Financial incentives are a tool available to recruiters and agency policy states that incentives are available to assist in meeting and sustaining readiness requirements and to assist in filling critical shortages. ARNG has not provided recruiters with training on using financial incentives. With additional training, recruiters could better understand when and how to offer financial incentives to fill critical positions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that ARNG take actions to collect consistent, complete, and valid data on soldiers who do not complete training and initial term of service, and evaluate and document its incentives programs.

At the height of Operations Enduring  Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, the Department of the Army and the  National Guard Bureau (NGB) allowed applicants with lower aptitude  scores or prior felony convictions to enlist in order to ensure that the Army  National Guard (ARNG) and Active Army could meet their respective  missions. However, since the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and a  significant drawdown from Afghanistan, the Department of the Army and  NGB have issued guidance prohibiting approval of waivers for applicants  with prior criminal offenses, such as certain types of sexual offenses, as  well as increasing the applicant aptitude score standards. These changes  and other factors such as a less physically fit youth population have  reduced the pool of qualified applicants for the ARNG and make it more  difficult for recruiters to meet defined recruiting goals.", "The ARNG primarily relies upon recruiters dispersed at the state-level to  conduct its recruiting process. Recruiters are often referred to as the  \u201cface\u201d of their respective military component. and any type of recruiter  misconduct could have significant implications for DOD. In the past, there  have been allegations of recruiter misconduct with applicants resulting in  negative perceptions about military service. This makes it important for  recruiters to ensure that proper procedures are followed when interacting  with applicants and that recruiters correctly assess applicant eligibility.  Further, the ARNG has had trouble in the past meeting its recruiting  goals, which inherently applies more pressure for recruiters to enlist  applicants. With the Army\u2019s downsizing and the current fiscal  environment, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, DOD faces an  uncertain future where personnel decisions may prove even more  important and where there is particular need for effective measures such  as financial incentives to help the ARNG meet its recruiting mission and  readiness requirements.", "House Report 113-446 accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for us to  review the ARNG\u2019s recruiting practices and report to the defense  committees. This report evaluates the extent to which (1) the ARNG has  provided oversight of its recruiting process; (2) the ARNG met its goals for  recruiting, completion of initial military training, and completion of initial  term of service in recent years; and (3) the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD), Department of the Army, and ARNG have conducted  their oversight responsibilities of the ARNG\u2019s financial incentives  programs. Also, the House report included two additional provisions: (1) a  provision for us to assess the extent to which contracting vehicles used to  support ARNG recruiting were in compliance with DOD and Department  of the Army policies and regulations, and (2) a provision for us to assess  the numbers of individuals who complete basic and advanced individual  training and the average length of time between when a person enlists in  the ARNG and when the person completes initial military training. To  address the first of these two additional provisions, we reviewed findings  from and the status of recommendations by the U.S. Army Audit Agency  and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Procurement to improve contracting processes at NGB. A Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Procurement official determined that  this information is sensitive but unclassified so we provided a briefing in  October of 2015 separately to the committees. To address the second  provision, we have included results of our analyses in appendixes II, III,  IV, and V.", "For our first objective, we obtained and reviewed DOD guidance  regarding ARNG oversight of its recruiting process and interviewed  officials from ARNG. To describe how states conduct oversight over the  recruiting process, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of four states  based on varying factors such as state ARNG assigned end-strength,  the total number of enlistments, and geographic locations. We selected  Texas and Pennsylvania as two states with a large-size ARNG end- strength, Virginia as a state with a medium-size end-strength, and Idaho  as a state with a small-size end-strength. We obtained and reviewed  applicable state and local recruiting and retention guidance and  interviewed recruiting officials at each of these four selected states. The  observations from these four selected states are not generalizable to all  states and territories but provide important insight into ARNG oversight of  its recruiting process.", "For the second objective, we obtained aggregate recruiting data and  associated goals from the ARNG. We compared data on the ARNG\u2019s  annual recruiting goals for enlistments with the number of enlistments in  the ARNG for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, respectively. We chose  fiscal year 2010 as the start date because our prior work discussed the  extent to which the ARNG met its recruiting goals from fiscal years 2000  through 2009. We chose fiscal year 2014 as the end date because it was  the most recently available data at the time of our review. To determine  the extent to which the ARNG met goals for completion of initial military  training, we compared the ARNG\u2019s goals for completion of initial military  training with ARNG-reported completion rates for fiscal years 2011  through 2014. We were not able to assess the extent to which the ARNG  met its goals for completion of initial military training prior to fiscal year  2011 either because the goals were not available or the goals in place  were not comparable to the completion rates provided for fiscal years  2004 through 2014. We chose fiscal year 2014 as the end date because it  was the most recently available data at the time of our review. Lastly, to  determine the extent to which the ARNG met goals for completion of  initial term of service, we compared the ARNG\u2019s fiscal year 2015 attrition  goal for completion of initial term of service with the ARNG\u2019s completion  rate as of May 2015, which was the most recently available data. We  could not assess the extent to which the ARNG met goals prior to fiscal  year 2015 because ARNG officials stated that the goals have changed  over time and could not provide goals for previous fiscal years.", "For our third objective, we obtained and analyzed relevant policy and  guidance documents to identify oversight responsibilities for ARNG  incentives programs. We interviewed officials from the ARNG to gain an  understanding of how incentives policies and guidance are being applied.  We interviewed officials from OSD, the Department of the Army, and the  ARNG about how they conduct oversight of ARNG incentives programs.

However, the officials stated that the  waiver was no longer granted in fiscal years 2012 through 2014, thus  requiring the ARNG to stay below the authorized end-strength and to  reduce its annual recruiting goals.", "While the ARNG met its recruiting goals in only 2 of the 5 years from  fiscal years 2010 through 2014, the ARNG achieved or nearly achieved  its goal of fully utilizing its authorized end-strength in all of the years as  shown in table 1. When setting goals for the states and territories, the  ARNG emphasizes that attrition management has a significant effect on  the ARNG\u2019s ability to utilize its authorized end-strength and that, in  addition to setting recruiting goals, the ARNG meets its end-strength by  setting goals for managing losses and retaining existing personnel. Since  fiscal year 2009, the ARNG has established annual goals for the states  and territories to reenlist a certain number of individuals nearing the end  of their term of service. ARNG data showed that it either exceeded or  nearly exceeded its reenlistment goal in 4 of the 5 years from fiscal years  2010 through 2014. Table 2 shows the extent to which the ARNG met  reenlistment goals from fiscal years 2010 through 2014.", "ARNG-HRM officials stated that the ARNG has increased its reenlistment  goal over time because the number of individuals who joined the ARNG  greatly increased from fiscal years 2006 through 2009, in part, due to the  Grow the Force initiative. The officials stated that the increased number  of soldiers who joined during this time period became eligible to reenlist  from fiscal years 2012 through 2014, thus increasing the population of  soldiers eligible for reenlistment. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division  officials noted that the ARNG achieved a lower percentage of its  reenlistment goal in fiscal year 2013 because ARNG wanted to  emphasize reenlistments in this year and set a more aggressive goal in  comparison to other years. For example, in fiscal year 2012, the ARNG  set a goal to reenlist 48,446 soldiers out of an eligible population of  125,785 soldiers, while in fiscal year 2013 set a goal to reenlist 59,233  soldiers out of an eligible population of 121,624 soldiers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ARNG Nearly Met Goals for Completing Initial Military Training but Does Not Have Consistent, Complete, and Valid Data on Why and When Soldiers Do Not Complete Training", "paragraphs": ["The ARNG nearly met its goals for completion of initial military training  from fiscal years 2011 to 2014; however, we identified inconsistencies in  how states recorded reasons that soldiers did not complete their training  and found that available Army training data does not provide the ARNG  with complete data on the timing of when soldiers leave during the  training process.

From fiscal years 2011 through 2014, the ARNG set  a goal of at least 84 percent and achieved a completion rate of  approximately 81 to 82 percent in each of those years. The ARNG sets  and tracks several goals that focus on states\u2019 and territories\u2019 ability to  prepare their recruits to attend initial military training. One such goal is  based on the percentage of soldiers who completed initial military training  (both basic and advanced) compared to the number of soldiers who  began training and did or did not complete training for a rolling time period  covering the past 12 months. By law members of the ARNG that have not  completed the minimum training required to deploy within 24 months must  be discharged. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated  that they have not separately set a goal for the extent to which soldiers  complete basic training because the ARNG is primarily concerned with  soldiers completing both basic and advanced training to become qualified  for their military occupation. Table 3 shows the ARNG\u2019s goal for  completion of initial military training, when available, and ARNG  completion rates from fiscal years 2011 through 2014.", "The percentage of ARNG soldiers who completed their initial military  training has generally increased annually from about 70 percent in fiscal  year 2004 to about 81 percent in fiscal year 2014. ARNG Strength  Maintenance Division officials attributed the improvements in completion  of training largely to the ARNG Recruit Sustainment Program, which  began in fiscal year 2005. The purpose of the ARNG Recruit Sustainment  Program is to increase the likelihood that ARNG soldiers will complete  initial military training by ensuring that recruits are mentally prepared and  physically fit prior to attending training. The program aims to provide  recruits with realistic training that is similar to the first 3 weeks of basic  training. In addition, recruiters stated that the ARNG Recruit Sustainment  Program allows the ARNG to maintain contact with recruits while they  wait to attend training and to monitor their conduct and educational  progress to help ensure they stay eligible to join. For states or territories  that struggle to meet ARNG\u2019s goal for training completion, ARNG  Strength Maintenance Division officials stated that they share best  practices from states that are meeting or exceeding ARNG\u2019s goal or send  out ARNG mobile training teams to the states or territories to help  address challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Reporting by Selected States and Incomplete and Invalid Data on Soldiers Who Do Not Complete Training", "paragraphs": ["We identified inconsistencies in how the four selected states we visited  recorded reasons that soldiers did not complete their initial military  training. ARNG regulation and guidance require states and territories to  report the reasons why soldiers leave the ARNG in the ARNG personnel  database of record known as the Standard Installation/Division Personnel  System (SIDPERS). Although not generalizable to all states and  territories, we found that states we reviewed varied in whether they  selected only a general category in the system about the timing of a  soldier leaving initial training versus selecting a category noting the  specific reason each soldier left training prior to completion. When  soldiers leave training prior to completion, officials from states and  territories are to select the reason why the soldier left the ARNG from a  list of over 100 pre-predetermined categories, such as alcohol or other  drug abuse or medically unfit at the time of appointment. In interviews  with officials from the four selected states that we visited, officials  provided different responses about how they select a category regarding  why soldiers left the ARNG before basic or during basic or advanced  training. For example, one official stated that he selected general  categories about timing, such as if a soldier left before attending basic  training or left during basic or advanced training; however, that state\u2019s  officials did not select a category that specified the reason why the soldier  left the ARNG. In contrast, officials in another state stated they have  selected 13 categories about specific reasons and use the general  categories about timing for soldiers that left before basic training or during  basic or advanced training from April 2014 through March 2015. Table 4  below shows the contrasts in how these two state officials chose general  or specific categories regarding soldiers leaving training.", "Further, we found that available Army training data do not provide the  ARNG with complete data on the timing of when soldiers leave during the  training process. According to GAO\u2019s leading practices on strategic  human-capital management, reliable data help enable an agency\u2019s  decision makers to evaluate the success of their human-capital  approaches and to identify opportunities for enhancing agency results.  The Army\u2019s training system of record known as the Army Training  Requirements and Resources System contains soldiers\u2019 training records,  including the dates soldiers completed basic training and advanced  training. However, we found that this system was missing completion  dates from basic training for a significant number of soldiers who should  have had dates listed. Specifically, we found that of the 134,293 non- prior-service enlisted soldiers who joined the ARNG from fiscal years  2010 through 2014 and completed their initial military training as of April  15, 2015, 36,644\u2014or 27 percent\u2014were missing basic training completion  dates. ARNG-HRM officials attributed this missing information, in part, to  data on the soldiers who attended basic and advanced training at the  same training site\u2014referred to as One Station Unit Training, leading the  school to only record one date for completion of both basic and advanced  training. ARNG-HRM officials stated that they use the information on  basic training completion in the Army system to track whether recruits are  completing basic training but that they understood there were data  limitations due to the missing information in the system. The level of  incompleteness in the data for basic training completion, however, raises  concerns about whether ARNG can use this system to determine the  timing of when soldiers left during their initial military training. Further, we  found that when the One Station Unit Training sites report discharges  from training, the reports do not indicate whether the soldiers were  discharged during basic training or advanced training. According to a  fiscal year 2014 discharge report for the Army training schools, of the  3,352 soldiers who were discharged from training sites, 1,037 soldiers\u2014 or 31 percent\u2014were discharged from a One Station Unit Training site. As  a result, the ARNG would not have visibility into whether these soldiers  were discharged during basic training or advanced training.", "ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials acknowledged that the  databases of record for ARNG personnel and Army training data do not  offer the level of detail they need to determine the reasons why soldiers  left before or during initial military training or when soldiers separated  during the training process. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division and  ARNG-HRM officials stated that they were aware that there could be  inconsistencies in how states and territories select the category to  describe the reason why soldiers left the ARNG before or during training.  The officials attributed the inconsistency in part to the availability of the  general categories in SIDPERS for soldiers who leave before beginning  basic training or prior to completion of advanced training. ARNG-HRM  officials noted that the 54 states and territories each enter the information  into SIDPERS, which likely result in inconsistencies in data entry across  the states. Further, as noted above, the system of record for data on  soldiers\u2019 training records is the Army Training Requirements and  Resources System, and the system of record for data on why soldiers  leave the ARNG is SIDPERS, rather than one centralized data source. In  July 2015, we reported that multiple data systems used to track soldier  availability data did not interface in a way to allow for timely updates  between all systems to ensure the relevance and value of the data that  management uses to make soldier availability-related decisions. We  recommended that the Secretary of the Army develop and implement  ways that the Army reserve components can facilitate timely updates of  availability data between all data systems through the current system  interfaces to improve the relevance and value of the data that  management is using to make soldier availability-related decisions, and  DOD concurred with our recommendation.", "Recognizing the gap in information on why soldiers did not complete  training and the timing of when they separated during the training  process, ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated that they  started to collect this information in fiscal year 2010 by modifying a  management tool\u2014known as the Vulcan Recruit Sustainment Program  Database\u2014used to track recruits while they are in the training process.  ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials emphasized that the  database is an internal management tool and not a database of record  and is therefore generally not used to report information outside of ARNG.  According to the officials, the ARNG modified the tool to capture when a  soldier separated during the training process, such as before basic  training, during basic training, or during advanced training, as well as the  reason for the loss. The officials stated that while the categories for  reasons are similar to those in SIDPERS, ARNG removed the two  general categories for separating before or during initial military training to  require the states and territories to select the specific reason why the  soldier left the ARNG. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials  stated that they did not modify SIDPERS to capture this information  because the Army is in the process of transitioning to an Army-wide  personnel database, the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army.  The officials stated that they have not been allowed to make changes to  SIDPERS since at least 2007 in anticipation of the new system. In  February 2015, we reported that the full deployment of the Integrated  Personnel and Pay System-Army is not expected until April 2020, and  that the Army had not developed any portion of the system as of  November 2014.", "As part of a broader review of the ARNG Recruit Sustainment Program, in  September 2008 the U.S. Army Audit Agency reported that the Vulcan  database sometimes did not provide accurate and timely data for Recruit  Sustainment Program managers. The U.S. Army Audit Agency found  that the Vulcan database provided useful information, but its effectiveness  was limited because program managers at the state level sometimes did  not update or use the system as the preferred management tool.  According to the report, the program managers did not use the Vulcan  database because it did not provide information that the states needed to  monitor recruit status, the database was not user-friendly, and the ARNG  did not routinely provide formal training to users. The U.S. Army Audit  Agency concluded that the data in the Vulcan system were not reliable for  making sound management decisions and made four recommendations  to address the issues identified, including developing and providing  routine formal training to Vulcan users and ensuring that state ARNG  organizations use the Vulcan database to manage the Recruit  Sustainment Program and not locally developed systems. The ARNG  agreed with the report\u2019s recommendations and, according to ARNG  Strength Maintenance Division officials, the ARNG has taken steps that  are intended to address the report\u2019s recommendations. For example,  ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated that states\u2019 use of  the Vulcan database is continuously managed by means of daily reviews  and validated during the branch leadership\u2019s accreditation process.  Further, ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated that, since  the U.S. Army Audit Agency audit, the ARNG instituted the role of training  liaison officers who act as liaisons to the Active component training  facilities in order to manage ARNG recruits at training as well as  contracted administrative support for the Recruiting Sustainment  Program. According to ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials,  both the training liaison officers and Recruit Sustainment Program  contract support staff now play a role in maintaining information in the  Vulcan database. In July 2015, the U.S. Army Audit Agency started a  follow-on review of the ARNG Recruit Sustainment Program, which  includes reexamining the Vulcan database and evaluating the measures  that the ARNG has taken to address the deficiencies described in the  September 2008 report.", "The ARNG\u2019s personnel database of record, SIDPERS, and the Army\u2019s  database of record on training, the Army Training Requirements and  Resources System, do not provide ARNG with full visibility into why  soldiers do not complete initial military training and when they separate  during the training process. Further, while ARNG has modified its internal  Vulcan database to capture this information, ARNG-HRM officials stated  that they could not determine the information to be valid because  inputting the information is voluntary, and the Vulcan database is not the  database of record on losses from the ARNG. According to GAO\u2019s  leading practices on strategic human-capital management, a critical  success factor is using consistent, complete, and valid data to determine  key performance objectives and goals. The Director, ARNG, has overall  responsibility for maintaining policy and programs for the ARNG recruiting  programs, and ARNG-HRM officials stated that they use the data on  reasons why individuals left the ARNG to develop policies to help retain  soldiers. Without consistent data about specific reasons soldiers left the  ARNG before or during training in the ARNG database of record, officials  will continue to be limited in their ability to identify actual reasons for  separation. Further, without complete information on when soldiers  separate during the training process, ARNG cannot know the extent to  which soldiers are leaving during basic or advanced training. Such  limitations hinder the Director, ARNG\u2019s ability to develop policies and  programs intended to help create an environment in which a higher  number of soldiers complete training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ARNG Does Not Track Whether Soldiers Complete Their Initial Term of Service and Has Not Periodically Estimated the Costs to Recruit and Train a Soldier", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Completion of Initial Term of Service Is Not Tracked", "paragraphs": ["ARNG Strength Maintenance Division does not track whether ARNG  soldiers complete their initial term of service. When individuals join the  ARNG, they sign a contract to actively serve in the ARNG for a specified  amount of time, which varies by soldier. For example, while a non-prior- service enlisted soldier must enlist in the ARNG for a total military service  obligation of 8 years, a portion of the 8 years can be active service in the  ARNG with the balance being in the Individual Ready Reserve. On an  ongoing basis, the ARNG Strength Maintenance Division tracks initial- term attrition rates\u2014the number of soldiers in their initial term who leave  the ARNG during a given period compared to the average number of  soldiers who were serving in their initial term over that same period\u2014with  the goal of keeping attrition below an established maximum rate. For the  purposes of tracking initial-term attrition rates, the ARNG does not track  all enlisted soldiers who join, but defines soldiers in their initial term as  enlisted soldiers who have completed initial military training and have  less than 6 years in service. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division  officials stated that they establish the goal based on the ARNG\u2019s historical  performance and that the metric is adjusted over time to encourage  incremental improvement. ARNG officials have established an attrition  goal of a percentage of less than or equal to 12 percent for soldiers  leaving during their initial term of service, and as of May 2015 the ARNG  had an attrition rate of 8.1 percent. According to the ARNG, managing  attrition has a significant effect on the ARNG\u2019s ability to achieve its end- strength goal, and ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated  that they track initial-term losses in this way because it helps states and  territories manage their respective end-strengths by better anticipating  future losses and the ARNG can include the most recent enlistments in its  analysis for initial-term losses.", "While the ARNG\u2019s calculation of the initial-term attrition rate provides  ARNG Strength Maintenance Division with some information that helps  officials manage end-strength, the ARNG Strength Maintenance Division  does not regularly track whether all soldiers who join in a given fiscal year  ultimately complete their initial term of service. We obtained data on  enlisted soldiers who joined the ARNG from fiscal years 2001 through  2007, and analyzed whether they ultimately completed their initial term of  service; we found that about 40 percent of these soldiers did not complete  their initial term of service (see table 5).", "According to GAO\u2019s leading practices on strategic human-capital  management, valid data help enable an agency\u2019s decision makers to  evaluate the success of their human-capital approaches and to identify  opportunities for enhancing agency results. ARNG Strength  Maintenance Division officials stated that there could be some  advantages to tracking the extent to which soldiers complete their initial  term of service by those who join in a given fiscal year, but it may be  viewed as redundant reporting given that the ARNG already tracks  attrition rates for initial-term soldiers. Further, ARNG Strength  Maintenance Division officials stated that tracking soldiers from the date  of their enlistment to their final completion is a complex task. However,  regularly tracking the extent to which soldiers who join the ARNG in a  fiscal year and complete their initial term of service can help the ARNG  understand what human-capital decisions may have led to certain trends  in data. For example, ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials  stated that multiple factors may have contributed to 40 percent of soldiers  we identified as not completing their initial term of service from fiscal  years 2001 through 2007. The officials noted that this time period was at  the height of the troop surge in Iraq, where many of the quality metrics  were loosened across the Army in order to meet expanded end-strengths.  As noted above, the officials stated that the Recruit Sustainment  Program, the program to which they attribute higher completion rates for  initial military training since fiscal year 2005, was not in full force until the  latter part of this time period. Further, tracking completion by soldiers who  join in a given fiscal year can help the ARNG identify the points in time  during soldiers\u2019 enlistments when they are more likely to separate from  the ARNG. Without the ARNG regularly tracking the extent to which  soldiers complete their initial term of service and understanding trends in  the data, officials do not have full visibility into the effect the ARNG\u2019s  programs and initiatives have in helping states meet their strength and  readiness requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs to Recruit and Train a Soldier Are Not Estimated", "paragraphs": ["In addition to not tracking the extent to which soldiers are not completing  their initial term of service, the ARNG had not estimated the total costs to  recruit and train an ARNG soldier. In response to our review, ARNG  Strength Maintenance Division officials estimated that in fiscal year 2014,  it cost the ARNG approximately $62,000 to recruit and train an ARNG  soldier for those soldiers who attended basic training and advanced  training at separate training sites or approximately $51,000 for soldiers  who attended basic training and advanced training at the same training  site. According to officials, a portion of these estimates includes the  salary paid to the soldier while in training but also includes enlistment  incentives and the administrative costs to process the soldiers, among  other things. ARNG Strength Maintenance Division officials stated,  however, that the estimate includes costs other than those that support  recruiting, such as resources used to manage attrition and retain  personnel and that additional analysis is needed to further refine this  estimate. For active-duty soldiers in the Army Active Component, the  Army has estimated that recruiting and training cost about $72,000 per  soldier who attended basic training and advanced training at separate  training sites or about $54,000 for soldiers who attended basic training  and advanced training at the same training site in fiscal year 2014.", "As mentioned above, the ARNG has recruited about 190,000 soldiers  from fiscal years 2011 through 2014, and not all of these individuals  completed initial military training. However, ARNG Strength Maintenance  Division had not estimated the ARNG\u2019s costs for recruiting and training  soldiers, and officials stated they would have to frequently update the  calculation because the associated costs change over time. While we  recognize costs for recruiting and training a soldier can change over time,  it is important for the ARNG to periodically estimate these costs, such as  during an annual budget cycle or other time period as appropriate,  because it would better enable the ARNG to know how it is spending its  resources. According to GAO\u2019s leading practices on strategic human- capital management, agencies should have valid data for determining  whether they are maximizing their human-capital investments and that  data gathered are kept current. Without periodically estimating the cost  to recruit and train an ARNG soldier, ARNG Strength Maintenance  Division does not know the extent of its investment in soldiers and the  potential loss of investment when soldiers do not complete training or  their initial term of service.

The management system was  implemented in response to a 2010 study that a contractor conducted  for the ARNG, which found deficiencies in quality controls for its previous  incentives processing system. For example, the study found that it was  not clear how many people had access to or how frequently they used the  incentives system. Further, the 2010 study found that the previous system  did not capture all requests for payments, creating the inability to  accurately manage the funding for the programs, and found that the  system did not monitor and validate that a soldier remained qualified to  receive an incentive.", "Financial incentives are to be awarded and monitored within GIMS, which  (1) establishes control by setting user levels and limitations on  transactions that users are able to complete regarding incentives; (2)  monitors a soldier\u2019s compliance with his or her incentives contract, and  can change the incentive payments to an on-hold status and withhold  payments until violations can be addressed (if at all); and (3) processes  and releases payment notifications per the contract schedule, assuming  the soldier\u2019s incentive payment is not flagged as in on-hold status. Some  controls within GIMS are similar to control activities suggested by the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which states  that attributes to internal control activities include dividing key duties and  responsibilities among different people in order to reduce the risk of error,  waste, or fraud.", "ARNG officials at all four selected states we visited said that GIMS  reduces the possibility that soldiers are awarded incentives that are not in  accordance with regulation. For example, the state-level incentives  manager has the responsibility to monitor incentives awarded within his or  her respective state and only officials within the incentives managers\u2019  office have the authority to review and approve incentives actions, while  the Military Entrance Processing Station guidance counselor is  responsible for issuing incentives to a soldier. Officials stated that GIMS  does not allow for individuals to perform duties outside of their  responsibility, which greatly reduces the risk of fraud and improper  incentives activities. Further, officials at all four selected states we visited  said that GIMS greatly reduces the possibility that soldiers are awarded  incentives or receive incentives payments if they do not meet the  requirements for the respective incentive. For example, officials stated  that soldiers cannot receive additional incentive payments until the soldier  passes his or her physical training test. Officials stated that in order to  receive a payment, GIMS requires the soldier\u2019s commander to verify that  the soldier has passed the most recent test.

Recruiters  access the information in GIMS to determine whether an available  position has an incentive attached. According to the ARNG\u2019s financial  incentives policy, positions are assigned an incentive tier level  corresponding to how critical the position is. For example, a position  scored as a tier level 1 is considered most critical and has the greatest  amount of incentives, while a position scored as a tier level 7 is  considered not critical and does not have any incentives. Further,  according to the policy, recruiting and retention financial incentives are  intended to assist in filling critical shortages. The policy also states that  ARNG-HRM is to develop and implement policy for ARNG incentives  programs and that the Chief of NGB, through the ARNG Strength  Maintenance Division, is responsible for developing strength maintenance  guidance, programs, and training.", "ARNG officials from all of the four selected states that we visited stated  that they did not understand which vacant ARNG positions were  considered critical and had incentives attached. These state recruiting  officials stated that because they did not understand which positions were  considered critical and had a financial incentive attached, it was difficult to  utilize financial incentives as a recruiting tool. For example, during our  review the algorithm within GIMS was initially being updated on a daily  basis and officials stated that the constant change was a contributing  factor in making it very difficult to understand which positions have a  financial incentive. ARNG-HRM officials stated that, based on feedback,  the algorithm was changed in January 2015 and was now being updated  on a monthly basis instead of a daily basis. However, ARNG-HRM  officials stated that the algorithm change to being updated on a monthly  basis confused state-level recruiting personnel as to how positions that  become vacant within the month are considered for criticality and  incentives between the monthly updates. ARNG-HRM officials stated that  there are tools, such as a search function, within GIMS for state recruiting  personnel that would assist in understanding which positions are  considered critical and have an incentive. However, officials stated that  the tools are not being fully utilized, which is another contributing factor in  not understanding which positions have a financial incentive.", "Part of the reason for confusion is that the ARNG Strength Maintenance  Division and ARNG-HRM has not provided recruiters with training to help  enable them to effectively use financial incentives to fill critical positions.  The ARNG\u2019s training curriculum instructs recruiters to identify the  motivator for each applicant and to use that motivator as leverage to gain  the applicant\u2019s commitment to join the ARNG. For example, some  applicants may be motivated to join the ARNG in order to gain certain job  skills or family tradition of service in the ARNG. Recruiters we interviewed  stated that they are trained to persuade applicants to join the ARNG  based on areas other than financial incentives, such as service to country  and skills training, but the training did not teach recruiters how to use  financial incentives to fill critical positions. While officials maintain that  recruiters should primarily utilize motivators to gain the applicant\u2019s  commitment to join the ARNG, ARNG Strength Maintenance Division and  ARNG-HRM officials stated that additional training for recruiters on how to  utilize tools to understand which positions have incentives may help in  more effective use of financial incentives. Financial incentives are a tool  available to recruiters, and ARNG incentives policy states that the  incentives assist leadership in meeting and sustaining ARNG readiness  requirements and provides incentives to assist in filling critical shortages.  Incentives are to be implemented in those situations where other less  costly methods have proven inadequate or ineffective in supporting unit  and skill staffing requirements. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that it is necessary to provide personnel  with the right training and tools, among other items, to ensure operational  success.

Without information  on the amounts obligated through National Guard- and Reserve- component incentives programs, OSD cannot effectively develop policies  and guidance to help ensure that recruiting resources are used efficiently  and in a cost-effective manner throughout DOD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department of the Army and the ARNG Have Not Evaluated and Documented the Effectiveness of the ARNG\u2019s Financial Incentives Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Army has reviewed and approved the ARNG\u2019s  financial incentives policy and has recently issued a directive that  expands its oversight; however, the Department of the Army and ARNG- HRM have not evaluated and documented the effectiveness of the  financial incentives programs in achieving overall objectives. The ARNG  obligated about $836 million in financial incentives from fiscal years 2012  through 2014, which includes enlistment bonuses, student loan  repayment, and reenlistment bonuses, among other incentives. The  amount obligated for ARNG incentives programs decreased over this time  period, from $348 million in fiscal year 2012 to $206 million in fiscal year  2014. ARNG officials noted that obligations related to ARNG financial  incentives programs decreased over this time period because of  budgetary constraints. According to Department of the a Army  regulation, the Department of the Army Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Personnel has responsibility for conducting a semiannual review  of the financial incentives program. Further, in September 2015 the  Secretary of the Army issued a directive that requires all new accession  incentives created by Department of the Army components, including the  ARNG, to be reviewed and approved by the Department of the Army. In  addition, the directive requires all Department of the Army components to  submit all current incentives programs for Department of the Army review  and approval. A Department of the Army official stated that it meets its  review requirement by ensuring that ARNG financial incentives policy  complies with applicable laws and Army regulations. The official stated  that if the ARNG determines that no midyear updates are necessary, then  the Department of the Army does not conduct an additional review of  ARNG incentives policy.", "As previously noted, the ARNG Strength Maintenance Division and  ARNG-HRM have not ensured that recruiting officials receive training and  understand available financial incentives to fill critical military positions,  and ARNG-HRM officials stated that they are aware that there is some  confusion at the state level over which positions are considered critical. In  November 2005, we reported that of the 1,500 enlisted occupational  specialties across DOD, 19 percent were consistently overfilled and 41  percent were consistently underfilled from fiscal years 2000 through  2005. Moreover, we found that active-duty components provided  bonuses to servicemembers in consistently overfilled occupational  specialties. We recommended that DOD require its 10 components to  report annually on all (not just critical) over- and underfilled occupational  specialties; provide an analysis of why occupational specialties are over-  and underfilled; and report annually on and justify their use of enlistment  and reenlistment bonuses provided to servicemembers in occupational  specialties that exceed their authorized personnel levels. DOD partially  concurred with our recommendation, stating that it has visibility over skills  deemed most critical for retention and that our definition for over- and  underfilled specialties was unreasonably strict. Our recommendation was  not implemented.", "Our current review found that in the ARNG, incentives are not always  being used to fill military occupational specialties that are consistently  below authorized levels and that incentives are being sometimes used for  military occupational specialties that are consistently above approved  levels. Specifically, we found that there were several military occupational  specialties that were consistently below 80 percent of approved rates  from fiscal year 2012 though fiscal year 2014. These military occupational  specialties were in areas including electronic warfare, explosives  ordnance disposal, and special forces, which have all been identified as  important to DOD. For example, data provided by ARNG showed that  while one special forces military occupational specialty was only at 70,  66, and 69 percent filled from fiscal years 2012 through 2014,  respectively, only 14 contracts containing incentives were approved for  individuals in these occupational specialties during that time frame.  ARNG officials stated that, depending on the demographics of a given  area in close proximity to a unit and the requirements to fill positions  within a particular unit, it may be difficult to find applicants who meet the  qualifications of an available position. Further, data provided by the  ARNG also showed that some military occupational specialties were  consistently filled over approved levels yet hundreds of contracts  containing incentives were approved for individuals in these positions  from fiscal years 2012 through 2014. For example, one supply military  occupational specialty was at 118, 116, and 113 percent of authorized  levels from fiscal year 2012 through 2014, respectively, and yet over 880  contracts containing incentives for these positions were awarded during  that time frame. Officials stated that incentives can be awarded to  positions even when the national authorized level is above 100 percent if,  for example, the unit or state-level fill rates are low.", "Furthermore, the Department of the Army and ARNG-HRM have not  exercised their oversight responsibilities to evaluate and document the  effectiveness of the ARNG\u2019s financial incentives program in achieving  overall objectives. A Department of the Army official stated that he  believed that it was not the role of Department of the Army to monitor and  evaluate the effectiveness of the ARNG\u2019s financial incentives program,  and that he believed that it was the ARNG-HRM\u2019s responsibility to do so.  According to ARNG-HRM officials, the effectiveness of the incentive  programs is evaluated on a regular basis. However, ARNG-HRM officials  have not documented results of any evaluations or documented that their  current financial incentives programs are meeting overall objectives.  Department of the Army and National Guard regulations state that the  Department of the Army Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel  and ARNG-HRM, respectively, will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness  of the ARNG financial incentives program in achieving overall objectives.  A National Guard regulation states that ARNG incentives serve as  extraordinary measures to assist the ARNG in meeting and sustaining  personnel requirements, help meet quality and skill-match objectives,  stabilize the ARNG through longer service commitments, assist in filling  critical skill shortages, and support deploying and high-priority units.  However, Department of the Army and ARNG-HRM officials have not  documented that the ARNG incentives programs are meeting the goals  listed in the National Guard regulation.", "Moreover, recruiting officials at all of the four selected states we visited  stated that there are cases where applicants enlist in the ARNG for  nonfinancial reasons, such as service to country, and have still been  awarded financial incentives. Without the Department of the Army and  ARNG-HRM evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of ARNG  incentives programs in meeting its goals and documenting the results,  they may not know whether incentives are being used effectively to meet  and sustain program goals and whether incentives are being awarded to  fill critical occupational specialties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In light of the Department of the Army\u2019s downsizing and ongoing fiscal  uncertainty, and given the importance of the ARNG to help meet Army  missions, it is critical for the ARNG to oversee its recruiting process and  to maximize its return on investment it incurs with recruits. In response to  findings from our prior work as well as others, the ARNG has taken steps  to increase its oversight of the recruiting process. However, the Recruiting  Standards Branch, which has played a key role in ARNG oversight of  state-level recruiting activities, is in a pilot phase awaiting approval and is  not permanently established. In addition to continued attention on  oversight, the ARNG must have relevant, timely information that provides  visibility over a soldier\u2019s career, including the recruiting process and  training for his or her military occupation, through the soldier\u2019s completion  of his or her initial term of service. While the ARNG has increased its  percentage of soldiers who complete initial military training, available data  do not provide the ARNG with full visibility into when or why a soldier  does not complete initial military training or may not be reliable. Further,  the ARNG\u2019s approach to tracking soldiers does not include whether  soldiers who join in a given fiscal year complete their initial term of  service. Moreover, the ARNG has not periodically estimated the total cost  to recruit and train a soldier. Such information could be useful to decision  makers to help understand the return on investment in recruiting and  training a soldier. Although the ARNG implemented a new financial  incentives system in fiscal year 2012, the ARNG has not provided training  to help ensure that recruiters understand what financial incentives are  available to help fill critical positions. Moreover, OSD, the Department of  the Army, and the ARNG have not fully conducted their oversight  responsibilities of ARNG incentives programs. Though the National Guard  and Reserve components are required to provide information on their  incentives programs, OSD has not enforced the requirement since around  2004, and while the Department of the Army and ARNG are required to  assess the effectiveness of the ARNG financial incentives programs, they  have not evaluated or documented their assessments of the programs.  Given the number of occupations that are not at full strength and given  the current constrained fiscal environment, it is critically important for  DOD to know that incentives are being obligated effectively and that they  are achieving the goal of helping to fill critical positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Army take the following six  actions:", "To aid ARNG officials in conducting their oversight of the states and  territories, direct the Director, ARNG, to establish a permanent  program for monitoring state-level recruiting activities either by  extending the Recruiting Standards Branch or establishing some other  similar program.", "To aid ARNG officials in understanding the effectiveness of efforts to  meet force requirements, direct the Director, ARNG, to do the  following:", "Take steps to help ensure that the ARNG collects consistent,  complete, and valid data on the specific reasons why soldiers do  not complete initial military training and when these soldiers  separate from the ARNG during the training process.

In its  written comments, DOD concurred with all seven of our  recommendations, but stated that it did not concur with our report due to  our description of recruiting policies that were in place during the last  nearly 15 years of war. DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix VIII.  DOD also provided technical comments that we considered and  incorporated as appropriate.", "Regarding its statement that the department does not concur with our  report, DOD stated that we portray both Army and ARNG recruiting efforts  as being targeted at sexual offenders and that we assert that during  hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan that both the Army and ARNG made  standard practice of issuing enlistment waivers for convicted sexual  offenders. We disagree with that assertion. In our report, we describe the  recruiting policies that were in place during a difficult time for military  recruiting and have since changed. Further, in the technical comments  provided to us, DOD stated that \u201cAt the height of Operations Enduring  Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, the Department of the Army and the  National Guard Bureau (NGB) accepted lower quality applicants (lower  aptitude scores and moral waivers) and offered significantly higher  incentives in order to ensure that the Army National Guard (ARNG) and  Active Army could meet their respective missions, achieve end strength  goals and provide ready units to combatant commanders.\u201d DOD also  provided additional context regarding factors that have made the  recruiting environment increasingly more challenging. Based on DOD\u2019s  technical comments, we have added context to our final report regarding  our description of the Army and ARNG\u2019s past recruiting efforts.   Specifically, our report now states that, \u201csince the end of Operation Iraqi  Freedom and a significant drawdown from Afghanistan, the Department  of the Army and NGB have issued guidance prohibiting approval of  waivers for applicants with prior criminal offenses such as certain types of  sexual offenses, as well as increasing the applicant aptitude score  standards. These changes and other factors such as a less physically fit  youth population have reduced the pool of qualified applicants for the  ARNG and make it more difficult for recruiters to meet defined recruiting  goals.\u201d In April 2012, the Director of Military Personnel Management  issued a memorandum entitled Suspension of Enlistment Waivers, which  stated that in an effort to reinforce and ensure compliance with Office of  the Undersecretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) policy issued  in 2009, the \u201cenlistment or commissioning of any individual with a  conviction or adverse adjudication for a felony or misdemeanor sexual  offense is prohibited and no waivers are authorized.\u201d The memorandum  also suspends enlistment waivers in areas of major misconduct, positive  drug/alcohol tests at military entrance processing stations, and  misconduct or juvenile major misconduct for drug use, possession, or  drug paraphernalia, to include marijuana.", "DOD agreed in its comments that not enlisting individuals with felony  issues does shrink the pool of eligible recruits but stated that the  accession mission for the ARNG has not been in jeopardy. However, as  we note in this report, while ARNG met end-strength goals from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014, the ARNG met overall recruiting goals in only 2  of the 5 years. We noted in our report that several factors have reduced  the pool of qualified recruits, all while end-strength goals have remained  constant. This in itself makes it inherently more difficult for recruiters to  meet defined recruiting goals. Further, officials we interviewed during this  engagement stated that their reduced ability to process waivers for  certain law violations has made meeting the recruiting mission more  difficult. We also note in our report that in June 2008 OSD issued a  Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-018 \u2013 Enlistment Waivers, which  established policy and provided guidance regarding enlistment waivers  for applicants for the Military Services and provided standardized  terminology for the tracking and reporting of waiver data to be  implemented in fiscal year 2009.

Also, House Report 113-446  accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2015 included two additional provisions: 1) a provision for us to  assess the extent to which contracting vehicles used to support ARNG  recruiting were in compliance with Department of Defense (DOD) and  Department of the Army policies and regulations, and 2) a provision for us  to assess the numbers of individuals who complete basic and advanced  individual training and the average length of time between when a person  enlists in the ARNG and when the person completes initial military  training. To address the first of the two additional provisions, we reviewed  findings from and the status of recommendations by the U.S. Army Audit  Agency and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Procurement to improve contracting processes at the National Guard  Bureau (NGB). A Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Procurement official determined that this information is sensitive but  unclassified so we provided this information separately to the committees.  To address the second provision, we included results of our analyses in  appendixes II, III, IV, and V.", "To describe the steps the ARNG has taken to provide oversight of the  ARNG recruiting process, we obtained and reviewed guidance and policy  documents regarding oversight of recruiter activities and interviewed  officials from the ARNG. Although not generalizable to all states and  territories, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of four states based on  factors such as size, the total number of accessions, and geographic  locations to understand and describe how states conduct oversight. We  selected Texas and Pennsylvania as two states with a large-size ARNG  end-strength, Virginia as a state with a medium-size end-strength, and  Idaho as a state with a small-size end-strength. We obtained and  reviewed applicable state and local recruiting and retention policy  documents and interviewed recruiting and retention officials at each of  these four selected states. The observations from these four selected  states are not generalizable to all states and territories but provide  important insight into ARNG oversight of its recruiting process.", "To determine the extent to which the ARNG met goals for recruiting,  completion of initial military training, and completion of initial term of  service, we obtained aggregate recruiting data and associated goals from  the ARNG. We compared data on the ARNG\u2019s annual recruiting goals for  enlistments to the number of enlistments in the ARNG for fiscal years  2010 through 2014, respectively. We chose fiscal year 2010 as the start  date because our prior work discussed the extent to which the ARNG met  its recruiting goals from fiscal years 2000 through 2009. We chose fiscal  year 2014 as the end date because it was the most recently available  data at the time of our review. In addition, we compared ARNG\u2019s goals for  completion of initial military training to ARNG-reported completion rates in  fiscal years 2011 through 2014. We could not assess the extent to which  ARNG met its goal for completion of initial military training in fiscal years  prior to 2011 because the goals in place for those years were not  available or not comparable to the completion rates provided by the  ARNG. We tried to analyze data on the reasons why soldiers did not  complete their initial military training and when these soldiers separated  during the training process; however, we found that states inconsistently  recorded the reasons why soldiers left before beginning or prior to  completion of training and that training data did not provide full visibility  into when soldiers separated during the training process, as we discuss in  greater detail in the report. Lastly, we compared ARNG\u2019s fiscal year 2015  attrition goal for soldiers nearing the end of their initial term to the ARNG\u2019s  initial term attrition rate as of May 2015, which was the most recently  available data at the time of our review. We could not assess the extent to  which the ARNG met goals prior to fiscal year 2015 because ARNG  officials stated that the goals have changed over time and could not  provide goals for previous fiscal years. In addition to analyzing available  data, we interviewed ARNG officials and officials from the four states we  visited for their perspectives on trends and issues we identified in  analyzing the data.", "To determine the extent to which OSD, the Department of the Army, and  the ARNG have conducted oversight of the ARNG\u2019s incentives programs,  we obtained and analyzed relevant policy and guidance documents to  identify oversight responsibilities for ARNG incentives programs.

We interviewed  officials from OSD, Department of the Army, and the ARNG to gain an  understanding of how OSD, the Department of the Army, and the ARNG  conduct oversight of ARNG incentives programs. To gain an  understanding of how incentives are being implemented during recruiting  and retention activities, we obtained and analyzed applicable state and  local incentives policies and interviewed recruiting and retention officials  from our four selected states.

We elaborate on the results from our analysis in appendixes II and III and  we provide additional analysis related to the length of time soldiers who  did not meet their initial term of service stayed in the ARNG in appendix  IV and the reasons why soldiers left the ARNG prior to completing their  initial term of service in appendix V. We analyzed data from 365,431 non- prior-service enlisted soldiers who joined the ARNG from fiscal years  2004 through 2013 to determine the extent to which they completed their  initial military training. We also calculated the length of time it took non- prior-service, non-split-option soldiers who enlisted during this time  period to complete their initial military training and become qualified for  their military occupational specialty. In addition, we analyzed data from  380,736 enlisted soldiers who joined the ARNG from fiscal years 2001  through 2007 to determine whether they completed their initial term of  service. For those soldiers who joined during this time period but did not  complete their initial term of service, we analyzed the length of time they  stayed in the ARNG and the reasons for their separation. Because states  inconsistently recorded the reason for soldiers who left the ARNG before  completing training, we could only analyze the reasons for soldiers who  completed training but left before the end of their initial term of service.", "To assess the reliability of the data used in this report, we analyzed the  data for inconsistencies, incomplete data fields, and outliers. We also  reviewed relevant documentation about the data systems and guidance  provided to the states and territories on how to report recruiting and  retention data.

We noted any  limitations in the report, where appropriate. Except in the case of reasons  why soldiers left the ARNG before completing their military training and  data on when soldiers separated during the training process, we found  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining (1)  the extent to which enlisted soldiers completed their initial military  training; (2) the length of time it took these soldiers to complete their initial  military training and become qualified for their military occupational  specialty; (3) the extent to which enlisted soldiers completed their initial  term of service; (4) the length of time enlisted soldiers who did not  complete their initial term of service served in the ARNG; and (5) the  reasons why enlisted soldiers who graduated from their training but did  not complete their initial term of service left the ARNG.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2014 to November  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

ARNG Strength Maintenance  Division officials attributed the improvements in completion of training  largely to the Recruit Sustainment Program, which began in fiscal year  2005.
