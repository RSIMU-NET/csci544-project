However, as discussed in chapter 2, the C-17\u2019s planned intratheater role has been largely limited and the Air Force does not plan to replace C-130s with C-17s for intratheater missions. Therefore, it was inappropriate to assume the mixed fleet alternative should include this added $4.7 billion. If this cost is subtracted from the mixed fleet, the cost of a fleet of 120 C-17s increases from about $6 billion to about $10.7 billion more than the mixed fleet alternative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "C-17\u2019s Program Cost Continues to Increase", "paragraphs": ["In its May 1994 paper, \u201cDepartment of Defense Airlift Acquisition Strategy,\u201d DOD included average cost figures that indicate that C-17 program cost estimates continue to increase. In December 1992, total program costs were estimated to be $39.5 billion (in then-year dollars) at a maximum rate of 16 aircraft per year. In January 1994, the C-17 program director estimated that total program costs would increase to $43 billion because of a reduced procurement rate of 12 aircraft per year and increased estimates for production and support costs.", "DOD\u2019s paper indicated that, at a maximum production rate of 12 aircraft per year, total program costs would be $45.4 billion. This increase is attributable to increased production and support costs and the cost of a recently approved business settlement between DOD and McDonnell Douglas. If the maximum procurement rate were reduced to eight aircraft per year, DOD\u2019s paper estimated that total program costs would increase another $2.6 billion, to about $48 billion. In recent years, due to ongoing development and production problems, Congress has reduced funding to slow the C-17\u2019s production rate to reduce the level of concurrency in the program. While the Air Force\u2019s desired procurement rate may eventually be achieved, the program has been significantly more stretched out than originally planned.", "The C-17 procurement cost estimates reported in DOD\u2019s paper are significantly higher than those in the C-17 COEA. DOD\u2019s paper indicates that estimated procurement costs have increased by $2.8 billion to $4 billion (in constant fiscal year 1993 dollars) since the C-17 COEA. Consequently, the potential savings from adopting an alternative to the 120-aircraft fleet would be significantly greater than the $10.7 billion we previously reported. While estimating the exact amount of savings would be very difficult because of the many variables involved, we believe the increase in savings could approach $4 billion. However, this estimate does not take into account changes that may have occurred in the estimated costs of modified commercial aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimum Number of C-17s Needed to Fulfill Unique Military Requirements Not Yet Determined", "paragraphs": ["Determining whether a mixed fleet is a viable alternative to a 120-aircraft C-17 program depends on the fleet\u2019s capability to fulfill certain unique military requirements such as direct delivery to forward airfields, routine operations into small, austere airfields in an intratheater role, airlift of outsize cargo, and airdrop. The COEA was not intended to address this issue in detail. DOD has several studies underway, scheduled to be completed before the November 1995 Defense Acquisition Board decision on C-17 full-rate production, that will assess the capability of various fleet mixes and identify the minimum number of C-17s needed to fulfill unique military airlift requirements. As currently planned, nondevelopmental airlift aircraft source selection and quantity will depend on the C-17 full-rate production decision. The Defense Acquisition Board will consider several factors in deciding whether to continue the C-17 program, including C-17 flight test and reliability results, contractor performance, and the findings of the Air Force\u2019s airlift fleet mix study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Serious concerns about the C-17\u2019s cost-effectiveness have prompted Congress to direct DOD to explore alternatives to the full C-17 program. The COEA identified less costly alternatives that could meet airlift requirements and save billions of dollars. In addition, the C-17\u2019s program cost continues to increase. Therefore, the savings associated with a mixed fleet of C-17s and commercial freighters could be significantly greater than the COEA reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of changes in the C-17\u2019s intended role, its less than anticipated performance, the results of DOD\u2019s COEA, and continued program cost growth, we continue to believe that Congress should not support the C-17 program beyond the minimum number needed to fulfill unique military requirements. That number has not yet been determined but is the subject of several ongoing studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of our report, DOD stated that (1) a direct invasion of Saudi Arabia would still likely result in extremely constrained theater airfield availability in contrast to that reflected in the 1992 MRS, (2) two C-17s flew missions to Kuwait and demonstrated higher utilization rates than required, and (3) its COEA estimate of potential savings associated with the mixed fleet alternatives was not understated.", "While the precise extent of airfield availability in any future contingency is unknown, the MRS threat suggests that more airfields will be available than was the case during Desert Shield, when allied forces had the advantage of a 5-month deployment period. We believe that using the Desert Shield-type airfield situation juxtaposed against an MRS threat gives the C-17 an inappropriate advantage over alternative airlifters. In our opinion, a more valid basis on which to compare the C-17 to alternative airlift fleets is the COEA\u2019s examination of the MRS airfield availability assumption.", "The recent missions to Kuwait are not an adequate basis for establishing the appropriate sustainable utilization rate because these missions were of extremely limited duration. DOD has not yet determined how to extrapolate an inherent utilization rate from the results of the planned July 1995 reliability, maintainability, and availability evaluation. Our position remains that the projected C-17 utilization rate of 15.2 is, as yet, undemonstrated and that comparing this rate to a 12.5-hour utilization rate for commercial airlifters that have demonstrated higher utilization rates inappropriately favored the C-17 in the COEA.", "DOD\u2019s position that the C-17\u2019s intratheater role is unchanged from that depicted in the 1983 Airlift Master Plan, despite an almost 50-percent reduction in the number of aircraft, is untenable. DOD\u2019s position also contradicts the comments of Office of the Secretary of Defense and AMC officials on our July 1994 report on the COEA, as well as the comments of AMC officials on this report. These officials acknowledged that the C-17\u2019s intratheater shuttle role has been substantially diminished in the wake of the reduction from 210 to 120 aircraft. Moreover, they concurred with our finding that the COEA should not have assumed a cost saving to the C-17 to account for this intratheater role."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
