VA plans to consolidate the Choice Program and its other VA community care programs into one community care program\u2014the VCCP. This legislation helps address some of the challenges faced by the Choice Program and VA's other community care programs. VA's implementation of the VCCP can benefit from the lessons learned under the Choice Program. Ignoring these lessons learned increases VA's risk for not being able to ensure that all veterans receive timely access to care in the community and that community providers are reimbursed in a timely manner.", "This testimony focuses on lessons learned from the Choice Program, including recommendations GAO has made to VA to help ensure (1) veterans' timely access to care under the VCCP (2) effective monitoring of veterans' access to care under the VCCP, and (3) timely payments to community providers under the VCCP. This testimony is based on GAO reports on the Choice Program that were issued in June 2018 and September 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers). The program is largely managed by third party administrators (TPA), who are responsible for establishing provider networks, scheduling veterans' appointments, and paying providers. GAO has identified the following challenges to the Choice Program that VA needs to address as it implements its new Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP).", "Factors that adversely affected veterans' timely access to care. GAO found that numerous factors adversely affected veterans' timely access to care through the Choice Program. These factors included (1) administrative burden caused by complexities of referral and appointment scheduling processes; (2) poor communication between VA and its medical facilities; and (3) inadequacies in the networks of community providers established by the TPAs, including an insufficient number, mix, or geographic distribution of community providers. VA has taken steps intended to help address these factors, however, some have not been fully addressed. In June 2018, GAO made five recommendations to VA, including that VA establish a system that will facilitate care coordination and exchanges of information among VA medical facilities, VA clinicians, TPAs, community providers, and veterans. VA agreed or agreed in principle with all five recommendations, but has not yet implemented them.", "Unavailable and unreliable data. GAO found that VA cannot systematically monitor the timeliness of veterans' access to Choice Program care because it lacks complete, reliable data to do so. The data limitations GAO identified included a lack of data on the timeliness of accepting referrals and opting veterans in to the program, inaccurate data on clinically indicated dates (which are used to measure the timeliness of care), and unreliable data on the timeliness of urgent care. In June 2018, GAO made five recommendations to VA, including that VA implement mechanisms to allow VA to systematically monitor the amount of time taken to prepare referrals, schedule appointments, and complete appointments. VA agreed with four of the five recommendations, but has not yet implemented them.", "Untimely payments to community providers. GAO identified three key factors that affected timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program. These factors included (1) VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay providers' claims; (2) Choice Program reimbursement requirements, which led to claim denials; and (3) inadequate provider education on filing claims. GAO found that VA has taken actions to address the factors, such as amending certain reimbursement requirements. However, two of these factors have not been fully addressed. In September 2018, GAO made two recommendations to VA, including that VA collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers.

VA refers to the consolidated program as the VCCP.  In December 2016, prior to enactment of the VA MISSION Act of 2018,  VA issued a request for proposals for contractors to help administer the  VCCP. The VCCP will be similar to the current Choice Program in certain  respects. For example, under the VCCP, TPAs will be responsible for  establishing regional networks of community providers and processing  and paying those providers\u2019 claims. However, unlike the Choice Program,  under the VCCP, VA is planning to have medical facilities\u2014not the  TPAs\u2014generally be responsible for scheduling veterans\u2019 appointments  with community providers.

VA has taken steps to help address these factors; however, not  all access factors have been fully addressed. For example, to help  address administrative burden and improve the process of coordinating  veterans\u2019 Choice Program care, VA established a secure e-mail system  and a mechanism for TPAs and community providers to remotely access  veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records. However, these mechanisms only  facilitate a one-way transfer of necessary information.

VA will need to address these data  limitations in order to effectively monitor the care delivered to veterans  through the VCCP. The data limitations we identified included the  following:", "A lack of data on the timeliness of accepting referrals and opting  veterans in to the program. We found that the data VA uses to monitor  the timeliness of Choice Program appointments do not capture the time it  takes VA medical facilities to prepare veterans\u2019 referrals and send them to  the TPAs, nor do they capture the time spent by the TPAs in accepting  VA medical facilities\u2019 referrals and opting veterans in to the Choice  Program. VA had implemented an interim solution to monitor overall wait  times that relies on VA medical facility staff consistently and accurately  entering unique identification numbers on VA clinicians\u2019 requests for care  and on Choice Program referrals, a process that is prone to error.", "Inaccuracy of clinically indicated dates. We found that clinically  indicated dates (used to measure the timeliness of care) are sometimes  changed by VA medical facility staff before they send Choice Program  referrals to the TPAs, which could mask veterans\u2019 true wait times. We  found that VA medical facility staff entered later clinically indicated dates  on referrals for about 23 percent of the 196 authorizations we reviewed.  It is unclear if VA medical facility staff mistakenly entered incorrect dates  manually, or if they inappropriately entered later dates when the VA  medical facility was delayed in contacting the veteran, compiling relevant  clinical information, and sending the referral to the TPA.", "Unreliable data on the timeliness of urgent care. We found that VA  medical facilities and TPAs do not always categorize Choice Program  referrals and authorizations in accordance with the contractual definition  for urgent care. According to the contracts, a referral is to be marked as  \u201curgent,\u201d and an appointment is to take place within 2 business days of  the TPA accepting it, when a VA clinician has determined that the needed  care is (1) essential to evaluate and stabilize the veteran\u2019s condition, and  (2) if delayed would likely result in unacceptable morbidity or pain. We  reviewed a sample of 53 urgent care authorizations and determined that  about 28 percent of the authorizations were originally marked as routine  care authorizations but were changed to urgent by VA medical facility or  TPA staff, in an effort to administratively expedite appointment  scheduling.", "We made five recommendations to VA on improving the completeness  and accuracy of data on veterans\u2019 wait times for care.

These factors included the following: (1) VA\u2019s untimely payments to  TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay  community providers\u2019 claims; (2) Choice Program reimbursement  requirements, which led to claim denials; and (3) inadequate provider  education on filing claims. We reported that VA has taken some actions to  address these factors. For example, VA updated its payment system and  related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of  July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs\u2019 invoices within  7 days, a significant increase from the 50 percent timely payments VA  made to TPAs between November 2014 and September 2016. In  addition, VA and the TPAs had taken steps to amend certain  reimbursement requirements and improve provider education to help  providers resolve claims processing issues.", "However, we found that VA has not fully addressed two of these factors.  First, with respect to reimbursement requirements, VA does not have  complete data allowing it to effectively monitor adherence with its policy  for VA medical facilities to perform timely reviews and approvals of  secondary authorization requests. Community providers request  secondary authorization requests when veterans need health care  services that exceed the period or scope of the original authorization.  Incomplete data impacted VA\u2019s ability to meet the requirement. When VA  medical facilities delay these reviews and approvals, community providers  may have to delay care or deliver care that is not authorized, which in turn  increases the likelihood that the providers\u2019 claims will be denied and the  providers will not be paid. Second, with respect to provider education on  filing claims, VA requires the TPAs to establish a customer call center to  respond to calls from veterans and non-VA providers. However, VA does  not enforce the contractual requirement for responding to calls from  community providers and allows the TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans  over calls from community providers. Consequently, VA is not collecting  data, monitoring, or enforcing compliance with its contractual  requirements for the TPAs to provide timely customer service to  providers. As a result, VA does not have information on the extent to  which community providers face challenges when contacting the TPAs  about claims payment issues, which could contribute to the amount of  time it takes to receive reimbursement for services.", "To address remaining factors that affect provider payment timeliness, we  made two recommendations to VA. VA agreed with both  recommendations. Our recommendations and the steps VA has taken in  response to these recommendations are described in table 4.", "In summary, consolidating its existing community care programs into the  VCCP and launching this new program in June 2019 is a large and  complex undertaking, which comes with many risks and challenges for  VA. Heeding the lessons learned from its implementation and  management of the Choice Program will better position VA to ensure  veterans receive timely access to care under the VCCP and avoid past  challenges such as delays in scheduling appointments and untimely  payments to community providers. Continued oversight of VA\u2019s  implementation of the VCCP will be critical given the scale of change and  the associated risks.
