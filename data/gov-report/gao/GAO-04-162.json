In response, VA has acted to reduce travel times to medical facilities and waiting times for appointments with primary and specialty care physicians. Recently, VA released a draft national plan for restructuring its health care system as part of a planning initiative known as Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES). GAO was asked to assess Chattanooga-area veterans' access to inpatient hospital and outpatient primary and specialty care against VA's guidelines for travel times and appointment waiting times and to determine how the draft CARES plan would affect Chattanooga-area veterans' access to such care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Almost all (99 percent) of the 16,379 enrolled veterans in the 18-county Chattanooga area, as of September 2001, faced travel times that exceeded VA's guidelines for accessing inpatient hospital care. During fiscal year 2002, only a few Chattanooga-area veterans were admitted to non-VA hospitals in Chattanooga--constituting about 5 percent of inpatient workload. In addition, over half (8,400) of Chattanooga-area enrolled veterans faced travel times that exceeded VA's 30-minute guideline for outpatient primary care. Also, waiting times for scheduling initial outpatient primary and specialty care appointments frequently exceeded VA's 30-day guideline. VA's draft CARES plan would shorten travel times for some Chattanooga-area veterans but lengthen travel times for others. Under the plan, the amount of inpatient care VA purchases from non-VA hospitals in Chattanooga would increase from 5 percent to 29 percent, thereby reducing those veterans' travel times to within VA's guidelines. The plan also proposes to shift some inpatient workload from VA's Murfreesboro hospital to its Nashville hospital. As a result, an estimated 54 percent of inpatient workload for Chattanooga-area enrolled veterans will be provided in Nashville compared to 40 percent in fiscal year 2002, thereby lengthening some veterans' travel times by about 20 minutes. The plan also proposes opening four new community-based clinics, which would bring about 2,700 more Chattanooga-area enrolled veterans within VA's 30-minute travel guideline for primary care, leaving about 5,700 enrolled veterans with travel times for such care that exceed VA's guideline. These clinics likely would not open before fiscal year 2011, given priorities specified in the plan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates a nationwide health  care system that is organized into 21 integrated health care networks  comprising over 160 hospitals and 600 community-based outpatient  clinics. Over 7 million veterans are enrolled nationwide; during fiscal year  2002, almost 4.3 million veterans received VA health care, at a cost of   $22.6 billion. Generally, VA assigns each enrolled veteran to a primary care  provider who manages his or her care, including making referrals for  hospital admission or consultation with specialists on an outpatient basis.", "Veterans residing in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have encountered  difficulties accessing VA inpatient and outpatient health care services. For  example, in a 1999 report, VA\u2019s Inspector General (IG) cited waiting times  for outpatient specialty care that frequently exceeded 90 days, which  raised concern about VA\u2019s capacity to meet veterans\u2019 health care needs at  the Chattanooga clinic and the nearest VA hospitals located in  Murfreesboro and Nashville, Tennessee. The report also highlighted long  distances between VA\u2019s Chattanooga clinic and those hospitals\u2014110 and  125 miles, respectively. Following the 1999 report, VA took several steps  specifically designed to enhance veterans\u2019 access to health care, including  expanding service capacity at the Chattanooga clinic and contracting for  inpatient hospital care and outpatient primary and specialty care with  local providers in Chattanooga, including the Erlanger Medical Center.", "To enhance services for veterans across its entire health care system, VA  began a nationwide strategic planning initiative in October 2000, known as  Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES). We support  the goals of this initiative, which was undertaken in response to our 1999  recommendation that VA restructure its delivery of health care to reduce  spending on underutilized or inefficient buildings and, in turn, reinvest the  savings in enhanced health care resources closer to where veterans live.  The CARES process is designed to address, among other things, veterans\u2019  access to health care and the cost and quality of health care. As part of this  initiative, VA conducted analyses of needs and alternatives at both the  national and local levels, using the 77 designated health care markets in  VA\u2019s health care networks. In August 2003, VA released its draft CARES  plan, which presented a wide range of health care service enhancement  proposals based on veterans\u2019 projected health care needs and related  capacity requirements. After reviewing the plan and collecting additional  information, an independent CARES Commission will, in February 2004,  make specific recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for  restructuring VA\u2019s health care system; the Secretary is expected to make a  final decision within 30 days of receiving the Commission\u2019s  recommendation.", "To measure the accessibility of its health care services, VA established  guidelines for travel times and waiting times. As part of its CARES  initiative, VA established national travel time guidelines to help define  reasonable access to health care. Specifically, VA defines reasonable  access to inpatient hospital care to be a travel time\u2014from a veteran\u2019s  residence to the nearest appropriate VA hospital\u2014of no more than 60  minutes for those residing in urban counties and 90 minutes for rural  county residents. VA defines reasonable access to outpatient primary care  to be a travel time of no more than 30 minutes from a veteran\u2019s residence  to the nearest VA primary care clinic in urban and rural counties. Prior to  its CARES initiative, VA had already established 30 days or less as a  reasonable waiting time for initial primary care and outpatient specialty  care appointments.", "At your request, we assessed how (1) Chattanooga-area veterans\u2019 access to  inpatient hospital and outpatient primary and specialty care compared to  VA\u2019s established travel time and appointment waiting time guidelines and  (2) VA\u2019s draft CARES plan, if implemented, could affect Chattanooga-area  veterans\u2019 access to such care.", "To perform our work, we discussed the provision of VA-financed health  care services with officials of VA\u2019s Chattanooga Clinic, the Mid South  Network office located in Nashville, the IG\u2019s office, and VA headquarters,  as well as representatives of the Erlanger Medical Center. To assess travel  and waiting times, we defined Chattanooga-area veterans to be those  residing in Hamilton County, which includes the city of Chattanooga, and  17 surrounding counties; those 18 counties are all closer (as measured by  travel time) to the VA clinic and non-VA hospitals in Chattanooga than to  VA hospitals and clinics in Murfreesboro and Nashville. Using VA\u2019s CARES  databases, we analyzed demographic and workload information for 16,379  veterans from those 18 counties who were enrolled in VA\u2019s health care  system as of fiscal year 2001. Our analyses of travel times focused on  hospital services and outpatient primary care because VA did not have  guidelines for outpatient specialty care travel times. Also, we examined  fiscal year 2002 data on inpatient hospital admissions for medicine and  surgery services as well as primary care and specialty care scheduling data  for Chattanooga-area veterans. Regarding the impact of VA\u2019s draft national  CARES plan, we reviewed the plan and a wide array of supporting  documents and discussed those documents with VA officials. As agreed  with your office, we focused on access to care for Chattanooga-area  veterans.

For  example, when purchasing care on a fee-for-service basis, providers were  to refer veterans to local hospitals only when care was not available at VA  hospitals in Murfreesboro or Nashville or the veterans\u2019 medical conditions  precluded travel to those sites. Also, in implementing a contract with the  Erlanger Medical Center, network officials instructed VA clinic providers  to limit referrals to Erlanger to only veterans with less severe medical  conditions, such as those who did not require surgery or hospital stays  longer than 5 days.

We used VA\u2019s CARES  databases for demographic and workload information for the 16,379  veterans from those 18 counties who were enrolled in VA\u2019s health care  system as of fiscal year 2001. We compared these results with the inpatient  and outpatient primary care travel time guidelines that VA used in its  CARES planning to determine the percentage of enrollees, by county, who  lived within the inpatient and outpatient access guidelines. We did not  analyze travel times for outpatient specialty care because VA did not have  guidelines for such care.", "In addition, we determined Chattanooga veterans\u2019 access to inpatient care  at non-VA Chattanooga hospitals by obtaining inpatient admissions data  and other information from officials of the Mid South Network; the VA  Chattanooga clinic; the Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga; and VA\u2019s  network data service centers in Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois,  Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Durham, North Carolina. We used VA\u2019s  Computerized Patient Record System to extract data from 60 of 580  medical records to compile a generalizable profile of all fiscal year 2002  admissions of Chattanooga-area veterans to VA hospitals in Murfreesboro  and Nashville. To evaluate information contained in the VA-Erlanger  inpatient contract, we reviewed contract documents and conducted  interviews with VA\u2019s clinic staff and network officials, including those in  the network\u2019s business office, as well as legal and other officials from the  Erlanger Medical Center.", "Regarding waiting times, we interviewed Mid South Network and  Chattanooga clinic staff and analyzed workload data compiled by clinic  staff. For example, we analyzed the clinic\u2019s fiscal year 2002 waiting lists to  identify the number of veterans who enrolled for primary care and the  number of days they waited for their first appointment with a primary care  provider. We compared these results to VA\u2019s 30-day appointment waiting  time guideline.", "In addition, using automated medical records and clinic data, we collected  information on Chattanooga clinic providers\u2019 requests for specialty  consultations. We used this information to determine the number of days  needed to obtain an appointment with a specialist. In May 2003, we  reviewed all such requests made by clinic providers in October 2002,  selecting this time frame to ensure that VA staff had sufficient time to  schedule the requested appointments by the time we conducted our  review. We then analyzed the results from this review and compared these  results to VA\u2019s 30-day waiting time guidelines and also to the waiting times  reported by VA\u2019s Inspector General in his office\u2019s 1999 performance review  of the Chattanooga clinic.", "To determine how VA\u2019s draft CARES plan could affect Chattanooga-area  veterans\u2019 access to VA inpatient health care services, we examined the  draft national CARES plan; the Mid South Network\u2019s CARES planning  documents; and workload data produced by VA\u2019s CARES Program Office,  the Mid South Network office, and the Chattanooga clinic. We also held  discussions with VA officials. To evaluate effects of the CARES proposal  to shift inpatient workload from VA\u2019s Murfreesboro hospital to Nashville  and non-VA hospitals in Chattanooga, we analyzed Mid South Network  data for Chattanooga-area veterans\u2019 inpatient workload at those locations  during fiscal year 2002 and estimated the workload that would be served  at those locations if the CARES proposal were implemented. In addition,  we used the Department of Energy driving time model to analyze the  extent to which access would change if VA opened the additional primary  care clinics proposed in the national draft CARES plan.", "Also, we analyzed the reliability of key databases to ensure that there were  no material errors or inconsistencies. For example, we used information  obtained through our medical record review to cross-check inpatient  workload data regarding admissions to Murfreesboro and Nashville during  fiscal year 2002 and found those data to be sufficiently reliable. Also, we  compared outpatient specialty consultation information with appointment  scheduling information contained in VA\u2019s computerized record system.  Lastly, we compared CARES demographic data on Chattanooga-area  veterans with data in VA\u2019s national enrollment data file for fiscal year 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Lisa Gardner, Julian Klazkin, John Mingus, Daniel Montinez, Keith Steck,  and Paul Reynolds made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["VA Health Care: Framework for Analyzing Capital Asset Realignment  for Enhanced Services Decisions.
