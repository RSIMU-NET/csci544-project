For example, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) continues to rely on forced-balance adjustments to replace the financial information that DOD's components submit to force agreement with Department of the Treasury balances without reconciling and researching the cause of differences (see figure). The recording of these adjustments was identified as a material weakness in DOD's internal control over financial reporting in its fiscal year 2018 financial statement audit.", "GAO found that DOD and DFAS policies and procedures for accounting adjustments are insufficient, outdated, and inconsistently implemented. For example, DOD's current policies do not define what constitutes adequate supporting documentation for system-generated adjustments, nor have DOD and DFAS established policies for identifying the cause of the adjustments, developing and implementing action plans to reduce the need for adjustments, and monitoring the effectiveness of those action plans. Because DOD and DFAS are not ensuring that their policies and procedures are up-to-date and consistently implemented, there is an increased risk that inaccurate, invalid, or unapproved adjustments will be recorded in DOD's core financial reporting system, resulting in a misstatement in DOD's consolidated financial statements.", "DOD and DFAS have undertaken initiatives to address some of the issues that contribute to the need for adjustments. Both organizations have developed strategies to decrease adjustments; however, neither has developed specific outcomes or detailed procedures for achieving stated goals in the strategies. Without clear procedures on how to implement its initiatives and a complete understanding across DOD of the issues contributing to the need for accounting adjustments, there is an increased risk that management efforts to reduce adjustments at the DOD consolidated level will be inefficient and ineffective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to DOD, which include updating and implementing policies and procedures on recording accounting adjustments and identifying steps to reduce the need for recording adjustments across the department.

We also  inquired about the procedures used to determine the underlying causes of  accounting adjustments, if action plans to address the causes have been  developed, and the status of these plans and assessed whether the  implemented action plans are monitored for effectiveness. Additionally,  we performed tests of controls on a random sample of 242 accounting  adjustments from a population of 200,468 adjustments recorded at the  consolidated level that impacted the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.

For example, elimination adjustments for intragovernmental balances, as  previously discussed, are necessary in order to avoid overstating the  account balances of subsidiary organizations in the consolidated financial  information. The need for these types of adjustments occurs on a regular  basis when two or more DOD components enter into business  transactions with each other. For example, when the Army purchases  weapons from the Defense Logistics Agency, the Army records the  transaction as an expense while the Defense Logistics Agency records  this transaction as revenue in its accounting system. At the DOD  consolidated level, both the revenue and expense reported at the  subsidiary level need to be eliminated to avoid overstating revenue and  expense for DOD as a whole. These elimination adjustments are routine,  expected, and recurring because they must be prepared every time DFAS  compiles DOD\u2019s quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements.", "Other adjustments, such as those DFAS records in order to force account  balances to match (forced-balance adjustments) are not expected within  the routine course of business. DOD defines a forced-balance adjustment  as any amount recorded, usually at a summary level, to eliminate  differences between the component\u2019s general ledger balance and  Treasury\u2019s control total. Such adjustments, recorded without adequate  supporting documentation at the transaction level, are commonly referred  to by the accounting community as plugs.", "Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) adjustments are one example of  forced-balance adjustments DFAS records to eliminate differences  between its cash balances and the amounts Treasury reported. In the  federal government, Treasury acts as the government\u2019s bank and keeps  an official record of the remaining spending authority for each agency.  Consequently, reconciling an agency\u2019s FBWT account with Treasury- reported amounts is similar to an individual reconciling a checkbook to a  bank statement. Treasury requires agencies to reconcile their cash  balances each month with the balances reported in Treasury\u2019s records.  However, DOD generally records adjustments to make its FBWT agree with Treasury\u2019s records rather than performing proper research to identify  what caused the differences.

Over the years, DOD\u2019s practice of  recording forced-balance adjustments has been questioned by GAO and  by DOD\u2019s auditors. For example, in an audit of the Army General Fund\u2019s  reconciliation process for the FBWT account, DOD\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) stated that the Army and personnel in DFAS\u2019s Indianapolis  office \u201cmake forced-balance adjustments, which are unsupported manual  and system-generated adjustments.\u201d GAO and an independent  accounting firm both reported similar practices at the Navy and Marine  Corps. These audits have repeatedly identified limitations within the  source-level accounting systems that DOD components use and the  multitude of legacy systems (computer systems that are outdated or that  can no longer receive support and maintenance but are still essential for  an organization) as the main contributing factors for the use of forced- balance adjustments.", "DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation (FMR) states that a forced- balance adjustment does not represent an adequate reconciliation.  Instead, DOD components are required to maintain detailed reconciliation  documentation to provide an adequate audit trail. Further, according to  the FMR, a reconciliation is not complete until all differences are  identified, accountability is assigned, differences are explained, and  appropriate adjustments are made to records. These activities are  needed to establish an adequate audit trail. Despite this policy, during the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we found that DFAS recorded  approximately 36,000, or over 17 percent of the total accounting  adjustments, to force the FBWT accounts to agree with Treasury. Out of  the 242 fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter accounting adjustments we  selected for testing, nine were FBWT forced-balance accounting  adjustments related to undistributed collections and disbursements.", "Based on our review of these adjustments, we found that DFAS continues  to rely on forced-balance adjustments to correct the differences between  amounts DOD recorded and those that Treasury reported without  properly investigating and resolving the differences. Specifically, we found  that DFAS systematically recorded forced-balance adjustments to replace  information that DOD components submitted with the amounts that  Treasury reported without reconciling and researching the causes of  differences and making any appropriate adjustments. DFAS indicated that  it performs reconciliations on the FBWT accounts when compiling  financial statements and researches the causes of any differences arising  from these reconciliations after it records the forced-balance adjustments.  However, for our sample of nine FBWT forced-balance adjustments  related to undistributed collections and disbursements, DFAS was unable  to provide evidence that these reconciliations were performed or that the  causes of differences were researched or resolved.

As noted above, many of these challenges are caused by  timing issues, limitations in the source-level accounting systems that DOD  components use, or the multitude of legacy systems that different DOD  components use. To address these challenges, DOD is currently  implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the military  services, such as the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management  System that the Air Force uses. These systems will replace the current  legacy systems across DOD with the expectation of a full transition to  ERP systems at all military services by 2025, at which point DOD expects  the need to record forced-balance adjustments to decrease. OUSD  (Comptroller) has a plan for implementing ERP systems at smaller DOD  components that also use legacy systems. However, the challenges that  legacy systems cause are likely to continue until the ERP transitions are  completed and ERP systems are fully implemented at the military  services and smaller DOD components. A DFAS official stated that until  DOD fully implements the ERP systems, DFAS does not have any plans  to modify the current financial management environment to eliminate the  recording of these types of adjustments. As noted earlier, as part of the  routine course of business certain adjustments will still need to be made  following the full implementation of the ERP systems.", "Along with DOD\u2019s implementing of the ERP systems, DOD officials stated  that some DFAS sites, in coordination with various DOD components,  have implemented tools to help them reconcile FBWT balances and  research the causes of any differences arising during these  reconciliations.

However, DFAS did not provide  supporting documentation for these reconciliations in order for us to verify  that they had been performed. Until DOD consistently performs and  documents the required reconciliations to identify the causes for these  types of adjustments and takes a holistic approach to resolving them,  DOD\u2019s financial management issues\u2014such as those associated with  FBWT\u2014are likely to continue, resulting in a continued inability to produce  reliable and auditable consolidated financial statements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and DFAS Policies and Procedures for Recording Accounting Adjustments Are Inadequate and Inconsistently Followed", "paragraphs": ["Establishing clear policies and procedures for recording accounting  adjustments is crucial for (1) ensuring that accounting adjustments are  properly recorded and adequately supported with documentation;  (2) identifying the underlying causes for the recording of adjustments; and  (3) developing, implementing, and monitoring action plans to reduce the  need for accounting adjustments.

Given the magnitude and unique  characteristics of system-generated adjustments, developing and  maintaining adequate supporting documentation are critical. According to  the FMR, adjustments to the accounting records should be supported with  sufficiently detailed written documentation to provide an audit trail to the  source transaction that requires the adjustment. Further, the FMR  requires supporting documentation to include information such as the  reason for the adjustment, calculation of the adjustment amount, and  evidence of managerial review and approval of the adjustment.", "To support certain types of recurring system-generated adjustments,  DFAS developed eight standardized narratives that include the reasons  for the adjustments and the documentation DFAS considers necessary to  support the adjustments. Other recurring system-generated adjustments  are recorded based on System Change Requests, which are proposals to  modify information in an accounting system such as revising  programming logic and coding changes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal  year 2018, DOD determined that 74 percent of the recorded system- generated adjustments related to four of the eight standardized  narratives. Most of the System Change Requests we tested related to  financial information migration from a legacy system to a new responsible  work area for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.", "DFAS annually selects and reviews a random sample of 40 system- generated adjustments related to each type of narrative for which  supporting packages are prepared. According to DFAS officials, the  supporting package preparation for the selected sample involves verifying  that the adjustments impacted the intended accounts. If no issues are  identified, DFAS concludes that the core financial reporting system  recorded the adjustments as intended, the desired results were achieved,  and the adjustments were supported. Within a given year, if DFAS  sample testing demonstrates that a certain type of system-generated  adjustment was supported, DFAS categorizes all the accounting  adjustments that relate to this particular type as supported for the rest of  the year.", "We found that other than the supporting packages created specifically for  the periodic random samples, DFAS maintains no other documentation to  support the system-generated adjustments related to each of the eight  narratives. As part of our audit, we selected for testing 242 accounting  adjustments that impacted the financial statements for the fourth quarter  of fiscal year 2018, of which 93 were system-generated accounting  adjustments. Of these 93 adjustments, DFAS categorized 42 as  unsupported and 51 as supported. DFAS categorized adjustments as  either supported or unsupported depending upon the circumstances. The  circumstances considered include whether it relates to one of the eight  narratives or to specific System Change Requests. When the eight  narratives are tested, if no issues are identified as part of the testing, the  transactions linked to that narrative are considered supported. However,  we determined that the corresponding narratives and System Change  Requests were insufficient support for the 51 adjustments categorized as  supported because we were unable to verify the validity and accuracy of  the adjustments with supporting documentation.", "In addition, we found that DFAS did not maintain evidence demonstrating  the review and approval of the programming of predefined business rules  in the systems that recorded the adjustments.

For example,  DFAS uses category A for reversing entries for a prior reporting period  and category B for data call adjustments. Additionally, the FMR  specifies the required documentation needed to support each category.  For example, for category A adjustments, adequate documentation  includes information on the original entry and a statement that the  adjustment is a reversing entry, whereas for category B adjustments,  documentation requirements include information on the summarized  amount and identification of the source or location of the transaction-level  detail for the adjustment. DOD\u2019s core financial reporting system is  designed to allow a DFAS accountant to select one of these 10 codes  when recording an adjustment. Since these codes are used to identify the  required documentation to support the adjustments, it is important that the  codes are periodically reviewed to ensure that they are still relevant in  DOD\u2019s current financial reporting environment and that supporting  documentation requirements are appropriate.", "We found that some of the category codes were rarely used and new  codes may need to be added to reflect the current financial reporting  environment. For example, we found that of the 18,521 manual  adjustments recorded in DOD\u2019s core financial reporting system during the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, category F (supply management  inventory) was used only four times. According to DFAS officials, this  code was primarily used to adjust the purchase cost of certain supplies,  but those adjustments are now rarely needed. DFAS officials stated that  the codes had not been reviewed for continued relevance since they were  first established and expressed a need to revisit the current categorization  scheme to determine whether the codes should be redefined. The most  recent update of FMR, volume 6A, chapter 2, in June 2019 included the  addition of category M, the first code added since 2002. According to  DFAS officials, this code was not added based on a thorough review of  the existing codes but because there was already a substantial volume of  data call adjustments taking place in the Data Collection Module.", "Further, a DOD official suggested that an additional code may be needed  for tie-point adjustments, which DFAS accountants frequently record as a  result of tie-point reconciliation. We found that 34 of the 149 manual  accounting adjustments we tested related to tie-point adjustments.  Because there is not a designated category code for tie-point  adjustments, we found that accountants used various other category  codes when recording the 34 tie-point adjustments, including D  (Recognition of Undistributed Disbursements and Collections), E  (Reconciliation of Trial Balance and Budget Execution Reports), G  (Reclassification of Accounts), H (Identified Errors and Reasonableness  Checks), I (Adjustment to Balance Reports Internally), or at times no  category code. As a result, there may be inconsistency in the  documentation maintained to support tie-point adjustments. Having a  single category code for tie-point adjustments could standardize recording  by accountants, enabling DFAS to identify the frequency with which tie- point adjustments are recorded and ensure that it maintains adequate  supporting documentation.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires that  management implement control activities through policies. To do this,  management periodically reviews policies, procedures, and related  control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving  the organization\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks.

We found that DFAS accountants did not  consistently follow the DOD FMR and DFAS\u2019s policies and procedures for  some of these critical elements, resulting in (1) the failure to maintain  adequate supporting documentation, (2) the recording of out-of-balance  accounting adjustments, and (3) the use of account numbers that do not  comply with the USSGL.", "Inadequate supporting documentation: We found that 51 of the 87  manual adjustments we reviewed that DFAS categorized as  supported did not contain supporting documentation required by the  DOD FMR. For example, we found instances where supporting  documentation packages were missing information to support the  reason for recording the adjustment or detailed worksheets to support  the calculation of the adjustment amount. DFAS officials explained  that 30 of the 51 adjustments resulted from a major change in how  DFAS processes U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 financial information.  Because of time sensitivity and based on a risk analysis, management  decided to process over 3,000 manual adjustments for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2018, including the 30 that were selected for our  sample, without preparing supporting documentation for these  individual adjustments.", "We also found that not all supporting documentation packages  included a DFAS Form 9339, DFAS Journal Voucher Catalog and  Checklist, as required by DFAS\u2019s Interim Policy Memorandum. This  memorandum requires that all manual accounting adjustments,  whether classified as supported or unsupported by DFAS, include a  Form 9339 to help ensure the inclusion of the appropriate supporting  documentation. We reviewed 149 manual adjustments and found that  94 included a Form 9339. Our review of these 94 accounting  adjustments found that 28 lacked the required information. For  example, nine packages did not include one or more of the necessary  elements required by Form 9339. We found instances where source  information, customer coordination, document labeling, before and  after trial balances, narratives, or a combination of these were  missing. For six of the nine packages, DFAS agreed that some of the  necessary data elements were missing; for the remaining three  packages, DFAS\u2019s response did not fully address the reasons for the  missing documentation. DFAS officials stated that one of the reasons  why these errors may have occurred was because the implementation  of the Interim Policy Memorandum was in its beginning stages when  we selected our fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 sample. The policy  memorandum was dated June 11, 2018, and was effective  immediately.", "We also found that 19 adjustments lacked the required root cause  indicator code on the Form 9339. According to DFAS officials, DFAS  Cleveland prepared those 19 forms. DFAS Cleveland officials  explained that in collaboration with the Navy Financial Management  Office, DFAS Cleveland\u2019s senior leadership decided to deviate from  the Interim Policy Memorandum and not include the root cause  indicator code in the Form 9339 when recording Navy\u2019s related  accounting adjustments. Rather, DFAS Cleveland developed its own  system to identify root causes by using a unique identifier code.  However, the Interim Policy Memorandum does not exclude any  DFAS site from adhering to the requirement, and DFAS was unable to  provide documentation to demonstrate that DFAS Cleveland had  authorization to deviate from this policy. According to DFAS officials,  DFAS Cleveland will begin including the root cause indicator code on  the Form 9339, starting second quarter of fiscal year 2020.", "Out-of-balance adjustments: We found that about 2,800 manual  adjustments, or approximately 15 percent of all manual adjustments  recorded at the DOD consolidated level for the fourth quarter of fiscal  year 2018, were out-of-balance. For example, we identified one  adjustment in which DFAS decreased its FBWT account by  $14,232,000 without recording a change to a corresponding account.  DOD\u2019s FMR requires that all recorded accounting adjustments be  balanced. Additionally, we found that the FMR does not identify any  situations where an out-of-balance adjustment is allowable, despite  DFAS officials stating that out-of-balance adjustments are sometimes  necessary.", "Auditors of the military services found that reasons for out-of-balance  financial information include (1) service-level general ledger systems  are not effectively designed to prevent incomplete transactions from  being recorded and (2) controls are not in place at the service level to  detect these errors in a timely manner. According to DFAS officials,  out-of-balance adjustments are recorded to correct out-of-balance  financial information received from DOD components\u2019 accounting  systems.", "Use of non-USSGL-compliant accounts: During our review of fourth  quarter fiscal year 2018 manual and system-generated adjustments,  we found that over 13,000 adjustments (over 6 percent) recorded at  the DOD consolidated level used non-USSGL-compliant accounts,  which are not allowed by the Treasury Financial Manual or DOD FMR.  The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996  requires certain federal agencies, such as DOD, to use the specific  and standardized set of accounts referred to as the USSGL in their  financial reporting systems. Treasury maintains this set of accounts  annually to help ensure the comparability of financial information  across the federal government. DFAS officials stated that these  noncompliant accounts are referred to as memo accounts and were  primarily used for management planning purposes. They further  explained that DOD had controls in place to prevent financial  information recorded in memo accounts in DOD\u2019s core financial  reporting system from being transferred into the financial reporting  systems, which Treasury uses to compile the U.S. government  consolidated financial statements.", "DOD OIG also reported issues related to DOD\u2019s use of noncompliant  accounts, which it identified in fiscal year 2018. In addition, in DOD\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2018 Agency Financial Report, management  acknowledged that DOD\u2019s financial management systems did not  comply with the USSGL at the transaction level. In response, the DOD  Deputy Chief Financial Officer issued a memorandum on March 15,  2019, acknowledging that DOD components must use the established  USSGL accounts identified in the Treasury Financial Manual for  financial reporting purposes. Additionally, the memorandum stated  that supporting documentation must be maintained for any accounting  adjustments recorded using memo accounts. However, for the seven  non-USSGL-compliant adjustments included within our sample of  manual and system-generated adjustments, we found that  documentation had not been maintained.", "Proper recording of adjustments is crucial for ensuring that the financial  information accurately reflects the financial transactions that have  occurred. This includes maintaining adequate supporting documentation  and implementing review procedures to help ensure controls are in place  to detect errors in a timely manner. Failure to fully adhere to established  procedures increases the risk that inaccurate accounting adjustments will  be recorded, thereby reducing the reliability of reported financial  information and potentially causing misstatements in the DOD  consolidated financial statements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and DFAS Lack Policies and Procedures for Analyzing and Addressing Necessary Root Causes of Accounting Adjustments", "paragraphs": ["Organizations use root cause analysis as a tool to identify and evaluate  systems, processes, or both that prompted the recording of an accounting  adjustment. For certain adjustments, it may be determined that a root  cause analysis or action plan is not necessary\u2014for instance, if the  adjustment is onetime or nonroutine. However, information obtained  through a root cause analysis may be used to make system or process  changes within a specific program, thus reducing the need to record  adjustments. Once a root cause has been identified and analyzed, an  organization should create an action plan that describes the steps to be  taken to address the root cause and monitors the effectiveness of the  actions taken. Figure 5 illustrates the identification, implementation, and  monitoring of accounting adjustment root causes and related action plans.", "We found that although DFAS headquarters and its individual sites  perform root cause analysis and develop and take some actions to  address the identified causes, neither DOD nor DFAS has established  policies and procedures that require staff to perform root cause analysis;  develop and implement action plans for issues that DFAS staff identified;  or monitor the effectiveness of action plans in eliminating the need for  accounting adjustments. DFAS officials acknowledged that there are no  policies in place requiring DFAS to perform root cause analyses that  would permit them to compare root causes for accounting adjustments at  a consolidated level across the DFAS sites.", "DFAS and its sites identify root causes for individual accounting  adjustments when accountants select a root cause indicator code when  recording the adjustment. DFAS staff also identify root causes for  accounting adjustments at an aggregate level when preparing summary  metrics on adjustment types. For example, we found that in addition to  the requirements previously discussed, Form 9339 requires accountants  across all DFAS sites to prepare \u201cwhite papers/narratives (white papers)  each time a manual adjustment is recorded.\u201d Our review of these white  papers identified that some DFAS sites use the white papers to document  the root cause analyses while others do not because DFAS has not  provided a template that identifies the minimum required information to be  included in the white papers. As a result, we found that individual DFAS  sites do not use standardized white paper templates and that the  information included in the white papers was not always consistent  between and within the DFAS sites.", "Inconsistency between DFAS sites: Our review of 52 white papers  found that DFAS Indianapolis was the only site to include information  such as scope, source system, and financial statement impact of the  accounting adjustment in its white papers, while DFAS Columbus was  the only site that included corrective actions taken. (See fig. 6.)", "Inconsistency within a DFAS site: Our review of 52 white papers  found that DFAS Indianapolis did not consistently include background,  purpose of the adjustment, a description of the root cause, posting  logic, financial statement impact, pending action, source system, and  scope in all white papers it prepared. Some white papers had these  elements and others did not. We found similar issues with the white  papers prepared by DFAS Columbus and DFAS Cleveland. Figure 7  illustrates information included in white papers that was inconsistent  within a DFAS site.", "We also found that DFAS does not have policies and procedures  requiring the identification and implementation of action plans to address  the cause of and need for accounting adjustments that staff identified  internally. This resulted in inconsistencies in how the different DFAS sites  developed and implemented action plans. For example, we found that 73  of the 98 manual and system-generated unsupported adjustment  packages that included a root cause analysis that we reviewed did not  include an action plan to address the root cause. Based on this testing,  we estimate that at least 88 percent of fourth quarter fiscal year 2018  unsupported adjustments for which a root cause analysis was performed  did not have a documented action plan. For the remaining 25 packages  with documented action plans, we found that only two included steps  documenting how the action plan was to be implemented. The remaining  23 packages with documented action plans lacked implementation  details, and DFAS officials stated that they were waiting for resolution  from the relevant DOD components.", "DFAS officials stated that they prepare and document action plans for  issues that affect multiple accounting adjustments but not for issues that  affect only one adjustment (unique root cause). Unique root causes do  not necessitate action plans and are resolved the following month through  DFAS working with the affected DOD components. According to DFAS  officials, many of the action plans are discussed in biweekly and monthly  meetings, but these action plans are not documented.", "Finally, we found that DOD and DFAS do not have policies and  procedures requiring management to monitor the results of action plans  that individual DFAS sites prepared or to measure whether implemented  action plans are effective in addressing the causes for accounting  adjustments. DFAS management activities were limited to periodically  reviewing summary metrics on the numbers and types of accounting  adjustments recorded. These metrics did not contain detailed information,  such as the causes of accounting adjustments to be addressed,  accountable officials responsible for implementing action plans, expected  time frames for the implementation of action plans, or specific steps to be  performed to address the causes. Additionally, the metrics did not include  any information on action plans to address system-generated accounting  adjustments, which account for the majority of the adjustments. This type  of detailed information is critical to DOD management and DOD external  stakeholders for evaluating the department\u2019s progress in correcting the  issues. GAO has previously reported that a lack of comprehensive  information on corrective action plans limits DOD\u2019s and Congress\u2019s ability  to evaluate DOD\u2019s progress toward fully, timely, and efficiently correcting  its long-standing financial management deficiencies.", "Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123 requires agencies to  perform cause analysis of deficiencies identified to ensure that  subsequent strategies and plans address the causes of the problem and  not just the symptoms.

To do this, management documents in its  policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization. In addition,  management periodically reviews policies, procedures, and related  control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving  the entity\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks. Without policies that  require consistent processes across DOD for identifying and addressing  the causes of accounting adjustments, from the identification of  underlying root causes to the development, implementation, and  monitoring of action plans, it is likely that DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce  accounting adjustments will be inefficient and ineffective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and DFAS Have Taken Actions to Reduce Accounting Adjustments but Lack Procedures for Implementing a Department-Wide Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The large number of accounting adjustments that are recorded in the  preparation of DOD\u2019s financial statements presents audit challenges.

In fiscal year 2018,  OUSD (Comptroller) determined that a large number of accounting  adjustments at the consolidated level resulted from data calls. To  decrease the need for recording these adjustments at the consolidated  level, DOD established the Data Call Journal Voucher (JV) Migration  Initiative with the goal of eliminating data call adjustments in its core  financial reporting system to the maximum extent possible.", "The first phase of this initiative moved the recording of adjustments for  the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) liability to the DOD  component level responsible for the underlying transaction.

Although this initiative may not reduce the overall  number of accounting adjustments that DOD records, it will reduce the  need for data call adjustments to be recorded at the consolidated level.  OUSD (Comptroller) expects this initiative will also enhance the quality of  the supporting documentation maintained for these types of adjustments  because the underlying transaction-level detail for the adjustments will be  available in the components\u2019 accounting systems.", "Individual DFAS sites have also undertaken their own initiatives that  eliminate the need for some accounting adjustments. For example, in  fiscal year 2018, DFAS Indianapolis found that some financial information  from the Army\u2019s accounting systems was improperly recorded, requiring  adjustments to correct the errors when the financial information  transferred into the DOD\u2019s core financial reporting system.
