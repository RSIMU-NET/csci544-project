GAO evaluated the Army's effectiveness in maintaining accountability of inventory shipped to repair contractors. To conduct its review, GAO analyzed shipment data for fiscal year 2004, surveyed repair contractors that were recipients of inventory shipments, and assessed the Army's adherence to internal control procedures. Inventory shipments included both secondary repair items--components, assemblies, and subassemblies, other than major end items, which may be sent to commercial facilities for repair, alteration, or modification--and government-furnished materiel--assemblies, parts, and other items provided in support of this work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army has not maintained accurate accountability for inventory shipped to repair contractors, thereby placing these assets at risk of loss or theft. Although DOD policy requires the military services to confirm receipt of all assets shipped to contractors, the Army is not consistently recording shipment receipts in its inventory management systems. In an analysis of fiscal year 2004 shipment data obtained from two Army inventory control points, GAO could not reconcile shipment records with receipt records for 42 percent of the unclassified secondary repair item shipments, with a value of $481.7 million, or for 37 percent of the classified secondary repair item shipments, with a value of $8.1 million. These data show that the Army cannot confirm that all inventory items shipped to repair contractors were received. The Army's data contained no receipts for government-furnished materiel. GAO survey results showed that repair contractors could confirm receipt of most, but not all, of the shipments. Specifically, on the basis of its survey results and follow-up work, GAO estimated that about 15 percent of the unclassified secondary repair item shipments in the survey population could not be confirmed as being received. GAO estimated that these lost or unaccounted for shipments have a value of approximately $68 million. All shipments of classified government-furnished materiel and secondary repair items were reported as received by the contractors in our survey. For shipments of unclassified government-furnished materiel, almost all shipments were reported by the contractors in our survey as being received. The Army's accountability for shipments of items sent to repair contractors is impeded by three internal control weaknesses. First, Army inventory control points lack systematic procedures for (1) obtaining and documenting contractor receipt of shipments of secondary repair items, (2) following up in cases where receipt was not confirmed by the contractors, and (3) providing advance notification of shipments to contractors. Second, the Army does not confirm receipt of government-furnished materiel shipments, reflecting a discrepancy between the Army's practices and DOD regulations regarding the need to confirm receipt of these shipments. DOD regulations require receipts for all shipments, including government-furnished materiel. Third, inventory control points do not provide the Defense Contract Management Agency with required quarterly reports that show the status of government-furnished materiel shipments. As a result, Defense Contract Management Agency officials may lack data to corroborate contractor-generated data during their inventory audits. These weaknesses in the Army's ability to account for inventory shipped to repair contractors increase the risk of undetected loss or theft. Moreover, inaccurate receipt records can diminish asset visibility and distort on-hand inventory balances, leading to unnecessary procurement of items."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every year the Army ships thousands of items from its inventory to  commercial contractors for repair, alterations, or modification. These  items range from small components, such as circuit card assemblies, to  larger, expensive items like turbine engines. In addition, contractors may  receive parts from the Army supply system for use in this work. In fiscal  year 2004, for example, Army records show that the U.S. Army Aviation and  Missile Command and the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command authorized shipment of about 70,000 items worth approximately  $970 million to repair contractors. To safeguard government-owned assets  while they are in transit, Department of Defense (DOD) and Army policies  require Army supply activities to follow specific procedures for managing  and maintaining accountability of inventory provided to commercial  contractors.", "Since at least 1990, we have considered DOD supply chain and inventory  management to be a high-risk area due to ineffective management systems  and procedures. Among the issues facing the department has been a lack of  control over inventory shipments, which increases DOD\u2019s vulnerability to  undetected loss or theft and also increases the risk that millions of dollars  will be spent on procuring unnecessary items.", "In response to your request, we evaluated the Army\u2019s effectiveness in  maintaining accurate accountability of inventory shipped to repair contactors. Our review included shipments of both secondary repair items  and government-furnished materiel.", "This report is the third and last in a series of reports focusing on the  services\u2019 inventory management procedures for controlling materiel  shipped to repair contractors. In July 2002, we reported that the Air Force  either did not adhere to, or did not establish, effective controls for assets  shipped to its repair contractors for repair or for use in the repair of other  assets. More recently, we reported in July 2004 that the Naval Inventory  Control Point and its repair contractors did not follow a number of DOD  and Navy procedures for maintaining accountability and visibility of  government-furnished materiel provided to contractors.", "To perform our review, we analyzed Army inventory shipment data,  surveyed repair contractors that were recipients of inventory shipments,  and assessed the Army\u2019s adherence to policies for managing and  maintaining accountability for inventory shipments. We obtained fiscal  year 2004 shipment data from two of the Army\u2019s three major inventory  control points\u2014the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command and the U.S.  Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command. For secondary repair  items, we analyzed the data to reconcile inventory shipment records with  receipt records. To assess the reliability of the Army data, we randomly  selected 200 secondary repair item shipments for which the inventory  shipment records and receipt records had not been reconciled in the  Army\u2019s inventory management systems. We also randomly selected 200  government-furnished materiel shipments. Because these were random  samples, the results of our analysis can be projected to the entire universe  of shipments that met our selection criteria. Additionally, we selected all  shipments of classified items\u201490 total shipments\u2014that were present in  our data population. We then sent surveys to 72 Army contractors  requesting property record information on these shipments to assess  whether these items had been received and accounted for by the  contractors. We received and reviewed survey responses from 66 of the 72  contractors, representing 184 unclassified secondary repair item  shipments, or 92 percent of our randomly selected sample; 169 unclassified  government-furnished materiel shipments, or 85 percent of our randomly  selected sample; and 100 percent of the classified shipments. We followed  up with repair contractor officials and Army item managers to obtain  additional information on specific shipments where our survey data  indicated a potential loss of accountability. On the basis of the survey  results and our follow-up analysis, we believe that the data are sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We conducted our review from October 2004  through November 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Army  inventory control points within the Army Materiel Command manage the  movement of assets from the Army supply system to commercially  operated repair facilities. The Army\u2019s three major inventory control points  for secondary repair items are the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile  Command, the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, and  the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command. Repair contractors  are generally required to establish and maintain a property control system  for the control, use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of  government property in their possession.", "Inventory control points, as part of their materiel management functions,  maintain the Army\u2019s data systems that support inventory and financial  management, requirements determination, maintenance planning, and  procurement. These inventory management systems retain the accountable  records for inventory transactions, including shipment and receipt records.  The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command and the U.S. Army Tank- automotive and Armaments Command use the Commodity Command  Standard System as their inventory management system. This system will  eventually be replaced with the Logistics Modernization Program, which  will integrate inventory functions performed by legacy inventory  management systems. The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics  Command uses the Logistics Modernization Program.", "The inventory shipment data we obtained from the U.S. Army Aviation and  Missile Command and U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command included shipments of secondary repair items and government- furnished materiel sent to contractor facilities located in the continental  United States during fiscal year 2004. Many shipments contained multiple  items. According to these records, the inventory control points together  authorized shipments of more than 25,000 secondary repair items worth  approximately $852 million to repair contractors. The records show they  also authorized shipments of more than 44,000 government-furnished  materiel items valued at approximately $118 million. The survey population  we used to draw our sample included all shipments of secondary repair  items for which we could not identify matching receipt records for  corresponding inventory shipment records, all shipments of government- furnished materiel, and all shipments of classified government-furnished  materiel and secondary repair items. Table 1 shows the population of  shipments from which we drew our samples.", "DOD has established policies for maintaining accountability for assets  shipped to repair contractors. Under these policies, for example,  contractors are responsible for posting receipts in their property control  records and notifying the appropriate inventory control point once they  have received shipped assets. The inventory control point establishes a  \u201cdue-in\u201d record when a shipment is issued to track inventory that will  eventually return to the Army supply system. Once notified of receipt by  the contractors, the inventory control point processes receipt of a  transaction in its inventory management system to reflect the contractors\u2019  receipt of the shipment. If the inventory control point is not notified of  receipt within 45 days of shipment, it is required to follow up with the  intended recipient to determine shipment status. Without a confirmation of  receipt, the status of a shipment is uncertain. In addition, DOD policy states  that the military services may establish requirements for their inventory  control points to provide advance notification of scheduled shipments to  repair contractors.", "DOD also requires inventory control points to submit quarterly reports to  DCMA identifying quantities and types of government-furnished materiel  provided to repair contractors. DCMA assesses the accuracy of repair  contractor records and accounts for government property furnished to  contractors. The quarterly reports are intended to help contract officers  verify that repair contractors have maintained accountability for all  government-furnished materiel shipped to their facilities without relying  strictly on contractor inventory records.", "The Army has established a system for formally reporting errors in  shipments. Under DOD and Army regulations, recipients of repair materiel  are required to investigate and report shipment discrepancies, such as  incorrect quantities and types of items and items sent to the wrong location. If the discrepancy results from shipper error, the recipient  submits a supply discrepancy report to the appropriate inventory control  point. Inventory control point officials review and validate these reports  and provide recipients with instructions for resolving the discrepancy. For  example, the customer may be instructed to return misdirected items to the  Army supply system or to retain items for future repair work.", "In addition to these policies, the Army is obligated to establish and  maintain effective internal control systems. The Federal Managers\u2019  Financial Integrity Act of 1982 requires GAO to issue standards for internal  control in the federal government. According to these standards, internal  controls are an integral component of an organization\u2019s management that  provide reasonable assurance that assets are being safeguarded and other  objectives are being met. Internal controls should be designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets.  Effective and efficient internal control activities help ensure that an  agency\u2019s control objectives are accomplished. Control activities are the  policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce  management directives, such as the process of adhering to DOD  requirements for receipting of shipped assets and generation of quarterly  government-furnished status reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Control Weaknesses Impede Army\u2019s Accountability for Inventory Shipments", "paragraphs": ["Internal control weaknesses have impeded the Army\u2019s accountability for  assets shipped to repair contractors.

In this analysis, we identified shipments that lacked a  matching receipt record as well as those shipments for which there was a  discrepancy between the number of items shipped and the number  receipted. Table 2 displays the results of our analysis for shipments of  unclassified secondary repair items.", "These data show that Army inventory control points, on the basis of receipt  records maintained in its inventory management systems, cannot confirm  that a substantial portion of inventory items shipped to repair contractors  were in fact received. In the absence of accurate and complete receipt  records, the Army lacks inventory transaction data needed for maintaining  accurate accountability for an asset as it moves through the repair cycle.  Furthermore, inaccurate or incomplete receipt records can lead to a  distortion of on-hand inventory balances, thus placing the Army at risk of  procuring more items than are needed to support the warfighter. The Army  Audit Agency, in September 2004, noted that the Army lacked accurate  receipt records for shipments both to contractors and to government- owned depot facilities, and that, as a result, on-hand inventory balances for  some items were understated by about $40.8 million.", "Our survey results showed that repair contractors could confirm receipt of  most, but not all, of the fiscal year 2004 shipments.

We estimated that these lost or  unaccounted for shipments have a value of approximately $68 million.  For example, our sample of secondary repair items included a shipment of  30 aircraft rotary wing components with a total value of $8.3 million. The  Army\u2019s inventory management system did not show a receipt for this  shipment, and the contractor had no record of receiving the shipment.

In a  subsequent analysis conducted by the Army to determine the status of this  classified shipment, the Army discovered that it had erroneously provided  us with a duplicate shipment record, causing this shipment to appear  unaccounted for based on the original data that the Army had provided for  this review. According to the Army, this was not a classified shipment sent  to the contractor for repair, but rather a shipment record that pertained to a  repaired asset coming from the contractor back into its inventory. The  Army provided documentation to confirm the receipt of this asset back into  its inventory. On the basis of this data, we deleted this record from our  analysis. Thus, all shipments of classified secondary repair items were  received by the contractors.", "Although required to obtain confirmation of receipt from repair  contractors, Army inventory control points lack systematic procedures for  obtaining and documenting receipt of shipments of secondary repair items  and for following up within 45 days in cases where receipt was not  confirmed by the contractors. Army regulations concerning receipt  notification do not specify the method or form by which contractors are to  notify the inventory control point when they receive shipments. Moreover,  multiple individuals at the inventory control points may become involved in  the receipting process. Item managers, who manage specific inventory  items and authorize shipments of secondary repair items to contractor  facilities, are generally responsible for ensuring repair contractors receive  shipments. We found that various methods are used to confirm receipt.  Some item managers rely on routine reports provided by the contractors or  on data obtained from contractors\u2019 inventory data systems. Other item  managers confirm receipt by telephone calls to contractor officials. Once  the receipt confirmation is obtained, the item manager may pass the receipt  information to other inventory control point personnel, who then update  the record in the inventory management system. In most cases, these  personnel enter the receipt information into the inventory management  system manually. Manual updating increases the probability of  inaccuracies in receipt data.", "Although we could not reconcile 42 percent of the shipments in the Army\u2019s  data with matching receipt records, our follow-up survey with repair  contractors indicated they were able to confirm receipt for a majority of  the shipments. In addition, on the basis of our survey of repair contractors,  we estimate that for 82 percent of the shipments, contractors stated they  had notified the Army of shipment receipt. However, these receipt  notifications were not always recorded in the Army\u2019s inventory  management systems. Systematic follow-up within 45 days of shipment by  the Army inventory control points could have identified these confirmed  receipts, enabling an update of the inventory record to accurately reflect  the shipment status.", "While contractors are required to report shipment discrepancies through  the Army\u2019s supply discrepancy reporting program, we found that this  practice does not always occur. In our survey, repair contractors noted  discrepancies in shipments that were not formally reported through the  Army\u2019s reporting program. It is unclear why all discrepancies were not  reported. One explanation provided by several contractors was that Army  officials do not routinely provide advance notification to contractors prior  to shipment. Because the Army had not notified them in advance of the  shipments, they did not expect the shipments to arrive and, therefore, did  not file supply discrepancy reports. Some contractors said they only  became aware of certain shipments sent to them when they received our  survey.

During  our review, we noted that the Army\u2019s data systems for managing  government-furnished materiel shipments provide automated checks of  requisitions to ensure their validity.
