From fiscal years 2003 to 2006, SAA funding increased from $13 million to $19 million to expand services and support the additional responsibilities. However, funding is scheduled to decrease beginning in fiscal year 2008. Many education and training programs approved by SAAs have also been approved by Education or Labor, and VA has taken few steps to coordinate approval activities with these agencies. More than two-thirds of all programs approved by SAAs are offered by institutions that have been certified by Education. Many apprenticeship programs approved by SAAs have also been approved by Labor, although apprenticeship programs make up less than 2 percent of all programs approved by SAAs. Similar categories of approval standards, such as student achievement, exist across agencies, but the specific standards within each category vary and the full extent of the overlap is unknown. For example, VA requires schools to give appropriate credit for prior learning while Education does not have such a requirement. Despite the overlap in approved programs and standards, VA and SAAs have made limited efforts to coordinate approval activities with other federal agencies. VA does not require SAAs to collect information on the amount of resources they spend on specific approval activities; therefore, information is not available to determine the amount of resources spent on SAA duties and functions, including those that may overlap with those of other agencies. SAAs reportedly add value to the approval process for education and training programs, but the lack of outcome-oriented performance measures makes it difficult to assess the significance of their efforts. Areas of added value include (1) a focus on student services for veterans and on the integrity of VA benefits, (2) more frequent on-site monitoring of education and training programs than provided by Education or Labor, and (3) assessments and approval of a small number of programs that are not reviewed by other agencies. States, schools, and apprenticeship officials we spoke with reported that without SAAs, the quality of education for veterans would not change. However, veterans' receipt of benefits could be delayed and the time required to complete their education and training programs could increase. Despite areas of apparent added value, it is difficult to fully assess the significance of SAA efforts. VA measures some outputs, such as the number of supervisory visits SAAs conduct, but it does not have outcome-oriented performance measures, such as the amount of benefit adjustments resulting from SAAs' reviews, to evaluate the overall effectiveness of SAAs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to present information from our March 2007  report on state approving agencies (SAA). In fiscal year 2006, the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) paid approximately $2.1 billion in  education assistance benefits to more than 470,000 beneficiaries and about  $19 million to state approving agencies to assess whether schools and  training programs offer education of sufficient quality for veterans to  receive VA education assistance benefits when attending them. Qualified  individuals\u2014veterans, service persons, reservists, and certain spouses and  dependents\u2014receive benefits through a number of education assistance  programs for the pursuit of various types of programs, such as a degree  program, vocational program, apprenticeship, or on-the-job training. In  general, these programs must be approved by an SAA in order for qualified  individuals to receive VA education assistance benefits. Under contracts  with VA, SAAs ensure that education and training programs meet VA  standards through a variety of approval activities, such as evaluating  course quality, assessing school financial stability, and monitoring student  progress.", "The Departments of Education (Education) and Labor (Labor) also assess  education and training programs for various purposes, primarily for  awarding student aid and providing apprenticeship assistance. These  assessments are based, in part, on evaluations against standards set by  laws and regulations, such as those applicable to accrediting agencies. In  2006, under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, Education provided  nearly $77 billion in student aid in the form of both grants and loans.  Education assesses and certifies postsecondary institutions for  participation in Title IV programs through various oversight functions to  ensure that these schools meet federal administrative and financial  requirements and that they are accredited and licensed. Similarly, under  the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937, Labor is authorized to formulate  and promote the furtherance of labor standards to safeguard the welfare  of apprentices. To ensure programs comply with federal standards, Labor  directly registers and oversees apprenticeship programs in less than half of  the states and has given state apprenticeship agencies or councils in the  remaining states such authority over their own programs.", "Given each agency\u2019s role, the potential of duplicative efforts among federal  agencies has been a congressional concern. In 1995, GAO reported on this  matter and concluded that there was a substantial amount of overlap  between the efforts of SAAs and the other federal agencies. My testimony  today is based on information from our recent report and will focus on   (1) changes that have occurred in state approving agencies\u2019 duties and  functions since 1995, (2) the extent to which the SAA approval process  overlaps with efforts by the Departments of Education and Labor, and   (3) the additional value that SAA approval activities bring to VA education  benefit programs.", "In summary, we found that:    Since 1995, legislative changes effective in 2001 created additional  responsibilities for SAAs, including promoting the development of  apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs, providing  outreach services, and approving tests for occupational licensing.

VA generally provides its assistance in the form  of payments to veterans, service persons, reservists, and certain spouses  and dependents.", "Benefits can be used to pursue a degree program, vocational program,  apprenticeship, and on-the-job training (see fig. 1). Before an individual  entitled to VA education assistance can obtain money for an education or  training program, the program must be approved by an SAA, or by VA in  those cases in which an SAA has not been contracted to perform the work.", "VA\u2019s administrative structure for the education and training assistance  programs includes its national office, which oversees the four regional  processing offices (RPO), and the national contract with SAAs. RPOs  administer the education assistance programs and process benefits for  veterans. SAAs review education and training programs to determine  which programs should be approved and ensure schools and training  providers are complying with VA standards. SAAs have six core duties:   (1) approval of programs, (2) visits to facilities, (3) technical assistance to  individuals at facilities, (4) outreach, (5) liaison with other service  providers, and (6) contract management. Sixty SAAs exist in the 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Eight states have two SAAs.  SAAs are usually part of a state\u2019s department of education (31 SAAs). In  some states, SAAs are organizationally located in other departments such  as labor (9 SAAs) or veterans\u2019 services (19 SAAs).", "The U.S. Department of Education\u2019s approval process is to ensure that  schools meet federal Education standards to participate in federal student  financial aid programs. In order for students attending a school to receive  Title IV financial aid, a school must be (1) licensed or otherwise legally  authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in which it is  located, (2) accredited by an entity recognized for that purpose by the  Secretary of Education, and (3) certified to participate in federal student  aid programs by Education. As such, the state licensing agencies,  accrediting agencies, and certain offices within Education are responsible  for various approval activities.", "State licensing agencies grant legal authority to postsecondary  institutions to operate in the state in which they are located. Each  of the states has its own agency structure, and each state can  choose its own set of standards.", "Accrediting agencies develop evaluation criteria and conduct peer  evaluations to assess whether or not those criteria are met by  postsecondary institutions. Institutions or programs that meet an  agency\u2019s criteria are then \u201caccredited\u201d by that agency.
