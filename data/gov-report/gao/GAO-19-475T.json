In 2003, shortly after the department was formed, we designated Implementing and Transforming DHS as a high risk area to the federal government because DHS had to transform 22 agencies into one department, and failure to address associated risks could have serious consequences for U.S. national security. In 2013, we reported that although challenges remained for DHS, the department had made considerable progress. As a result, we narrowed the scope of the high-risk area to focus on strengthening DHS management functions (human capital, acquisition, financial management, and information technology). discusses DHS's progress and remaining actions needed to strengthen and integrate its management functions.", "This statement discusses DHS\u2019s progress and remaining actions needed to strengthen and integrate its management functions. This statement is based on our 2019 high-risk update and other reports issued from February 2017 through March 2019. Among other things, GAO analyzed DHS strategies and other documents related to the department's efforts to address its high-risk areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As GAO reported in its 2019 high-risk update, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has continued its efforts to strengthen and integrate its acquisition, information technology, financial, and human capital management functions. As a result, the department has continued to meet three out of five criteria for removal from GAO's High-Risk List (leadership commitment, action plan, and monitoring) and partially meet the remaining two criteria (capacity and demonstrated progress). With regard to leadership commitment, DHS's top leadership has continued to demonstrate support for addressing the department's management challenges through, for example, its Integrated Priorities initiative to strengthen the integration of DHS's business operations across the department. Additionally, DHS has established an action plan for addressing the high-risk area and has issued 14 updated versions since 2011.This action plan also demonstrates DHS's ongoing monitoring of these efforts as it describes DHS's progress to-date and planned corrective actions.", "The two key areas where additional work is needed are DHS's capacity and demonstrated progress. With regard to capacity, DHS needs to make additional progress identifying and allocating resources in the areas of acquisition, information technology, and financial management. With regard to demonstrated progress, DHS should show the ability to achieve sustained improvement across 30 outcomes that GAO identified and DHS agreed were needed to address the high-risk area. GAO found in its 2019 high-risk update that DHS fully addressed 17 of these outcomes, while work remains to fully address the remaining 13. DHS has made some progress in recent years regarding human capital and information technology outcomes, but needs to continue implementing its action plan to show measurable, sustainable progress in achieving the 13 outcomes not yet fully addressed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, GAO has made about 2,800 recommendations to DHS to strengthen its management efforts, among other things. DHS has implemented more than 75 percent of these recommendations which have strengthened program management and performance measurement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) management challenges and its progress in addressing  them. As you know, in 2002, when DHS was created, department  leadership faced the daunting task of transforming 22 agencies\u2014several  with major management challenges\u2014into one department. At that time,  we recognized that the creation of DHS was an enormous undertaking  that could take years to implement, and failure to effectively address  management challenges could have serious national security  consequences. In 2003, shortly after the department was formed, we  designated Implementing and Transforming DHS as a high-risk area to  the federal government. Today, the work to strengthen DHS\u2019s  management continues.", "Since 2003, we have narrowed the focus of this high-risk area as DHS  has matured and evolved. In 2013, we reported that although challenges  remained for DHS across its range of missions, the department had made  considerable progress in transforming its original component agencies  into a single cabinet-level department. As a result, we narrowed the  scope of the high-risk area to focus on strengthening DHS management  functions (human capital, acquisition, financial management, and  information technology) and changed the name of the high-risk area to  Strengthening DHS Management Functions to reflect this focus.", "In the last decade, DHS has taken many steps to strengthen its  management including developing a more strategic approach to human  capital planning, improving acquisition process compliance, and  improving its information technology (IT) investment framework. DHS has  implemented more than 75 percent of the approximately 2,800  recommendations we have made since 2003, which have strengthened  program management and performance measurement, among other  things. However, significant challenges remain in the areas of acquisition  management and financial reporting. In May 2018, we found that many of  the acquisition programs we assessed were not on track to meet their  schedule and cost goals, as I will explain in greater detail later in this  statement. Further, components\u2019 financial management systems and  business processes need to be modernized to facilitate the department\u2019s  ability to have ready access to reliable information for informed decision  making. We continue to closely monitor DHS\u2019s work in these areas and  regularly meet with DHS management to discuss progress.", "Our five criteria for removing areas from the High-Risk List guide our  discussions with DHS and our assessments of its progress. Specifically,  the agency must have (1) a demonstrated strong commitment and top  leadership support to address the risks; (2) the capacity\u2014the people and  other resources\u2014to resolve the risks; (3) a corrective action plan that  identifies the root causes, identifies effective solutions, and provides for  substantially completing corrective measures in the near term, including  but not limited to steps necessary to implement solutions we  recommended; (4) a program instituted to monitor and independently  validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures; and  (5) the ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective  measures.", "My statement discusses DHS\u2019s progress and remaining actions needed  to strengthen and integrate its management functions. This statement is  based on our 2019 high-risk update and other reports we issued from  February 2017 through March 2019. For these products we analyzed  DHS strategies and other documents related to the department\u2019s efforts  to address its high-risk areas and interviewed DHS officials, among other  things.

DHS has partially  met the remaining two criteria\u2014capacity and demonstrated, sustained  progress, as shown in figure 1.", "With regard to leadership commitment, DHS\u2019s top leadership, including  the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, has continued  to demonstrate commitment and support for addressing the department\u2019s  management challenges. They have also taken actions to institutionalize  this commitment to help ensure the long-term success of the  department\u2019s efforts. One such effort is the Under Secretary for  Management\u2019s Integrated Priorities initiative to strengthen the integration  of DHS\u2019s business operations across the department. During monthly  leadership meetings with the Under Secretary for Management, the  department\u2019s Chief Executive Officers have been providing status  updates on their respective actions to address this high-risk designation.  Furthermore, top DHS leaders, such as the Under Secretary for  Management and the department\u2019s Chief Executive Officers, routinely  meet with GAO management to discuss progress on high-risk areas.", "With regard to having an action plan and monitoring effectiveness, in  January 2011, DHS produced its first Integrated Strategy for High-Risk  Management and has issued 14 updated versions, most recently in  September 2018. The September 2018 strategy describes DHS\u2019s  progress to-date, planned corrective actions to further strengthen its  management functions, and includes performance measures to monitor  key management initiatives. DHS\u2019s Management Directorate leads this  ongoing effort and DHS\u2019s strategy and approach, if effectively  implemented and sustained, provides a path for DHS to be removed from  our High-Risk List.", "DHS has partially met the criteria for capacity but needs to make  additional progress identifying and allocating resources in certain areas\u2014 namely acquisition, IT, and financial management\u2014to fully demonstrate  its capacity. DHS has analyzed components\u2019 acquisition program staffing  assessments but has yet to conduct an in-depth analysis across  components or develop a plan to address any gaps. With regard to IT  staffing, DHS has not fully identified or reported to Congress or the Office  of Personnel Management (OPM) on its department-wide cybersecurity  specialty areas of critical needs, such as cybersecurity management or  incident response, as required by law. Additionally, DHS\u2019s financial  statement auditor has identified several capacity-related issues, including  resource limitations and inadequate management and staff training, as  causes for the material weaknesses reported.", "The final criterion is demonstrated progress, which remains partially met.  In 2010, we identified, and DHS agreed, that achieving 30 specific  outcomes in the areas of acquisition management, IT management,  financial management, human capital management, and management  integration would be critical to addressing the department\u2019s management  challenges. As such, these 30 outcomes became the key criteria by which  we gauge DHS\u2019s demonstrated progress.", "We reported in March 2019 that DHS has fully addressed 17 of the 30  needed outcomes, mostly addressed four, partially addressed six, and  initiated actions to address the remaining three, as shown in table 1.", "In the last 2 years, DHS has made particular progress in the areas of  human capital and IT management. Specifically, since 2017 DHS has  taken steps to fully address 4 outcomes. The department fully addressed  two key human capital outcomes by (1) demonstrating that components  are basing hiring decisions and promotions on human capital  competencies and (2) strengthening employee engagement efforts. In  addition, in the last 2 years DHS has fully addressed two IT outcomes by  (1) providing ongoing oversight and support to troubled IT investments to  help improve their cost, schedule, and performance; and (2)  demonstrating significant progress in implementing its IT strategic  workforce planning initiative.", "Important progress and remaining work in all of the five key areas include:", "Acquisition management. DHS continues to face challenges in  funding its acquisition portfolio. In May 2018, we found that recent  enhancements to DHS\u2019s acquisition management, resource  allocation, and requirements policies largely reflect key portfolio  management practices. However, we also found that of the 24 major  acquisition programs we assessed with approved schedule and cost  goals, 10 were on track to meet those goals during 2017\u2014a decrease  from 2016.", "In addition, we found that DHS\u2019s portfolio of major acquisition  programs was not affordable from fiscal years 2018 to 2022 because  the planned costs exceeded the planned budget. DHS has taken  steps to strengthen acquisition requirements development across the  department, such as reestablishing the Joint Requirements Council in  June 2014 to review and validate DHS acquisition requirements.  However, opportunities remain to further strengthen DHS\u2019s acquisition  process by, for example, using the Joint Requirements Council to (1)  identify overlapping or common requirements and (2) make  recommendations to senior leadership to help ensure that DHS uses  its finite investment resources wisely and maintains a balanced  portfolio of investments that combine near-term operational  improvements with long-term strategic planning.", "IT management. DHS has updated its approach for managing its  portfolios of IT investments across all components. As part of the  revised approach, the department is using its capital planning and  investment control process and the Joint Requirements Council to  assess IT investments across the department on an ongoing basis.  For example, as part of its capital planning process for the fiscal year  2020 budget, the Office of the Chief Information Officer worked with  the components to assess each major IT investment to ensure  alignment with DHS\u2019s functional portfolios, and to identify  opportunities to share capabilities across components. This updated  approach should enable DHS to identify potentially duplicative  investments and opportunities for consolidating investments, as well  as reduce component-specific investments.", "Additionally, DHS has continued to take steps to enhance its  information security program. In November 2018, the department\u2019s  financial statement auditor reported that DHS had made progress in  correcting its prior year IT security weaknesses. However, for the 15th  consecutive year, the auditor designated deficiencies in IT systems  controls as a material weakness for financial reporting purposes.  Work also remains in implementing our six open recommendations  concerning DHS\u2019s cybersecurity workforce assessment  requirements.", "DHS also faces challenges in fulfilling its pivotal role in government- wide cybersecurity efforts, as identified in our Ensuring the  Cybersecurity of the Nation high-risk area. DHS has established the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center,  which functions as the 24/7 cyber monitoring, incident response, and  management center for the federal civilian government. However,  DHS has continued to be challenged in measuring how the center is  performing its functions in accordance with mandated implementing  principles.", "Financial management. DHS received a clean audit opinion on its  financial statements for 6 consecutive years\u2014fiscal years 2013 to  2018. However, in fiscal year 2018, its auditor reported two material  weaknesses in the areas of financial reporting and information  technology controls and financial systems, as well as instances of  non-compliance with laws and regulations. These deficiencies hamper  DHS\u2019s ability to provide reasonable assurance that its financial  reporting is reliable and the department is in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations.", "Further, DHS components\u2019 financial management systems and  business processes need to be modernized; the current systems  affect the department\u2019s ability to have ready access to reliable  information for informed decision-making. As we reported in 2017,  DHS officials have faced various challenges in their efforts to address  this\u2014lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex  requirements, and increased costs. Effectively modernizing financial  management systems for the Coast Guard, Federal Emergency  Management Agency, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  would help address DHS\u2019s risk in this area.", "Human capital management. DHS has continued to strengthen its  employee engagement efforts by implementing our 2012  recommendation to establish metrics of success within components\u2019  action plans for addressing its employee satisfaction problems.", "Further, DHS has conducted audits to better ensure components are  basing hiring decisions and promotions on human capital  competencies. OPM\u2019s 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data  showed that in the past 2 years, DHS\u2019s score on the Employee  Engagement Index increased by 4 points\u2014from 56 in 2016 to 60 in  2018\u2014which was 1 point more than the government wide increase  over the same period. While this improvement is notable, DHS\u2019s 2018  score ranked 20th among 20 large and very large federal agencies.  Increasing employee engagement and morale is critical to  strengthening DHS\u2019s mission and management functions.", "Management integration. Since 2015, DHS has focused its efforts to  address crosscutting management challenges through the  establishment and monitoring of its Integrated Priorities initiative. The  department updated these priorities in September 2017. Each priority  includes goals, objectives, and measurable action plans that are  discussed at monthly leadership meetings led by senior DHS officials,  including the Under Secretary for Management. DHS needs to  continue to demonstrate sustainable progress integrating its  management functions within and across the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Remains to be Done", "paragraphs": ["In closing, it is clear that significant effort is required to build and integrate  a department as large and complex as DHS, which has grown to more  than 240,000 employees and approximately $74 billion in budget  authority. Continued progress for this high-risk area depends primarily on  addressing the remaining outcomes. In the coming years, DHS needs to  continue implementing its Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management  to show measurable, sustainable progress in implementing corrective  actions and achieving outcomes. In doing so, it remains important for  DHS to maintain its current level of top leadership support and sustained  commitment to ensure continued progress in executing its corrective  actions through completion;  continue to identify the people and resources necessary to make  progress towards achieving outcomes, work to mitigate shortfalls and  prioritize initiatives as needed, and communicate to senior leadership  critical resource gaps;  continue to implement its plan for addressing this high-risk area and  periodically provide assessments of its progress to us and Congress;  closely track and independently validate the effectiveness and  sustainability of its corrective actions, and make midcourse  adjustments as needed; and make continued progress in achieving the 13 outcomes it has not fully  addressed and demonstrate that systems, personnel, and policies are  in place to ensure that progress can be sustained over time.", "We will continue to monitor DHS\u2019s efforts in this high-risk area to  determine if the outcomes are achieved and sustained over the long term.", "Madam Chairwoman Torres Small, Ranking Member Crenshaw, and  Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
