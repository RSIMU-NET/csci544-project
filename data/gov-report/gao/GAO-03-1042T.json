Reports of adverse events have been received by FDA and others, including Metabolife International, the manufacturer of a dietary supplement containing ephedra, Metabolife 356. Because of concerns surrounding the safety of dietary supplements containing ephedra, GAO was asked to discuss and update some of the findings from its prior work on ephedra, including its examination of Metabolife International's records of health-related calls from consumers of Metabolife 356. Specifically, GAO examined (1) FDA's analysis of the adverse event reports it received for dietary supplements containing ephedra, (2) how the adverse events reported in the health-related call records collected by Metabolife International illustrate the health risks of dietary supplements containing ephedra, and (3) FDA's actions in the oversight of dietary supplements containing ephedra."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FDA has used the adverse event reports it has received to conclude that dietary supplements containing ephedra pose a significant public health hazard. Since February 1993, FDA has received 2,277 reports of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedra, 15 times more reports than it has received for the next most commonly reported herbal dietary supplement. The types of adverse events that GAO identified in the health-related call records from Metabolife International were consistent with the types of adverse events reported to FDA and with the documented physiological effects of ephedra. Although call records contained limited information for most of the reports, GAO identified 14,684 call records that had reports of at least one adverse event among consumers of Metabolife 356. GAO's count of 92 serious events--heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths--was similar to that of other reviews of the call records, including counts by Metabolife International and its consultants. Many of the serious events were reported among relatively young consumers--more than one-third concerned consumers who reported an age under 30. In addition, for call records containing information on the amount of product consumed or length of product use, GAO found that most of the reported serious adverse events occurred among consumers who followed the usage guidelines on the Metabolife 356 label. As part of its oversight of dietary supplements, FDA has taken some actions specifically focused on dietary supplements containing ephedra. FDA has issued warnings that focus on improper labeling, issued warnings to consumers, and issued a proposed rule in 1997 that, among other things, would require a health warning on the label of dietary supplements containing ephedra and prohibit a dietary supplement from containing both ephedra and a stimulant. FDA subsequently banned the sale of certain classes of over-the-counter drugs containing ephedrine and related alkaloids--the active ingredient in ephedra--in combination with an analgesic or stimulant. As the 1997 proposed rule has not been finalized, there is no rule prohibiting the marketing of dietary supplements with similar ingredients, and many dietary supplements with ephedra, such as Metabolife 356, also include caffeine or other stimulants. To receive comments on new evidence, FDA recently reopened the comment period for the proposed rule, and FDA reported to GAO that the agency is in the process of reviewing comments it has received and has not reached a decision regarding further action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as the Subcommittee considers concerns  about the safety of dietary supplements containing ephedra. More than  half of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, and more than one-third are  trying to lose weight. Many Americans have turned to dietary supplements  to help them lose weight. The most widely used weight loss supplement  ingredient is ephedra, which is also referred to as ma huang. The dietary  supplement industry has estimated that as many as 3 billion servings of  dietary supplements containing ephedra are consumed each year in the  United States. Medical experts have expressed concerns about the safety  of dietary supplements containing ephedra.

Dietary supplements may not contain  synthetic active ingredients that are sold in over-the-counter drugs and  prescription medications and cannot be promoted as a treatment,  prevention, or cure for a specific disease or condition.", "Under DSHEA, manufacturers are responsible for ensuring the safety of  dietary supplements they sell. Dietary supplements do not need approval  from FDA before they are marketed; thus FDA generally addresses safety  concerns only after dietary supplements are marketed. DSHEA does not  require manufacturers to register with FDA, identify the products they  manufacture, or provide reports of adverse events to FDA. Mechanisms  that FDA uses to oversee dietary supplements and other products it  regulates differ (see app. I for more details).", "Since manufacturers of dietary supplements are not required to provide  reports of adverse events to FDA, the agency relies on voluntary  postmarket reporting of adverse events to better understand the safety of  dietary supplements. Some individual adverse event reports are especially  valuable to FDA because they include enough information to help FDA  determine if the adverse event was likely caused by the supplement. These  reports include information about the receipt of medical care, health care  professionals\u2019 attribution of adverse events to the consumption of dietary  supplements, the consumer\u2019s appropriate use of the products, the  consumer\u2019s use of other products, underlying health conditions and other  alternative explanations for the adverse event, and the consistency of  symptoms with the documented effects of the dietary supplement.", "FDA, through the Department of Justice, can take enforcement action in  court against dietary supplements that are adulterated to remove them  from the market. A dietary supplement is considered adulterated under a  number of circumstances, including when it    presents a \u201csignificant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury\u201d under the  conditions of use recommended or suggested in its labeling, or under  ordinary conditions of use if there are no suggestions or recommendations  in the labeling, or    bears or contains any \u201cpoisonous or deleterious substance\u201d which may  render it injurious to health under the conditions of use recommended or  suggested in its labeling.", "Instead of going to court, FDA may choose to take administrative action to  prohibit the sale of dietary supplements it considers to be adulterated.  FDA can promulgate a regulation declaring a particular dietary  supplement to be adulterated. FDA has not taken this action with any  dietary supplement. FDA can also issue an advisory letter explaining why  it considers the dietary supplement to be adulterated. The advisory letter  provides guidance to the industry regarding FDA\u2019s opinion and notifies the  public that FDA may take legal action against firms or individuals that do  not follow the letter\u2019s advice. FDA has done this for two dietary  supplement ingredients, comfrey and aristolochic acid.", "In addition, although it has never been done, the Secretary of Health and  Human Services (HHS) may declare that a dietary supplement is  adulterated because it poses an \u201cimminent hazard\u201d to public health or  safety.

In  February 2003, the RAND Corporation released a review of the scientific  evidence on the safety and efficacy of dietary supplements containing  ephedra and concluded that a sufficient number of cases of these same  types of events had occurred in young adults to warrant further scientific  study of the causal relationship between ephedra and these serious  adverse events. RAND also found that use of ephedra or ephedrine plus  caffeine is associated with a number of other adverse effects, including an  increased risk of nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations, and psychiatric  symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood.", "Because of these health concerns, many organizations and jurisdictions  have taken actions aimed at reducing the use of dietary supplements  containing ephedra. The American Medical Association and the American  Heart Association have urged FDA to ban the sale of dietary supplements  containing ephedra. In January 2002, Health Canada issued a Health  Advisory for Canadians not to use certain products containing ephedra,  especially those that also contain caffeine and other stimulants. In 2003,  Illinois banned the sale of products containing ephedra and other states  have similar bans under consideration. In addition, some states have  banned the sale of such products to minors or required label warnings.  Several sports organizations, including the NCAA, the National Football  League, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the International Olympic  Committee, have banned the use of ephedra by their athletes.", "In 2003, General Nutrition Centers, the nation\u2019s largest specialty retailer of  nutritional supplements, discontinued the sale of products containing  ephedra, as have three other major retail outlets.
