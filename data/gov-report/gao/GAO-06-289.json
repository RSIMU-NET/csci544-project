Because DAP programs can have significant impacts on fishermen and their communities, many believe that effective participation by fishermen and other stakeholders in the development of these programs is critical. GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which the regional fishery management councils are using a framework for effective participation and (2) the methods stakeholders and participation experts suggest for enhancing stakeholder participation in developing DAP programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The fishery management councils that GAO reviewed lack key elements of an effective stakeholder participation framework and therefore may be missing opportunities for all stakeholders to participate in the DAP program development process. Based on GAO's review of the literature and the experience of leading federal agencies in stakeholder participation, such a framework should include a strategic implementation approach that embodies a set of core principles, such as making key information readily available and understandable and fostering responsive, interactive communication between stakeholders and decision makers. However, fisheries stakeholders identified several areas where council practices do not fully adhere to the core principles GAO identified. For example, while the councils make DAP-related information available to stakeholders, this information is not always presented in an easily understandable way. Also, while stakeholders can testify at council meetings, according to participation experts, this one-way communication is not an effective way to share information because it does not lead to a dialogue between stakeholders and decision makers. Unlike other federal agencies, NMFS has neither developed a formal stakeholder participation policy nor provided the councils with guidance or training on how to develop and use a strategic approach to enhance stakeholder participation. While not legally required to do so, if NMFS adopted such an approach it could help ensure, among other things, that all relevant stakeholders are identified, specific participation goals are defined, and participation plans are implemented by the councils developing DAP programs. Methods suggested by stakeholders and participation experts that could enhance stakeholder participation in the DAP program development process principally fall into five categories: (1) providing education and outreach; (2) holding meetings using different times, locations, and formats; (3) streamlining the DAP program development process; (4) diversifying interests represented in the council process; and (5) sharing decision-making authority. While using these methods can result in more effective participation, particularly when they are employed as part of a participation plan, these methods can also have certain disadvantages, such as increased costs. For example, the Marine Resource Education Project (MREP), which is sponsored by a group of universities in New England, offers several examples of promising practices. MREP provides stakeholders with training on fisheries management and science to help them better understand the council process and DAP issues, teaches the importance of being involved early and throughout the process, and provides diverse stakeholders with the opportunity to exchange information in informal settings. However, such training can be costly and may reach relatively few stakeholders."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Overfishing is a problem with far-reaching environmental and economic  consequences. When a fishery\u2014one or more stocks of fish within a  geographic area\u2014cannot be sustained because of overfishing, the marine  ecosystem in which those stocks live can be harmed, and fishermen and  their communities can experience economic hardship. The National Marine  Fisheries Service (NMFS), a component of the Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has several  management tools available to help end overfishing and promote  conservation, including dedicated access privilege (DAP) programs. Under  a DAP program, NMFS sets a total allowable catch in a particular fishery  and then allocates quota\u2014the privilege to harvest a specified portion of the  total catch allowed for the fishery\u2014to eligible entities, such as fishermen,  communities, and fishery cooperatives. DAP programs have achieved  several desired benefits, such as helping to stabilize fisheries. However,  these programs have also raised concerns about such issues as the equity  of quota allocation decisions. Moreover, because of the potential for DAP  programs to have significant impacts on fishermen, fishing communities,  and the environment, among other things, many believe that effective  participation by fishermen and other stakeholders in the development of  these programs is critical. Yet, some believe that effective participation  may not be occurring.", "In 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  established the process for managing marine fisheries in the United States.  Under the act, eight regional fishery management councils are responsible  for developing fishery management plans, including DAP programs and  other plans for managing fisheries in federal waters. The councils are  composed primarily of federal and state fishery management officials and  individuals selected by the Secretary of Commerce from lists submitted by  the governors of the states in the councils\u2019 regions. The Secretary is  required, to the extent practicable, to select council members in such a way  as to ensure a fair and balanced representation of the active participants in  the commercial and recreational fisheries under the jurisdiction of the  councils. Each council establishes advisory committees to provide  information and recommendations to the council on the development of  DAP programs and other fishery management plans, amendments, and  regulations.", "To provide for stakeholder participation in developing fishery management  plans, such as DAP programs, each council must hold open meetings that  are widely publicized; make available council-generated information, such  as detailed minutes of council and committee meetings; and allow  interested individuals and groups to provide oral or written comments  regarding agenda items. Once a council prepares a DAP plan and drafts  regulations to implement the plan, the council submits the plan and  regulations to the Secretary of Commerce for approval. The Secretary  reviews the plan and proposed regulations for consistency with national  standards and applicable law, and immediately publishes notice of the  plan\u2019s availability for comment. The Secretary also publishes the  regulations for public comment after reviewing them for consistency with  the plan and applicable law. Once the comment period closes, the Secretary  may then approve the plan and promulgate final regulations, disapprove  the plan, or partially approve the plan; recommended changes are provided  to the council if the plan is not approved. Both NMFS and the councils have  responsibility for implementing and monitoring approved DAP programs  and proposing any changes. According to participation experts, effective  stakeholder participation may require agencies to go beyond the legal  requirements for formalized participation and use a more open, responsive,  informal, and collaborative approach to participation. Based on our review  of the literature and the experience of leading federal agencies in  stakeholder participation, adopting a participation framework is an  effective way to guide the development and implementation of this type of  approach. Such a framework includes core principles that provide a  foundation for an agency\u2019s stakeholder participation efforts and a strategic  approach to implementing them.", "This is the fourth in a series of requested reports on individual fishing quota  (IFQ) and other DAP programs. In December 2002, we reported on the  extent of consolidation of quota holdings, the extent of foreign holdings of  quota, and the economic effect of IFQ programs on seafood processors. In  February 2004, we reported on methods available for protecting the  economic viability of fishing communities and facilitating new entry into  IFQ fisheries, key issues facing fishery managers in protecting  communities and facilitating new entry, and the comparative advantages  and disadvantages of the IFQ system and the fishery cooperative  approach. In March 2005, we reported on the costs of managing IFQ  programs and how these costs differ from pre-IFQ management costs, the  IFQ management costs being recovered by NMFS, and ways to share the  costs of IFQ programs between government and industry. For this report,  you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which the regional fishery  management councils are using a framework for effective stakeholder  participation and (2) the methods stakeholders and participation experts  suggest for enhancing stakeholder participation in the development of DAP  programs.", "To conduct this review, we reviewed the activities and attended meetings of  four regional fishery management councils: the Gulf of Mexico, New  England, North Pacific, and Pacific councils. We selected these councils to  obtain broad geographic coverage of councils where DAP programs were  being developed. At the council meetings and elsewhere, we interviewed  DAP program stakeholders, including commercial vessel owners, captains,  and crew; recreational fishermen; fish dealers and processors;  environmentalists; fishing community representatives; and state and  federal fishery managers. In addition, we surveyed the members of the four  fishery management councils whose meetings we attended to obtain their  views regarding stakeholder participation, including both obstacles and  potential methods for enhancing participation. We also interviewed  participation experts and federal agency officials on public participation  theory and practice. See appendix I for additional details on our scope and  methodology and appendix II for the fishery management council survey  results. We conducted our review from March through November 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Public participation in federal agency decision making has evolved over the  past 60 years. The Administrative Procedure Act, enacted in 1946, created a  legal basis for public participation by requiring agencies to hold public  comment periods for proposed rules. In 1969, the enactment of NEPA  provided the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental  impacts of certain proposed federal actions. NEPA requires federal  agencies to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement for any  major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human  environment, as well as an analysis of alternatives to the proposed action.  The agency must take this information to the public and provide  opportunities for the public to comment before a decision is reached. In  1993, Executive Order 12866 was issued to reform the regulatory process  by, among other things, making the process more accessible and open to  the public. Specifically, the order directs federal agencies to seek the  involvement of those who are intended to benefit from and those expected  to be burdened by any regulation before issuing a notice of proposed  rulemaking, and to give the public an opportunity to comment on any  proposed regulation.", "In 1976 the Magnuson-Stevens Act institutionalized regional decision  making in which stakeholders play a key role. Specifically, the act  established eight regional councils responsible for developing DAP and  other fishery management plans: the New England, Mid-Atlantic, South  Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Pacific, North Pacific, and Western  Pacific councils. One of the purposes of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is to  ensure that the councils prepare, monitor, and revise these plans under  circumstances that will enable the states, the fishing industry, consumer  and environmental organizations, and other interested parties to  participate in and advise on the establishment and administration of the  plans. To this end, the act provides many opportunities for stakeholder  participation in developing fishery management plans. Stakeholders can  attend open meetings, provide oral and written comments regarding DAP  issues before the council, and serve (or be represented) on the councils or  advisory committees that make recommendations to the councils.  Programs developed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act must also meet the  requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, NEPA, and other laws  governing fisheries management. NMFS prepares operational guidelines to  assist the councils in developing practices and procedures, consistent with  these laws, for developing, reviewing, and implementing fishery  management plans.", "There are several different types of DAPs:  IFQs allow eligible entities, such as vessel owners or fishermen, to catch  a specified portion of the total catch allowed. When the assigned  portions can be sold or transferred, they are called individual  transferable quotas.", "Community quotas grant a specified portion of the total catch allowed to  a community. The community then decides how to allocate the catch.", "Fishing cooperatives divide all or part of the available quota among  fishing and/or processing entities by means of contractual agreements.", "Area-based quotas give an individual or group dedicated access to the  fish within a specific area of the ocean.", "At the time of our review, NMFS had implemented nine DAP programs for  fisheries under the management authority of the regional councils: the Mid- Atlantic surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ program in 1990, the South Atlantic  wreckfish (snapper-grouper complex) IFQ program in 1992, the Western  Alaska Community Development Quota Program in 1992, the Alaskan  halibut and sablefish (black cod) IFQ program in 1995, the Whiting  Conservation Cooperative in 1997, the Bering Sea pollock cooperative  authorized by the American Fisheries Act in 1998, the Pacific sablefish  permit stacking program in 2002, the Georges Bank cod hook sector  allocation program in 2004, and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab  rationalization program authorized by Congress in 2004. See appendix III  for descriptions of these programs. In addition, NMFS had implemented a  tenth DAP program for the Atlantic bluefin tuna purse seine fishery, which  the Secretary of Commerce established and now manages. Finally, at the  time of our review, DAP programs were being developed for the following  fisheries: Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands non-pollock groundfish (trawl  catcher-processor), Gulf of Alaska groundfish, Gulf of Alaska rockfish, Gulf  of Mexico red snapper, Mid-Atlantic tilefish, Georges Bank cod (gillnet),  and Pacific groundfish (trawl)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Councils Lack Key Elements of a Framework for Ensuring Effective Stakeholder Participation during the DAP Program Development Process", "paragraphs": ["An effective stakeholder participation framework encompasses a set of  core principles and a strategic implementation approach. However, the  current practices of the fishery management councils we reviewed do not  fully reflect such core principles or include an implementation strategy.  While the DAP program development process provides many opportunities  for stakeholder participation, stakeholders identified several areas where  the councils have not addressed obstacles to participation faced by some  stakeholders, particularly crew members."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Stakeholder Participation Practices Do Not Fully Adhere to Core Participation Principles", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the participation literature and policies from leading federal  agencies in stakeholder participation identified the following core  principles for effective stakeholder participation, some of which may  overlap when put into practice:  using an open and clearly defined decision-making process;   making key information readily available and understandable;  actively conducting outreach and soliciting stakeholder input;  involving stakeholders early and throughout the decision-making   fostering responsive, interactive communication between stakeholders   using formal and informal participation methods; and  including all stakeholder interests.", "While the DAP program development process used by the fishery  management councils provides many opportunities for stakeholder  participation, stakeholders with whom we spoke and council members  who responded to our survey identified several areas where current  practices do not fully adhere to the core principles for effective  participation.", "Using an open and clearly defined decision-making process. Adhering  to this principle means that an organization makes program  development processes open and accessible to all interested  stakeholders, and that the organization has informed stakeholders about  what roles they can play and how the organization uses stakeholder  input, such as oral statements provided at council meetings, in decision  making. Using a transparent process gives stakeholders clear  expectations about how decisions will be made, enhancing  understanding and trust in the organization\u2019s decisions. While the  councils we reviewed use an open decision-making process and inform  stakeholders how they can participate, they do not always make clear  how they use stakeholder input in decision making. Specifically, the  councils hold open meetings where any stakeholder can provide oral or  written statements on DAP agenda items. Also, each council has  prepared a Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures that  provides information on council operations and how stakeholders can  participate in developing fishery management plans, such as DAP  programs. Further, the councils we reviewed make information  available at council meetings on how to participate. In addition, the  Pacific Council has prepared a guide on how to get involved in the  council process, which is available on its Web site, as well as at council  meetings. Nonetheless, stakeholders told us that it takes time to  understand the process. As a result, some stakeholders, particularly  those who are new to the process or who are not members of a  stakeholder organization, do not understand which meetings to attend  and the appropriate times to submit information on DAP proposals.  Finally, while all council members who responded to our survey said  that they use stakeholder input in making decisions, they do not always  provide explanations of how stakeholder input was used. For example,  stakeholders told us that when a council votes immediately after public  comment, it is not always clear that their input was considered,  particularly when the council\u2019s decision does not reflect the views  expressed in public comment. In addition, council meeting minutes do  not always address issues raised by stakeholders or explain how their  input was used in making decisions.", "Making key information readily available and understandable. This  core principle helps ensure that stakeholders have access to  information, such as analyses of DAP proposals, and that the  information is understandable to them so that they can participate in a  meaningful way during the program development process. While all the  councils we reviewed make key information on DAP program  development readily available to stakeholders, this technical  information is not always presented in an easily understandable way.  Specifically, the councils make program documents, such as draft DAP  planning documents and analyses, available on their Web sites and at  council meetings. The councils also send these documents to those who  request them. However, stakeholders told us that the documents often  use technical language to present complex issues, making them difficult  to understand. Stakeholders also told us that documents can be lengthy  and repetitive, making them time-consuming to read. For example, the  environmental impact statement for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands  crab rationalization program, required under NEPA, was more than  2,300 pages long. When key information is difficult to understand and  time-consuming to read, some stakeholders said that they have difficulty  becoming knowledgeable about the issues, which, according to  participation experts, can limit stakeholders\u2019 ability to participate in a  meaningful way.", "Actively conducting outreach and soliciting stakeholder input.", "Adhering to this principle means that decision makers seek out those  potentially affected by a decision and request input, paying particular  attention to stakeholder groups that have traditionally been less  involved. The councils we reviewed conduct some outreach and solicit  stakeholder input. For example, the councils we reviewed place notices  in the Federal Register and distribute notices to the media to announce  public meetings as required by law, maintain mailing lists of people  interested in receiving council-generated information, prepare and  distribute newsletters to people on their mailing lists, and send  representatives to fishing conferences, expositions, and forums. In  addition to conducting outreach, the councils also solicit stakeholder  input on the potential effects of specific DAP program alternatives by  holding meetings at various locations where stakeholders can submit  oral and written statements. However, at the four councils we reviewed,  we found only limited efforts by the councils to provide targeted  outreach to, or seek input from, stakeholders who do not typically  participate in the council process, such as crew members. This may  explain, in part, why stakeholders told us that some stakeholders, such  as crew members and others who may be affected by DAP decisions, do  not participate or participate too late in the process to provide  meaningful input. Over 60 percent of the council members who  responded to our survey believe that expanding public outreach  activities would be effective in improving stakeholder participation in  developing DAP programs. Some council members noted, however, that  stakeholders also have a responsibility to seek out information about  DAP issues and use the available opportunities to participate in the  development process.", "Involving stakeholders early and throughout the decision-making  process. According to participation experts and our prior work,  involving stakeholders early and throughout the decision-making  process can help ensure that stakeholders provide input early enough  for the input to be useful and often enough so that stakeholders are  involved in the smaller decisions that lead to a final decision. Although  the councils follow the stakeholder participation requirements provided  by law, the length of the DAP program development process and the  costs of attending meetings make it difficult for some stakeholders to be  involved early and throughout the process. Specifically, stakeholders  can participate in the process by providing oral and written input to the  council and its advisory committees on DAP agenda items at public  hearings and meetings, and by serving on the council or advisory  committees that make recommendations to the council. However, many  stakeholders told us that the length of the process, which can take  several years, was a significant obstacle to participation. In addition to  the length of the process, the costs associated with travel and time away  from work make it difficult for some stakeholders to attend meetings  and stay involved. Stakeholders told us that this situation is particularly  problematic for those who are not members of organizations or do not  have representatives to attend meetings, gather information, and  provide input on their behalf.", "Fostering responsive, interactive communication between  stakeholders and decision makers. This core principle promotes  understanding between stakeholders and decision makers. While the  councils communicate with stakeholders, they do not always do so in a  responsive, interactive way. Stakeholders can provide input to the  councils by testifying at council meetings (see fig. 1) and by submitting  written comments. At the councils we visited, testimony is given at  designated times during the council meetings, with one speaker  following another. Council members may ask clarifying questions at the  completion of each statement, but they do not always do so. According  to participation experts, serial testimony is not an effective way to  communicate, because it does not lead to a dialogue between  stakeholders and decision makers. Further, some stakeholders told us  that they find it intimidating to deliver public testimony before the  council, which may require speaking before as many as 21 council  members and 200 people in the audience.", "In addition, stakeholders told us that when they submit written  comments, which become part of the official record, councils do not  consistently respond to these comments. When a council does not  respond to oral or written comments, it loses an opportunity to foster  interactive communication and stakeholders question how their input  was used.", "Using formal and informal participation methods. Formal  information exchanges\u2014such as written council responses to  stakeholder input on proposed DAP plans\u2014help ensure that  information (e.g. the rationale for DAP decisions) is available to all,  regardless of one\u2019s ability to attend meetings. Informal methods, such as  open houses where agency officials can share information and hear  stakeholder concerns, can give stakeholders and decision makers the  opportunity to interact and share views on DAP issues. While the  councils we reviewed provide stakeholders with formal opportunities to  participate in developing DAP programs, they offer few informal  opportunities that are open to all stakeholders. Specifically, while all  stakeholders can formally participate in developing DAP programs by  attending meetings and submitting oral and written comments,  according to participation experts, these formal participation methods  are not always conducive to interactive communication between  stakeholders and decision makers. Moreover, stakeholders told us that  they would like more opportunities for informal interactions. All four of  the councils we reviewed provide contact information for council  members and staff on their Web sites, and stakeholders told us that  council staff are available and helpful to people who contact them.  However, our review of council practices showed that the councils  provide few organized opportunities for all stakeholders to informally  discuss issues.", "Including all stakeholder interests. Including all stakeholder interests  helps ensure that all viewpoints are considered in developing DAP  programs and is crucial to perceptions of fairness. One of the purposes  of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is to ensure that councils prepare plans in  ways that enable stakeholders to participate, but some stakeholder  groups may not be adequately represented. For example, 60 percent of  the council members who responded to our survey believed that crew  members were poorly represented or not represented at all in the DAP  program development process. Further, while stakeholders serve on the  council or on advisory committees that make recommendations  regarding DAP proposals to the council, some stakeholders are  concerned that not all stakeholder interests are adequately represented  on the councils and their advisory committees. Regarding  representation on the councils, the Secretary of Commerce is required  to select council members in such a way as to ensure a fair and balanced  representation of the active participants in the commercial and  recreational fisheries under the council\u2019s jurisdiction. However, among  the commercial representatives on the Pacific Fishery Management  Council, there are no active commercial fishermen; similarly, there are  no active crew members on the four councils we reviewed. Moreover,  the Secretary is not required to balance any other stakeholder interests,  such as environmentalist or consumer interests, and many stakeholders  (including some council members we surveyed) believe that the  councils are not representative of all interests. In addition, some  stakeholders told us that they believe the composition of the advisory  committees, whose members are selected by the councils, is not always  adequately representative. Finally, when stakeholders bypass the  council process to get a DAP program approved, all interests may not be  included. For example, in some cases, stakeholders have taken DAP  proposals directly to the Congress for legislative approval rather than  using the council process. While some stakeholders expressed concern  that involving more people will increase the amount of time and effort  needed to make decisions, others noted that including all stakeholders\u2019  interests can help agencies avoid controversy once decisions are made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Stakeholder Participation Practices Are Not Based on a Strategic Approach", "paragraphs": ["According to participation experts and government officials, using a  strategic approach to participation that is based on core principles is the  second key element of an effective participation framework. Although the  specifics of a strategic approach to stakeholder participation should be  tailored to each situation, it should generally include identifying all key  stakeholders, defining specific participation goals, creating a participation  plan, implementing the plan, evaluating the results, and making  adjustments as necessary. (See fig. 2.)", "Identifying stakeholders involves systematically considering which internal  and external parties may be affected by or interested in a decision. In the  case of DAP decisions, for example, stakeholders may include a wide range  of interests, such as vessel owners, captains, and crew members;  processors; fishing-dependent communities; recreational fishermen;  environmentalists; federal and state fishery managers; consumers; and  members of the public. Once managers identify stakeholders, they should  then define specific goals for involving those stakeholders, such as having  stakeholders help design a solution to a particular problem or gaining their  support for agency decisions. The next step\u2014creating a participation  plan\u2014outlines the methods managers will use to involve stakeholders.  Once a plan is implemented, evaluating the results can help agencies  determine what is working\u2014and what is not\u2014and make adjustments as  necessary to improve participation. To increase the chances of success,  participation experts suggest that managers involve stakeholders in these  participation planning, execution, and evaluation efforts.", "Adhering to a set of core principles and using a strategic implementation  approach can enhance participation, which can benefit agencies and  stakeholders by increasing stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of fairness, helping  diffuse potentially controversial issues, minimizing overall costs and delays  in developing programs, and generally developing better decisions.  However, if participation efforts are not executed well, they can undermine  stakeholders\u2019 trust in the process and decrease the credibility of decisions.  To minimize this risk, participation experts told us that agency  commitment is key. This commitment can be exemplified by adopting a  formal stakeholder participation policy that expresses core principles, and  providing guidance and training on how to develop and use a strategic  approach to stakeholder participation. Such policies, guidance, and  training can help managers better understand what is expected of them  regarding stakeholder participation and help them strategically plan and  execute participation efforts.", "NMFS is not legally required to develop a formal policy on stakeholder  participation or provide the councils with guidance and training on how to  develop and implement a participation framework, and it has not done so.  Moreover, the councils themselves have not developed strategic  approaches that define their specific participation goals or include  participation plans, and therefore may be missing opportunities to make  stakeholder participation in the DAP process more effective. However,  without NMFS\u2019s leadership and commitment, it may be difficult for the  councils to enhance stakeholder participation in developing DAP  programs.", "Two federal government agencies\u2014the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014are recognized by  participation experts as leaders in establishing effective stakeholder  participation frameworks. Both agencies have (1) established policies that  define their core participation principles, such as fostering openness  between the agencies and their stakeholders, and (2) provided guidance to  program managers on using a strategic approach to stakeholder  participation. EPA\u2019s public involvement policy articulates participation  principles, such as ensuring that the public has timely, accessible, and  accurate information about EPA programs so that stakeholders have the  knowledge they need to participate. For example, EPA provides  information on its Web site for planning and conducting public involvement  activities. EPA also provides a participation strategy that directs agency  officials to take specific steps, such as planning and budgeting for public  involvement activities, systematically identifying stakeholders, and  evaluating public participation activities. Further, EPA provides guidance,  training, and resources to implement its policy. Similarly, DOE has  established participation principles, such as using open, ongoing, formal  and informal two-way communication between DOE and its stakeholders,  and provides guidance to managers on how to plan and implement effective  participation efforts. DOE also publishes evaluations of past efforts, which  managers can learn from as they devise strategies appropriate for their  specific situation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders and Participation Experts Suggested a Variety of Methods for Enhancing Stakeholder Participation", "paragraphs": ["According to stakeholders and participation experts, a variety of methods  are available that, depending on the situation, could enhance stakeholder  participation in developing DAP programs. These methods generally fall  into five categories: (1) providing education and outreach, (2) holding  meetings in different ways, (3) streamlining the DAP program development  process, (4) diversifying interests represented in the council process, and  (5) sharing decision-making authority. While strategic use of these methods  can result in more effective participation, they can also have disadvantages,  such as increased costs.", "Providing education and outreach. Stakeholders and participation experts  suggested several ways to conduct education and outreach activities that  encourage stakeholders to participate in the DAP program development  process and help give stakeholders the substantive and procedural  information they need to participate effectively. These approaches include  implementing formal training programs, conducting outreach activities in  locations likely to be affected by DAP programs, expanding council mailing  lists to include more stakeholders, making DAP program documents more  easily understandable to non-experts, and making greater use of  technology.", "Implement formal training programs. Stakeholders said that they  would like more training on fishery management and science. NMFS  currently offers two days of training to new council members on the  fishery management process and hopes to expand its efforts by  providing ongoing training on other fishery management issues.  Stakeholders identified the Marine Resource Education Project  (MREP), which is sponsored by a group of universities in New England,  as an example of a good training program. MREP provides stakeholders  with intensive training on fisheries management and science to help  them better understand the council process and DAP issues, teaches the  importance of being involved early and throughout the process, and  provides diverse stakeholders with the opportunity to exchange  information in informal settings. However, such training can be costly  and may reach relatively few stakeholders.", "Conduct outreach activities in locations likely to be affected by DAP  programs. Stakeholders said that they would like council members or  staff to meet with them in their communities, such as port towns or  communities likely to be affected by DAP programs, instead of making  participants travel to council meetings. While this method could  increase stakeholder understanding of complex issues (such as DAP  programs), bring more stakeholders into the process, and foster  interactive communication between stakeholders and decision makers,  it may also require a high level of council resources.", "Expand council mailing lists to include more stakeholders. Councils  could proactively expand their mailing lists, which currently are largely  composed of stakeholders who have attended meetings or who have  contacted the council and requested that their name be added. For  example, when people apply for fishing permits, permitting agencies  could request to add their contact information to the appropriate  council mailing list. While this method would make council-generated  information, including information on DAP program development,  available to more stakeholders, councils may still have difficulty  obtaining contact information for some stakeholders.", "Make DAP program documents more understandable. Stakeholders  suggested that councils simplify their documents or provide additional  documents for those with less technical backgrounds. One way to  simplify documents is to make them shorter. For example, the  regulations governing the creation of environmental impact statements  state that the text of even unusually complex documents should  normally be less than 300 pages. NMFS has recently issued draft  guidelines that encourage councils to create clear and concise  documentation that stakeholders can easily understand. Additionally,  councils could create short summary documents that explain key issues  in plain language. For example, the Pacific Council issues short fact  sheets on a variety of fishery management issues. Simplifying  documents would make information easier to understand; however, it  could require additional council resources.", "Make greater use of technology. Stakeholders have suggested making  greater use of technology, such as e-mail and Web sites, in providing  education and outreach on DAP issues. For example, EPA\u2019s Web site for  hazardous waste cleanup activities offers easy access to a range of  material, from introductory information explaining key issues to non- experts, to technical information for people with high levels of  expertise. Participation experts say that using such technology can  enhance communication of important information, give stakeholders a  more immediate sense of connection to the process, and reach more  people at a lower cost. However, some stakeholders may not use or have  access to the technology being used.", "Holding meetings in different ways. To increase meeting attendance and  allow for more informal, deliberative interaction, stakeholders suggested  holding meetings at different times or locations, broadcasting meetings,  holding informal discussions with stakeholders on DAP issues, and using  facilitators to run meetings.", "Hold meetings at different times or locations. Some stakeholders  requested that council meetings take place at more convenient times or  in locations that were easier to reach. For example, one advisory  committee member in the Gulf Council said that the committee  successfully increased attendance by scheduling meetings in ports at  times convenient to fishermen. While holding meetings at different  times or places would allow for additional input from those who might  not otherwise be able to attend, it may increase convenience for only  some stakeholders, while inconveniencing others.", "Broadcast meetings. Stakeholders and experts said that broadcasting  meetings using technology, such as the telephone, television, or the  Internet, could be one way to increase meeting attendance. For  example, during public hearings on developing the halibut and sablefish  IFQ program, the North Pacific Council used conference calls to  broadcast meetings, giving stakeholders in remote locations the  opportunity to learn about and provide input on IFQ program options.  While broadcasting meetings could increase meeting attendance, it may  not entirely replace the value of direct contact through face-to-face  meetings.", "Hold informal discussions with stakeholders on DAP issues.", "Stakeholders with whom we spoke requested opportunities for informal  discussions. Participation experts noted that this type of  communication is often key to ensuring stakeholder satisfaction with  involvement efforts, because such interactions can help break down  barriers between people and allow stakeholders to learn from one  another. There are several options for conducting such discussions. For  example, in 2003, NMFS held eight regional \u201cconstituent sessions\u201d to  gather the views of marine resources stakeholders on issues facing each  region\u2019s fisheries. While these sessions were not directly related to DAP  program development, NMFS officials said that they were valuable  because they provided the agency with a general sense of stakeholders\u2019  concerns. Another option is to sponsor informal interactions, such as  roundtable meetings, where agency officials and stakeholders can meet  and talk about issues of interest. A DOE official said that seating  officials among stakeholders in a roundtable setting has helped her  agency break down barriers between these two groups. Further, the  Pacific Council\u2019s state representatives hold open and informal meetings  with their constituents on days when the council is in session. Through  these meetings, council members make information readily available to  stakeholders and foster responsive, interactive communication. One  disadvantage of these meetings, though, is that they are accessible only  to people who are able to attend the council meeting.", "Use facilitators to run meetings. Participation experts and some  stakeholders suggested using neutral facilitators to run meetings.  According to participation experts, neutral facilitators can ensure that  issues are thoroughly explored and increase perceptions of fairness. For  example, EPA\u2019s National Environmental Justice Advisory Council  published a model plan for public participation in which providing a  skilled facilitator is a critical element. However, hiring a facilitator may  require additional expense.", "Streamlining the DAP program development process. Many laws govern  the fishery management process. Yet, according to stakeholders, how these  laws are applied often results in a costly and lengthy fishery management  process. To decrease the time and effort required to develop DAP programs  and other fishery management plans, NMFS has proposed adopting  administrative procedures to streamline the regulatory process, and some  stakeholders have suggested amending the Magnuson-Stevens Act to  incorporate elements of NEPA and then exempt the Magnuson-Stevens Act  from NEPA.", "Adopt administrative procedures to streamline the regulatory process.", "Stakeholders have suggested that NMFS streamline the process for  developing fishery management plans, such as DAP programs. This  effort is underway. NMFS issued revised draft guidelines in August 2005  for developing fishery management plans that, among other things,  integrate the many statutory requirements, such as NEPA, that govern  fisheries management. NMFS expects that these new guidelines will  increase the quality of their decisions, improve their ability to  successfully defend lawsuits, and decrease the overall time and effort  required to create a fishery management plan, such as a DAP program.  However, officials recognize that the new process will create additional  work for councils in the early stages of plan development.", "Amend the Magnuson-Stevens Act to incorporate NEPA requirements.", "Some stakeholders have suggested that the Magnuson-Stevens Act be  amended to include elements of NEPA and then exempt the Magnuson- Stevens Act from NEPA. While we recognize that the councils do not  have the authority to make these decisions, some stakeholders believe  that this option would remove duplicative effort and decrease the time  needed to develop DAP programs. However, others say that NEPA  requirements can benefit the decision-making process by providing key  analyses and participation opportunities not required by the Magnuson- Stevens Act, such as the requirements to use an early and open process  for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and to assess  different DAP program options before making a decision.", "Diversifying interests represented in the council process. Stakeholders and  participation experts suggested two methods for more fully including all  interests in the DAP program development process: diversifying interests  represented on the councils and their advisory committees, and helping  ensure that stakeholders have organized representation.", "Diversify interests represented on the councils and their advisory  committees. Stakeholders suggested that the councils and their advisory  committees should have more diverse membership. Methods for  diversifying the councils could include amending the Magnuson-Stevens  Act to require balanced representation from a wider set of stakeholders  beyond commercial and recreational fishery participants, and  nominating a wider array of stakeholders from each state to serve on the  councils. While we recognize that the councils do not have the authority  to make these decisions, stakeholders believed that diversifying  interests represented on the councils was important. Regarding  representation on advisory committees, stakeholders requested a more  participatory process for selecting committee members. For example, a  council could determine the interests it wishes to have represented and  then allow people representing those interests to select their own  committee representatives. While stakeholders may perceive this option  as being fairer, it may be difficult for groups to coordinate among  themselves to select a representative. Also, depending on the fishery, it  may be difficult to find people willing to serve on the advisory  committees. While diversifying interests can enhance participation,  such a change could increase the length of the decision-making process  and make it more difficult for councils to reach decisions.", "Help ensure that stakeholders have organized representation in the  DAP program development process. Stakeholders have noted that those  who are organized and have a designated representative who follows  the process and provides input to the council on their behalf are able to  participate more effectively in the DAP program development process.  Intensive training programs such as MREP may help stakeholders  organize. For example, a fisherman who attended MREP training said  that he used information he learned at MREP to form an organization to  represent his fishing gear type at New England Council proceedings.  While organizing can enhance participation, it may not be the role of the  councils or NMFS to help stakeholders organize.", "Sharing decision-making authority. To help respond to stakeholders\u2019  requests for more input into decision making, stakeholders suggested  holding a referendum and participation experts suggested using  collaborative or consensus-based decision making.", "Hold a referendum. A referendum is a means of submitting proposed  rules or laws to a direct vote. In the fishery management context,  holding a referendum allows a specified group of stakeholders to vote  on whether to develop a DAP program or whether to adopt a specific  DAP plan. For example, the Congress required NMFS to hold two  referenda among red snapper fishing license holders. In the first  referendum, a majority decided that the council should develop an IFQ  program for red snapper, and the second referendum will decide  whether to submit the IFQ plan to the Secretary of Commerce. NMFS  was required to identify and notify license holders, decide how to weight  votes among eligible participants, and then conduct the referendum.  While holding a referendum can provide some stakeholders with direct  decision-making power, it excludes those who are deemed ineligible to  vote. Further, decisions regarding the weight of each vote can create  controversy among eligible stakeholders. Also, a referendum can be  time-consuming to administer and may be useful only if stakeholders  are sufficiently informed about the issues.", "Use collaborative or consensus-based decision making. Participation  experts suggested the use of collaborative or consensus-based  approaches. These approaches allow stakeholders to fully explore  issues together, often with the help of a facilitator, by working toward  consensus rather than making majority-based decisions. EPA has used  this process with local government, industry, community, and  environmental interests to help develop new strategies for achieving  environmental protection.

The sector submitted a sector  allocation proposal consisting of an operations plan for the sector, a  contract signed by all sector participants indicating their agreement to  abide by the operations plan, and an environmental analysis to comply with  National Environmental Policy Act requirements. NMFS approved the  proposal and allocated quota to the sector. Sector members can, in turn,  allocate the fish among themselves in any way they choose. About 60  fishermen participated in the program in 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab Rationalization Program (2005)", "paragraphs": ["The Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area contains eight large crab  fisheries, the largest of which are the Bristol Bay red king crab, the Bering  Sea snow crab, and the Bering Sea Tanner crab fisheries. These fisheries  are subject to joint federal and state management with certain elements of  oversight, including monitoring, in-season management, and observer  coverage, deferred to the state of Alaska. Historically, the fisheries had  been managed using a guideline harvest level that set target catch limits. By  2002, six of the eight crab fisheries had experienced stock declines, which  resulted in a race for fish or, in some cases, closed fisheries. The race for  fish put pressure on participants to fish in unsafe weather conditions and  work for long periods without rest, resulting in a proportionately higher  number of fatalities than in other Alaskan commercial fisheries.", "To alleviate overcapacity and safety issues associated with the race for fish,  the Congress mandated that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council  analyze several different approaches to rationalization. The council  selected its preferred alternative, a \u201cthree-pie voluntary cooperative  program,\u201d and presented its analysis to the Congress in August 2002. The  program was subsequently mandated by the Consolidated Appropriations  Act of 2004 for NMFS approval by January 2005, and was effective as of  April 1, 2005. The program provides for allocations of harvesting shares to  harvesters, communities, and captains; processing shares to processors;  and landings and processing activity to designated regions to preserve their  historic interests in the fishery. The program also permits harvesters to  form voluntary cooperatives associated with one or more processors  holding processing shares. Because of the program\u2019s novelty, the council  included several safeguards in it, such as binding arbitration to resolve  price disputes, and extensive data collection and review to assess the  success of the rationalization program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on NOAA\u2019s written comments provided  by the Deputy Secretary of Commerce in a letter dated February 3, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
