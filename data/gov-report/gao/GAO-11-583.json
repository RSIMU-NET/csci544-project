The major activities of MAS's offices include: collection and dissemination of data on U.S. industry and trade, production of analyses on policies that can affect competitiveness, and identification and resolution of overseas trade barriers. While some activities may seem similar to those of other agencies, such as USTR, officials from MAS's client agencies stated that MAS's combination of industry and trade expertise is not readily available to them elsewhere in the government. MAS has undertaken an internal review to update its mission and priorities regarding activities and clients and has proposed changes currently under departmental review. MAS does not have a mechanism to systematically monitor analysts' workload or the amount of time spent on requests for different clients. The absence of workload data may hinder its ability to effectively allocate its resources to address the needs of the trade policy process. Further, MAS's role has not been clearly communicated, and ITA's Web site provides limited information about MAS. Consequently, the public and Congress have limited information about MAS's activities and contributions to policy making. MAS's ability to meet its performance targets largely depends on actions from other government agencies and other parties, making isolating its contributions difficult. MAS developed a series of steps, or milestones, to help isolate its contributions to trade policy outcomes, although officials acknowledged continuing challenges. Further, MAS does not systematically obtain feedback on its performance from the agencies to which it provides analysis, nor does it track its contributions to major policy decisions that fall outside its externally reported performance targets. This makes it difficult to assess the extent to which MAS's work adds value to the trade policy process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Commerce take actions, in concert with MAS, to finalize MAS's focusing of mission and priorities, systematically monitor workload, and more systematically obtain and communicate information on the value MAS adds to the trade policy process.

The report grew out of a 2003  review of the U.S. manufacturing sector initiated by former Secretary of  Commerce Donald Evans in response to \u201cunprecedented challenges\u201d  facing U.S. manufacturers. Commerce received input from industry  associations and large and small manufacturers from critical sectors, and  the report summarized manufacturers\u2019 concerns, which included the  government\u2019s limited focus on manufacturing and its ability to compete  globally.

The report called for the  creation of a better analytic basis for U.S. trade policies and negotiations.  It contained several specific actions, including ones targeting U.S.  manufacturers. For example, Congress expected the proposed MAS unit to  develop tools and expertise to assess industry trends and evaluate the  impact of trade agreements, and to identify and address challenges facing  manufacturers through an interdepartmental advisory committee.  Subsequent legislative and agency activity established the reorganization  proposed in the committee report and transferred functions and staff  across ITA business units, with one result being the reorganization of the  Trade Development unit into MAS.", "Congressional concerns leading to the reorganization of ITA stemmed, to a  large degree, from continuing trends in manufacturing and trade. Although  the United States remains the world\u2019s largest producer of manufactured  products, there have been steep declines in manufacturing employment as  measured by share of hours worked, and manufacturing\u2019s share of gross  domestic product (GDP) (see fig.1). Manufacturing employment fell from  about 28 percent of total U.S. employment in 1969 to about 10 percent in  2009. As a share of nominal GDP, the drop has been similar. However,  even with declines, almost 10 percent of the U.S. economy is in  manufacturing\u2014roughly 11 million workers.

USTR noted that MAS can play an important role in providing insight into  industry\u2019s concerns and potential reactions to policy changes. USTR  officials also commented that MAS provided useful information to them  during the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement negotiations.

Every year, each industry office develops an assessment of  the industry sectors it covers which, MAS guidance states, should present  an analysis of the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the industry  and an assessment of the industry\u2019s needs. Each office then uses these  industry assessments to develop business plans, which describe activities  the office plans to undertake during the year, and links business plan  activities to objectives, performance measures, and targets.

The plan linked this  activity to MAS\u2019s performance measure to identify the percentage of  industry-specific trade barriers that were removed or prevented.

The Committee is an interagency  panel authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a  U.S. business by a foreign person. The review is to determine the effect of  such transactions on the national security of the United States and is not  directly related to exports.

To better enable MAS to target its resources, ensure MAS has a way to  more systematically monitor how staff time is allocated across various  efforts. 3.  To improve transparency and ensure that priorities are consistent with  those of key stakeholders, explore methods for MAS to more clearly  communicate its mission, priorities, and activities to clients,  stakeholders, the public, and Congress. These methods could include,  among others, working with ITA leadership to develop a strategic plan  with associated time frames to improve ITA\u2019s web presence and  management. 4.  In order to ascertain whether MAS is meeting the needs of its  government clients involved in the trade policy process, explore ways  to more systematically obtain information on the value it is adding.

We reviewed the International Trade Administration\u2019s (ITA) strategic plan  and Web site to evaluate how the type of work MAS undertakes compares  to that conducted by the other ITA business units.
