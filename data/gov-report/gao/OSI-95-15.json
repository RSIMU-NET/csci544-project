The company must also meet the small business size standards established by SBA for the firm\u2019s industry as defined in the classification categories prescribed by the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual. SBA approves applicable SIC codes for participating firms. Participating 8(a) firms may have one or more SICs assigned to them by SBA. To be considered a small business and remain eligible for the program, participating firms must not have outgrown all their SBA-approved SIC codes. Size standards for each SIC code are generally defined by the firm\u2019s number of employees or its average annual gross sales.", "Under the program, SBA acts as a prime contractor, entering into contracts with other federal agencies and then subcontracting work to firms in the 8(a) program. Firms in the program are also eligible for financial, technical, and management assistance from SBA to aid their development. Participating firms can stay in the program for up to 9 years.", "The Small Business Act, as amended, and federal regulations define \u201csocially disadvantaged\u201d as those persons who have been subjected to racial, ethnic, or cultural bias because of their identities as members of groups, without regard to their individual qualities. Certain racial and ethnic groups such as Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Subcontinental Asian Americans, and Native Americans are presumed to be socially disadvantaged. However, individuals in groups not cited in the act, who can demonstrate that they are socially disadvantaged, may also be eligible. SBA regulations define \u201ceconomically disadvantaged\u201d as socially disadvantaged individuals who are unable to compete in the free enterprise system because their opportunities to obtain credit and capital have been more limited than those of others in similar businesses. Further, program applicants must demonstrate a personal net worth that does not exceed certain limits so as to meet and maintain the criteria for an economic disadvantage.", "Each 8(a) firm under SBA\u2019s regulations is subject to a program term of 9 years. However, SBA may also, under its regulations, \u201cgraduate\u201d an 8(a) firm prior to the expiration of its 9-year program term if that 8(a) firm substantially achieves the target objectives and goals set forth in its business plan.
