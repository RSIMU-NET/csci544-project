Due to high interest by Congress and the public regarding vehicle armor, GAO initiated this subsequent engagement to examine issues affecting the production and installation of armor for medium and heavy trucks. The objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which truck armor was produced and installed to meet identified requirements, (2) identify what factors affected the time to provide truck armor, and (3) identify what actions the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Army have taken to improve the timely availability of truck armor.

Completion of armor kit installation for tankers is expected by January 2007. Although the Army first identified a requirement for 3,780 truck armor kits for five types of trucks in November 2003, it did not produce all of the kits until February 2005 and did not install the kits to fully meet the requirement until May 2005--18 months after the initial requirement was identified. However, by that time, requirements had increased substantially. As subsequent requirements for an additional 7,847 kits, excluding tankers, were identified, the time lag to meet them lessened. A number of factors contributed to the time to provide truck armor kits to deployed troops, placing them at greater risk as they conducted wartime operations in vehicles not equipped with the preferred level of protection. For example, the Army missed a valuable opportunity to have substantial numbers of truck armor kits available for Operation Iraqi Freedom by not fully capitalizing on approved operational requirements established in 1996. In addition, production time lengthened because contracts were awarded for amounts less than total requirements due to increasing needs for truck armor and inadequate funding. As was the case for other critical wartime shortages that GAO previously examined, sufficient documentation was lacking to determine why funding was not available when needed, limiting effective oversight over funding decisions. Material shortages and limited tanker kit installation rates also impacted the availability of truck armor. DOD and the Army have taken a number of short-term actions, such as leveraging available funding, to improve truck armor availability during current operations. The Army is also developing a long-term armoring plan to improve the availability of truck armor for future operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When combat operations were declared over during Operation Iraqi  Freedom (OIF), U.S. and coalition forces transitioned to stabilization  operations to restore public order and infrastructure in Iraq.

During this situation there  have been numerous attacks on military convoys as they carry supplies and  equipment throughout the region.  The threat of IEDs, in particular, has  become increasingly frequent and has been ranked as the number one killer  of U.S. troops in Iraq. The explosives used in IEDs consist mainly of  dynamite, land mines, old artillery shells or other types of military  ordnances. Many IEDs are hidden and disguised along traffic routes and  are remotely detonated against unsuspecting military personnel.", "As a result of experiences in Iraq, the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the services have taken several immediate steps to improve the protection  of military forces operating in the region.

Among  the problems we observed were the unavailability of spare parts, hundreds  of backlogged shipments, and an inability to track shipments at the  distribution centers.  In April 2005, we reported on shortages of a number  of critical items during OIF, to include certain protective items such as  body armor and armored high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicles  (HMMWV).  We identified a number of systemic causes for these  shortages, including inaccurate requirements, delayed funding, and  ineffective distribution processes.

An official requirement for truck add-on  armor kits was identified and approved by the Army in 1996 to address  threats similar to what deployed forces are currently facing in Iraq.  On  January 19, 1996, the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)  issued an operational requirement document (ORD) for the tactical  wheeled vehicle crew protection kit. Generally, official requirements  documents lead to the development and production of new systems to  address the specified required capabilities.", "According to Army officials, the Army developed this ORD because  officials recognized that operations in Haiti, Rwanda, and Somalia exposed  troops to a civilian threat and led to concerns over countermine protection  for supply and troop transport vehicles. The crew protection kit was to  provide increased crew survivability in tactical wheeled vehicles against  small arms fire, artillery/mortar fire, mines, submunitions, and IEDs where  needed while operating throughout an area of operations.  The ORD  described the threat against U.S. forces usually consisting of small arms,  hand portable antitank weapons such as light antitank weapons and rocket  propelled grenades, and IEDs.  According to the document, tactical  wheeled vehicles at that time lacked armor protection to provide crew  survivability against these threats.  No existing ballistic protection systems  had met this requirement, with one exception of the Up-Armored Heavy  HMMWV.  According to the ORD, the kit\u2019s capabilities would enable all  units to provide ballistic protection to crews of tactical wheeled vehicles,  including most of the same types of trucks being armored today in the  Middle East.", "Once the ORD was approved, the Army Tank-Automotive Research,  Development and Engineering Center built prototype armor kits for the  HMMWV and 5-ton truck, and blast testing was also done at Fort A.P. Hill.", "The ORD specified a number of kits to be built and available to add on to  vehicles as operations dictated the need for them.  However, the Army  never fully addressed this requirement. The need for armor kits after  Somalia never materialized, and, according to Army officials, the ORD was  not completed because funding was not available to fully meet the 1996  requirement due to other higher funding priorities in the Army. According  to one Army official, given the amount of effort expended to develop and  approve the ORD, it is relatively uncommon for an ORD not to be funded  through production, especially when research and development funds had  been spent, prototypes developed, and blast testing performed.", "Even though the 1996 requirement was not fully addressed, a small number  of armor kits were produced around this time period for two types of  trucks, the HEMTT and the PLS, to support operations in Bosnia.  According to the Army\u2019s Project Manager, development of these kits was  initiated in response to an ONS from units deployed to Bosnia.  The ONS  was submitted prior to completion of the ORD.  However, these kits did not  meet all the protective requirements specified in the ORD, such as  providing blast protection.  The Bosnia kits were never installed on  vehicles and were placed into storage because the need for them was never  realized.", "The Army\u2019s November 2003 armor requirement, developed in response to  experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, addressed the same vehicles  confronting similar threats as those found in the January 1996 ORD. This  November 2003 requirement for the crew protection kit validated an  operational wartime need for add-on armor kits for light, medium, and  heavy tactical wheeled vehicles in support of OIF and OEF.  The  requirement cites the January 1996 ORD as providing the basis for add-on  armor and extends the requirement to continue identifying alternative  capabilities for development, testing, and procurement.  The November  2003 requirement noted that the armor kits are necessary to provide a  capability to protect against small arms fire, IEDs, mine blast protection,  and artillery fragmentation; and to minimize degradation of the vehicle  mission.  Army officials in theater modified the November 2003  requirement by changing the distribution of armor and prioritizing armor  needs; however, the amounts of armor kits required remained the same.  Table 3 shows the 1996 and 2003 requirements, as well as the most recent  armor requirements.", "Because not all the kits required under the 1996 ORD were developed, the  Army went into Iraq with less protective capability than it might otherwise  have done.  However, the Army\u2019s work done in support of the ORD and the  Bosnia kits laid a foundation to meet future truck armor requirements.  For  example, the limited number of kits developed for military operations in  Bosnia was pulled from storage and used in Iraq. Furthermore, according  to Army officials, the knowledge gained and the processes for design,  research, development, and testing of these kits, as well as the kits  themselves, were used to address and meet the need for armor during  current operations.  Based on these efforts, the Army\u2019s Project Manager for  truck armor in 2003 had knowledge of the concepts of designing and  building armor kits, the necessary materials in terms of weight and  protective capabilities, and system performance requirements and  technical specifications for ballistic protection.

Contractors tend to size their production  levels to the contract orders they have on hand.  Thus, larger contract  quantities generally mean increased production rates.  Larger up-front  contracts can affect a contractor\u2019s production capacity for a number of  reasons.  For example, according to one contractor producing armor kits  for all four of the Army\u2019s heavy trucks, ordering smaller quantities of armor  kits caused a lack of continuity for its supply base and fluctuations in kit  deliveries.  More specifically, the contractor experienced (1) a lack of  supplier commitment, which wavered with the uncertainty of future orders;  (2) fluctuations in its labor force; (3) constrained ability to make process  improvements to expedite production, such as the creation of specialized  tooling, due to a short-term focus of work; and (4) insufficient support for  investment and facility decisions that would have resulted in more efficient  production operations for the contractor and its supply base.", "In some cases, increases in requirements caused contracts to be awarded  in an intermittent fashion. In other cases, funding was not available to  award complete contract quantities to meet requirements at the time  requirements were identified. Although it is difficult to determine the exact  effects of intermittent contracting on the availability of armor kits, we  identified a number of specific cases where it lengthened the production  schedule.  For example, there were breaks in production for three different  types of truck kits (the FMTV, HEMTT, and HET) because the contractors  had completed their current contact orders and new orders were not  placed early enough to maintain continuous production.  In one of these  cases regarding an armor kit for the FMTV, the contractor received an  additional contract from the Army in December 2004 for 1,049 kits as it  neared completion of its current requirement of 771 kits.  Although the new  requirement for additional kits was validated by the Army in April 2004,  funding was not available to award the new contract until December 2004,  which was not early enough to overcome the required 15-week material  lead time.  As a result, production stopped and new production did not  resume until 2 months later.  According to the contractor, production could  have been maintained or even accelerated if the new contract had been  awarded in time to meet the long lead time item requirements.", "In the cases of the HEMTT and the HET armor kits, the production lines  stopped when the contractor completed the current contract quantities of  1,598 and 665 armor kits respectively.  The contractor did not receive  additional contract awards of 791 HEMTT kits and 131 HET kits until April  2005, or about a month after completion of the previous contract quantities  in March 2005.  By that time, production had already stopped, employees  and subcontractors were released, and equipment and facility space were  given up for other uses.  As a result, there was a two and a half month break  in production.  The reason the additional production quantities were not  awarded earlier was that validated requirements did not increase until  March 2005, which, according to Army Project Manager officials, was too  late to avoid a production stoppage.", "In another example of the impact of intermittent contract awards, the  initial armor kit production contract for the M915 was awarded in April  2004 for 250 kits, which was based on the validated Army requirement at  the time.  However, when subsequent contracts for 240 and 136 kits were  awarded in September and October 2004 respectively, due to increasing  Army requirements, the manufacturer, an Israeli subcontractor to the  primary contractor, did not have sufficient capacity to keep up with the  demand.  This was due, in part, to other commitments the manufacturer  already had for producing Marine Corps truck armor. As a result, the  production levels for M915 kits were lower than desired based on the new  requirements and remained so until July 2005 when the contractor was able  to transition production from the Israeli subcontractor to its own facilities  in the United States. According to contractor officials, if they had known in  the beginning that the total quantities needed by the Army would have been  as high as they were, they would have proceeded differently from the  outset, such as using a different manufacturer.", "In one instance, the quantities of contracts also adversely affected the costs  of armor kits.  Specifically, the first contract for the FMTV armor kits was  awarded in February 2004 for 270 kits.  Subsequently, in March 2004, a  second contract was placed for 501 kits.  According to the contractor, the  quantity in the initial contract was too low for the Army to receive the  highest price break, which was received for the second contract.  As a  result, the first 270 kits cost the Army over $1.7 million more than if the two  production quantities had been combined.

Army headquarters validated an operational wartime need  for kits in support of OIF and other CENTCOM operations, and approved  3,780 armor kits for medium and heavy tactical wheeled vehicles.

DOD  Comptroller officials further noted that although there was sufficient  funding available in the Iraqi Freedom Fund to fund all of the truck armor  requirements at the time they were initially identified by the Army, there  were other competing funding priorities that would have prevented DOD  from fully funding the entire truck armor requirement at once.  Examples  of these competing priorities include other force protection requirements  such as the procurement of up-armored HMMWVs and night vision  equipment, IED countermeasures, reimbursements to other coalition  forces for logistics support, operational costs associated with deploying a  Marine Expeditionary Force to Iraq, financing clearance of captured  munitions, and funding for various classified programs.", "In April 2005, we reported that insufficient and delayed funding also  contributed to critical wartime shortages of armored vehicle track shoes,  lithium batteries, and tires.

In addition, unique requirements to coat the tankers with a  protective chemical prior to installing armor panels also limited the  installation rate.  The primary component of the tanker armoring effort is a  self-sealing coating material that is sprayed onto the exterior of the fuel  tank.  When a small arms round penetrates the coating material and the fuel  tank, the hole self-seals and the fuel leak stops.  The proper application of  the chemical coating requires controlled environmental conditions, such as  humidity and temperature, which has led to a limited number of spray  locations accessible to the Army.

For example, it used funding designated for future armor  kit installations to buy long lead time materials and award some  contracts for armor kits until additional armor kit funding could be  made available.  In addition, when the Project Manager received funding  for armor kits from Army headquarters, it allocated the funding among  all the armor kit contracts to maintain sufficient work flow to keep all  production lines open, rather than fund some truck kits to the full level  of requirements.

Under the plan, add-on armor will consist of two kits,  one that includes hardware to be placed on the vehicle to receive the  armor, and another that contains the actual armor.  The plan also includes  provisions to facilitate the production and availability of armor.
