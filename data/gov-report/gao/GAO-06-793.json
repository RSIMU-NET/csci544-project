While the lists are primarily intended to inform U.S. export control decisions, they can also inform counterintelligence activities, research plans, and technology protection programs, making MCTL and DSTL fundamental resources for security decisions.

Validation of the updates--a critical check to ensure the lists are complete and accurate--also provides little assurance that the lists are of value. More than one-third of the reviewers acknowledged they do not have the technical expertise necessary to validate the updates, and one-quarter did not review the lists. The lists are also out of date. Although a stated program goal calls for all 20 sections of the lists to be completely updated at least every 4 years, about half of the sections on the MCTL--including technologies related to weapons, communications, and biological warfare--have not been updated for 10 years. The DSTL is also out of date; almost half of the sections have not been updated in the past 5 years. With the limited value of the MCTL and DSTL, agencies tend to rely on other information sources to inform export control and DOD policy decisions. According to DOD and Department of Commerce export control officials, the MCTL is too broad, difficult to use, and out of date to inform export control proposals or export licensing decisions. Concerned about the MCTL's accuracy and reliability, the Air Force instructed its personnel not to use the MCTL. The DSTL is also seldom used--in part because some DOD components were not aware of the list. For those components that were aware of the DSTL, some found it only marginally useful because it too is out of date. Several DOD components have developed their own efforts to track global technologies. For example, the Army established international technology centers dedicated to identifying international cooperative opportunities as well as to maintain knowledge of foreign research efforts to avoid technological surprises for the warfighter."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Technological advantage is fundamental to U.S. military dominance in  Technological advantage is fundamental to U.S. military dominance in  21st-century warfare.

Many DOD organizations  and other federal agencies have a need to know what is militarily critical  to assist in planning program activities related to technology and to help  inform decision making. Within DOD specifically, knowledge about  militarily critical technologies is needed for such activities as    consideration of anti-tamper protection of critical technologies on  defense systems,    counterproliferation programs and activities, and  research and development planning.", "Similarly, other federal agencies depend on DOD to identify militarily  critical technologies. For example, the Departments of Commerce and  State rely in part on DOD\u2019s input on what is militarily critical to inform  export control decisions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also needs  to be aware of DOD-identified critical technologies to determine which  technologies need protection from being acquired or exploited by foreign  intelligence collection efforts.", "In response to the Export Administration Act of 1979, which governs the  exports of items with both military and civilian applications, DOD  established the Militarily Critical Technologies Program in 1980 to  periodically identify and assess technologies that are critical to retaining  dominance for the warfighter. The Militarily Critical Technologies  Program produces a restricted and a public version of both the MCTL and  the DSTL. DOD has contracted with the Institute for Defense Analyses, a  federally funded research and development center, since the inception of  the program to furnish scientific and technical support in developing and  maintaining the lists. The MCTL covers technologies that are of concern in  the near term, while the DSTL covers those in the longer term. (See fig. 1  for comparison of the lists.) Program oversight is provided by DOD\u2019s  Office of International Technology Security. Over the past 5 years, DOD  has provided approximately $2 million annually to support the Militarily  Critical Technologies Program.", "The lists are divided into 20 technology sections (see fig. 2), and each  section is developed and updated by a technology working group led by a  chair and cochair and composed of experts. Each working group identifies  militarily critical technologies and the parameters at which they are  critical, based on definitions of what is militarily critical established by the  Export Administration Act. Each working group is responsible for one  MCTL and one DSTL section covering the same topic, such as aeronautics  technology. The Institute for Defense Analyses has established broad  guidance for the chairperson of the technology working groups to use  regarding the update process. This guidance in part indicates that working  groups should consist of experts from government, industry, and academia  and that they should reach consensus on what is critical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Updates of the MCTL and DSTL Produces Lists of Limited Value", "paragraphs": ["In updating the MCTL and DSTL, the technology working groups face  several challenges, including identifying and engaging experts in the  process and interpreting the definition of militarily critical.

First,  reviewers are unclear about how to validate proposed updates or what  factors to consider when reviewing proposed updates. For example, one  reviewer indicated that the purpose of the MCTL is to inform decisions on  technologies that may need to be export controlled, but was unsure  whether the review should validate that the technologies in proposed  updates need to be controlled or whether to ensure that parameters of  technologies listed are accurate. Reviewers stated that they are not  informed as to what is added, deleted, or otherwise changed from one  update to the next. Without instruction or information on the updates,  validation of the changes to the lists may be little more than a reviewer\u2019s  guess.

Eight reviewers stated they or their organizations lack the  necessary expertise to determine whether the lists were complete or  accurate. Program officials stated they do not currently have a process to  determine whether they have the proper reviewers or if these reviewers  are adequately validating proposed updates.", "Finally, program officials assume concurrence with the lists if reviewers  have not provided feedback within 30 days. According to program  officials, the process is working well because reviewers seldom provide  feedback or comments on proposed MCTL or DSTL updates. However,  one-quarter of the reviewers did not review the lists. Specifically, five  reviewers told us that they receive MCTL and DSTL updates but do not  comment on them.

The Institute for Defense Analyses produced  only one update of the MCTL in fiscal year 2004 and four updates in fiscal  year 2005 (see table 1).

Regardless, program  officials stated they are satisfied with how the process for updating the  lists is working and noted that the lists are available on the Web site for  public comment. In 2005, program officials held forums to obtain feedback  from list users and participants in the technology working groups about  the process for updating the lists. In response to user feedback expressing  concern about the process, program officials developed an action plan that  in part called for an independent assessment of the MCTL and DSTL  process for updating the lists, which was not completed.

Instead, the Defense Technology  Security Administration relies on other sources of information, including  technology-specific information from subject matter experts associated  with the Institute for Defense Analyses, who may also participate in MCTL  updates. According to Defense Technology Security Administration  officials, the MCTL is too broad, out of date, and difficult to navigate to be  an effective tool for informing export licensing decisions or export control  proposals.", "Officials from the key export control regulatory agencies agreed that the  MCTL lacks the specificity and currency needed for export control  decisions. These have been long-standing issues. In 1982, we reported that  the Departments of Commerce and State and private industry were  concerned that the MCTL was not specific enough to be useful as a  practical daily guide for export control decisions. Presently, Commerce  officials expressed additional concerns that because of delays in updating  sections of the MCTL, the list contains items that they have already  determined need not be controlled or limited. Further, the chair for the  Militarily Critical Technologies Program\u2019s electronics technical working  group acknowledged that microprocessors are included as militarily  critical on the MCTL at parameters no longer controlled on Commerce\u2019s  control list. Because of the lack of specificity and lack of currency,  Commerce officials told us that they do not use the MCTL to inform items  to control. Instead, they rely on the judgment of the Defense Technology  Security Administration.", "The military services also seldom use the MCTL when reviewing export  license applications. In 1996, the Air Force issued guidance instructing  personnel not to use the MCTL to inform export control and other  decisions. This guidance, which is still in effect today, specifically  prohibits the Air Force\u2019s export control specialists, intelligence analysts,  investigators, system security engineers, operations security officers, and  public affairs officers from using the MCTL to inform export decisions or  to determine the importance of military-related technologies. The  guidance further states that because the MCTL is out of date, its utility is  substantially limited and it may only serve as a desk reference or  dictionary to obtain a description of a particular dual-use technology.  While Navy officials responsible for export control decisions stated that  the MCTL occasionally serves as the starting point to inform decisions,  they rely on their own export licensing databases for export control  policy. In addition, a senior Navy official stated that even though extensive  time and effort go into the development and maintenance of the MCTL, the  list does not provide significant value. Navy officials also noted that the  MCTL is out of date and raised concerns regarding its accuracy. The Army  Director of Policy for Security Cooperation, Resources, and Exports  similarly stated the MCTL is inappropriate for being used to inform export  control decisions because the lists are too component- and material- focused and do not list specific systems.", "As with export control decisions, we found that the MCTL is seldom used  to inform various DOD policy decisions, including those related to  identifying and protecting critical technology on weapon systems,  counterintelligence efforts related to critical technologies, and programs  reporting on the protection of the defense industrial base. For example,  DOD officials stated that they do not directly use the MCTL to inform  decisions related to determining whether to use anti-tamper protections.  Yet the MCTL is intended to be a primary resource in DOD\u2019s process for  identifying critical technologies in defense systems that may require anti- tamper protections to discourage or delay reverse engineering. While  officials stated that the MCTL is a starting point to select critical  technologies for protection, the MCTL\u2019s limitations\u2014including the fact  that it is out of date and does not incorporate previously identified critical  technologies or anti-tamper decisions\u2014led the anti-tamper executive  agent to develop a more comprehensive tool for identifying and tracking  critical technologies that may need anti-tamper protection.", "The MCTL is intended to be used as a reference for counterintelligence  initiatives throughout the DOD intelligence community.  Counterintelligence program officials need to know what technologies are  critical and which ones are being targeted through foreign intelligence  collection activities. Some counterintelligence entities, including the  Defense Intelligence Agency and Army Counterintelligence, indicated that  the MCTL informs decisions about technologies that should be examined  to ensure that each military service protects them in a consistent manner,  but have found limitations in using the list. For example, officials from  Army Counterintelligence stated that the MCTL is not current enough to  inform decisions needed to help the military services consistently track  and protect their current technologies. Due to the difficulties in using the  MCTL, the Army has developed a program to identify technologies that are  critical to individual Army acquisition programs. Defense Intelligence  Agency officials stated that the taxonomy of the MCTL technology  categories is useful. However, officials have found that some MCTL  sections must be augmented with more current critical technology  information to help inform decisions. Outside of DOD counterintelligence  activities, Militarily Critical Technologies Program officials stated that  they are entering into an agreement with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to provide support to the bureau\u2019s critical national assets  program.", "The MCTL is also intended to inform decisions made by the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency committee  responsible for reviewing foreign acquisitions of U.S.-based companies to  determine whether the proposed acquisition could pose a threat to  national security. DOD, which is a member of the committee, provides  input through its Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Industrial Policy on decisions related to proposed transactions that may  involve technologies critical to DOD interests. According to a DOD official,  the MCTL is not used to inform these decisions. Instead, DOD relies on  input from technical experts in the Directorate for Defense Research and  Engineering, who may use the MCTL as one of their many sources of  information.", "In addition, DOD Industrial Policy officials have created a Defense  Industrial Base Capabilities Study Series, which in part identifies critical  technologies and companies that produce them to help inform DOD input  to Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States decisions as well  as other DOD policy decisions. The Defense Industrial Base Capabilities  Study Series was completed in June 2005 and lists over 1,400 critical  technologies. The study series notes that it includes examples of critical  technologies that the MCTL should consider incorporating.

Officials from the  Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and  Technology/Chief Scientist, who were aware of the existence of the DSTL,  stated that the DSTL is not useful for informing science and technology  decisions because it is overly broad, its taxonomy does not align with  Army Research and Technology taxonomy, and its assessments are rarely  in consonance with Army Research and Technology subject matter  experts.  Furthermore, the Army\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Research and Technology/Chief Scientist maintains sufficient in-house  expertise for all required program planning activities and does not require  the DSTL to complete mission requirements.

However, the Defense Technology Security Administration has developed  a \u201cTop Ten Technologies\u201d list that identifies emerging technologies.  According to Defense Technology Security Administration officials, the  Top Ten list is designed to help DOD identify paradigm-shifting  technologies on or approaching the horizon to provide a basis for defense  proposals on how these technologies should be controlled and to inform  decisions on how these technologies might benefit the military. In  addition, officials who represent the military services and DOD research  and development components have established more extensive efforts to  aid science planning and track developing and future technologies. For  example, both the Army and the Navy maintain offices and technology  centers worldwide to monitor and assess research efforts of foreign  governments and industries to both inform science and technology  planning and identify rapidly evolving or breakthrough technologies. Army  officials explained that the Army\u2019s science and technology research  activities, with a fiscal year 2005 annual budget of approximately   $1.7 billion, have more expertise to comprehensibly track all areas of  developing global technology than the Militarily Critical Technologies  Program, which has an average annual budget of $2 million.", "At the same time, the Directorate for Defense Research and Engineering  has developed a Global Technology Knowledge Base, which incorporates  the DSTL along with other information provided by the military services.  Like the DSTL, the Global Technology Knowledge Base is intended to  serve as a broad-based evaluation of foreign technology and an assessment  of foreign technology development efforts to assist in the planning of  DOD\u2019s science and technology efforts and offers insight into potential  collaboration opportunities with foreign entities or utilization of foreign  technologies.
