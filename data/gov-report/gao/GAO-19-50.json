For example, in September 2013, the Defense Health Agency was created, in part, to implement common clinical and business processes across the services. Essential to this effort are the services' ability to effectively staff their medical facilities, including the processes used for staffing dental clinics and the services' ability to recruit and retain military dentists.", "Senate Report 115-125 included a provision for GAO to review the services' processes for determining requirements for dentists and its programs for recruiting and retaining military dentists, among other things. GAO assessed the extent to which the services (1) use validated dental clinic staffing models that also incorporate cross-service staffing standards, and (2) have recruited and retained military dentists and measured the effectiveness of their recruitment and retention programs. GAO assessed service dental clinic models, analyzed recruitment and retention data from fiscal year 2012 through 2016, and interviewed DOD and service officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army and the Air Force use validated staffing models for their respective dental clinics, and the Navy has developed a model that is under review. The Army and the Air Force's models are based on service-specific staffing standards. For example, the Army's model generally projects dental clinic staffing based on historical facility data and, according to officials, the Air Force model is largely a population-based model that requires one dentist for every 650 servicemembers. In contrast, in the absence of a validated model, officials stated that, the Navy uses a general ratio of one dentist for every 1,000 servicemembers to staff its dental clinics. The Navy has developed a model that is under review, and if approved, according to officials, will be subject to the Navy's validation processes.", "While the services have developed and implemented cross-service staffing standards for 42 medical specialties, according to a key official involved in developing these standards, they currently do not plan to develop a similar set of standards for dental care. Cross-service staffing standards help the services standardize clinic staffing to address the common day-to-day health needs of patients. Service officials maintain that they must operate their respective dental clinics autonomously and in a manner that best supports their service-specific needs and unique command structures. However, as oral health requirements for servicemembers are standardized across the Department of Defense (DOD), it is unclear why dental care has been excluded from the staffing standardization effort\u2014especially because the services have implemented cross-service staffing standards for 42 other medical specialties.", "The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force meet their needs for military dentists by recruiting both dental students and fully qualified dentists. The services generally met their recruitment goals for dental students between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, but faced challenges recruiting and retaining fully qualified dentists during that period. For example, the Army missed its recruitment goals for fully qualified dentists in all 5 years, the Navy missed its goals in 2 out of 5 years, and the Air Force missed its goals in 3 out of 5 years. These challenges are most pronounced for certain specialties. For example, service data indicate that the Army and the Navy were unable to recruit any oral surgeons, while the Air Force recruited 50 percent of the oral surgeons it needed. Service officials cited various reasons for not meeting recruitment goals, including the availability of more lucrative careers in the private sector and quality of life concerns associated with military service.", "The services rely on various programs, including scholarships and special pay and incentives, to attract and retain military dentists, and service officials stated that they monitor their programs by reviewing their goals, among other actions. However, GAO found that some services continue to provide incentive bonuses for positions that are overstaffed and have met or exceeded recruitment goals, but they do not know whether this is necessary because they have not evaluated the effectiveness of their programs. Without evaluating their programs, the services lack the information necessary to ensure that they are using recruitment and retention incentives effectively and efficiently for attracting and retaining dentists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that each of the services develop cross-service staffing standards to be incorporated into their staffing models, and evaluate the effectiveness of their recruitment and retention programs.

Key to this  modernization is ensuring that the Military Health System has the right  number of medical providers, including dentists, with the requisite skill set  and competencies to staff its Military Treatment Facilities (MTF). Military  dentists practice across all major dental specialties with the primary  mission of ensuring the dental readiness of all active duty  servicemembers.", "According to a February 2015 U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services report, projected future nationwide shortages of dentists are  anticipated through 2025 as the demand for dental care in the United  States exceeds supply. Projected nationwide shortages of dentists  emphasize the importance for DOD to ensure its dental clinics are  adequately staffed and the services are able to recruit and retain certain  dental specialists. In 2010, we found that DOD\u2019s processes for  determining MTF personnel requirements could be improved, and we  made recommendations aimed at enhanced collaboration across the  services. Specifically, we recommended that by identifying shared  medical capabilities, the services would benefit from the development of  cross-service standards for determining the amount of personnel needed  to meet the day-to-day health needs of the patient population. We also  made recommendations aimed at ensuring the validity and verifiability of  their MTF staffing models. DOD generally concurred with these  recommendations and took actions to implement them. These  recommendations and DOD\u2019s actions are discussed in more detail in  subsequent sections of this report.", "Senate Report 115-125, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, included a provision for us to  review the services\u2019 processes for determining requirements for dentists  and DOD\u2019s programs for recruiting and retaining military dentists, among  other things. This report assesses the extent to which the services (1)  use validated dental clinic staffing models that also incorporate cross- service staffing standards, (2) have recruited and retained military  dentists, and are measuring the effectiveness of their recruitment and  retention programs.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed DOD, Army, Navy, and Air  Force policy and guidance for reviewing and validating workforce  models. We described the processes the services use for reviewing and  validating their dental clinic staffing models as it pertains to this guidance.  We interviewed officials with the Army Medical Command, the Navy  Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, and the Air Force Medical Service, as  well as officials from each service\u2019s dental corps and other service  organizations who are responsible for the development, operation, and  implementation of these models. We reviewed the models and  interviewed service officials to determine similarities and differences  within the methodologies used in the models and processes, and  assessed the extent to which the services collaborated in the  development of their models and based their models on common  standards.", "To address our second objective, we analyzed the extent to which the  services have met their recruitment goals for military dentists during fiscal  years 2012 through 2016, the most recent year for which data were  available at the time of our review. We assessed the reliability of these  data by obtaining and reviewing information from the services regarding  the processes and internal controls that are in place to ensure the  reliability and quality of the data. Based on our review, we believe these  data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Additionally,  we used data from DOD\u2019s Health Manpower and Personnel Data System  (HMPDS) and service-level data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to  assess the extent to which the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force (1) have  met authorized end-strengths for dentists, (2) are retaining dentists, and  (3) have gaps in dental specialties. We selected this timeframe to enable  us to evaluate trends over time, and fiscal year 2016 was the most recent  year of HMPDS and service-level data available at the time of our review.  We assessed the reliability of the HMPDS and service-level data by  collecting information and interviewing officials to determine how the  services and the Defense Manpower Data Center compile the data and  what internal controls are in place to ensure their reliability.

We also interviewed officials with the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs as well as  each service\u2019s dental corps regarding the programs used and the  measures in place to evaluate the effectiveness of any such programs.  We reviewed our prior work on effective strategic workforce planning,  which state agencies should periodically measure their progress toward  meeting human capital goals and the extent that human capital activities  contributed to achieving programmatic goals and provide information for  effective oversight by identifying performance shortfalls and appropriate  corrective actions.

AFHPSP dental students  can pursue either a Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental  Medicine degree to become a general dentist.", "In addition to the AFHPSP program, the services recruit fully qualified  licensed dentists. For example, individuals may become military dentists  through direct accessions, either by entering the service as a fully trained,  licensed dentist or through the Financial Assistance Program, which  provides stipends for dentists accepted or enrolled in a residency  program. For additional information on these and other recruitment  programs, see appendix I.", "Regardless of the recruitment program, dentists may begin to practice  after obtaining a degree and completing licensure requirements. Military  dentists may pursue postgraduate training through a general dentistry  program, such as the Advanced Education in General Dentistry Program,  a general practice residency, or a specialty dental program offered  through the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences  Postgraduate Dental College. Postgraduate dental college includes  training and/or residency within a specific specialty and typically requires  between 1 to 6 years of additional training. While in a postgraduate dental  college program, participants incur an additional 6 months of active duty  service obligation for each 6 months in training, with a minimum of 2  years active duty service obligation. However, this obligation can be  served concurrently with obligations already incurred through AFHPSP if  incurred through sponsored postgraduate education in a military or  affiliated program.

An Air Force official  acknowledged that not offering the bonus could result in their losing  potential applicants to the services that do offer the bonus, but Air Force  officials also recognized that money is not always a deciding factor for  those who choose to serve as a dentist in the military. The uncertainty  described by the Army and Air Force officials demonstrates their lack of  information about what factors motivate individuals to join the military.

While a bonus can be offered to any dental specialty  designated as a critically short wartime specialty, data that we analyzed  indicate that the bonus may be disproportionately effective in recruiting for  these specialties. For example, from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the  Navy used this type of bonus and was able to meet or exceeded its  recruitment goals for critically short wartime specialty general dentists and  staffed this specialty at between 108 and 122 percent. However, our  analysis of the Navy\u2019s data also found that, even after offering this bonus,  the Navy was unable to recruit any oral surgeons during the same time  period. However, like with the accession bonus, service officials do not  know the extent to which the CWSAB bonus is an effective recruitment  incentive for some or all of the critically short wartime specialties because  they have not evaluated the effectiveness of this program.", "In addition, the services offer special pay and incentives, which vary by  specialty, to qualified dentists. Special pay and incentives include  incentive pay, retention bonuses, and board certification pay. Each bonus  and incentive, except board certification pay, requires an additional  service obligation, thus creating a retention tool for the services. The  services and officials from the Office of the ASD(HA) participate in the  Health Professions Incentives Working Group to review recruitment and  retention special pay and incentives and recommends adjustment to  amounts offered as necessary. Service and officials from the Office of the  ASD(HA) told us that there are no ways to evaluate the effectiveness of  these incentives because they cannot account for the emotional or non- monetary decisions that contribute to whether servicemembers stay in the  military, and money is not always an effective incentive for getting people  to train in certain specialties or to continue their service. However, in our  recent review of DOD\u2019s special pay and incentive programs in 2017, we  recommended that DOD take steps to improve the effectiveness of its  special pay and incentive programs. Additionally, in February 2018,  through our review of gaps in DOD\u2019s physician specialties, we  recommended that the services develop targeted and coordinated  strategies to alleviate military physician gaps. An official from the Office  of the ASD(HA) stated that they have started discussing measures with  the services to evaluate the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s medical and dental  recruitment and retention programs, including special pay and incentives.  Additionally, Office of ASD(HA) and service officials stated that they will  begin reviewing the dental special pays and incentives in fiscal year 2019.  Because these reviews are in the early stages, it is too soon to know how  effective they will be in evaluating pay and incentive programs.", "Although service officials also told us that they believe their recruitment  and retention programs are effective because they have generally met  their overall recruiting and retention goals, until the services evaluate the  effectiveness of their recruitment and retention efforts, they will not have  the information to know which programs are the most efficient and cost- effective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD continues to implement several major initiatives to support the  mission of its health system maintaining the medical readiness of  servicemembers while operating as efficiently as possible. The dental  corps plays a critical role in these efforts by ensuring the oral health and  dental readiness of all servicemembers. Ensuring dental readiness  requires, in part, that the services are able to staff dentists adequately  and consistently across DOD\u2019s dental clinics. However, the Army, the  Navy, and the Air Force have not collaborated in their approaches to  staffing dental clinics, and have not developed cross-service staffing  standards for dental clinic staffing. As DOD progresses in its efforts to  implement efficiencies across its Medical Health System and assesses  the scope of medical care to be transferred to the Defense Health  Agency, it could be of benefit to the dental corps to develop cross-service  standards that could result in improvements to the consistency and  efficiency of dental clinic staffing.", "In addition to ensuring the appropriate number of dentists at each clinic to  support the dental corps\u2019 mission, recruiting and retaining fully qualified  dentists has been an ongoing challenge for the services. However, the  services have not evaluated whether their existing programs have been  effective at helping them recruit and retain dentists, and therefore do not  know whether they are effectively targeting their resources to address the  most significant recruitment and retention challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of six recommendations, including two to the Army,  two to the Navy, and two to the Air Force.
