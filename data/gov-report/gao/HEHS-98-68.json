Along with substantial active duty force and infrastructure reductions, medical personnel strength has decreased by 15 percent, and one-third of all military hospitals have been closed. Further, the 1980s doubling of military health costs and increasing beneficiary concerns about care access in military hospitals led the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish its nationwide managed care program, called TRICARE. But further facility downsizing and access priority changes under TRICARE have continued to fuel beneficiary concern, especially among persons living far from military facilities and senior retirees who are ineligible for TRICARE and have the lowest priority for military facility care. And TRICARE\u2019s cost effectiveness, not yet proven, has increasingly come into question.", "We have reported and testified frequently on TRICARE\u2019s implementation, including TRICARE contracting and resource sharing program problems and retirees\u2019 health benefit shortfalls and the pros and cons of proposed alternatives (see list of related GAO products at the end of this report). We have recently reported on providers\u2019 participation in TRICARE and their concerns about existing payment mechanisms as well as TRICARE\u2019s beneficiary feedback systems.", "In response to many concerns about TRICARE, members of the Congress, beneficiary groups, and others have proposed such measures as authorizing Medicare payments to expand TRICARE eligibility for senior retirees and extending to certain beneficiaries coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), a health insurance program that offers a wide array of health plans to federal employees. At your request, we reviewed nine bills introduced in the 105th Congress to authorize FEHBP for military beneficiaries. Six of the bills would authorize immediate nationwide access to FEHBP for either all Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries (H.R. 76, H.R. 1456, H.R. 2128, and S. 224) or Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries and certain other nonactive duty beneficiaries (H.R. 1356 and H.R. 1631). Three other bills (H.R. 1766, H.R. 2100, and S. 1334) propose testing the approach to better determine government costs and beneficiary interest before deciding whether to implement the option nationwide.", "Specifically, you asked us to (1) review issues that cut across the various bills, such as potential effects on beneficiary costs, eligibility, and the military health system (MHS) generally, and (2) profile and comment on the bills\u2019 key features, highlighting their similarities and differences (see app. I). In doing our work, we interviewed representatives of DOD; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), FEHBP\u2019s administrator; and military beneficiary organizations. We also worked closely with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) staff on our estimates of the bills\u2019 effects on beneficiaries and the MHS, as well as on their estimates of certain bills\u2019 overall costs and related enrollment figures, which CBO has reported on separately.

In 1997, approximately 9 million beneficiaries participated in 374 FEHBP plans nationwide at a cost of approximately $16.3 billion\u2014$12.1 billion paid by the government and $4.2 billion by enrollees. In comparison, DOD provided care to about 6.3 million beneficiaries in fiscal year 1997 at a total cost of approximately $15.6 billion, which also includes its costs for medical readiness and training, military deployments, veterinary services, and occupational health. See appendix III for a historical comparison of DOD and FEHBP beneficiary numbers and program costs.", "The federal share of the FEHBP premium is about 72 percent, not to exceed 75 percent of any plan\u2019s premium. The types of FEHBP plans\u2014HMOs, managed fee-for-service plans, and plans offering a point of service product\u2014are similar to TRICARE\u2019s three options. And although not all plans are available in all localities, each type is. FEHBP enrollees, depending on where they live, can choose from between 10 and 30 plans, including such fee-for-service plans as Blue Cross and Blue Shield and such health maintenance organizations as Kaiser Permanente. More than 85 percent of federal employees participate in FEHBP. To differing degrees, all FEHBP plans cover inpatient and outpatient care, prescription drugs, and mental health services, and many cover some dental care expenses. They also have limits on catastrophic out-of-pocket costs in the case of expensive health care problems. For Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, many FEHBP plans operate as a \u201cwraparound\u201d policy to Medicare, giving retirees comprehensive coverage with no or small copayments and deductibles."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Crosscutting FEHBP Bill Issues", "paragraphs": ["Along with the bills\u2019 individual price-tags, several other key issues cut across them to extend FEHBP coverage to military beneficiaries. The issues include (1) who would be eligible and, among those, how many might be attracted to FEHBP and might choose to enroll; (2) how premiums would be set and what the cost-sharing arrangement would be; (3) whether FEHBP enrollees would be prohibited from also using military health care; and (4) whether the FEHBP option should be tested before deciding on nationwide implementation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defining Eligibility and Projecting Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["Each FEHBP option\u2019s first consideration, tempered by overall cost considerations, is who would receive the benefit. Many of the bills would provide eligibility only for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries aged 65 and older\u2014approximately 1.3 million retirees, dependents, and survivors.The Military Coalition, an alliance of beneficiary associations including The Retired Officers\u2019 Association and the National Military Family Association, favors this approach as responding to the immediate needs of persons with declining direct care system access and as a way to reduce the option\u2019s price tag. Other bills would extend FEHBP eligibility beyond Medicare-eligibles to certain other military beneficiaries. The maximum number of eligible beneficiaries under the bills studied would range from an estimated 50,000, under the most limited demonstration bills, to almost 3 million, under the bill with the broadest eligibility definition.", "Projecting FEHBP enrollment under the various options requires making assumptions about beneficiaries\u2019 behavior, including their coverage choices, cost consciousness, and risk aversion. Many TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries have care alternatives that they may find more attractive than FEHBP. For those who are most concerned with cost and are eligible for TRICARE Prime, Prime would likely be more attractive, because most FEHBP plans would cost more than TRICARE Prime\u2019s enrollment fee. For example, FEHBP\u2019s lowest-cost HMO is Foundation Health, available in South Florida, at $279 per year for a single enrollee and $787 per year for a family. This compares with Prime, which has no annual fee for active duty singles or families and a fee of $230 for single retirees or $460 for retiree families. And Prime\u2019s guarantee of priority access to free care in military facilities may be more attractive to many who live near facilities than FEHBP\u2019s plan choices. Alternatively, a beneficiary could participate in TRICARE Standard or Extra for no annual fee and make use of available free care and prescriptions at a nearby military facility. In contrast, FEHBP\u2019s lowest-cost nationwide fee-for-service plan, Mail Handlers Standard, costs $1,030 for family coverage, and the lowest-cost point-of-service plan, United HealthCare Puerto Rico, is $1,019 per year. These plans, like TRICARE Standard and Extra, may require beneficiaries to meet an annual deductible and may charge copayments typically ranging from 20 to 30 percent of care costs.", "Also, persons with private insurance coverage may find their costs lower than those under FEHBP\u2014many large employers pay a greater plan premium share than the government\u2019s 72 percent of FEHBP premiums. However, the benefits covered under some private plans may not be as generous as FEHBP, and some studies have indicated a decline in employer coverage of retiree health benefits. Finally, for beneficiaries generally dissatisfied with their access to care or choices under TRICARE or private plans, FEHBP\u2019s wide array of choices would likely be more attractive.", "FEHBP would likely be more attractive and beneficial to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, who also may have alternative health care choices but find them less comprehensive and more costly than FEHBP. FEHBP\u2019s advantages for senior beneficiaries include prescription drug coverage and catastrophic limits on out-of-pocket costs: Medicare covers neither. And on the basis of FEHBP\u2019s current federal employee cost-sharing provisions, senior retirees could pay lower premiums for more coverage than they would under private Medigap policies that they purchase to supplement Medicare\u2019s coverage. For example, in 1997 an enrollee\u2019s share of the premium for the five largest plans in FEHBP with comprehensive coverage, including prescriptions and some dental coverage, ranged from about $370 to $1,750, compared with Medigap plans, which have premiums ranging from $750 to almost $3,000 but offer no dental benefits and limit prescription coverage to 50 percent of drug costs, after payment of a $250 deductible. Medigap plans also have maximum benefit limits on prescriptions ranging from $1,250 to $3,000.", "Further, for retirees with both Medicare part A (hospital) and part B (physician and laboratory services and outpatient care) coverage, most FEHBP fee-for-service plans operate as a \u201cwraparound\u201d policy to Medicare, providing comprehensive coverage and waiving most copayments and deductibles. For those who have Medicare part A but who have not purchased part B, FEHBP plans generally do not waive the copayments and deductibles but provide the same coverage as for non-Medicare enrollees.", "Alternatively, many Medicare-eligible beneficiaries can now join an HMO or other health care plan under the expanded Medicare+Choice program. Approximately 50 percent of Medicare-eligible military retirees live in a county in which 10 percent or more Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare HMOs, indicating that they have access to at least one Medicare HMO. Many such plans offer coverage comparable to FEHBP HMOs, including prescription drugs, vision care, and even dental care at low or zero premiums. A significant unknown is the extent to which these plans\u2019 growing availability might affect beneficiaries\u2019 decisions to enroll in FEHBP. Further, those who already have health care insurance paid in full or in part by their current employer\u2014about 17 percent of older retirees\u2014might not elect FEHBP if it cost more than their current coverage. Also, some number of senior retirees will have guaranteed access to DOD health care by enrolling in the recently authorized Medicare subvention demonstration. Finally, those with high risk tolerance, in good health, and living near large military facilities may forgo FEHBP and continue taking their chances in gaining access to free space-available care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bill Cost-Sharing and Premium Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Premium-setting and cost-sharing provisions also differ under the bills and would likely affect beneficiaries\u2019 decisions about participating in FEHBP. OPM, which administers FEHBP, would set the premiums for plans that participate in the military FEHBP option separately from the federal groups\u2019 premiums. According to OPM, if a sizable group were added to FEHBP, it would be appropriate to keep those enrollees separate from the federal participants, called a risk pool. A separate risk pool\u2014required under all but two of the bills (H.R. 1631 and H.R. 2100)\u2014would protect federal participants from large changes in premiums because of a military population that may have different health care usage and cost patterns.", "Most of the bills stipulate separate risk pools until a cost and health care use pattern similar to that of civilian FEHBP enrollees has been established and until merging with the federal civilian pool can be safely done. Thus, military beneficiaries\u2019 premiums could be different from those under the federal civilian program. OPM officials told us that they could not prospectively estimate military enrollees\u2019 potential premiums without a final plan and detailed data on military beneficiaries\u2019 historical health care use patterns. However, because not all military beneficiaries get their care from DOD, this historical use data may not be available. Despite past studies showing higher health care use by military beneficiaries than the civilian population, OPM believes that the initial military premiums would not be markedly different from the federal pool and that future use by military FEHBP enrollees, because of the premium and copayment effects on usage patterns, would approximate that of the federal pool.", "The bills\u2019 provisions for sharing premium costs between DOD and enrollees also differ. Under some bills, the enrollee premium amount for military beneficiaries would be the same as for federal civilians enrolled in the same FEHBP plans, with DOD contributing the remainder, up to the total premium. Under this arrangement, DOD\u2019s\u2014and thus the government\u2019s\u2014share of the premium could be greater than the 72 percent the government now pays on average toward civilian FEHBP premiums and more in total dollars if, under separate risk pools, the military premiums are higher than civilian premiums.", "Other bills could move the cost burden to beneficiaries by limiting DOD\u2019s share to what is now paid on civilian FEHBP enrollees\u2019 behalf. Thus, should the military program\u2019s premiums be higher than in the federal civilian plan, beneficiaries would likely pay more than civilian enrollees. Another bill\u2019s premium-sharing arrangement would have the total premium set at civilian FEHBP levels and allow DOD to determine its premium share. Under this arrangement, DOD could set different shares for different beneficiary groups such as families of enlisted personnel and officers or active duty families and retirees and their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Concurrent Use of FEHBP and Military Health Care", "paragraphs": ["Another key issue is whether military FEHBP participants would also be allowed to continue using military facilities on a space-available basis or enroll in TRICARE or both. In commenting on past proposals similar to the bills, OPM has stated that military enrollees should be clearly committed to FEHBP and that it should be their exclusive vehicle for health care coverage. Also, OPM officials told us that military beneficiaries who enroll in FEHBP should, if they disenroll, be prevented from reenrolling in FEHBP. Disenrollment is allowed under each of the bills, and most bills propose that FEHBP cancellation be irrevocable. Nonetheless, all but three would allow concurrent DOD and FEHBP care use.", "Current law allows eligible military beneficiaries access to space-available military facility care and TRICARE civilian care, regardless of other insurance coverage. Also, military retirees who are now active or retired federal employees and are FEHBP enrollees have both benefits\u2014although neither OPM nor DOD has analyzed how much they use either care source. Such dual use and the lack of a total enrolled population have exacerbated the MHS\u2019s recurring problems with respect to estimating and budgeting for care use and containing costs. DOD estimates that about two-thirds of eligible beneficiaries who are not active duty members rely on the DOD system, although the numbers of those who partially use the system along with other benefits is likely much larger.", "Should concurrent DOD and FEHBP use be allowed, the government would in effect be providing affected beneficiaries with coverage that is duplicative and unnecessarily costly. If beneficiaries were required to elect either FEHBP or DOD care, such benefit redundancy and associated costs could be guarded against. Precedent for such a requirement already exists in DOD\u2019s Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities (USTF) managed care program, under which enrollees agree to receive all their care from that program and forgo DOD care and Medicare.", "Allowing concurrent FEHBP and DOD care use also has DOD sizing and readiness implications. Should many current DOD care users switch to FEHBP, prohibiting concurrent use would allow DOD to downsize or close additional military facilities to help fund FEHBP costs. As it is, DOD\u2019s $15.6 billion annual MHS appropriation is not sufficient to fund care for all DOD-eligible beneficiaries; it will fund only those now using the system. Therefore, should FEHBP attract beneficiaries not now using DOD, then system downsizing may not be feasible and the added costs could be significant.", "Should concurrent use be allowed, however, some revenue could be generated by DOD\u2019s collecting third-party payments from FEHBP plans. FEHBP plans are now permitted to reimburse MTFs that provide care to dually eligible beneficiaries. In such cases, the FEHBP plan is the primary insurer. In contrast, when a Medicare-eligible beneficiary is also enrolled in FEHBP, Medicare is usually the primary payer and the FEHBP plan is the secondary payer. Because MTFs are currently prohibited by law from billing Medicare (except under the Medicare subvention demonstration), revenue from Medicare-eligibles enrolled in FEHBP plans would be less than that from younger beneficiaries. Also, DOD facilities are usually not part of FEHBP HMOs\u2019 provider networks and thus would likely receive reimbursement only for providing emergency care to DOD eligibles enrolled in those plans. Moreover, should large numbers of DOD beneficiaries enroll in FEHBP and reduce their DOD care use without consequent direct care downsizing, DOD might need to seek out FEHBP enrollees who are also DOD beneficiaries in order to maintain facility use levels and might need to continue to aggressively seek FEHBP plan reimbursement to help offset its overall costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefit Equity", "paragraphs": ["In creating the TRICARE Prime benefit, members of the Congress and DOD sought reduced out-of-pocket costs for all beneficiaries, including an enrollment fee of zero for active duty members and their families and low fees for retirees and their dependents.

Active duty members and their families pay no annual fees or deductibles, while retirees annually pay $230 per individual or $460 per family.", "Most of the bills we reviewed would structure the FEHBP option such that military enrollees would pay the same dollar amount as similarly situated federal enrollees\u2014that is, no payment differential would be made based on grade or position. Currently, civilian enrollees in FEHBP plans pay the same amount per plan regardless of their grade or position. Other bills would authorize DOD to determine the premium share that it would pay, thus enabling it, should it choose, to structure premiums so that they account for enrollees\u2019 beneficiary category, such as is done in TRICARE.The premium amounts charged to military beneficiaries would likely have significant effects on how many chose to enroll in FEHBP.

Health care use and choices tend to be relatively local and, thus, a test with too few localities and types of health care options could have results that would not be replicated across the country. However, limiting enrollment and sites would allow the test to be appropriately isolated, would allow its results to be compared with control sites, and would otherwise allow it to be properly studied.", "The demonstration\u2019s evaluation would be critical to determining whether to authorize more widespread use of the program.

This would be extremely difficult because of the wide range of reimbursement methods across plans, because plans guard this information as proprietary, and because OPM does not maintain records on this type of information. Further, if current rates are bringing about desired care access and quality outcomes, then increasing them to coincide with the highest FEHBP rates becomes cost-ineffective.", "Eligibility under this bill\u2019s provisions would also be likely to extend to few active duty dependents or younger retirees, because the required benefit change would mean that no TRICARE-eligible beneficiary would have a benefit level less than Blue Cross and Blue Shield high option.

Also, TRICARE Prime availability is expanding and is now available in 90 percent of the zip codes in many regions, and new contracts require coverage wherever active duty members live.

Thus, a 65-year-old beneficiary who does not enroll and chooses to do so at age 70 faces a monthly premium 50-percent higher than the normal premium. According to a recent DOD survey, approximately 10 percent of military retirees aged 65 and older do not have Medicare part B. FEHBP participation does not require that Medicare-eligible beneficiaries be enrolled in part B, and neither does this bill. However, because each fee-for-service FEHBP plan waives its hospital and medical deductibles and copayment for members enrolled in part A and part B, if beneficiaries do have part B and choose such a plan as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, they would have nearly 100-percent coverage.

The total FEHBP premium charges are the same as in the civilian federal program. Beneficiaries\u2019 premium charges are based on the contribution made by DOD. The bill does not require DOD to contribute a particular amount toward the FEHBP plan but allows the Secretary of Defense to determine the amount of DOD\u2019s contribution.", "Comparatively, this bill offers the least restrictive eligibility, and it would be phased in over 3 years.

The bills set forth that the sites should be (1) an area that includes one or more military medical facilities and contains fewer than 25,000 eligible beneficiaries and (2) an area that does not include any military medical facility but contains fewer than 25,000 who are eligible. Enrollees do not need Medicare part B coverage, but the bills require that enrollees with such coverage retain it throughout the demonstration. A separate risk pool would be established, and DOD\u2019s premium share could not exceed that paid for a civilian FEHBP enrollee in the same plan. Therefore, if their total premiums were higher, military enrollees might pay more for FEHBP plans than civilians. Those who disenrolled from FEHBP could not reenroll during the demonstration. These bills also require annual DOD and OPM studies to address participation rates, beneficiary and government costs, and a cost comparison with other care alternatives.", "Limiting enrollment under these demonstration bills limits the government\u2019s cost and provides some evidence of military beneficiaries\u2019 interest in the program. But using only two test sites might limit the usefulness for predicting the effects of nationwide implementation. Because Medicare and FEHBP choices vary widely in different areas of the country and because military facilities also differ markedly, it would be difficult to select sites from among those meeting the bills\u2019 proposed criteria where results would be representative of the country as a whole. Only the San Diego Naval Hospital, California, and MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, catchment areas and six noncatchment areas\u2014northern and southern California, eastern Florida, eastern Texas, and the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania\u2014have more than 25,000 Medicare-eligible beneficiaries.
