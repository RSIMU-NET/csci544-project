These include product sales, advertising, market research, and the commercial use of personal data about students (such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers) by schools. To update information about commercial activities in schools, Congress asked us to answer the following questions: (1) Since 2000, what statutes and regulations have states enacted and proposed to govern commercial activities in schools? (2) To what extent have districts developed policies implementing amended provisions of the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) in the No Child Left Behind Act on the use of student data for commercial purposes? (3) What guidance has the Department of Education (Education) disseminated? To answer these questions, we researched state laws, surveyed a national sample of school districts, analyzed policies provided by districts, interviewed officials at Education, and examined its guidance.

Of the states establishing new laws, 6 established laws affecting market research by addressing the use of student data for commercial activities. Almost all of the proposed bills target the sale of food and beverages. Prior to 2000, 28 states established laws addressing commercial activities, particularly product sales and advertising. At that time, only 1 state passed a provision affecting market research. PPRA provisions required districts to implement policies on the collection, disclosure, or use of student data for marketing and selling purposes, and we estimate that about two-thirds of the districts in the nation believe they are developing or have developed such policies. However, of the 61 districts that sent us policies, only 19 policies addressed these issues. No district reported having collected student data for commercial purposes. Only a few reported disclosing student information for these purposes, and all had done so for school-related purposes such as graduation pictures. Education has undertaken several activities, such as sending guidance to state education agencies and school district superintendents and posting information on its Web page, to inform districts about the student information provisions of PPRA, but many districts appear not to understand the new requirements. Some districts told us that they relied on their state school boards association to develop policies for them because state school boards associations address federal and state laws. School districts in one state sent us policies that addressed commercial activities that had been developed by their state school boards association. Education was not required to disseminate guidance to associations of local school boards in each state and has not done so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, public schools and businesses have been forging  new types of relationships to help each other achieve their educational  and business-related goals. In some of these relationships, business\u2019  apparent focus is on improving teaching and learning, but in others, the  apparent focus is on developing product loyalty and increasing sales. In  recent years, Congress and the public at large have become increasingly  interested in the mixing of school activities with commercial enterprise.  Some parties have wanted to limit such relationships by restricting  product sales, advertising, market research, and the commercial use of  personal data about students (such as names, addresses, and telephone  numbers) by schools. However, others have promoted business  relationships with schools as a desirable and necessary way to generate  additional funding and resources for students.", "We first reported on product sales, direct and indirect advertising, and  market research in schools in 2000. At that time, we found state laws and  district school board policies governing commercial activities were not  comprehensive, and in most states, local school officials were responsible  for making decisions about commercial activities. In addition, we found  that the visibility and profitability of commercial activities varied widely  and the high schools we visited had more commercial activities than the  middle or elementary schools.", "Since then, some changes related to these commercial activities have  occurred. Schools are facing even greater needs for funds; the use of the  Internet as a marketing tool has expanded; and through the No Child Left  Behind Act (NCLBA) of 2001, Congress has legislated new protections  regarding the collection, disclosure, and use of student data for marketing  or selling purposes. For decades, federal law has safeguarded the release  of student education records and has allowed parents some control over  the use of information about their children. For example, federal law has  prohibited districts from releasing students\u2019 Social Security numbers  without parental approval. However, NCLBA established new safeguards  about the use of student data for marketing or selling purposes.  Specifically, NCLBA amended the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment  (PPRA) of 1994 addressing pupil privacy by requiring school districts to  develop a policy on the collection, disclosure, and use of personal data  about students for commercial purposes that includes requirements for  parental notification and permission. Finally, there has been growing  concern about childhood obesity and whether the sale of beverages and  food outside those offered by school breakfast and lunch programs might  contribute to this problem.", "In view of these developments, you asked us to examine efforts by states  to regulate a broad range of commercial activities in public schools and  determine how districts have followed through with the PPRA provisions  about the collection, disclosure, or use of student data for marketing and  selling purposes. We conducted research to answer the following  questions: (1) Since 2000, what statutes and regulations have states  enacted to govern commercial activities in schools and what proposed  legislation are states considering? (2) To what extent have districts  developed policies implementing the PPRA provisions in NCLBA on the  use of student data for commercial purposes? (3) What is the Department  of Education (Education) doing to help districts implement the new  provisions on the use of student data for commercial purposes?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed state laws and regulations in all  50 states and Washington, D.C., as of May 2004. Also, we reviewed  proposed legislation that had been introduced between January 1, 2003,  and February 2004 to obtain a snapshot description of possible future state  legislative activities. We conducted a national sample survey of school  districts to determine if their policies were consistent with the PPRA  provisions on the use of student data for commercial activities and asked  them to report on any activities in which they engaged that used student  data for commercial purposes. We obtained an 87 percent weighted  response rate. We also asked superintendents in the districts we surveyed  to send us copies of their policies that govern activities involving the use  of student information for marketing and selling purposes. We evaluated  the extent to which these policies implemented PPRA requirements by  examining whether they covered the collection, disclosure, and use of  student data for commercial purposes. To discern changes in commercial  activities in the seven school districts we visited in 2000, we interviewed  district and school officials in those districts by telephone. We had  selected these seven districts, located in California, Michigan, and New  Mexico, to illustrate a range of commercial activities in states identified as  having legal frameworks generally supportive of such activities as well as  a range of geographic, economic, and demographic characteristics.  Finally, we interviewed officials at Education and examined its guidance  and initiatives on PPRA\u2019s commercial provisions.

Although this report synthesizes statutes,  regulations, and proposed legislation addressing all four categories, our  discussions of school district policies and Education\u2019s activities focus on  the fourth category, market research, because of the amendments made by  NCLBA that place requirements on districts that deal with the collection,  disclosure, and use of student data for marketing and selling. (See table 1.)", "In recent years, the growth of the Internet has had a large impact on  commercial activities, particularly market research, by enabling marketers  to elicit aggregated and personally identifiable information directly from  large numbers of students. For example, some Web filtering systems used  in schools that block student access to certain Web sites also allow the  company that maintains that software to measure and analyze how  children use the Internet by tracking which Web sites they visit and how  long they stay there. Although this information is aggregated and does not  identify particular children, this information, especially when used with  demographic data, can help businesses develop advertising plans that  target particular audiences if districts allow the installation of the  software. Also, Web sites directly elicit the participation of students in  market research panels by offering them cash or prizes in exchange for  information about themselves and their preferences. This makes it  possible for companies to engage large-scale customized panels of  students to test out marketing strategies and provide data to develop  product lines and product loyalty without relying on schools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NCLBA Amends Statutory Safeguards on the Use of Student Data for Marketing and Selling Purposes", "paragraphs": ["NCLBA addresses some concerns about commercial activities and student  data by amending and expanding certain student data safeguards that  were established in PPRA.

Districts are also required to directly notify  parents of these policies and provide parents an opportunity to opt their  child out of participation in such activities. Furthermore, districts are  required to notify parents of specific activities involving the collection,  disclosure, and use of student information for marketing or selling  purposes and to provide parents with an opportunity to review the  collection instruments. PPRA did not contain deadlines for districts to  develop policies.

In addition, many states have not enacted legislation concerning  commercial activities or have passed the authority to regulate these  activities to local districts, thus allowing district school boards,  superintendents, or principals to determine the nature and extent of  commercial activities at the local level. Not only do commercial  activities\uf8e7product sales, direct advertising, indirect advertising, and  market research\uf8e7encompass a broad spectrum of activities, but also the  levels of these activities and the levels of controversy attached to them  vary substantially. For example, few would equate selling advertisements  for a high school football program with selling the naming rights to a  school, although both are examples of direct advertising. Because of these  differences, as well as philosophical differences among districts and  communities, it is probably not surprising that states legislatures have  taken various approaches toward the regulation of commercial activities.", "Perhaps because providing student information for commercial purposes  may have serious implications, few districts do so. In fact, some school  officials said they were skeptical that schools would allow the use of  student data for this purpose. In the past, marketers may have approached  schools to survey students about commercial products or services. Today,  however, technology, particularly the proliferation and availability of the  Internet, provides marketers with quick and inexpensive access to very  large numbers of children without involving the cooperation of schools. As  Internet users, children often submit information about themselves and  their personal product preferences in exchange for cash or prizes. Because  of the disinclination of school officials to sell student data and the ability  of marketers to get data directly from students without involving schools,  it may be understandable that relatively few districts as yet have actually  adopted policies that specifically address the selling and marketing  provisions of PPRA. On the other hand, few would argue against the need  to protect students\u2019 personal information. Many businesses, particularly  local businesses catering to youth markets, might still profit from  acquiring student information from schools. Although we found districts  did not use student data for purposes generally viewed as offensive, this  does not mean such use would not happen in the future in the absence of  safeguards.", "It appears that some superintendents may not be aware of the new PPRA  requirements or have not understood Education\u2019s guidance because many  thought their district\u2019s policies reflected the latest federal requirements on  use of student data when, in fact, they did not. Also, several districts told  us that they relied on state school boards associations to develop policies.

We were also  concerned that there could be an underreporting of commercial activities  because our question did not specify the activities (\u201cDuring school year  2003-2004, did your LEA, or any school in your LEA, engage or plan to  engage in one or more activity regarding the collection, disclosure, or use  of student information for the purposes of marketing or selling or  providing the information to others for these purposes?\u201d) and because  very few schools reported using student information for commercial  purposes. Further, our pretesting indicated a potential problem with  respondents suggesting they would be hesitant to report commercial  activities. Moreover, because 86 percent of our respondents answered \u201cno\u201d  to question 2, a higher rate than expected, there was some question in our  minds whether our respondents who answered no had really considered  all the possible ways in which student information could be used for  commercial purposes when formulating their answers.", "We attempted to verify the answers to our question about commercial  practices by telephoning 36 districts, the 20 districts that reported using  student data for commercial purposes, and the 16 randomly selected  districts from among the districts that reported not using student data for  commercial purposes. Three of the 20 districts originally reporting the use  of student data were found not to be using the data for commercial  purposes because they were supplying the data to military organizations  or for scholarships, allowed uses. For the 16 sampled districts reporting  not using students\u2019 data for commercial purposes, we asked the  superintendent or other knowledgeable person in the district detailed  questions about 20 possible commercial activities. We asked whether the  school provides student addresses or phone numbers for specific activities  (student pictures, letter jackets, any types of school uniforms, yearbooks,  class rings, tuxedo rentals for prom, corsages for prom, musical  instrument rentals, caps and gowns for commencement, preparation for  Scholastic Aptitude Test or other tests, any other type of tutoring,  transportation for school field trips, or travel for other trips such as spring  break or ski trips), or to outside organizations for students to serve on an  Internet or study panel, answer questionnaires, test or try out a product, or  receive mailings from or talk with representatives of outside organizations  who are selling services or products. One of these 16 districts was found to  be using the data for commercial purposes in connection with  photographers for school pictures. As a result of these telephone calls, we  corrected the three incorrect records but did not make further  adjustments for districts that were not contacted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of District Policies", "paragraphs": ["We attempted to verify the answers about the development of policies by  examining policies that were voluntarily submitted by districts in our  sample. Sixty-one districts complied with our request to submit a copy of  their policy. We analyzed these policies to determine if they specifically  referred to marketing or commercial activities. We found 11 districts  submitted policies that addressed these provisions and an additional 8  submitted policies that partially addressed the provisions in that they  prohibited the release of student data for commercial purposes but did not  address the collection or use of such data. Therefore, our questionnaire  gathered relevant data about districts\u2019 perceptions of the extent to which  they thought they were implementing the provision, rather than the extent  to which these policies actually did so. This probably reflects confusion in  interpreting the provision or lack of awareness of its existence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contacts at Education", "paragraphs": ["We interviewed officials at Education\u2019s Family Policy Compliance Office  and the Office of the General Counsel.
