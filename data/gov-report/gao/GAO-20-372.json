Four CDC centers perform modeling.", "HHS agencies reported using multiple mechanisms to coordinate modeling efforts across agencies, but they do not routinely monitor, evaluate, or report on the extent and success of coordination. Consequently, they risk missing opportunities to identify and address modeling challenges\u2014such as communicating clearly, and obtaining adequate data and resources\u2014before and during an outbreak. As a result, agencies may be limiting their ability to identify improvements in those and other areas. Further, there is potential for overlap and duplication of cross-agency modeling efforts, which could lead to inefficiencies.", "CDC and ASPR generally developed and assessed their models in accordance with four steps GAO identified as commonly-recognized modeling practices: (1) communication between modeler and decision maker, (2) model description, (3) verification, and (4) validation. However, for four of the 10 models reviewed, CDC did not provide all details needed to reproduce model results, a key step that lets other scientists confirm those results.

Notable outbreaks include  novel coronavirus beginning in 2019, Zika virus disease (Zika) in 2015,  Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in 2014, and H1N1 pandemic influenza in  2009. Disease outbreaks can cause catastrophic harm to the United  States, disrupt economic and social systems, and kill, sicken, and  traumatize people on a massive scale. For example, approximately 1  billion people worldwide get sick annually from zoonotic pathogens\u2014 pathogens that can spread from animals to humans\u2014of which,  approximately 15 million people die. Such outbreaks are on the rise. The  latest example is the novel coronavirus disease which had, as of May 6,  2020, caused approximately 250,000 deaths worldwide and sickened  approximately 3,600,000 people. In the United States, the virus had  caused approximately 63,000 deaths, and sickened approximately  1,200,000 people. The situation has heightened U.S. attention to potential  future infectious disease threats and raised questions about the nation\u2019s  preparedness and response capabilities. It has also raised concerns among some members of Congress about how federal agencies predict  the spread of emerging infectious diseases, in particular through the use  of modeling.", "A model is a simplified representation of reality expressed through  mathematical or logical relationships. Modeling is widely used in fields as  diverse as engineering, finance, meteorology, and wildlife management.  In public health, infectious disease modeling can help decision makers by  predicting the social and economic effects of an intervention and  informing spending for preparedness and response, among other things.  It can answer public health questions that other methods cannot, whether  for practical, ethical, or financial reasons. However, because models  simplify reality, they may give misleading answers if the underlying data  or assumptions are flawed or not fully understood by decision makers.  Further, some real-world systems can be difficult to model because of  their inherent complexity, scale, or randomness. For these and other  reasons, researchers must carefully design, interpret, and communicate  the results of models that may be used to support public health decisions.  Understanding where and when infectious disease outbreaks may occur  can provide information\u2014in near real time\u2014to decision makers who help  set disease control policies and allocate resources.", "You asked us to examine how federal agencies have used models to  inform decision-making in recent infectious disease outbreaks, and the  limitations and challenges in developing and using models.

In the  cases of Zika, Ebola, and pandemic influenza, CDC and ASPR are two  key agencies that conduct federal infectious disease modeling efforts. As  of February 2020, ASPR had a centralized modeling unit staffed by about  nine people, who are a mix of federal and contract employees, according  to ASPR officials. At CDC, however, modeling is decentralized and  integrated into the individual centers that make up the agency. Some  staff work full time on modeling, while others spend part of their time on  other tasks. In addition, some of CDC\u2019s modeling efforts are conducted  externally. According to CDC, approximately 70 staff members  participated in modeling studies, as of October 2018. Of those staff,  CDC\u2019s Health Economics and Modeling Unit employed about 10  modelers who have worked on Ebola and other diseases. For Zika, CDC  officials responding to Zika said most modeling work was done by one  modeler in CDC\u2019s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, a part of the  National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. CDC  influenza officials said influenza modeling is conducted by six or seven  members of CDC\u2019s Influenza Division. Agency infectious disease  modeling activities are not limited to Ebola, Zika, or pandemic influenza.", "Agency efforts to protect the nation from disasters and emergencies can  be organized into two elements: preparedness and response. Infectious  disease modeling is one tool used to inform a wide range of decisions  related to outbreak preparedness and in response to an outbreak. In the  context of infectious disease outbreaks, ASPR and CDC perform work on  preparedness and response. For example, ASPR leads the Public Health  Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE), an  interagency group that helps develop medical countermeasures\u2014FDA- regulated products including drugs, or devices that may be used in the  event of a potential public health emergency to protect the public from  harm. CDC may activate its EOC to assist with the response during an  outbreak. For example, during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola  outbreak, CDC activated its EOC in July 2014 to help coordinate  activities.

Some of these diseases\u2014including Ebola and Zika\u2014are  zoonotic pathogens, meaning they spread from animals to humans.

Ebola symptoms include fever, muscle pain, vomiting,  diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver functioning, and, in some cases,  internal and external bleeding. There have been five Ebola outbreaks  since 2014, including the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak which caused  more than 28,600 cases and 11,325 deaths.

Many infected people do not have  symptoms or will only experience mild symptoms. The Zika outbreak that  began in 2015 affected individuals infected with the virus in ways that had  not been seen with previous outbreaks of the disease. Specifically, during  the 2015-2016 outbreak, Zika infection in pregnant women was linked to  microcephaly and other severe brain defects, according to CDC. CDC  officials said this was the first time in more than 50 years that an  infectious pathogen has been identified as the cause of birth defects. Zika  was also linked to other problems, such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and  Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an uncommon disorder affecting the nervous  system. In the Western Hemisphere, the first cases of locally- transmitted Zika were confirmed in Brazil in May 2015. In December  2015, locally-transmitted Zika was reported in Puerto Rico. On January  22, 2016, CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to respond to  outbreaks of Zika occurring in the Americas and to increased reports of  birth defects and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in areas affected by Zika.

This new virus contained a  combination of influenza genes not previously identified in animals or  people. The virus was very different from other H1N1 viruses circulating  at the time, so seasonal influenza vaccines offered little cross-protection  against infection with the new H1N1 virus, according to CDC. A vaccine  against the new virus was produced, but it was not available in large  quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illnesses during the  second wave in the United States. CDC activated its EOC on April 22,  2009, to manage the H1N1 response.

A model is a physical, mathematical, or logical representation  of a system, phenomenon, or process that allows a researcher to  investigate that system, phenomenon, or process in a controlled way. For  example, the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered or \u201cSIR\u201d model  divides a population into three categories: 1) susceptible to the disease,  S; 2) infected and infectious, I; and 3) recovered or removed from the  infected or susceptible population, R. This model uses equations to  determine how many people move between these three categories. The  equations contain parameters\u2014numerical descriptors of the disease  based, for example, on experiment, expert opinion, or statistics of an  ongoing or past outbreak. The equations allow the researcher to estimate  how many people are or could be affected by the disease. For example,  for past Ebola outbreaks, models estimated that after 40 days, about 44  percent of the population in close contact with infected individuals was  susceptible to infection, 31 percent was infected, and 22 percent was  recovered. Based on these parameters, equations for transfer between  categories, and underlying demographics of the community, an  epidemiologist could use the model to estimate how many people within a  given town could be susceptible, infected, or removed from the categories  of susceptible or infected (due to death or recovery and immunity).  Based on model estimates and if a vaccine was available, CDC officials  said the decision maker could plan for a specific number of vaccine kits  and additional medical staff and supplies to treat infected patients.", "Models can also help agency officials anticipate future outbreaks, forecast  the spread or severity of a disease, and predict the effects and costs of  different intervention options. After an outbreak, models can help sort out  what happened, what drove the outbreak, and how it compared to past  outbreaks. Other tools are available to accomplish some of these tasks,  but models are particularly useful when existing data are not sufficient to  answer a given question, or when agencies need to integrate data from  disparate sources.", "Infectious disease models can be put into two broad categories:", "Statistical models. This type of model identifies relationships or  patterns that can be used to describe what is occurring or predicts  what may occur in the future based on what has occurred in the past.  Statistical models tend to use a large amount of data, such as past  observed events, to forecast future events, such as disease  occurrence, but do not require a fundamental understanding of  biological processes or human behavior. They can predict outcomes  when causes are not known or understood and when scientific  understanding of a disease is limited. They tend to use large amounts  of data on past events to forecast future events. Statistical models do  not provide full explanations about an infectious disease but may be  used when epidemiologists have all or most of the data needed to test  a hypothesis. Several benefits can be derived from statistical  modeling, including the ability to control for multiple factors that might  impact the outcome reviewed, and the ability to isolate the potential  effect of infectious disease factors on a particular outcome.", "Mechanistic models. Mechanistic models rely heavily on scientific  evidence and theory related to infectious diseases, and the  understanding of disease dynamics or human behavior from prior  knowledge\u2014such as biological processes or interactions between  people\u2014to represent known processes. They use basic infectious  disease science to inform public health guidance and provide insights  into outbreak emergence, spread, and control. For example,  population-based models can simulate the course of an epidemic by  dividing the population into different categories, such as susceptible,  infected, and recovered. Mechanistic models can project the likely  course of disease transmission, calculate and predict the effect of  proposed interventions, and take into account variable conditions,  such as human behavior.", "Both statistical and mechanistic models can range from simpler to more  complex. A simpler model may, for example, have fewer parameters  (inputs) or equations than a more complex model. According to CDC  modelers and an expert, a simpler model may be run with a variety of  software, ranging from spreadsheet software to more sophisticated  software, whereas more complex models are usually run using  sophisticated statistical or mathematical programming languages. As a  model becomes more complex, it can become harder to describe,  recreate, and understand its internal functioning.", "Modeling is identified as a beneficial tool in various national plans for  disease response and biodefense.

CDC and ASPR officials told us, and documents show, that  modeling is one source of information that may inform such decisions,  along with sources such as expert opinion, surveillance, other prior work  on the disease, and an official\u2019s own knowledge.", "CDC modelers and officials said there is no \u201crule\u201d as to when to use  models, and in some situations, it may not be considered useful. For  example, CDC did not use modeling when issuing a travel notice for an  Ebola outbreak in specific provinces in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo, officials said. Instead, CDC based the travel order on an analysis  that considered disease incidence and prevalence, public health  infrastructure, and the availability of therapeutics, among other things.  Similarly, CDC officials responding to Ebola said modeling may be  undesirable when it would take too long to engage the necessary external  subject matter experts or when modeling would detract from responding  to a disease.", "CDC and ASPR modelers use models for a variety of purposes. CDC  officials said modeling is done differently for each disease, and the  amount and type of modeling varies across CDC centers, in part because  some centers have less capacity to conduct modeling than others.  According to a CDC internal report, the most frequent uses of infectious  disease modeling at CDC are: guiding preparedness and response efforts;  conducting economic analyses to evaluate the benefits of public  health actions, thereby reducing illness and deaths from infectious  diseases; understanding pathogen biology, disease transmission, and  estimating disease burden; and assessing the effect of interventions and prevention strategies.", "ASPR modelers and officials said models have provided information  about topics such as:  resources, including protective equipment, needed to help respond to  an Ebola outbreak;  the number of therapeutics and vaccine doses needed to respond to  Ebola, both in Africa and domestically; expected U.S. demand for Zika diagnostics; and  the number of vaccine doses needed to mitigate the spread of  pandemic influenza.", "ASPR modelers and officials said modelers tend to serve in a broad role  that can include modeling, data analysis, or other tasks. For example,  officials said a modeler could provide a team with day-to-day analytic  support and not necessarily spend time developing models or use them.  Additionally, ASPR maintains a Visualization Hub that can be used for  outbreak planning and response, including outbreaks of pandemic  influenza and other emerging infectious diseases (see fig. 2).", "CDC and ASPR modelers and officials said they generally initiate  modeling in response to questions from decision makers. The modelers  then work closely with epidemiologists and other subject matter experts to  answer the questions. Modeling, according to CDC officials, may be used  by individuals or groups within centers, such as division directors,  branches, or teams to influence decisions. Who answers a particular  question depends, according to ASPR modelers and officials, on the  decision maker. Sometimes questions asked will not be within their  mission\u2014modelers may suggest such questions be sent to a more  relevant agency or part of HHS. CDC and ASPR have modeled to answer  a variety of public health questions relevant to Ebola, Zika, and pandemic  influenza, and, at times, the results helped inform policy and planning  decisions. Modelers and officials provided the following examples:", "Planning: ASPR modelers and officials said the bulk of the agency\u2019s  modeling is related to the planning, development, and deployment of  medical countermeasures. For example, these modelers and officials  said many clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics were planned  during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak response. As a part of these  planning activities, ASPR modelers said modelers developed  forecasts of future trajectories of disease incidence under a variety of  conditions. These forecasts indicated a significant likelihood the  disease incidence in Sierra Leone could decrease to a level that  would significantly reduce the success of the trials, according to  modelers. Additionally, at the beginning of the 2014-2016 Ebola  outbreak response, CDC modelers received modeling questions  related to the resources needed to effectively limit the spread of the  disease, according to CDC documentation. CDC used models to  predict the number of Ebola cases that could be expected over time  with and without disease interventions such as Ebola treatment units,  community care centers, and safe burials. On the basis of this  information and other factors, including a United Nations document on  Ebola needs, CDC leadership and other U.S. government officials  recommended a rapid increase in Ebola response aid, according to  CDC documentation. According to CDC documentation, later  analyses demonstrated that this increase helped to greatly reduce the  actual number of cases, compared to the likely number if prompt  action had not been taken. Additionally, in response to the H7N9  influenza outbreak in 2017, ASPR modeled to determine when doses  of influenza vaccine should be delivered and how many doses should  be administered in order to mitigate a domestic outbreak. This model  found that having a vaccine stockpile could be helpful in preventing  disease and that a slow effort to administer an H7N9 vaccine could  reduce the vaccine\u2019s usefulness.", "Policy: During the Zika outbreak, CDC modelers and officials said  they modeled to determine the potential effectiveness of using  pesticides to remove insects from aircraft, trains, or ships. According  to modelers and agency officials, the issue arose as concern about  Zika virus grew, including from other countries and U.S. agencies, like  the Department of Transportation and Department of Defense. The  model indicated that humans are more likely than insects to transport  Zika on airplanes, and officials therefore concluded that the use of  pesticides on airplanes would not be an effective intervention.  According to CDC modelers and officials, this modeling resulted in an  additional sentence being added to World Health Organization policy,  which stated that pesticide use was not expected to be effective.", "The extent of modeling conducted for Ebola, Zika, and pandemic  influenza varied according to the question being asked, along with other  factors as follows:", "Type of question: CDC and ASPR have used models to answer  such questions as who should be prioritized for vaccination or  treatment, how transmissible a disease is, and how effective certain  interventions are likely to be, according to modelers and agency  officials. For example, ASPR modelers and officials said they modeled  to help estimate the resources needed to respond to an Ebola  outbreak; the number of therapeutics and vaccine doses needed to  respond to Ebola, both in Africa and the U.S; and the expected U.S.  demand for Zika diagnostics. One ASPR official said that, during the  2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, modeling questions were used to  provide decision makers with information on what might happen in a  given situation. For example, models were used to provide information  related to decisions on early vaccine distribution and how this  intervention could affect the potential mortality rate.", "Time to model: How soon decision makers needed information also  influenced the extent to which CDC and ASPR modeled. For example,  if decision makers needed an answer in a week, modelers would  inform the decision makers about how much of the answer they could  provide within that time frame, ASPR modelers said. Similarly, CDC  modelers and officials said that, in one instance, modelers had only  12 hours to provide decision makers with information. Even estimating  the time needed to develop and conduct modeling could represent an  additional challenge, according to CDC modelers responding to Zika.  According to a CDC article on modeling to inform responses to novel  influenza viruses, the amount of time required to develop and execute  a model can vary from less than a week to more than a month.  Agency officials concurred with these time frames.", "Personnel and data availability: The availability of qualified  personnel was also a factor that affected how much modeling  agencies conducted for the selected diseases. For example, CDC  modelers and officials said the agency\u2019s Division of Vector-Borne  Diseases has focused its resources in other areas, such as building  the capacity of states to address vector-borne diseases, and therefore  had not invested in individuals with the right skill sets to conduct  modeling for the Zika outbreak response. As a result, the division  had to call on the three or four CDC modelers from outside of the  division who were available to assist with the Zika outbreak response,  which limited the amount of modeling that could be performed. Data  challenges can also limit the types of modeling conducted. For  example, when modeling for Zika, ASPR modelers said they used  available information, but data quality and availability limited their  ability to model. More data typically become available as an outbreak  progresses, but models may be most helpful at the beginning of an  outbreak when critical decisions need to be made (see fig. 3).", "CDC and ASPR do not keep a list of all modeling conducted, and we  therefore cannot quantify the extent of their efforts in terms of a number of  models. ASPR modelers and officials said modeling is typically one small  aspect of the way the agency carries out its mission. One ASPR official  said models are never the sole source of information for decision-making.", "According to NIH officials, NIH does not conduct or fund internal modeling  for decision-making purposes. NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center has  conducted self-initiated, internal modeling to answer questions generated  from research, and from ideas from Center-held workshops. Two NIH  institutes\u2014the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u2014along with NIH\u2019s  Fogarty International Center have awarded grants for external modeling  research for our selected diseases.

While modeling can help determine the amount of particular  resources needed during an infectious disease outbreak, CDC modelers  and officials said it is not central to their resource allocation planning. For  example, CDC modelers and officials noted that while a model could  inform a decision maker about how many diagnostic testing supplies  would be needed based on the range of predicted cases, this would be  one input among many into the decision. Decision makers would also  consider whether there are other diagnostic test supplies for similar  diseases that could be used, the extent of laboratory testing capacity, or  the longevity of those supplies.", "Models can be used to help plan for the cost of interventions by  determining the numbers or types of interventions that can be used during  a response to an infectious disease outbreak, according to CDC modelers  and officials. It can also help decision makers recognize gaps in their  ability to implement resource allocation decisions, according to CDC  officials. For example, CDC leadership described how modeling input  requirements spurred analysis of the factors limiting hospitals\u2019 use of  ventilators during a pandemic influenza outbreak. This work, according  to CDC officials, helped determine the number of ventilators that should  be included in the national stockpile. While modeling results are important  to consider during a public health event, ASPR officials and modelers said it is also important to consider concrete financial estimates based on  prior experience and whether recommended medical interventions or  countermeasures are available or effective.", "For example, ASPR modelers and officials have occasionally been asked  to analyze costs for medical countermeasures, but modelers and officials  said that few medical countermeasures typically meet the requirements of  decision makers, and existing medical countermeasures are typically  unavailable for use in a response. ASPR modelers and officials noted that  the usefulness of modeling to the decision maker in these instances is  limited. In the event that they were asked to model for such questions,  ASPR modelers and officials said time would also be a limiting factor in  their analysis.", "CDC has also developed models to inform decision-making at the state  level, specifically to assist state and local public health agencies in  developing outbreak response plans. A professional organization of  epidemiologists we contacted expressed some concerns with limitations  of CDC models, specifically noting that state and local officials viewed  CDC models as lacking the level of refinement needed for their state- and  local-level planning needs. To follow up, we interviewed officials from a  non-generalizable selection of five states based on their reported use of  CDC models, the level of selected disease activity in the state, and  geographic variation. Two of the five state health departments we  contacted reported using one of CDC\u2019s models for Ebola, Zika, or  pandemic influenza. These two states confirmed that the usefulness of  the CDC FluSurge pandemic influenza model was limited by unrealistic  assumptions or a lack of predictive capability, but added that the models  were useful to them when considering how to allocate resources or  otherwise prepare for a severe pandemic. Officials from one state health  department told us they had similar concerns with the CDC Ebola model  regarding an unrealistic overestimate of the potential cases, but added  that it was useful for informing staff allocation planning as part of their  overall response.", "Officials from another state health department told us they used CDC\u2019s  Zika modeling results that indicated how many emergency room visits  they could expect and what symptoms it would take to confirm a Zika  infection. At the time, state officials said, commercial testing for Zika was  not available, so this modeling was very helpful to health officials looking  to recommend who hospitals should test based on the presence of Zika  symptoms. State health department officials added that many other  factors are considered when deciding on resource allocation, such as  local leadership and willingness to embrace the public health response."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Coordinate Infectious Disease Modeling Efforts but Do Not Fully Monitor, Evaluate, and Report on Coordination", "paragraphs": ["The four HHS agencies that work on infectious disease modeling reported  using multiple mechanisms to coordinate their efforts.

For example:", "Emergency Operations Center (EOC). During the response to an  outbreak, CDC activates its EOC\u2014a temporary, formal organizational  structure for coordinating expertise within CDC and among agencies.  The four HHS agencies\u2014ASPR, CDC, FDA, and NIH\u2014used EOCs to  coordinate modeling efforts during responses to Ebola, Zika, and  pandemic influenza outbreaks. For example, during the 2015-2016  Zika outbreak, CDC\u2019s EOC served as the command center for  monitoring and coordinating the response by bringing together CDC  scientists with expertise in areas such as arboviruses (the category  that includes Zika), reproductive health, birth defects, and  developmental disabilities. CDC modelers and officials told us that  they had weekly strategy meetings and briefings with response  leadership within the EOC where they discussed which modeling  questions to prioritize. In general, CDC modelers in the EOC were  expected to coordinate with modelers from other agencies within and  outside of HHS\u2014such as ASPR, FDA, NIH, and the Department of  Homeland Security\u2014to produce timely estimates of cases,  hospitalizations, and deaths. These estimates can inform response  leadership and enable them to assess the speed and impact of the  geographic spread of the pandemic. Modelers in the EOC also  provide support to decision makers as they examine the potential  effects of various response options. These options include when and  how to deploy Strategic National Stockpile assets, such as influenza  antiviral drugs and mechanical ventilators. We found the use of  EOCs to be consistent with leading collaboration practices we have  previously identified, such as defining and articulating a common  outcome.", "Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise  (PHEMCE). The four HHS agencies also participated in PHEMCE, a  federal interagency body formed by HHS in 2006 that coordinates the  development, acquisition, stockpiling, and recommendations for use  of medical products that are needed to effectively respond to a variety  of high-consequence public health emergencies. PHEMCE is led by  ASPR and also includes partners at the Departments of Defense,  Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and Agriculture. PHEMCE\u2019s  2017-2018 strategy and implementation plan, its most recent,  identified Ebola, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious  diseases more broadly as high-priority threats. PHEMCE leadership  could ask modelers to address questions related to these infectious  diseases, according to ASPR modelers and officials. According to  ASPR officials, such questions tend to support larger response- related efforts, and modeling results are often incorporated into final  reports and products. According to ASPR officials, as of February  2020, the PHEMCE structure has been updated and it is unclear how  modeling fits into the new structure. We found that coordination  through PHEMCE is consistent with leading collaboration practices  such as establishing mutually-reinforcing or joint strategies.", "Working groups. Modelers with the four HHS agencies have  participated in working groups related to infectious disease modeling  (see table 2). The use of working groups and similar bodies is  consistent with leading collaboration practices that we have previously  reported as useful for enhancing and sustaining interagency  collaboration, such as identifying and addressing needs by leveraging  resources. For example, CDC and ASPR modelers participated in  the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s Pandemic Prediction  Forecasting Science and Technology Working Group, which facilitates  coordination among numerous federal agencies. In 2016, this group  produced a report that identified challenges in outbreak prediction and  modeling for federal agencies and offered recommendations for  federal actions to advance the development and effective application  of outbreak prediction capabilities.", "Description  This interagency working group, directed by the National Science and Technology  Council, is responsible for analyzing the state of infectious disease modeling and  prediction, and facilitating coordination among numerous federal agencies.  According to CDC modelers and officials, as of October 2018, the charter for this  group is no longer active, and it meets on a voluntary, ad hoc basis.  According to CDC officials, this group connects modelers by holding seminars,  managing an email list, and arranging for members to peer review one another\u2019s  models. This group had over 160 participants from various centers across CDC,  as of June 2019.  During the 2014-2016 Ebola and 2015-2016 Zika outbreaks, the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response (ASPR) established temporary modeling  coordination groups that brought together government agencies and academics to  share early modeling results and discuss pressing questions that could be  answered through modeling, according to ASPR modelers and officials. A wide  range of entities participated in these groups, including the four HHS agencies,  other federal agencies such as the Departments of Defense and Homeland  Security, universities, and foreign entities, such as the World Health Organization  and the United Kingdom. According to ASPR modelers and officials, there are no  plans to convene modeling coordination groups unless there is an ongoing  infectious disease outbreak.", "Joint model development. ASPR and CDC modelers jointly  developed some modeling products during outbreak responses. For  example, during the 2014-2016 Ebola response, ASPR and CDC  developed a model to estimate future numbers of Ebola patients  needing treatment at any one time in the United States. According to  a publication describing the model, policymakers have used it to  evaluate responses to the risk for arrival of Ebola-infected travelers,  and it can be used in future infectious disease outbreaks of  international origin to plan for persons requiring treatment within the  United States. Building these positive working relationships can help  bridge organizational cultures by building trust and fostering  communication, which facilitates collaboration and is vital in  responding to emergencies. For example, in our 2011 report, we  found that, through interagency planning efforts, federal officials built  relationships that helped facilitate the federal response to the H1N1  influenza pandemic. Similarly, HHS officials said that federal  coordination during the H1N1 pandemic was much easier because of  these formal networks and informal relationships built during  pandemic planning activities and exercises.", "Memoranda of understanding. The four HHS agencies have  entered into various agreements through memoranda of  understanding in order to define their relationships for coordinating  infectious disease modeling (see table 3). Generally these  memoranda were between individual agencies rather than  department-wide. We found that the use of memoranda of  understanding was consistent with leading collaboration practices,  such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities. Our prior work found  that agencies that articulate their agreements in formal documents  can strengthen their commitment to working collaboratively.  Similarly, CDC modelers and officials said that written agreements  can reduce the possibility of misunderstandings or disagreements and  help ensure that participants have a mutual understanding of  collaboration goals. For example, in the absence of such written  agreements, the potential for duplication is increased because  agencies could be working on similar types of models without one  another\u2019s knowledge.", "Table 3. Selected Examples of Memoranda of Understanding for Coordinating on Infectious Disease Modeling  Collaborating agencies   The Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness  and Response (ASPR) and  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC)", "ASPR and the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA)", "Description  From 2013 to 2018, CDC and ASPR had a memorandum of understanding to promote collaboration,  provide expertise, and facilitate data and information exchange related to infectious disease modeling.  This agreement expired in 2018. ASPR modelers and officials told us that, as of August 2019, it had not  been updated, and there were no plans to do so. Despite this, according to CDC modelers and officials,  the substance of the agreement is still being followed. CDC modelers and officials told us they continue  to collaborate with ASPR modelers on the development of models that address questions of mutual  interest. For example, for the ongoing Ebola response, CDC modelers and officials said they have kept  ASPR informed on modeling efforts, and ASPR shares data on vaccine production that is included in  one of the models.  ASPR and FDA have a memorandum of understanding to promote collaboration and enhance  knowledge and efficiency by providing for the sharing of information and expertise. This memorandum  was in place from 2012 to 2017, and was then renewed in 2019. It remains valid unless modified by  consent of both parties or terminated by either party immediately upon written notice in the event that a  federal statute is enacted or a regulation is issued by a federal partner that materially affects the  memorandum. According to FDA modelers and officials, the agreement facilitates collaboration related  to FDA\u2019s Medical Countermeasure Initiative and FDA\u2019s role in supporting the HHS-led Public Health  Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). FDA modelers and officials told us that  the agreement supports the frequent, ongoing collaborations between FDA and ASPR, including  collaboration related to preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. However, FDA modelers and  officials said, while no specific steps have been taken with regards to collaborating on infectious  disease modeling under the agreement, modeling assistance could be provided in the future, if needed.", "Description  From 2013-2018, ASPR had a memorandum of understanding with NIH\u2019s Models of Infectious Disease  Agent Study program to (1) enable Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study program researchers to  work with ASPR as part of public health preparedness and response activities, (2) share data and  information, and (3) support model development and use in the HHS modeling hub. This agreement  has expired. ASPR modelers and officials told us that, as of August 2019, it has not been updated, and  there were no plans to do so.  Since 2015, CDC has had a memorandum of understanding with NIH\u2019s Models of Infectious Disease  Agent Study program, to promote collaboration and facilitate the exchange of data, tools (models),  methods, and information. It was set to expire in February 2020.  From 2013 to 2018, ASPR had separate memoranda of understanding with the Departments of  Defense and Homeland Security to promote collaboration, provide expertise, and facilitate data and  information exchange. The goals of the collaboration in both agreements were to explore ways to,  among other things: share analytical approaches and efforts, such as modeling and simulation tools, in  support of public health preparedness and response activities; provide personnel as needed to facilitate  analytical efforts; and share data and information. These goals were similar to those laid out in the  agreement between CDC and ASPR. These agreements expired in 2018. ASPR modelers and officials  told us that, as of October 2019, they have not been updated, and there were no plans to do so.", "Forecasting competitions. CDC and NIH have sponsored formal  forecasting competitions to improve modeling for Ebola, Zika, and  seasonal influenza. According to a report from the National Science  and Technology Council, controlled, multi\u2010center modeling contests  and projects generate valuable insights. For example, they often show  that simpler models perform as well as more complex models and that  ensemble models, which combine the results of multiple models to  predict an outcome, perform better than an individual model. Such  competitions are consistent with a leading collaboration practice we  previously reported: identifying and addressing needs by leveraging  resources. In this case, such leveraging allowed CDC and NIH to  obtain additional benefits and insights on models that may not  otherwise be available. These modeling competitions can therefore  help the HHS agencies better prepare for future outbreaks through  coordination with participants. The following are examples of  forecasting competitions sponsored by CDC or NIH:", "Ebola competition. NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center held an  Ebola forecasting competition from August to December 2015,  related to the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, to compare  the accuracy of predictions from different Ebola models, among  other things. According to NIH modelers and officials, lessons  learned from the challenge were that (1) with regard to short-term  incidence predictions, ensemble estimates were more consistently  accurate than predictions by any individual participating model; (2)  as expected, more accurate and granular epidemiological data  improved forecasting accuracy; (3) the availability of contextual  information, including patient-level data and situational reports, is  important for accurate predictions; (4) the accuracy of forecasting  was not positively associated with more complex models; and (5)  coordination of modeling teams and comparison of different  models is important to ensure robustness of predictions.  According to NIH officials, based on these lessons and in  response to the most recent Ebola outbreak, NIH has established  a coordination group to share information about modeling and  data sharing for this particular outbreak and a formal model  comparison is underway under World Health Organization  leadership.", "Aedes (Zika) competition. In 2019, CDC hosted a forecasting  competition related to using models to predict the presence of  Aedes mosquitoes, which is a vector for the Zika virus. Evaluating  these models can, according to CDC, help clarify model accuracy  and utility, the seasonal and geographical dynamics of these  mosquitoes, and key directions for future research. According to  CDC documentation, these advances can contribute to improved  preparedness for arboviral invasion in the United States and in  other regions where Aedes suitability may be limited and  changing. CDC plans to evaluate forecasts for this competition in  early 2020, as soon as final surveillance data for 2019 are  available.", "FluSight (seasonal influenza) competition. CDC holds an  annual seasonal influenza forecasting competition\u2014known as  FluSight\u2014to facilitate efforts to engage external researchers to  improve the science and usability of seasonal influenza forecasts.  The results of the competition are evaluated by the CDC Influenza  Division, which works with state and local partners to determine  whether the results are useful to them and if there are other  metrics, milestones, or targets that would be more helpful in  making public health decisions. According to CDC officials in  February 2020, the results from the FluSight competition are not  directly incorporated into pandemic influenza forecasting because  the most accurate seasonal influenza forecasts would not  necessarily be the most accurate pandemic influenza forecasts.  According to these officials, the overall lessons learned from the  FluSight competition relate to how to quantify, visualize, and  communicate model results and model accuracy, as well as the  value of forecast ensembles to summarize multiple models. CDC  officials said these lessons are incorporated into pandemic  influenza forecasting plans.", "Coordination with academic and other modelers. CDC  coordinated infectious disease modeling efforts with academic and  other modelers through various means, including the following:  Intergovernmental Personnel Act agreements. CDC has used  agreements under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 to  collaborate with external experts on modeling efforts. For  example CDC\u2019s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases had an  agreement from 2014 to 2017 to assign a CDC official to the  Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The agreement was  to help CDC integrate with a larger modeling community and  provide the Harvard School of Public Health with expertise in  arboviral diseases and applied public health.", "Vector-Borne Disease Centers of Excellence. CDC has funded  the Vector-Borne Disease Centers of Excellence, which are  engaged in modeling-specific projects. In 2017, CDC established  five universities as regional centers of excellence to help prevent  and rapidly respond to emerging vector-borne diseases across the  United States. According to CDC, the goals of the centers are to  build effective collaboration between academic communities and  public health organizations at federal, state, and local levels for  surveillance, prevention, and response, among other things.", "Support for other governmental entities. CDC has coordinated  with other entities\u2014such as state and local officials\u2014to provide  modeling tools, estimates of case counts, or effects of  interventions during the Ebola, Zika, and pandemic influenza  outbreaks. For example, CDC developed pandemic influenza  models for state and local health departments to use in influenza  pandemic planning activities. The tools are available on the CDC  pandemic influenza website and from ASPR\u2019s emergency  preparedness information portal. As previously discussed, officials  from two of the states we spoke with said they generally were  unaware of the availability of the models. According to CDC  modelers and officials, these models were developed in the mid- 2000s for pandemic influenza planning and remain useful but had  not been a priority to update because they have not received a  request to do so.", "Informal collaboration. CDC has engaged in a range of informal  collaborations related to infectious disease modeling. According to  CDC modelers and officials, modelers often develop relationships  through conferences or other contacts. For example, CDC  modelers and officials said they informally collaborated on Ebola  modeling needs with academic institutions, as well as modelers  and analysts in the World Health Organization and other U.S.  government agencies, such as the Federal Emergency  Management Agency. For example, CDC modelers and officials  told us that model estimates produced under collaboration with  academics helped inform decisions about how many beds to be  ordered and delivered on the ground in West Africa during the  2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak. Similar to the forecasting  competitions described above, such informal coordination  mechanisms are consistent with the best practice of identifying  and addressing needs by leveraging resources, thus obtaining  additional benefits that may not be available if they were working  separately. For example, we have previously reported that  informal collaboration mechanisms\u2014such as building  relationships between key personnel and soliciting input for  research projects\u2014can provide the opportunity to leverage  expertise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Agencies Do Not Fully Monitor, Evaluate, and Report on Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CDC and ASPR modelers and officials did not routinely monitor, evaluate,  and report on coordination efforts for infectious disease modeling. While  CDC did conduct after-action reviews for Ebola and Zika, which included  a review of modeling efforts, such reviews are not routine outside of a  response and do not examine modeling coordination between agencies.  ASPR modelers and officials told us they saw no reason to monitor  coordination efforts under the memorandum of understanding with CDC  because such memoranda outline expectations rather than requirements.  However, we have found that agencies that create a means to monitor,  evaluate, and report the results of collaborative efforts can better identify  areas for improvement. We have previously reported that progress  reviews or after action reviews can be useful mechanisms for monitoring,  evaluating, and reporting on collaborative efforts. For example, we  previously reported that, to monitor, evaluate, and report on the status of  achieving the Healthy People 2010 objectives, HHS held progress  reviews in which the federal agencies with lead responsibilities for a focus  area reported on the progress towards achieving the objectives. During  these reviews, the participating agencies discussed the data trends,  barriers to achieving the objectives, strategies undertaken to overcome  barriers, and alternative approaches to attain further progress. By holding  similar progress reviews in which CDC and ASPR evaluate and report on  coordination efforts for infectious disease modeling, these agencies could  be better positioned to identify and address challenges prior to infectious  disease outbreaks occurring, which could lead to improved responses.  Further, there is the potential for overlap and duplication of modeling  efforts across agencies, which may not be identified if coordination efforts  are not effectively being monitored, and which could lead to inefficiencies.", "The memorandum of understanding between CDC and ASPR had  expired in 2018. Agency officials told us they had no plans to review or  update the agreement. According to ASPR modelers and officials, the  agreement has not been updated because it was not a priority and the  substance of the expired agreement is being followed. However, without  an active agreement in place that clearly defines the goals of the  collaborative effort and the roles and responsibilities of participants, a lack  of understanding and agreement becomes more likely, particularly as  agencies\u2019 priorities evolve over time. Our prior work on leading  collaboration practices found that agencies that articulate their  agreements in formal documents can strengthen their commitments to  working collaboratively, and that such agreements are most effective  when they are regularly reviewed and updated.", "Further, we found that the memorandum of understanding between ASPR  and CDC was not fully implemented when it was active. For example,  according to this agreement, CDC was to appoint a designee to  participate in a steering committee related to modeling within HHS.  However, ASPR modelers and officials told us that this steering  committee was never formed because of changing leadership and priorities. They told us that HHS does not have any intention to form such  a steering committee in the future. However, our past work shows  creating a steering committee or other similar coordination mechanism  could help facilitate monitoring of coordination efforts.", "We similarly found that other memoranda of understanding related to  infectious disease modeling were not fully implemented. For example,  although ASPR had a 2013-2018 memorandum of understanding with  NIH\u2019s Models of Infectious Disease Agency Study program, ASPR  modelers and officials said they rarely use models funded by NIH,  including those funded through the program. In particular, ASPR  modelers and officials recalled only using one such model in recent years.  That model, known as \u201cFluTE,\u201d is an influenza model that was used as  part of a larger study on vaccine availability. However, ASPR modelers  faced challenges in using this model. Specifically, these ASPR modelers  and officials said the FluTE model initially was not compatible with  ASPR\u2019s computer system, so software engineers had to modify the  source code to resolve the compatibility issue. The model did not have  documentation describing its parameters, according to ASPR modelers  and officials, so they had to read through the model\u2019s source code to  understand them. Similarly, regarding a separate agreement between  ASPR and FDA, FDA modelers and officials said that, while there is  ongoing information sharing, no specific steps have been taken with  regard to collaborating on infectious disease modeling under the  agreement. However, these modelers and agency officials said that  modeling assistance could be provided in the future, if needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CDC and ASPR Generally Followed Identified Practices for Infectious Disease Modeling, but CDC Has Not Fully Ensured Model Reproducibility", "paragraphs": ["We identified four elements of practices for developing and assessing  models: (1) communication between decision maker and modeler, (2)  description of the model, (3) verification, and (4) validation. We  determined that CDC and ASPR generally followed these GAO-identified  practices for 10 models we reviewed. However, for four of the 10  models, CDC modelers did not provide all of the details needed in the  verification steps to reproduce their model results, which is inconsistent  with HHS guidelines on transparency and reproducibility."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CDC and ASPR Generally Followed Identified Modeling Practices but Did Not Always Fully Assess Model Performance", "paragraphs": ["According to our interviews with agency modelers and experts, along with  our review of selected literature, there are no documented standards that  prescribe the steps agencies must or should follow when developing and  assessing models. However, based on our interviews and review, we  identified four broad elements of the modeling process that modelers  generally consider. They are:  1  communication between modelers and officials to refine questions to  be addressed by the model, such as geographic spread of the  disease and total cases of the disease;  2  description of the model, including detailed descriptions of  assumptions and data sources used;  4  validation.", "Figure 4 outlines the model development and assessment process.", "Based on our assessment of 10 selected models, we found that CDC and  ASPR generally took steps that corresponded to our four elements, and  agency modelers generally agreed with our assessment of each model.  See table 4 for more information on the elements. See appendix III for a  list of models we reviewed and a complete list of the steps we identified  that make up each element.", "Communication between modeler and decision maker. In all 10  agency models we reviewed, we found that agencies took all the steps  we identified for communication between decision maker and modeler. In  some cases, these steps were formalized, while in others they were  informal. For example, CDC modelers responding to Ebola ensured  communication with decision makers by following a memo template they  developed, which has a section requiring modelers to communicate key  aspects of their model. These modelers noted, however, that they would  not follow all the steps in their memo template for models developed  during an outbreak because of time constraints. CDC modelers  responding to pandemic influenza noted they do not have formal best  practices for communication about key model aspects to decision makers,  and a CDC modeler responding to Zika highlighted the role of CDC\u2019s  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in communication between decision  makers and modelers, which is activated only during a response. ASPR  modelers noted that\u2014as a best practice\u2014they hold a discussion for all  new models, in which decision makers describe what they are looking for  and modelers describe what they can provide.", "Description of the model. In nine of the 10 models we reviewed,  modelers took all steps we identified for describing their model type,  inputs, outputs, assumptions, and limitations. In one case, ASPR\u2019s  \u201cflumodels\u201d package, the agency did not carry out the step of describing  the model\u2019s limitations. ASPR modelers told us they did not do so  because they expected the model\u2019s intended users\u2014primarily federal  public health modeling experts\u2014would understand the limitations of their  model, an assumption we find reasonable.", "Verification. In six of 10 models reviewed, we found agency modelers  followed most of the steps we identified for model verification. However,  in four of the seven CDC models reviewed, CDC did not publish the  model\u2019s code, a part of model reproducibility and a model verification  step. We examine CDC\u2019s policy and efforts on reproducibility in more  detail below.", "Validation. For four of the 10 models we reviewed, agencies performed  few validation steps. In all three CDC pandemic influenza models we  reviewed, and the ASPR Zika model, sensitivity analysis was the only  validation step performed. CDC influenza modelers said they did not  perform other validation steps because of a lack of comparable external  models or applicable data which could be used for other types of model  validation. For example, they said they could not validate their models  using real-world data because they made projections for scenarios that  did not come to pass (e.g., an unmitigated pandemic influenza outbreak).  They said they have continued to look for comparable models that could  be used to cross-validate their model estimates. ASPR modelers  responding to the Zika outbreak also did not have access to comparable  external models or applicable data to confirm their model projections, but  have since attempted to validate their model. For the other six models we  reviewed, agencies carried out most but not all validation steps. For  example, CDC modelers responding to Zika also said they did not  perform cross-validation (comparison of different model results to each  other) for their Zika model because of a lack of comparable models.  However, these ASPR and CDC Zika modelers said they have attempted  to validate their model since its publication as new data emerges, and we  found this occurred.", "Assessing Model Validity  Assessing model validity means determining  whether a model is sufficiently accurate for its  purpose. Several methods are available,  including the following:", "Modelers can compare the results of the  model against real-world data the model  was designed to predict.  If there are no such data, another method  is to determine how much the model  projections change in response to  changes in input data. This is known as  model sensitivity analysis.", "Modelers can also withhold a part of the  available data in building the model and  then confirm the model can reproduce the  withheld data.  real-world data is to run the model along  with a separate, independent model using  the same input data, and comparing the  outputs.", "CDC modelers and ASPR modelers responding to Zika followed identified  practices and validated their model projections for the Zika outbreak,  although their efforts yielded mixed results for model performance. CDC  modelers responding to Zika attempted to estimate whether there was an  enhanced risk of microcephaly in infants born to expectant mothers  infected with Zika. Using data available during the initial stage of the  outbreak, they calculated the enhanced risk to be between 0.88 and 13.2  percent if the mother was infected in the first trimester. In two subsequent  studies using later data on the actual incidence of microcephaly as a  result of the outbreak, other researchers found the enhanced risk was  within the bounds of CDC modelers\u2019 earlier projections: a 10 percent  enhanced risk in one study and an 8.3 percent enhanced risk in the other.  In the second case, ASPR modelers attempted to estimate potential new  cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body\u2019s  immune system attacks part of its own nervous system, in places  burdened by Zika infection. Their initial projections were that there would  be between 191 and 305 new cases in Puerto Rico, a three- to five-fold  increase above the number normally expected. ASPR modelers  attempted to verify these results themselves and found that the incidence  did increase, but only two-fold, to 123 new cases. through independent performance  evaluations. For example, agencies  sometimes host modeling competitions, in  which independent modelers compare the  predictive performance of multiple models  under controlled conditions using  standardized data. The National Institutes  of Health hosted an Ebola forecasting  competition in 2015, and the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  launched its FluSight competition in 2013.", "The Challenge of Modeling During an  Outbreak.  Early in the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) officials faced the challenge of  answering questions with limited data and  time. In order to estimate the potential number  of future cases and to aid in planning for  additional disease-control efforts, CDC  developed EbolaResponse, an Excel  spreadsheet-based model that could forecast  how interventions would impact the outbreak.  Using EbolaResponse, CDC predicted in early  September 2014 that 1.4 million cases of  Ebola could occur in Liberia and Sierra Leone  by January 2015, if the world health  community did not increase interventions.  These estimates included a correction factor  intended to account for the underreporting of  cases and that, according to officials, was to  represent model uncertainty. Partly because  of these estimates of rapidly increasing cases,  CDC and others increased intervention by  sending more treatment units, personnel, and  medical supplies in late 2014.  EbolaResponse was created to model the  effects of intervention, and it later turned out  to be unreliable for the 4-month forecast that  CDC used to support its request for increased  intervention. Independent analysis found that  the model could forecast cases up to a month  ahead well but could not provide any measure  of uncertainty. Furthermore, the model was  unable to make accurate forecasts much  beyond 3 months, a limitation that was  common among the models used during the  outbreak. CDC later reported that roughly  8,500 cases, or 34 percent of the corrected  EbolaResponse prediction of 25,000 cases,  occurred in Liberia by the end of January  2015.", "We also found that CDC and ASPR modeling approaches varied  somewhat, while generally remaining within the bounds of our identified  practices. For example, all the agency modeling groups reviewed their  model assumptions, but they also varied in whether this review was  formal or informal and internal or external. CDC modelers responding to  Ebola use a formal internal peer review process during non-outbreak  periods, as well as a detailed checklist to ensure communication with  decision makers, full consideration of model inputs and outputs,  quantification of model uncertainty, and validation of the model. By  contrast, CDC modelers responding to Zika told us they do not have a  formal system for evaluating their models, and instead rely on their own  review of model assumptions. ASPR and CDC pandemic influenza  modelers told us their modeling approach also relied on peer review, but  the review was done by external experts; informally for ASPR and  formally for CDC pandemic influenza modelers.", "There are several reasons agency modeling approaches can vary.  According to agency modelers, agency modeling practices can be  influenced by the availability of time, data, and comparable models. For  example, CDC pandemic influenza modelers and officials said they follow  a shortened process when facing time constraints by documenting model  development in a journal publication after the model has already been put  to use. Similarly, CDC modelers responding to Ebola noted that, during a  response, a lack of time may mean models are not reviewed through  CDC\u2019s formal clearance process; instead, a more informal review of  model results may occur.", "CDC and ASPR modelers also described variation in the complexity of  the models they use. They said they sometimes use both simple and  complex models for the same disease and during the same outbreak.  CDC modelers and officials responding to Ebola said that they preferred  models run in spreadsheet programs for their transparency and  communicability, whereas CDC influenza modelers mostly use dedicated  statistical software programs to run models and spreadsheets for  communicating with state and local health departments. ASPR modelers  develop more complex prediction models so that they can be reused to  answer more than one question, as opposed to models run in  spreadsheet programs that are designed to answer one question.", "Experts and agency modelers generally agreed that infectious disease  models should not be more complex than is necessary to answer the  questions they were developed to address. A simpler model may be run  on a variety of software programs, ranging from spreadsheet programs to  specialized programming languages that can do statistical analysis. One  downside of models run in spreadsheet programs, according to CDC  influenza modelers, is that it is harder to conduct quality control  measures. Two experts we spoke to, along with CDC Zika modelers, also  expressed concerns with reliability and reproducibility of models run in  spreadsheet programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC Has Not Fully Implemented a Policy to Ensure Model Reproducibility", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, HHS agencies responsible for disseminating influential  scientific, financial, or statistical information have been required to ensure  methods used to develop this information are \u201creproducible.\u201d A 2019  report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine noted that the scientific enterprise depends on the ability of the  scientific community to scrutinize scientific claims and to gain confidence  over time in results and inferences that have stood up to repeated testing.  As part of this process of scrutiny, a study\u2019s data and code should be  made available so that the study is reproducible by others. The National  Academies report defines reproducibility as obtaining consistent  computational results using the same input data, computational steps,  methods, code, and conditions of analysis. Reproducibility is specifically  addressed earlier in this section in our discussion of model verification, a  step that requires making code available for independent review.", "HHS requires its component agencies to either follow HHS department  guidelines on reproducibility or to ensure their own guidelines include a  high degree of transparency about the data and methods used to  generate scientific information. HHS guidelines require that, in a  scientific context, agencies identify the supporting data and models for  their published scientific information and provide sufficient transparency  about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be  undertaken by a qualified member of the public. When asked whether  CDC has specific policies related to reproducibility that would have  applied to provision of model code in their published scientific research,  CDC referred to its guidelines developed in response to the 2002 HHS  Guidelines. However, CDC guidelines do not contain any reference to  reproducibility, models, or provision of model code. CDC guidelines for  review of scientific information provided to the public focus on  completeness, accuracy and timeliness, data management and analysis,  clarity and accuracy of presentation, and validity of interpretation of  findings. CDC\u2019s policy on public health research and non-research data  management and access does not make any reference to reproducibility  or model code. This lack of reference to reproducibility in CDC\u2019s  guidelines and policies is not in accordance with HHS guidelines.", "Our review found four instances in which CDC modelers did not provide  model code when they published their models. CDC modelers said in  some instances, issues with publication formats made the code difficult to  share, they did not have time to produce a user-friendly version of the  code, or they would share the code upon request.", "By contrast, ASPR modelers provided code for every model within our  review when they published their models. While neither agency cited a  specific HHS policy that required them to share model code, ASPR  modelers noted that their internal peer review process typically includes  sharing model source code with other modelers within PHEMCE. In our  review of HHS guidelines and agency-specific guidance for these HHS  guidelines, we found that, of three published agency guidance, two  require reproducibility, or transparency for the methods used in the  reports they issue to the public. Of these agencies, CDC was the only one  that did not explicitly require transparency or reproducibility.", "The National Academies report noted that researchers have to be able to  understand others\u2019 research in order to build on it. This report also notes  that the ability of qualified third parties to reproduce a model using  published code is important because it can reveal mistakes in model  code, which can lead to serious errors in interpretation and reported  results. If researchers do not share an important aspect of their study,  such as their model code, it is difficult to confirm the results of their  research and ultimately produce new knowledge. One agency official  acknowledged the importance of releasing model code, noting that HHS  could benefit by ensuring policies across the agency are consistent  regarding reproducibility and transparency in modeling.

The categories are data, resources, and  communicating results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Challenges", "paragraphs": ["According to a 2016 report from the National Science and Technology  Council (NSTC), obtaining timely and accurate data and information has  long been a major challenge to an effective response during an infectious  disease outbreak. One expert described reliable data as a modeler\u2019s  most limited resource. Until data of sufficient quality and quantity are  available and usable, the predictive value of models will be limited.", "Agency modelers and officials provided examples of data-related  challenges, which we categorize as follows:", "Data Access. Public health data, according to one expert, often has  access restrictions. For example, ASPR modelers said their ability to  access data during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak was reduced by a  need to enter into agreements with data-owning countries in order to  obtain patient data. Modelers said there were agreements between  CDC and data owners, but further agreements would have been  required for ASPR to obtain data because the agreements did not  authorize CDC to share data with its partners. In addition to the  example above, the lack of data sharing agreements during the 2014- 2016 Ebola outbreak response led to modeling projects being  delayed, according to a CDC publication. ASPR modelers said their  inability to obtain data without a data-sharing agreement made it  challenging for them to developing a current, reliable estimate of  Ebola incidence before modelers could start creating future estimates  of disease incidence. They said that, as a result, they instead  developed a statistical model, which provided less reliable estimates  of future numbers of disease cases than they would have preferred.  Modelers said they worked to address this challenge by obtaining  data and indirect information through personal relationships with other  modelers. In addition to the example provided above, CDC modelers  and officials responding to Ebola described experiencing data access  challenges.", "Data availability. Without sufficient data, models may be unable to  identify an epidemic\u2019s key drivers, which could result in misdirected  intervention efforts. For example, ASPR modelers noted that during  the 2015-2016 Zika outbreak response, there were substantial limits  on available data, and data that were available could be unreliable  and delayed. They said it was very difficult, and in many cases  effectively impossible, to determine the accuracy of forecasting  models for the evolving Zika outbreak. In addition, CDC officials and  modelers responding to Ebola, Zika, and influenza described  encountering limits on available data as an ongoing challenge. Steps  that modelers said they have taken to address data availability  challenges include designing models to use a minimum amount of  data, building trust and communication with stakeholders who might  be able to provide additional data, and updating data systems to  provide all available information. According to CDC modelers, data  availability will likely continue to pose a challenge to public health  responses.", "Data collection. There is limited manpower during an infectious  disease outbreak response, which can limit the health care system\u2019s  ability to collect data, according to CDC modelers and officials  responding to Ebola and ASPR modelers. ASPR modelers said if a  provider has to fill out a time-consuming form, then they will be  delayed in treating the next patient. In order to address this challenge,  CDC modelers and officials and ASPR modelers said data requesters  should ask for the minimum amount of data needed. For example,  CDC modelers and officials said they focus on understanding what  data are essential, how they are collected, and the policy implications  of reporting those data. A 2016 NSTC report recommended the  federal government address this challenge by identifying questions  likely to arise during an outbreak response, in order to help define and  prioritize data collection and modeling goals.", "Data quality. Experts said creating models with low-quality data can  result in inaccurate models that may not provide clear answers to  decision maker questions. For example, CDC modelers and officials  responding to the 2015-2016 Zika outbreak said the data quality  varied, based on many factors such as surveillance systems that were  doing different things and defining reporting Zika cases differently,  and the availability of diagnostic testing. Because of data quality  concerns, there were questions about whether modeling could be  conducted, but through discussions modelers and agency officials  said they were able to address challenges. To address such  challenges, CDC modelers and officials responding to Zika said they  worked to improve public data sharing, sent an official to the Pan- American Health Organization to help interpret data and understand  the outbreak from an international perspective, and used modeling  methods appropriate for data with high levels of uncertainty. In  addition to the example provided above, CDC modelers and officials  responding to Ebola, ASPR modelers, and experts described  experiencing data quality challenges.", "Data integration. CDC modelers and officials responding to Ebola  and Zika also faced the challenge of integrating multiple data sets,  which may not be standardized or in a readily usable form. For  example, CDC modelers and officials responding to Zika found it  challenging to integrate data as the definition of the disease was  refined over time. As the definition got more specific and monitoring  systems became available, it was hard to establish data trends, these  officials said. Further, there were variations in who would be tested,  with all people who exhibited symptoms being tested in some areas,  and only pregnant women in others, and also when data would be  placed into a combined form and reported to state, national, or  international officials, according to these officials. This integration  issue may have complicated efforts to conduct modeling such as  determining the risk of microcephaly in infants over time. In order to  address this challenge, Zika modelers said they set up an online data  repository to, among other things, standardize shared data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource-Related Challenges", "paragraphs": ["CDC modelers and officials responding to Ebola and Zika, along with  experts, said finding staff with sufficient training to support modeling  during an infectious disease outbreak represented an ongoing  challenge. For example, CDC modelers responding to Zika said it can  be difficult to find modelers with both an epidemiological background and  skills in coding and mathematics. Modelers and agency officials said  those who had the correct skills were in high demand, and it was difficult  to fully engage them in the Zika outbreak response. They said they could  have conducted more modeling or completed modeling efforts more  rapidly if they had had access to more modelers with the right skills. To  address this challenge, modelers participate in trainings on how to  communicate what models can and cannot do, participate in working  groups that support modeling efforts, employ the Intergovernmental  Personnel Mobility Act Program, maintain collaborations with external  partners, and host students and researchers. ASPR modelers said they  faced personnel challenges in their modeling efforts but that they were  wide-ranging and not specific to Ebola, Zika, or pandemic influenza.", "According to a 2016 NSTC report, time constraints make it challenging for  researchers to keep up with scientific literature during an outbreak. CDC  influenza modelers said they faced this challenge and that they conduct  weekly searches for new influenza publications, which normally identify  about 150 publications each week. To address this challenge, modelers  said they conduct literature searches, share the responsibility of reviewing  publications and informing others of their content, talk to experts, and  attend conferences.

Model results, according to  CDC influenza modelers, are often nuanced and complicated, and  officials have to think about what pieces of information are the most  important to convey to a decision maker, the public, or health officials.  Furthermore, as one expert noted, the complexities of modeling can get  lost in translation, especially with the media, which may focus on only a  worst-case scenario. When modeling for infectious diseases,  appropriately communicating complex information has been described as  a constant challenge, and CDC influenza modelers described it as their  biggest challenge. CDC influenza modelers particularly noted the  challenge of communicating uncertainty. CDC influenza and ASPR  modelers said if decision makers did not understand the models, they  could misunderstand the results, which, according to ASPR modelers,  could lead to errors in decision making. CDC modelers and officials  responding to Ebola and Zika, CDC influenza modelers, ASPR modelers,  and experts described experiencing challenges communicating model  results to decision makers.", "Clear communication may help prevent misunderstandings. For example,  one review article said officials may not understand what models can and  cannot do before an epidemic, and modelers may not be fully aware of a  decision maker\u2019s needs. An expert said there is a need to constrain the  use of models intended to inform decisions so that the model does not  over- or under-influence a decision maker. And, according to ASPR  modelers, decision makers sometimes want a model to make a decision  for them, although models can only inform the decision making process.", "They said this is less of a problem during an outbreak response, when  decision makers know they have to act based on incomplete information.", "Some steps officials described taking to address communication  challenges were similar across CDC and ASPR officials. For example,  CDC modelers and officials and ASPR modelers said they took steps to  improve communication, such as working to develop relationships outside  of an outbreak and to improve how data are visualized. For example,  ASPR modelers and officials said they provided decision makers with a  website that displays an interactive influenza model known as ShinyFlu.  The website lets users adjust a model to see how its results could change  based on its inputs used. However, modelers said this only works if the  decision maker is willing to engage with data.", "Other steps to address communication challenges were not discussed by  all modelers we spoke to. For example, ASPR modelers said that, when  they use models with high uncertainty, they do additional research to  assess and communicate how a model could be misrepresenting a real- world problem. Additionally, CDC modelers responding to Zika and CDC  influenza modelers said they sometimes use the language of weather  forecasting\u2014which provides information on the risk of an event occurring  over a specified period of time\u2014to help communicate model outcomes.", "For all 10 of the models we reviewed, modelers communicated all the  information they had agreed to provide to decision makers, including  information about model uncertainty.

However, HHS does not  routinely monitor and evaluate its coordination efforts, as called for by  another leading collaboration practice, which limits the department\u2019s  ability to identify areas for improvement. Further, there is the potential for  overlap and duplication of modeling efforts across agencies, which may  not be identified if coordination efforts are not effectively being monitored,  and could lead to inefficiencies.

Finally, we reviewed CDC guidance on decision making  for data access and long-term preservation as it related to documentation  standards.", "Based on our review of identified literature, we developed a data  collection instrument to assess the extent to which CDC and ASPR used  the steps for infectious disease model development identified by experts  and in the literature. Through this data collection instrument, we  gathered information about the elements of developing and assessing  model performance and the steps that could be taken within each  element. In order to develop the data collection instrument, based on our  review of literature, we mapped out steps to develop and assess model  performance, and developed broad categories of assessment elements.  Within each assessment element, we included steps modelers could take  as a part of each assessment element. For example, the data collection  instrument included items that recorded model verification steps that  might have been taken by modeler(s) within the broader model  verification element. The instrument was reviewed by internal  stakeholders, who provided feedback on its content. Prior to sending the  data collection instrument to the agency, we filled in information on  verification steps taken for each of the 10 selected models, based on  provided model documentation to reflect steps we determined modelers  took as a part of the model development and assessment process. In  order to provide officials with this information, two analysts reviewed each  model\u2019s documentation, with one analyst providing an initial coding of the  model and the other reviewing and verifying the first analyst\u2019s findings.  This method was first tested on one of the 10 selected models by two  analysts independently coding information from the model\u2019s  documentation into the data collection instrument and then reviewing  coding choices to reconcile any differences found. We then sent the  instruments with filled-in information to CDC and ASPR modelers to  receive their feedback concerning the steps taken to develop models and  assess their performance, provide any missing information, and resolve  any ambiguities. See Appendix III for a list of the 10 selected models  reviewed and steps to develop and assess model performance included  in the data collection instrument. The data collection instrument was  intended to record whether a specific step had been taken, but did not  assess the quality of the modeling steps.", "In order to determine steps CDC and ASPR took to develop and assess  its models, we selected a non-generalizable sample of 10 models for  review in our data collection instrument that demonstrated steps that HHS  agencies took to develop models and assess their performance. The  model selection process described above informed our selection of  infectious disease models. To be selected for inclusion in our non- generalizable sample, the model had to be (1) developed by CDC, or  ASPR officials or contractors; (2) developed to answer a question about  Ebola, Zika, or pandemic influenza; and (3) used to inform public health  decision makers during an outbreak or for preparedness activities. We  selected 10 models that differed in form and answered different types of  questions, which included studies prepared during both outbreak  preparedness and response times, and covered topics such as the impact  of vaccination programs on deaths and hospitalization. For Ebola and  Zika, we focused on review of selected papers or memos produced since  2014 in order to capture the time period following the 2014-2016 Ebola  and 2015-2016 Zika outbreaks. For pandemic influenza, we focused on  papers and memos produced since 2009, when the H1N1 pandemic  occurred in the United States. Because we selected from a group of  models identified by HHS modelers and officials for Ebola, Zika, and  pandemic influenza, the results of our review cannot be generalized to  other diseases outside of the scope of this report. Furthermore, we  requested models that informed public health decision making, and did  not consider models that were not used for this purpose. Because we  reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 10 models, the results of our  review cannot be generalized to a larger population of models prepared  by HHS agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Effective Modeling", "paragraphs": ["To identify challenges associated with modeling for the selected  infectious diseases, we reviewed documents and reports to identify  modeling challenges and steps to address those challenges, and  interviewed agency officials and modelers, and experts identified through  the previously-described snowball sampling methodology.
