However, questions have been raised about the adequacy of performance information on services to veterans by these and other employment programs. In this report, GAO examined (1) the extent to which DVOP and LVER performance information reflects services and outcomes for veterans; (2) the extent to which performance information on veterans paints a clear picture of their use of one-stop services; and (3) what Labor is doing to improve the quality of performance data and better understand program impact and outcomes for veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Performance information for the DVOP and LVER programs provides some sense of services and outcomes for veterans, but is weakened by several factors. In July 2005, Labor adopted new performance measures for the programs, but not all have been fully implemented. For example, states are held accountable for helping veterans get and keep jobs, but are not yet held accountable for their average earnings once employed, as they are for other programs. Additionally, having separate performance measures for the DVOP and LVER programs fails to acknowledge the similarity of the populations they serve and duties they perform. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess outcomes over time or across states because of frequent changes in reporting requirements that prevent establishing reliable trend data. Labor's data on veteran job seekers paint an unclear picture of their use of other employment and training services in the one-stop system, despite the use of common performance measures across programs. Although many veterans use services other than those provided by the DVOP and LVER programs, key employment programs vary in how well their data on veteran job seekers are shared across programs, making it difficult to know how many veterans are served. In addition, statutory differences in the definitions of veterans hinder efforts to standardize data across employment programs. Moreover, Labor has no means of assessing whether priority of service for veterans has been implemented in various employment programs. Labor has taken some steps to improve the quality of performance data and better understand outcomes for veterans. For example, Labor requires states to validate key performance data. Labor has also planned an integrated data reporting system that would track individual veterans' progress through the one-stop system. However, states have raised concerns about the timelines and its current implementation date is unclear. Furthermore, while outcome information on veterans is helpful, it cannot measure whether the outcomes are due to the program or other factors. While Labor has sponsored research on services to veterans, it has not yet conducted the impact evaluation required by law to assess the effectiveness of one-stop services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 700,000 veterans are unemployed in any given month, and  Approximately 700,000 veterans are unemployed in any given month, and  roughly 200,000 service members leave active duty and transition to  roughly 200,000 service members leave active duty and transition to  civilian life each year, according to the Department of Labor (Labor).  civilian life each year, according to the Department of Labor (Labor).

Each quarter, states report a wide range of data to Labor on  demographics, services, and outcomes for veterans in the DVOP and LVER  programs. States are specifically held accountable for certain employment- related outcomes for all veterans\u2014whether veteran participants get and  keep jobs\u2014and separately, for the outcomes of some disabled and  recently separated veterans. JVA requires Labor to include information in  its annual report to Congress on whether veterans are receiving priority  and are being fully served by employment and training programs.  However, questions have been raised about whether available  performance information accurately reflects services and outcomes for  veterans. Moreover, outcome information alone cannot be used to  evaluate the effectiveness\u2014or impact\u2014of employment services for  veterans. Program outcomes may be attributable to factors other than a  program\u2019s services, such as local labor market conditions. In view of these  concerns and the changes to the performance accountability system  resulting from the Jobs for Veterans Act, you requested that we review the  performance information collected on employment and training programs  that serve veterans. Specifically, we examined (1) the extent to which  DVOP and LVER performance information reflects services and outcomes  for veterans served by these programs; (2) the extent to which  performance information on veterans served by other key programs paints  a clear picture of veterans\u2019 use of one-stop services and (3) what Labor is  doing to improve the quality of performance data and better understand  outcomes for veteran job seekers.", "To determine the extent to which available performance information  reflects services and outcomes for veteran job seekers, we administered a  nationwide Web-based survey to state workforce administrators in all   50 states and the District of Columbia. We received responses from all   51 administrators. In addition, we analyzed performance data from the  relevant programs and reviewed Labor\u2019s program guidance. To better  understand state and local variation in employment programs serving  veterans, we conducted site visits to three states: New Hampshire,  California, and Tennessee. We selected these states based on a range of  criteria, including geographic dispersion, state size and veteran  demographics, recent state performance in veterans\u2019 programs, and  recommendations by Labor and the National Association of State  Workforce Agencies.

JVA sought to address concerns that  the programs were overly prescriptive by providing states with enhanced  flexibility to determine the best way to serve veteran job seekers. Among  its reforms, JVA  redefined the DVOP specialist and LVER staff roles but gave states  flexibility in deciding their duties;    established a single state grant and a new funding formula that  allowed states to determine the mix of DVOP specialists and LVER  staff;  required a comprehensive performance accountability system  consistent with WIA performance measures;  required that veterans receive priority over other job seekers in all  Labor job training programs, not just the Employment Service; and  required that VETS include information in its annual report to  Congress on employment services to veterans throughout the   one-stop system.", "JVA identified broad roles and responsibilities of DVOP specialists and  LVER staff.

Specifically, in 1998, WIA  required that states use automated unemployment insurance wage records  to track employment-related outcomes. Formerly, to obtain data on  outcomes, states relied on a manual follow-up process using  administrative records or contacts with job seekers. To conform to WIA,  VETS moved from such a manual follow-up system to the new automated  process in 2002.", "The measures that Labor uses to assess performance in the DVOP and  LVER programs have also changed over time, gradually reflecting more  emphasis on outcome-based measures. Before passage of the JVA in 2002,  for example, some of the measures used for the DVOP and LVER programs  focused more on services received\u2014such as the number of veterans in  training or receiving counseling\u2014than on outcomes achieved. In 2002, JVA  required that Labor develop a comprehensive performance accountability  system and required that the new system measure performance in a way  that is consistent with WIA. In 2003, VETS adopted performance measures  for the DVOP and LVER programs based on those then used in WIA. In  2005, in response to an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiative,  Labor began requiring states to implement common performance  measures for its employment and training programs, including the DVOP  and LVER programs, the Employment Service, and WIA. OMB established  a set of common measures to be applied to most federally funded job  training programs that share similar goals. Labor further defined the  common measures for all of its Employment and Training Administration  programs, applying three measures to each of its adult programs (see   table 2).", "In applying the common measures to its programs, VETS also developed  additional measures to emphasize outcomes for disabled veterans in the  DVOP program and outcomes for recently separated veterans in the LVER  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Labor collects performance data for the DVOP and LVER programs on a  quarterly basis from state workforce agencies.

The experimental method is  often considered the most rigorous method for conducting impact  evaluations. In the experimental method, participants are randomly  assigned to two groups\u2014one that receives a program service (or  treatment) and one that does not (control group). The resulting outcome  data on both groups are compared and the difference in outcomes  between the groups is taken to demonstrate the programs impact.  However, it is not always feasible to use the experimental method for  assessing program impacts. Alternatively, researchers may use a quasi- experimental approach in which program participation is not randomly  assigned. One approach, often called a comparison group study, compares  outcome data for individuals who participated in the program with data on  others who did not participate for various reasons. In a comparison group  study, it is important to find ways to minimize, or statistically control for,  any differences between the two groups. According to OMB, well-matched  comparison group studies, under certain circumstances, can approach the  rigor of the experimental method, and it recommends considering this  method if random assignment is not feasible or appropriate.", "Under WIA, Labor was required to conduct at least one impact evaluation  of program services by 2005.

States are held accountable for four separate measures in each program  that focus on outcomes attained by veterans (see table 3). For the DVOP  program, states are held accountable for employment and retention for all  veterans served by the program, as well as for disabled veterans. For the  LVER program, states are assessed on employment and retention for all  veterans, as well as for recently separated veterans.

For the DVOP and LVER programs, however,  calculating the average earnings was not as straightforward as Labor had  anticipated. A VETS official told us that the agency will calculate baseline  data for average earnings during the current program year, but Labor will  not establish goals and states will not be held accountable for their  performance on this measure until the following year\u2014program year  2007\u2014at the earliest.", "Furthermore, Labor has not adopted a system to give more weight to  successful outcomes for veterans who have substantial barriers to  employment, such as a disability. JVA required Labor to weight  performance measures to provide special consideration to veterans  requiring intensive services, as well as disabled veterans. Such a weighting  system would compensate for the fact that veterans with barriers to  employment may need more assistance than others in finding jobs. It  would also provide an incentive for program staff to help veterans with  severe barriers to employment. For example, if a veteran has a disability  and requires intensive case management services, his or her successful  outcomes would have a greater effect on a state\u2019s overall performance  than those of other veterans with fewer barriers. Following JVA\u2019s  enactment, Labor formed a work group to develop a weighting system for  the DVOP and LVER performance measures. On the basis of the group\u2019s  work, the agency issued guidance to introduce the weighted measures to  states in June 2003, with the expectation of implementing them soon after.

Both DVOP and LVER staff are expected to  serve the general veteran population, but DVOP specialists are also  expected to target their services toward veterans who have greater  barriers to employment and need intensive case management, including  disabled veterans. JVA specifies that LVER staff focus on conducting  outreach to employers and assisting all veteran job seekers. In addition,  Labor has recently added the expectation that LVER staff focus their  responsibilities on assisting recently separated veterans. As a result of  these expectations, Labor separately holds DVOP specialists accountable  for the outcomes achieved by the disabled veterans they serve, and LVER  staff for the outcomes of the recently separated veterans they serve.", "In practice, however, both programs\u2019 staff serve similar veteran  populations. In program year 2005, for example, 14 percent of veterans  served by the DVOP program were disabled and 21 percent were recently  separated. For the LVER program, 10 percent of veterans served were  disabled and 19 percent were recently separated (see table 4). States  acknowledged this similarity in our survey as well.

Additionally, almost 60 percent of states responded that LVER staff  provide intensive services, a primary focus of the DVOP program.", "In our site visits, we found that this similarity in staff roles and target  populations exists in part because some one-stop centers have only a  single DVOP specialist or LVER staff on duty at any given time. In these  particular one-stop centers, the same employee is responsible for serving  all groups of veterans and carrying out job roles for both programs. Even  in centers with more than one staff person, veterans tend to be served by  whichever staff person is available at that time. Program staff in several  centers told us that recently separated veterans were not specifically  directed to LVER staff for services, nor were disabled veterans directed to  DVOP staff. This sharing of duties may be due, in part, to changes in  staffing levels. More than half of states reported a decrease in the number  of full-time DVOP specialists or LVER staff over the last 2 years, and most  attributed this decline to the size of their state grant for the programs.", "Nevertheless, this similarity in roles and populations served causes the  current performance measures to present an incomplete view of outcomes  for disabled and recently separated veterans in the DVOP and LVER  programs. The large numbers of disabled veterans served by the LVER  program and recently separated veterans served by the DVOP program are  not included in the set of measures that focus on the outcomes of those  populations (see fig. 1).", "Beyond the measures for disabled and recently separated veterans, having  separate measures for the DVOP and LVER programs obscures the overall  picture of outcomes to veterans, given the similarity between many of the  program activities and the reality of how the programs operate.

Labor requires states to  report a wide range of data for the DVOP and LVER programs, including  information on veteran characteristics\u2014such as age and disability status\u2014 and staff services provided\u2014such as intensive services and referrals to  other programs. However, Labor does not require data on employer  outreach activities, despite JVA\u2019s designation of employer outreach as a  primary job responsibility of LVER staff. Consequently, Labor and states  cannot formally monitor the extent to which staff perform this activity.  Some states, however, collect these data for their own use. According to  our survey, almost half of states currently collect employer-related  information for the DVOP and LVER programs, and over 75 percent of  states reported that it would be helpful to collect these data.", "In addition, even though the data reported to Labor generally reflect  services and outcomes for veterans, these data are aggregate tallies and do  not show services provided to individual veterans. For example, each  state\u2019s quarterly reports reflect the sum of all services provided and do not  show the number of services provided per veteran or per staff person.

These changes have moved  the performance accountability system closer to those of other  employment and training programs. At the same time, the changes have  resulted in a lack of reliable trend data. In July 2002, the DVOP and LVER  programs changed from using administrative follow-up to determine  veterans\u2019 employment outcomes to obtaining information from  Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records. In doing so, Labor changed  its method of calculating outcomes for veterans in the DVOP and LVER  programs. Then, in July 2005, Labor applied the common measures to  these two programs, refining and standardizing the application of UI wage  records to determine outcomes. Under the old system, Labor calculated  entered employment and employment retention rates based on the number  of veterans who participated in the programs. However, under the new  system, Labor calculated these rates based on how many veterans  terminate services and exit the programs. Although these changes have  standardized the performance measures across programs, they have also  prevented Labor and states from developing consistent, comparable data  over the past 5 years. As a result, Labor does not have reliable historic data  for either program. Figure 2 illustrates the various changes to the DVOP  and LVER programs\u2019 performance reporting requirements.", "Furthermore, the instability in data collection and reporting has left Labor  unable to establish a national veterans\u2019 entered employment standard, as  required by JVA. Labor anticipates that it will need at least 3 years of  stable data to establish the national standard. Once it is established, all  states will be held accountable to the same minimum goal for veterans\u2019  entered employment. However, it is unclear when Labor will have  sufficient data to establish this standard because states continue to  experience difficulty adjusting to the numerous changes. According to our  survey, over 70 percent of states reported that frequent changes to  performance reporting requirements have been either a great or very great  challenge.", "The data also vary somewhat state by state. For example, the application  of wage records to calculate veteran outcomes across state lines is no  longer consistent across states. The Wage Record Interchange System  (WRIS) allows states to share UI wage records and account for job seekers  who participate in one state\u2019s employment programs but get jobs in  another state. In recent years, all states but one participated in WRIS,  which was operated by the nonprofit National Association of State  Workforce Agencies. In July 2006, Labor assumed responsibility for  administering WRIS. However, many states have withdrawn, in part  because of a perceived conflict of interest between ETA\u2019s role in enforcing  federal law and the states\u2019 role in protecting the confidentiality of their  data. As of March 2007, only 30 states were participating in the program,  and it is unknown if and when the other states will enter the data-sharing  agreement. As a result, DVOP and LVER performance information in  almost half the states will not include employment outcomes for veterans  who found jobs outside the states in which they received services. In  addition, other reasons contribute to data variation by state. Labor allows  states flexibility in choosing data collection software, which has resulted  in some states adapting more quickly than others to the recent changes,  depending on their software capabilities. Several Labor officials told us  that because of differences in software capabilities, some states\u2019 data may  be more reliable than others\u2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Available Data Paint an Unclear Picture of Veterans\u2019 Use of One- Stop Services", "paragraphs": ["Labor\u2019s data on veteran job seekers paint an unclear picture of their use of  employment and training services in the one-stop system, despite the  shared use of common performance measures across programs.

According to our survey, veteran job seekers in  most states receive initial assistance from the Employment Service when  they access the one-stop system. If they are subsequently referred to the  DVOP and LVER programs, all of their information is housed in the same  system and an unduplicated count of veterans served between these  programs can be obtained. In addition, states are held accountable for  meeting separate goals in the Employment Service for veterans and  disabled veterans (see app. III). Labor considers these measures to reflect  veterans\u2019 outcomes for the entire one-stop system, as they constitute  outcomes for all veterans who access the Employment Service, DVOP, and  LVER programs. Furthermore, they are the best approximation of a total  count of veterans who access the one-stop system that the current data  will allow.", "On the other hand, data on veterans served by other one-stop programs  are not well integrated. States report data to Labor on WIA participants  who exit the programs, including veterans, using the Workforce  Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) system. Although  WIASRD contains sufficient information to produce separate veteran  outcome data for WIA programs, states are not required to produce  separate veteran reports and are not accountable for meeting veteran  goals in those programs. In addition, fewer than half the states reported  that they routinely match WIA and Employment Service records to attain  an unduplicated count of veterans served by those programs.  Consequently, veterans who access two different employment services  may be counted twice in some cases. Data for TAA participants are  reported to Labor in yet another data system, which does allow states to  report on the veteran status of participants, but Labor officials told us the  agency does not currently use veteran outcomes from that program for  any purpose. VETS does not include the veteran outcome data from WIA  or TAA in its annual report to Congress, and Labor officials told us they  are exploring ways to better use the data.", "In addition, data are not always collected on job seekers who use  Employment Service or WIA resources without assistance from program  staff.

For the  purposes of the DVOP and LVER programs, an eligible veteran is  statutorily defined as an individual who served on active duty for more  than 180 days. Labor also uses this definition for the Employment Service.  WIA, on the other hand, does not specify a length of time in service for a  person to be considered a veteran. Moreover, to qualify as a recently  separated veteran in the DVOP and LVER programs, a veteran must have  left active duty in the last 3 years. By contrast, WIA defines recently  separated as having left active duty in the last 4 years (see table 5).", "These inconsistent definitions have been difficult for Labor and states to  reconcile with the concept of seamless service delivery and have caused  some confusion for states as they implement priority of service throughout  the one-stop system. While JVA requires that veterans receive priority over  other job seekers in Labor-funded employment and training programs, it  does not define a veteran for purposes of the priority requirement. Labor  has interpreted JVA\u2019s provisions to mean that while veterans are to receive  preference in the programs after any other statutory eligibility  requirements are met, each program must use its own statutory definition  of a veteran in applying that preference. Labor officials told us that one  state applied for a waiver in 2006 to use a single definition of veterans for  all of its employment and training programs, but Labor\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s Office  orally denied the request. In our survey, approximately half of all states  reported that the conflicting veteran definitions in various employment  programs complicate data entry, referrals to other programs, and the  implementation of priority of service. In addition, about a third of the  states claimed that the definitions created gaps in services for veteran  clients as they moved among employment programs (see fig. 5). For  example, if a veteran receives services from WIA and is subsequently  referred to the DVOP program but is found ineligible, he or she may  become discouraged and stop seeking services altogether.", "Almost half of states shared their concerns about different definitions by  providing additional comments in our survey, many of which cited the  difficulty of providing priority of service under these circumstances. For  example, one state responded that different definitions often lead to  inappropriate referrals, resulting in poor customer service and frustration  for program participants and service providers. Other states focused on  the burden that competing definitions placed on data collection and  reporting. For example, one state responded that the issue has made it  difficult to integrate the state\u2019s Employment Service and WIA data  systems, because the different definitions could lead to invalidating the  veteran numbers on reports for those programs. Another state cited the  difficulty in assessing how many veterans were served by the state,  highlighting the complexity of producing an unduplicated count of  veterans served by different programs that do not share a single definition.  States also cited challenges in dealing with other agencies that are not  mandated partners in the one-stop system. For example, two states  mentioned that some staff of other agencies\u2019 programs may hesitate to  refer participants to the DVOP and LVER programs because they are  unsure about participant eligibility.

In its fiscal year 2005 report, Labor stated that the  participation rate for veterans in its adult programs was approximately   8.4 percent\u2014slightly higher than veterans\u2019 participation rates in the U.S.  workforce.

We do not know when Labor will develop  further guidance on the issue. However, in December 2006, Congress  passed the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology  Act of 2006, which included a requirement that Labor release regulations  on implementing priority of service within 2 years.

While element validation in WIA is conducted on- site with hardcopy source documentation, the Employment Service data  validation process is performed centrally and electronically, because  Employment Service records are generally electronic. The Employment  Service element validation process checks for duplicate or invalid entries  in source files by, for example, checking for inconsistencies among  various veteran-related fields, such as veteran status and disabled veteran.  However, the Employment Service element validation process cannot  check the underlying accuracy of the data, because there is no hard copy  documentation to prove whether a participant is in fact a veteran.", "Labor officials told us that the Employment Service data validation  process has been helpful in raising awareness among states about the  importance of data quality and that some states have come to see it as a  useful tool. Additionally, states responding to our survey generally agreed  that it has been effective\u201438 states, or about 75 percent, rated the  Employment Service data validation process as effective in ensuring the  accuracy of veteran job seekers\u2019 information. For example, according to  one respondent, review of the data validation results is used as a  management tool, to highlight successes and to alert staff to weaknesses.  Nevertheless, some states have expressed concerns about the data  validation processes. Concerns about the process were also raised by state  officials in all 3 of the states we visited. For example, officials in 2 of the   3 states noted that they had experienced difficulties adjusting to frequent  changes in software before the results were due to Labor. On our survey,   2 states said that the sample size was too small to be meaningful, and   4 states expressed concerns about the fact that the process does not verify  the accuracy of the data in source files. These concerns are similar to  those we identified in a previous report that addressed the WIA process.", "Additionally, Labor has taken steps to address data quality as a part of its  routine monitoring and technical assistance. Specifically, beginning in  2004, ETA regional staff have incorporated a data quality component into  compliance visits to state offices, which are generally conducted once or  twice a year, according to Labor officials. Data validation is just one  component of these compliance visits, which typically do not focus on  veterans\u2019 data as a separate issue. To support this effort, Labor officials  told us that ETA has amended its monitoring guide for these visits to  include a section on data validation. According to Labor officials, these  visits have been useful in identifying problems and corrective actions.  Moreover, ETA and VETS have recently collaborated on a few of these  compliance visits. Labor officials said they believed this joint monitoring  was beneficial, and expect those efforts to be a model for future joint  visits.", "There are several other forms of management reviews that generally focus  on services to veterans but also offer a chance to review data. For  example, VETS regional and state-based staff conduct site visits as part of  their routine monitoring, which focus primarily on services to veterans but  which can include reviewing performance information as well.  Additionally, VETS has required a series of annual assessments\u2014of the  program for each state overall, and self-assessments by DVOP specialists,  LVER staff, and one-stop managers\u2014that address data issues to a limited  extent.

The modified system,  now called the Workforce Investment Streamlined Performance Reporting  System (WISPR), was planned with a July 2007 implementation date.", "WISPR has been designed to both integrate and expand data reporting.   If implemented, the system would integrate data reporting by using  standardized reporting requirements across the Employment Service,  DVOP and LVER, WIA, and TAA programs, and ultimately replace their  preexisting reporting systems with a single reporting structure.  Additionally, it would rely on a standardized set of data elements and  quarterly reports to provide data on participant characteristics and  services provided, as well as performance outcomes based on the common  measures. Its integrated design would, for the first time, allow Labor and  states to track individual veterans\u2019 progress through the one-stop system.", "In addition, the system would expand data collection and reporting in two  key areas: the services that LVER staff provide to employers, a key aspect  of the LVER role on which Labor currently collects no data, and estimates  of the population of veterans who access the one-stop system but  ultimately receive limited or no services from one-stop staff.", "As with EMILE, however, concerns have been raised about challenges in  implementing the new system, and at present, the timeline for WISPR\u2019s  implementation remains unclear. Some of the comments received by OMB  during the official comment period noted the challenge of a July 2007  implementation date, according to a Labor official. While states will have a  2-year period to consolidate reporting on the full range of programs, they  are expected to begin collecting and reporting data in the new format  immediately. As of December 2006, 39 entities, including state workforce  agencies, local agencies and unions, had submitted comments reflecting  their concerns about WISPR to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB). Of the 20 states that submitted comments, 14 noted that a July  2007 implementation date would represent a challenge. For example, some  of them expressed the view that Labor had underestimated the time states  would need to revise policy, reprogram systems, and retrain staff.

To measure the effects of a program, it  is necessary to conduct an impact evaluation that would seek to assess  whether the program itself led to participant outcomes. Labor has not  conducted an impact evaluation of one-stop services, including those to  veterans. However, the department did sponsor a study, issued in 2003,  that examined the relationship between services provided to certain  groups of veterans and employment and earnings outcomes.

While WIA required one such  evaluation by 2005, Labor has declined to fund one in prior budgets. In a  2004 report, we recommended that Labor comply with the requirements of  WIA and conduct an impact evaluation of WIA services to better  understand what services are most effective for improving employment- related outcomes. In response to our report, Labor cited the need for  program stability and proposed delaying an impact evaluation of WIA until  any changes that might be included in reauthorization legislation had been  implemented. While efforts to reauthorize WIA began in 2003, they have  stalled and it is not clear at this time when they will be complete.  Furthermore, OMB has also found Labor\u2019s evaluations of WIA services to  be lacking.

Further, Labor  cannot provide assurance that veterans are appropriately given service  priority by programs in the one-stop system, or that services to veterans  are truly effective. The federal government spends about $155 million each  year on the DVOP and LVER programs alone, not counting the amounts  spent on veterans who use other one-stop programs, but there is no  information on whether these programs have an impact in helping this  important population.
