Most federal agencies face long-standing challenges, which are discussed in greater detail in our mandated September 2003 report, Sustained Efforts Needed to Achieve FFMIA Accountability (GAO-03-1062).

As you requested, our testimony today addresses the  recurring financial management systems problems that agencies are facing  and the status of their efforts to implement systems that substantially  comply with FFMIA.", "As you know, FFMIA builds on the foundation laid by the Chief Financial  Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 by reflecting the need for agencies to have  financial management systems that can generate timely, accurate, and  useful information with which to make informed decisions and to ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis.  FFMIA requires the major departments  and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and maintain financial  management systems that comply substantially with the (1) federal  financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal  accounting standards, and (3) U.S. Government Standard General Ledger  (SGL) at the transaction level.  Further, FFMIA requires auditors to report  in their CFO Act financial statement audit reports whether the agencies\u2019  financial management systems comply with FFMIA\u2019s requirements.  We are  also required to report annually on the implementation of the act.", "As discussed in our recently issued annual report on FFMIA, the results of  the fiscal year 2002 FFMIA assessments performed by agency inspectors  general (IG) or their contract auditors again show that the same types of  problems still plague the financial management systems used by the CFO  Act agencies.  While much more severe at some agencies than others, the  nature and severity of the problems indicate that overall, agency  management lacks the full range of information needed for accountability,  performance reporting, and decision making.  While the CFO Act agencies  have obtained more clean or unqualified audit opinions on their financial  statements, often through extraordinary, labor-intensive measures, there is  little evidence of marked improvements in agencies\u2019 capacities to create  the full range of information needed to manage day-to-day operations.  As  we have previously testified before this Subcommittee, if agencies  continue year after year to rely on significant costly and time-intensive  manual efforts to achieve or maintain unqualified opinions without  improving underlying financial management systems, it can mislead the  public about the true status of the agencies\u2019 financial management  capabilities.", "Agencies have recognized the seriousness of the financial systems  weaknesses, and have many efforts underway to implement or upgrade  financial systems to alleviate long-standing problems.  As of September 30,  2002, 17 CFO Act agencies advised us they were planning to or were in the  process of implementing a new core financial system.  Under the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-127, Financial Management  Systems, agencies are required to purchase commercial off-the-shelf  (COTS) packages sold by vendors whose core financial systems software  has been certified. Some of the key factors that affect FFMIA compliance  of an implemented COTS package include how the software works in the  agency\u2019s environment, whether any customizations or modifications have  been made to the software, and the success of converting data from legacy  systems to new systems.", "Successful implementation efforts of financial management systems are  supported by the presence of several key characteristics, which apply to  both the public and private sectors.  These characteristics include, among  others, (1) involvement by the users, (2) support of executive management,  (3) leadership provided by experienced project managers, (4) clear  definition and management of project requirements, (5) proper planning,  and (6) realistic expectations.  Conversely, financial systems  implementation projects are often hindered by the lack of executive  support, poor communication between managers and stakeholders, poor  estimations and planning, and poor documentation and updating of user  requirements.", "To provide impetus for upgrading financial management systems that  provide reliable, timely, and useful data, congressional oversight, the Joint  Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) Principals, and the  President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA) are driving forces behind several  governmentwide efforts now underway to improve federal financial  management.  The Congress has demonstrated leadership in improving  federal financial management by enacting financial management reform  laws and through oversight hearings, such as this one today.  The JFMIP  Principals have continued the series of regular deliberative meetings that  focus on key financial management reform issues.  The PMA, being  implemented by the administration as an agenda for improving the  management and performance of the federal government, includes five  crosscutting initiatives, including improved financial performance.  Continued attention by these key drivers is critical to sustaining agencies\u2019  efforts to improve their financial management systems.", "My statement today will focus on these issues and discuss (1) auditors\u2019  determinations of FFMIA compliance for fiscal year 2002, (2) problems that  affect agency systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA, (3) agency efforts to  implement new core financial systems, (4) key characteristics of successful  systems implementation and the challenges federal agencies face, and  (5) the status of governmentwide financial management improvement  efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Auditors\u2019 Assessments of FFMIA Compliance for Fiscal Year 2002", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2002, Inspectors General and their contract auditors  reported that the systems for 19 of the 24 CFO Act agencies did not comply  substantially with at least one of the FFMIA requirements\u2014federal  financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting  standards, or the SGL.  Auditors\u2019 assessments of financial systems\u2019  compliance with FFMIA for 3 agencies\u2014the Department of Labor (DOL),  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Science  Foundation (NSF)\u2014changed from fiscal years 2001 to 2002.  For fiscal year  2002, the auditors for DOL concluded that its systems were not in  substantial compliance with the managerial cost standard and thus were  not in compliance with FFMIA.  Auditors for EPA and NSF found the  agencies\u2019 respective systems to be in substantial compliance, a change  from the fiscal year 2001 assessments.", "As we have testified previously,while the number of agencies receiving  clean opinions increased over the past 6 years from 11 in fiscal year 1997 to  21 for fiscal year 2002, the number of agencies reported to have systems  that lacked substantial compliance with FFMIA has remained steady.  While the increase in unqualified opinions is noteworthy, a more important  barometer of financial systems\u2019 capability and reliability is that the number  of agencies for which auditors provided negative assurance of FFMIA  compliance has remained relatively constant throughout this same period.  In our view, this has led to an expectation gap.  When more agencies  receive clean opinions, expectations are raised that the government has  sound financial management and can produce reliable, useful, and timely  information on demand throughout the year, whereas FFMIA assessments  offer a different perspective.  For agencies equipped with modern, fully  integrated financial management systems, preparation of financial  statements would be more routine and much less costly.", "Auditors for the remaining five agencies\u2014the Department of Energy, EPA,  the General Services Administration (GSA), NSF, and the Social Security  Administration (SSA)\u2014provided negative assurance in reporting on FFMIA  compliance for fiscal year 2002.  In their respective reports, they included  language stating that while they did not opine as to FFMIA compliance,  nothing came to their attention during the course of their planned  procedures indicating that these agencies\u2019 financial management systems  did not meet FFMIA requirements.  If readers do not understand the  concept of negative assurance, they may have gained an incorrect  impression that these systems have been fully tested by the auditors and  found to be substantially compliant.  Because the act requires auditors to  \u201creport whether\u201d agency systems are substantially compliant, we believe  the auditor needs to provide positive assurance, which would be a  definitive statement as to whether agency financial management systems  substantially comply with FFMIA, as required under the statute.  This is  what we will do for the financial statement audits we perform when  reporting that an entity\u2019s financial management systems were in substantial  compliance.  To provide positive assurance, auditors need to consider  many other aspects of financial management systems than those applicable  to the purposes of rendering an opinion on the financial statements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Widespread Systems Problems Affect FFMIA Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of the fiscal year 2002 audit reports for the 19 agencies  reported to have systems not in substantial compliance with one or more of  FFMIA\u2019s three requirements, we identified six primary problems affecting  FFMIA noncompliance: nonintegrated financial management systems,  lack of accurate and timely recording of financial information, noncompliance with the SGL,  lack of adherence to federal accounting standards, and weak security controls over information systems.", "The relative frequency of these problemsat the 19 agencies reported as  having noncompliant systems is shown in figure 1.  In addition, we caution  that the occurrence of problems in a particular category may be even  greater than auditors\u2019 reports of FFMIA noncompliance would suggest  because auditors may not have included all problems in their reports.  FFMIA testing may not be comprehensive and other problems may exist  that were not identified and reported.  For example, at some agencies, the  problems are so serious and well known that the auditor can readily  determine that the systems are not substantially compliant without  examining every facet of FFMIA compliance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonintegrated Financial Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["The CFO Act calls for agencies to develop and maintain an integrated  accounting and financial management system that complies with federal  systems requirements and provides for (1) complete, reliable, consistent,  and timely information that is responsive to the financial information needs  of the agency and facilitates the systematic measurement of performance,  (2) the development and reporting of cost management information, and  (3) the integration of accounting and budgeting information.  In this regard,  OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, requires agencies to  establish and maintain a single integrated financial management system  that conforms with functional requirements published by JFMIP.", "An integrated financial system coordinates a number of functions to  improve overall efficiency and control.  For example, integrated financial  management systems are designed to avoid unnecessary duplication of  transaction entry and greatly lessen reconciliation issues.  With integrated  systems, transactions are entered only once and are available for multiple  purposes or functions.  Moreover, with an integrated financial management  system, an agency is more likely to have reliable, useful, and timely  financial information for day-to-day decision making as well as external  reporting.", "Agencies that do not have integrated financial management systems  typically must expend major effort and resources, including in some cases  hiring external consultants, to develop information that their systems  should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis.  In addition,  opportunities for errors are increased when agencies\u2019 systems are not  integrated.  Agencies with nonintegrated financial systems are more likely  to be required to devote more resources to collecting information than  those with integrated systems.", "Auditors frequently mentioned the lack of modern, integrated financial  management systems in their fiscal year 2002 audit reports.  As shown in  figure 1, auditors for 12 of the 19 agencies with noncompliant systems  reported this as a problem.  For example, auditors for the Department of  Transportation (DOT) reported that its major agencies still use the  Departmental Accounting and Financial Information System (DAFIS), the  existing departmentwide accounting system and cannot produce  auditable financial statements based on the information in DAFIS.  For  example, DOT\u2019s IG reported that DOT made about 860 adjustments outside  of DAFIS totaling $51 billion in order to prepare the financial statements.DOT\u2019s IG also reported that there were problems linking some information  between DAFIS and the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Fiscal  Management Information System (FMIS).  DOT uses FMIS to record initial  obligations for federal aid grants to states.  However, due to problems  resulting from upgrades and changes made to the FMIS system, all  obligations are not electronically transferred from FMIS to DAFIS.  As of  September 30, 2002, valid obligations of about $388 million were  understated.  Moreover, problems linking information also existed between  Delphi, DOT\u2019s new financial management system, and the Federal Transit  Administration\u2019s (FTA) financial feeder systems that prevented FTA from  electronically processing about $350 million in payments related to its  Electronic Clearing House Operation.  These transactions had to be  manually processed into Delphi.  What is important here is that the  information developed to prepare auditable annual financial statements is  not available on an ongoing basis for day-to-day management of DOT\u2019s  programs and operations.", "As we have reported, cultural resistance to change, military service  parochialism, and stovepiped operations have played a significant role in  impeding previous attempts to implement broad-based reforms at the  Department of Defense (DOD).  The department\u2019s stovepiped approach is  most evident in its current financial management systems environment,  which DOD recently estimated to include approximately 2,300 systems and  systems development projects\u2014many of which were developed in  piecemeal fashion and evolved to accommodate different organizations,  each with its own policies and procedures.  As DOD management has  acknowledged, the department\u2019s current financial environment is  comprised of many discrete systems characterized by poor integration and  minimal data standardization and prevents managers from making more  timely and cost-effective decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Reconciliation Procedures", "paragraphs": ["A reconciliation process, even if performed manually, is a valuable part of a  sound financial management system.  In fact, the less integrated the  financial management system, the greater the need for adequate  reconciliations because data are accumulated from various sources.  For  example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) IG  reported that the department\u2019s lack of an integrated financial  management system continues to impair the ability of certain operating  divisions to prepare timely information.  Moreover, certain reconciliation  processes were not adequately performed to ensure that differences were  properly identified, researched, and resolved in a timely manner and that  account balances were complete and accurate.  Reconciliations are needed  to ensure that data have been recorded properly between the various  systems and manual records.  The Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government highlights reconciliation as a  key control activity.", "As shown in figure 1, auditors for 11 of the 19 agencies with noncompliant  systems reported that the agencies had reconciliation problems, including  difficulty reconciling their fund balance with Treasury accounts with  Treasury\u2019s records.  Treasury policy requires agencies to reconcile their  accounting records with Treasury records monthly, which is comparable to  individuals reconciling their checkbooks to their monthly bank statements.  As we recently testified, DOD had at least $7.5 billion in unexplained  differences between Treasury and DOD fund activity records.  Many of  these differences represent disbursements made and reported to Treasury  that had not yet been properly matched to obligations and recorded in DOD  accounting records.  In addition to these unreconciled amounts, DOD  identified and reported an additional $3.6 billion in payment recording  errors.  These include disbursements that DOD has specifically identified  as containing erroneous or missing information and that cannot be  properly recorded and charged against the correct, valid fund account.  DOD records many of these payment problems in suspense accounts.  While DOD made $1.6 billion in unsupported adjustments to its fund  balances at the end of fiscal year 2002 to account for a portion of these  payment recording errors, these adjustments did not resolve the related  errors.", "Inadequate reconciliation procedures also complicate the identification  and elimination of intragovernmental activity and balances, which is one of  the principal reasons we continue to disclaim on the government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements.  As we testified in April 2003, agencies  had not reconciled intragovernmental activity and balances with their  trading partners and, as a result, information reported to Treasury is not  reliable.  For several years, OMB and Treasury have required CFO Act  agencies to reconcile selected intragovernmental activity and balances  with their trading partners.  However, a substantial number of CFO Act  agencies did not perform such reconciliations for fiscal years 2002 and  2001, citing such reasons as (1) trading partners not providing needed data,  (2) limitations and incompatibility of agency and trading partner systems,  and (3) human resource issues.  For both of these years, amounts reported  for federal trading partners for certain intragovernmental accounts were  significantly out of balance.

Accurate  and timely recording of financial information is key to successful financial  management.  Timely recording of transactions can facilitate accurate  reporting in agencies\u2019 financial reports and other management reports that  are used to guide managerial decision making.  The Comptroller General\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and  value to management in controlling operations and making decisions.", "Untimely recording of transactions during the fiscal year can result in  agencies making substantial efforts at fiscal year-end to perform extensive  manual financial statement preparation efforts that are susceptible to error  and increase the risk of misstatements.  Gathering financial data only at  year-end does not provide adequate time to analyze transactions or account  balances.  Further, it impedes management\u2019s ability throughout the year to  have timely and useful information for decision making.  For example,  auditors reported that, for fiscal year 2002, Department of Justice  (Justice) components did not adjust the status of obligations on a quarterly  basis as required, and as a result, extensive manual efforts had to be  performed at year-end to correct the status of obligation records.  This  process of reviewing the status of obligations only at the end of the year  increases the risk that errors will go undetected, does not provide  managers with accurate information during the year for decision making,  and results in misstatements in the financial statements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Noncompliance with the SGL", "paragraphs": ["Implementing the SGL at the transaction level is one of the specific  requirements of FFMIA.  However, as shown in figure 1, auditors for 9 of  the 19 noncompliant agencies reported that the agencies\u2019 systems did not  comply with SGL requirements.  The SGL promotes consistency in financial  transaction processing and reporting by providing a uniform chart of  accounts and pro forma transactions.  Use of the SGL also provides a basis  for comparison at agency and governmentwide levels.  These defined  accounts and pro forma transactions are used to standardize the  accumulation of agency financial information, as well as enhance financial  control and support financial statement preparation and other external  reporting.  By not implementing the SGL, agencies are challenged to  provide consistent financial information across their components and  functions.", "As in previous years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s  (HUD) auditors reported that the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s (FHA)  systems were noncompliant with the SGL for fiscal year 2002 because FHA  must use several manual processing steps to convert its commercial  accounts to SGL accounts.FHA\u2019s 19 legacy insurance systems, which fed  transactions to its commercial general ledger system, lacked the  capabilities to process transactions in the SGL format.  Therefore, FHA  provided only consolidated summary-level data to HUD\u2019s Central  Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS).  As we reported, FHA used  several manual processing steps to provide summary-level data, including  the use of personal-computer-based software to convert the summary-level  commercial accounts to government SGL, and transfer the balances to  HUDCAPS.  This process did not comply with JFMIP requirements that the  core financial system provide for automated month- and year-end closing of  SGL accounts and the roll-over of the SGL account balances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Adherence to Federal Accounting Standards", "paragraphs": ["One of FFMIA\u2019s requirements is that agencies\u2019 financial management  systems account for transactions in accordance with federal accounting  standards.  Agencies face significant challenges implementing these  standards.  As shown in figure 1, auditors for 13 of the 19 agencies with  noncompliant systems reported that these agencies had problems  complying with one or more federal accounting standards.  Auditors  reported that agencies are having problems implementing standards that  have been in effect for some time, as well as standards that have been  promulgated in the last few years.  For example, auditors for three  agencies\u2014DOD, Justice, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)\u2014reported weaknesses in compliance with Statement of Federal  Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 6, Accounting for Property,  Plant, and Equipment, which became effective for fiscal year 1998.  Auditors for DOD reported that DOD did not capture the correct  acquisition date and cost of its property, plant, and equipment, due to  system limitations.", "Therefore, DOD could not provide reliable information for reporting  account balances and computing depreciation.  Auditors for two  agencies\u2014HUD and Justice\u2014reported weaknesses in compliance with  SFFAS No. 7, Revenue and Other Financing Sources, which also became  effective for fiscal year 1998.  For example, auditors reported a material  weakness for FHA\u2019s budget execution and fund control.  According to the  auditors, FHA\u2019s financial systems and processes are not capable of fully  monitoring and controlling budgetary resources.  Finally, auditors for three  agencies\u2014the Agency for International Development (AID), the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC)\u2014reported trouble with implementing SFFAS No. 10,  Accounting for Internal Use Software, which became effective at the  beginning of fiscal year 2001.  For example, auditors reported that NASA\u2019s  policies and procedures do not specifically address purchasing software as  part of a package of products and services.  In their testing, NASA\u2019s auditors  identified errors for costs that were originally recorded as expenses, but  instead should have been capitalized as assets.", "Managerial cost information is required by the CFO Act of 1990, and since  1998 by a federal accounting standard.  Auditors for five agencies reported  problems implementing SFFAS No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting  Concepts and Standards.  For example, auditors for DOL reported that the  department has not developed the capability to routinely report the cost of  outputs used to manage program operations at the operating program and  activity levels.  Moreover, DOL does not use managerial cost information  for purposes of performance measurement, planning, budgeting, or  forecasting.  At DOT, auditors stated that its agencies, other than the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, have  begun to identify requirements for implementing cost accounting systems.  DOT\u2019s existing accounting system, DAFIS, does not have the capability to  capture full costs, including direct and indirect costs assigned to DOT  programs.  The Secretary recently advised OMB that as the remaining DOT  agencies migrate to Delphi, DOT\u2019s new core financial system, Delphi will  provide them with enhanced cost accounting capabilities.", "Managerial cost information is critical for implementing the PMA.  According to the PMA, the accomplishment of the other four crosscutting  initiatives will matter little without the integration of agency budgets with  performance.  Although the lack of a consistent information and reporting  framework for performance, budgeting, and accounting may obscure how  well government programs are performing as well as inhibit comparisons,  no one presentation can meet all users\u2019 needs.  Any framework should  support an understanding of the links between performance, budgeting,  and accounting information measured and reported for different purposes.  However, even the most meaningful links between performance results and  resources consumed are only as good as the underlying data.  Moreover,  this link between resources consumed and performance results is  necessary to make public-private competition decisions as part of  competitive sourcing.  Therefore, agencies must address long-standing  problems within their financial systems.  As agencies implement and  upgrade their financial management systems, opportunities exist for  developing cost management information as an integral part of these  systems to provide important information that is timely, reliable, and  useful.", "As we recently reported,DOD\u2019s continuing inability to capture and report  the full cost of its programs represents one of the most significant  impediments facing the department.  DOD does not have the systems and  processes in place to capture the required cost information from the  hundreds of millions of transactions it processes each year.  Lacking  complete and accurate overall life-cycle cost information for weapons  systems impairs DOD\u2019s and congressional decisionmakers\u2019 ability to make  fully informed decisions about which weapons, or how many, to buy.

These weaknesses are placing enormous  amounts of government assets at risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse,  financial information at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction,  sensitive information at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical  operations at risk of disruption.  Auditors for all 19 of the agencies reported  as noncompliant with FFMIA identified weaknesses in security controls  over information systems.  Unresolved information security weaknesses  could adversely affect the ability of agencies to produce accurate data for  decision making and financial reporting because such weaknesses could  compromise the reliability and availability of data that are recorded in or  transmitted by an agency\u2019s financial management system.", "General controls are the policies, procedures, and technical controls that  apply to all or a large segment of an entity\u2019s information systems and help  ensure their proper operation.  The six major areas are (1) security  program management, which provides the framework for ensuring that  risks are understood and that effective controls are selected and properly  implemented, (2) access controls, which ensure that only authorized  individuals can read, alter, or delete data, (3) software development and  change controls, which ensure that only authorized software programs are  implemented, (4) segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that one  individual can independently perform inappropriate actions without  detection, (5) operating systems controls, which protect sensitive  programs that support multiple applications from tampering and misuse,  and (6) service continuity, which ensures that computer-dependent  operations experience no significant disruption.  As we discussed in our  April 2003 testimony, our analyses of audit reports issued from October  2001 through October 2002 for 24 of the largest federal agenciescontinued to show significant weaknesses in federal computer systems that  put critical operations and assets at risk.  Weaknesses continued to be  reported in each of the 24 agencies included in our review, and they  covered all six major areas of general controls.  Although our analyses  showed that most agencies had significant weaknesses in these six control  areas, weaknesses were most often cited for access controls and security  program management.", "Since 1997, GAO has considered information security a governmentwide  high-risk area. As shown by our work and work performed by the IGs,  security program management continues to be a widespread problem.  Concerned with reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, the Congress enacted  Government Information Security Reform provisions (commonly known  as GISRA) to reduce these risks and provide more effective oversight of  federal information security.  GISRA required agencies to implement an  information security program that is founded on a continuing risk  management cycle and largely incorporates existing security policies found  in OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources.  GISRA provided an overall framework for managing information security  and established new annual review, independent evaluation, and reporting  requirements to help ensure agency implementation and both OMB and  congressional oversight.", "In its required fiscal year 2002 GISRA report to the Congress, OMB stated  that the federal government had made significant strides in addressing  serious and pervasive information technology security problems, but that  more needed to be done, particularly to address both the governmentwide  weaknesses identified in its fiscal year 2001 report to the Congress and new  challenges. Also, OMB reported significant progress in agencies\u2019  information technology security performance, primarily as indicated by  quantitative governmentwide performance measures that OMB required  agencies to disclose beginning with their fiscal year 2002 reports. These  include measures such as the number of systems that have been assessed  for risk, have an up-to-date security plan, and for which security controls  have been tested.", "As discussed in our June 2003 testimony, the governmentwide  weaknesses identified by OMB, as well as the limited progress in  implementing key information security requirements, continue to  emphasize that, overall, agencies are not effectively implementing and  managing their information security programs.  For example, of the 24  large federal agencies we reviewed, 11 reported that they had assessed risk  for 90 to 100 percent of their systems for fiscal year 2002, but 8 reported  that they had assessed risk for less than half of their systems.", "The information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements  established by GISRA have been permanently authorized and strengthened  through the recently enacted Federal Information Security Management  Act of 2002 (FISMA). In addition, FISMA provisions establish additional  requirements that can assist the agencies in implementing effective  information security programs, help ensure that agency systems  incorporate appropriate controls, and provide information for  administration and congressional oversight.

The other 6 agencies have not reached the  software selection phase of their acquisition process.", "Implementing a core financial system that has been certified does not  guarantee that these agencies will have financial systems that are  compliant with FFMIA.  Certification of core financial systems and testing  vendor COTS packages help ensure that financial management system  requirements and the vendor software remain aligned. One critical factor  affecting FFMIA compliance is the integration of the core financial system  with the agency\u2019s administrative and programmaticsystems and the  validity and completeness of data from these systems.  Other factors  affecting a COTS core financial system\u2019s ability to comply with FFMIA  include how the software package works in the agency\u2019s environment,  whether any modifications or customizations have been made to the  software, and the success of converting data from legacy systems to new  systems. As of September 30, 2002, target implementation dates for 16 of  the 17 agencies planning to implement new core financial systems ranged  from fiscal years 2003 to 2008.  One agency\u2014DOD\u2014had not yet  determined its target date for full implementation.  As shown in figure 2, 3  of the 16 agencies\u2014Agriculture, GSA, and NASA\u2014planned to complete  implementation in fiscal year 2003.  Three other agencies\u2014SSA,  Commerce, and DOT\u2014planned to complete their implementations in fiscal  year 2004.  The Department of Energy established fiscal year 2005 as its  target implementation date and 3 agencies\u2014the departments of State and  Veterans Affairs and AID\u2014have targeted fiscal year 2006 for completion.  Moreover, as shown in figure 2, 4 agencies\u2014DOL, HHS, EPA, and HUD\u2014  have set fiscal year 2007 as their implementation target date.  Finally, 2  agencies\u2014the Departments of the Interior and Justice\u2014projected fiscal  year 2008 for completion of their core financial systems implementation.", "The remaining 7 of the 24 CFO Act agencies that advised us that they had  no plans to implement a new system had either recently implemented a  new core financial system in the last several years or were not planning to  implement an agencywide core financial system.  Five of the 7 agencies had  fully implemented new core financial systems since the beginning of fiscal  year 2001\u2014including the Department of Education, NSF, NRC, the Small  Business Administration (SBA), and OPM.  FEMA had implemented a new  system prior to fiscal year 2001.  The remaining agency, Treasury, is not  planning to implement an agencywide core financial system, but several of  its subcomponent agencies\u2014including the Internal Revenue Service and  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2014are in the process of  implementing core financial system software packages.", "In their performance and accountability reports, management for some  agencies stated that full implementation of these new systems will address  their systems\u2019 substantial noncompliance with FFMIA.   However, as  previously mentioned, implementation of a new core financial system may  not resolve all of an agency\u2019s financial management weaknesses because of  the myriad of problems affecting agencies beyond their core financial  systems.  Nevertheless, it is imperative that agencies adopt leading  practices to help ensure successful systems implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful Implementation of Financial Management Systems Is Key for Improved Financial Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Implementing new financial management systems provides a foundation  for improved financial management, including enhanced financial  reporting capabilities that will help financial managers meet OMB\u2019s  accelerated reporting deadlines and make better financial management  decisions due to more timely information. Successful implementation of  financial management systems has been a continuous challenge for both  federal agencies and private sector entities.  In the past, federal agencies  have experienced setbacks and delays in their implementation processes.  These delays were caused by various factors, including a lack of executive- level involvement, poor communication between managers and users, and  inadequate project planning.  For example, our work at NASA has shown  the need for consistent executive support, communication with all  stakeholders, full identification of user requirements, and adequate  planning.", "Recent work at NASA illustrates some of the specific problems agencies  are encountering in implementing JFMIP-certified financial systems.  In  April 2000, NASA began its Integrated Financial Management Program  (IFMP), its third attempt in recent years at modernizing financial processes  and systems.  NASA\u2019s previous two efforts were eventually abandoned after  a total of 12 years and a reported $180 million in spending.  As part of this  third effort, NASA recently implemented a new core financial module that  was expected to provide financial and program managers with timely,  consistent, and reliable cost and performance information for management  decisions.  However, earlier this year we reported that NASA\u2019s core  financial module was not being implemented to accommodate the  information needed by program managers, cost estimators, and the  Congress.  The need for ongoing communication between project  managers and systems users is crucial to any successful systems  implementation project.  Project managers need to understand the basic  requirements of users, while users should be involved in the project\u2019s  planning process.  NASA\u2019s program officials chose to defer the  development of some functions and related user requirements in order to  expedite the systems implementation process.  As a result, the new system  will not meet the needs of some key users who will continue to rely on  information from nonintegrated programs outside of the core financial  module, or use other labor-intensive means, to capture the data they need  to manage programs.", "NASA has also not followed certain other best practices for acquiring and  implementing its new financial management system.  NASA\u2019s  implementation plan calls for the system to be constructed using  commercial components; however, NASA has not analyzed the  interdependencies of the various subsystems.  When constructing a system  from commercial components, it is essential to understand the features and  characteristics of each component in order to select compatible systems  that can be integrated without having to build and maintain expensive  interfaces.  By acquiring components without first understanding their  relationships, NASA has increased its risks of implementing a system that  will not optimize mission performance, and that will cost more and take  longer to implement than necessary.", "Private sector entities have also encountered a number of challenges and  setbacks when implementing new systems.  These challenges have  included competition between internal organizational units, user resistance  to the new systems, and frequent changes in management and to  underlying corporate strategy.  Entities are overcoming their challenges  because better tools have been created to monitor and control progress  and skilled project managers with better management processes are being  used.", "The Standish Group International, Inc.(Standish Group) has reported that  the number of successful systems implementation projects in the private  sector is increasing.  From 1994 to 2000, successful projects increased from  28,000 to 78,000.  The Standish Group, through its research, has identified  10 project success factors.  These factors include user involvement,  executive support, experienced project managers, firm basic requirements,  clear business objectives, minimized scope, standard software  infrastructure, formal methodology, reliable estimates, and other.", "Also, according to the Standish Group, although no project requires all 10  factors to be successful,the more factors that are present in the project  strategy, the higher the chance of a successful implementation.  As  discussed above, many of these factors have been challenges for both  private sector and federal entities.  By its very nature, the implementation  of a new financial management system is a risky proposition. Therefore, it  is crucial that federal departments and agencies follow accepted best  practices and embrace as many of the key characteristics for successful  implementation projects as possible to help minimize the risk of failed  projects and result in systems that provide the necessary data for  management\u2019s needs.", "Our executive guide on creating value through world-class financial  management describes 11 practices critical for establishing and  maintaining sound financial operations.  These practices include  reengineering processes in conjunction with new technology.  As a result,  using commercial components such as COTS packages may require  significant changes in the way federal departments conduct their business.  According to the leading finance organizations that formed the basis for  our executive guide, a key to successful implementation of COTS systems  is reengineering business processes to fit the new software applications  that are based on best practices.  Moreover, OMB\u2019s former Associate  Director for Information Technology and e-Government has stated that \u201cIT  will not solve management problems\u2014re-engineering processes will.\u201d", "The conversion of data from an old system to a new system is also critical.

In addition, there is value in sustained congressional  interest in these issues, as demonstrated by hearings on federal financial  management and reform held over the past several years.

Furthermore, the  modernization of agency financial management systems, as envisioned by  FFMIA, is critical to the success of all of these initiatives. Notably, OMB is  developing a federal enterprise architecture that will affect the  government\u2019s ability to make significant progress across the PMA.  For  example, as part of the e-gov initiative, the number of federal payroll  providers is being consolidated.  Numerous agencies had targeted their  payroll operations for costly modernization efforts.  According to OMB,  millions of dollars will be saved through shared resources and processes  and by modernizing on a cross-agency and governmentwide basis.  The  administration\u2019s implementation of its Program Assessment Rating Tool  (PART) relates specifically to the PMA initiative of integration of budget  and performance information.

This will depend  on continued efforts to assess progress and maintain accountability to  ensure that the agencies are able to, in fact, improve their performance.  It  will be important that there be continuous rigor in the scoring process for  this approach to be credible and effective in providing incentives that  produce lasting results.
