Effective information security controls over these systems are essential to ensuring that BSA data, which contains sensitive financial information used by law enforcement agencies to prosecute financial crime, is protected from inappropriate or deliberate misuse, improper disclosure, or destruction. GAO evaluated whether security controls that effectively protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support FinCEN's mission have been implemented.

The three organizations implemented many information security controls to protect the information and systems that support FinCEN's mission. For example, IRS controlled changes to a key application and FinCEN segregated areas of its network. Nonetheless, the organizations had inconsistently applied or not fully implemented controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized access to this information and these systems. For example, the organizations did not always (1) implement user and password management controls for properly identifying and authenticating users, (2) restrict user access to data to only what was required for performing job functions, (3) adequately encrypt data, (4) protect the external and internal boundaries on its systems, and (5) log user activity on databases. Furthermore, weaknesses in which systems were insecurely configured and patches were not applied to critical systems also existed. As a result, sensitive information used by the federal government, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing is at an increased risk of unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure. A key reason for many of the weaknesses was that FinCEN and IRS had not fully implemented key information security program activities. For example, FinCEN did not always include detailed implementation guidance in its policies and procedures and adequately test and evaluate information security controls. Furthermore, GAO has previously reported that IRS did not sufficiently verify whether remedial actions were implemented or effective in mitigating vulnerabilities and recommended that it implement a revised remedial action verification process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau within the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), is tasked with the mission of safeguarding the U.S.  financial system from money laundering, terrorist financing, and other  abuses.
