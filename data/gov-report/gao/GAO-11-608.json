The Recovery Act requires GAO to review funds made available under the act and comment on recipients' reports of jobs created and retained. These jobs are reported as full-time equivalent (FTE) positions on a Web site created for the Recovery Act on www.Recovery.gov . GAO examined the (1) status and use of Recovery Act SRF program funds nationwide and in nine states; (2) EPA and state actions to monitor the act's SRF program funds; (3) EPA and selected states' approaches to ensure data quality, including for jobs reported by recipients of the act's funds; and (4) challenges, if any, that states have faced in implementing the act's requirements. For this work, GAO, among other things, obtained and analyzed EPA nationwide data on the status of Recovery Act clean and drinking water funds and projects and information from a nonprobability sample of nine states that represent all but 1 of EPA's 10 regions. GAO also interviewed EPA and state officials on their experiences with the Recovery Act SRF program funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 50 states have awarded and obligated the almost $6 billion in Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program funds provided under the Recovery Act, and EPA indicated that all 50 states met the act's requirement to award funds to projects under contract 1 year after the act's passage. States used the funds to support more than 3,000 water quality projects, and according to EPA data, the majority of the funds were used for sewage treatment infrastructure and drinking water treatment and distribution systems. Since the act was passed, states have drawn down almost 80 percent of the SRF program funds provided under the act. According to EPA data, states met the act's requirements that at least (1) 20 percent of the funds be used to support \"green\" projects and (2) 50 percent of the funds be provided as additional subsidies. In the nine states GAO reviewed, the act's funds paid for 419 infrastructure projects that helped address major water quality problems, but state officials said in some cases the act's requirements changed their priorities for ranking projects or the projects selected. In addition, although not required by the act, the nine states used about a quarter of the funds they received to pay for projects in economically disadvantaged communities, most in additional subsidies. EPA, states, and state or private auditors took actions to monitor Recovery Act SRF program funds. For example, EPA officials reviewed all 50 states' Recovery Act SRF programs at least once and found that states were largely complying with the act's requirements. Also, in part as a response to a GAO recommendation, in June 2010 EPA updated--and is largely following--its oversight plan, which describes monitoring actions for the SRF programs. Furthermore, state officials visited sites to monitor Recovery Act projects, as indicated in the plan, and found few problems. Officials at EPA and in the nine states have also regularly checked the quality of data on Recovery.gov and stated that the quality has remained relatively stable, although GAO identified minor inconsistencies in the FTE data that states reported. Overall, the 50 states reported that the Recovery Act SRF programs funded an increasing number of FTE positions for the quarter ending December 2009 through the quarter ending June 2010, from about 6,000 FTEs to 15,000 FTEs. As projects were completed and funds spent, these FTEs had declined to about 6,000 FTEs for the quarter ending March 2011. Some state officials GAO interviewed identified challenges in implementing the Recovery Act's Clean and Drinking Water SRF requirements for green projects and additional subsidies, both of which were continued with some variation, in the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 appropriations for the SRF programs. Officials in four states said achieving the green-funding goal was difficult, with one suggesting that the 20 percent target be changed. In addition, officials in two of the four states, as well as in two other states, noted that when monies are not repaid into revolving funds to generate future revenue for these funds, the SRF program purpose changes from primarily providing loans for investments in water infrastructure to providing grants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making no recommendations in this report, which was provided to EPA for its review and comment.

Among other things, the purposes of the Recovery Act were to  preserve and create jobs, promote national economic recovery, and  provide long-term economic benefits through infrastructure investments,  including water infrastructure. In past reports, GAO has identified the  need for stimulus funds to be timely, targeted, and temporary. To this end,  Recovery Act funds were directed to support services and build  infrastructure in a wide range of areas, including health, education,  transportation, energy, and water. In particular, the Recovery Act provided  $6 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Clean Water  and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs. These funds  represented a significant federal investment in the nation\u2019s water  infrastructure at a time when, according to a 2010 Congressional Budget  Office report, overall spending on infrastructure has been declining, and  when reported problems with the quality and safety of water supplies have  raised questions about the condition of the nation\u2019s infrastructure.", "The Recovery Act mandates that GAO conduct bimonthly reviews of the  funds used by states and determine whether the act is achieving its stated  purposes. The Recovery Act also requires GAO to comment and report  quarterly on, among other things, estimates of job creation and retention,  counted as full-time equivalent (FTE), as reported by recipients of  Recovery Act funds. In this report, we update our May 2010 report and  add new information on the use of Recovery Act funds provided for the  Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs. Specifically, for this report we  examined the (1) status and use of Clean and Drinking Water Recovery  Act SRF program funds nationwide and in selected states; (2) actions  taken by federal, state, and other agencies to monitor and ensure  accountability of these program funds; (3) approaches federal agencies  and selected states have taken to ensure data quality, including data for  jobs reported by recipients of these program funds; and (4) challenges, if  any, that states have faced in implementing Recovery Act requirements for  the Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs.", "To address these objectives we obtained and analyzed nationwide data  from EPA on the status of Recovery Act Clean and Drinking Water SRF  program funds and projects, as well as information from selected states on  their use of Recovery Act funds. We discussed this information and  Recovery Act requirements and reporting with EPA and state officials,  including program officials in state environmental and public health  departments responsible for the SRF programs and state Recovery Act  officials. To develop a more in-depth view of the states\u2019 use of Recovery  Act funds for Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs, we selected a  nonprobability sample of nine states that we had not reviewed in our  previous bimonthly reports, representing all but 1 of EPA\u2019s 10 regions. For  these states, we obtained and analyzed information on the states\u2019  prioritization processes for the programs, the amount of Recovery Act  funds provided to projects, the amount of funding provided to green  projects and additional subsidies, the amount of funds received and spent,  and the FTEs funded for each project and in total. For data gathered from  the nine states, we had state officials review, verify, and correct, when  necessary, data in EPA\u2019s Recovery Act databases; we found the data  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also obtained and analyzed  national data from EPA on award amounts, funds drawn down by states,  categories of water infrastructure projects funded, and FTEs. We used  these data to assess the reliability of Recovery.gov data reported by the  states and determined that the data were reliable for our purposes.  Appendix I discusses our scope and methodology in more detail.", "Our oversight of programs funded by the Recovery Act has resulted in  more than 100 related products with numerous recommendations since we  began reporting on the Recovery Act.

We conducted this  performance audit from September 2010 through June 2011, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Both the Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF programs authorize EPA to  provide states and local communities with independent and sustainable  sources of financial assistance. This assistance is typically in the form of  low- or no-interest loans, for projects that protect or improve water quality  and that are needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and  protect public health. Repayment of these loans replenishes the funds and  provides the ability to fund future loans for additional projects. The Clean  Water SRF program was established in 1987 under the Clean Water Act,  which was enacted to protect surface waters, such as rivers, lakes, and  coastal areas, and to maintain and restore the physical, chemical, and  biological integrity of these waters. The Drinking Water SRF program was  established in 1996 under the Safe Drinking Water Act, which was enacted  to establish national enforceable standards for drinking water quality and  to guarantee that water suppliers monitor water to ensure compliance  with standards.", "The Recovery Act provided $6 billion for EPA\u2019s Clean Water and Drinking  Water SRF programs. This amount represents a significant increase over  the federal funds awarded to the non-Recovery Act, or base, SRF programs  in recent years. From fiscal years 2000 through 2009, annual  appropriations averaged about $1.1 billion for the Clean Water SRF  program and about $833 million for the Drinking Water SRF program. In  addition to increasing funds, the Recovery Act included some new  requirements for the SRF programs. First, projects funded with Recovery  Act SRF program funds had to be under contract\u2014ready to proceed\u2014 within 1 year of the act\u2019s passage, or by February 17, 2010. Second, states  had to use at least 20 percent of these funds as a \u201cgreen reserve\u201d to  provide assistance for green infrastructure projects, water- or energy- efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities.  Third, states had to use at least 50 percent of Recovery Act funds to  provide \u201cadditional subsidies\u201d for projects in the form of principal  forgiveness, grants, or negative interest loans. Uses for these additional  subsidies can include helping economically disadvantaged communities  build water projects, although these uses are not a requirement of the act.", "With some variation, Congress incorporated two of these requirements\u2014 green projects and additional subsidies\u2014into the fiscal year 2010 and 2011  base SRF program appropriations.", "In addition to meeting requirements from program-specific provisions,  water projects receiving Recovery Act funds have to meet requirements  from the act\u2019s Buy American and Davis-Bacon provisions. The Recovery  Act generally requires that all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods  used in a project be produced in the United States, subject to certain  exceptions. Federal agencies can issue waivers for certain projects under  specified conditions, for example, if using American-made goods is  inconsistent with the public interest or if the cost of goods is  unreasonable; the act limits the \u201cunreasonable cost\u201d exception to those  instances when inclusion of American-made iron, steel, or other  manufactured goods will increase the overall project cost by more than 25  percent. Furthermore, recipients do not need to use American-made goods  if they are not sufficiently available or not of satisfactory quality. In  addition, the Recovery Act applies Davis-Bacon provisions to all Recovery  Act-funded projects, requiring contractors and subcontractors to pay all  laborers and mechanics at least the prevailing wage rates in the local area  where they are employed, as determined by the Secretary of Labor.  Contractors are required to pay these workers weekly and submit weekly  certified payroll records.", "To enhance transparency and accountability over Recovery Act funds,  Congress and the administration built numerous provisions into the act,  including a requirement that recipients of Recovery Act funding\u2014 including state and local governments, private companies, educational  institutions, nonprofits, and other private organizations\u2014report quarterly  on a number of measures. (Recipients, in turn, may award Recovery Act  funds to subrecipients, which are nonfederal entities.) These reports are  referred to as \u201crecipient reports,\u201d which the recipients provide through  one Web site, www.federalreporting.gov (Federalreporting.gov) for final  publication through a second Web site, www.recovery.gov (Recovery.gov).  Recipient reporting is overseen by the responsible federal agencies, such  as EPA, in accordance with Recovery Act guidance provided by the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB). Under this guidance, the federal  agencies are required to conduct data quality checks of recipient data, and  recipients can correct the data, before they are made available on  Recovery.gov. Furthermore, additional corrections can be made during a  continuous correction cycle after the data are released on Recovery.gov.", "A significant aspect of accountability for Recovery Act funds is oversight  of spending. According to the federal standards of internal control,  oversight should provide managers with current information on  expenditures to detect problems and proactively manage risks associated  with unusual spending patterns. In guidance issued in February 2009,  OMB required each federal agency to develop a plan detailing the specific  activities\u2014including monitoring activities\u2014that it would undertake to  manage Recovery Act funds. EPA issued its first version of this plan in  May 2009, as required, and updated this document as OMB issued new  guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Recovery Act SRF Program Funds Have Been Awarded and Obligated, and with Some Exceptions, States Reported Supporting Major Infrastructure Projects and Helping Economically Disadvantaged Communities", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, the 50 states have awarded and obligated the almost $6 billion  in Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program funds provided under the  Recovery Act and reported using the majority of these funds for sewage  treatment infrastructure and drinking water treatment and distribution  systems, according to EPA data.

As shown in figure 1, the states  used the majority of their Recovery Act Clean Water SRF program funds to  improve secondary and advanced treatment at wastewater treatment  plants, as well as projects to prevent or mitigate sanitary sewer  overflow.", "In Montevallo, Alabama, for example, the state provided Clean Water SRF  program funds to upgrade an outdated wastewater treatment plant in  Shelby County that served a population of about 5,000. The upgrade added  two large settlement basins to hold and treat wastewater, replacing a  series of small basins (see fig. 2). The additional treatment is expected to  remove nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to help the county  meet higher standards in the nearby waterways receiving the plant\u2019s  discharged water.", "As shown in figure 3, the states used about half of their Recovery Act  Drinking Water SRF program funds to construct projects to transmit and  distribute drinking water, including pumps and pipelines to deliver water  to customers. States used about 40 percent of their funds for projects to  treat and store drinking water.", "In Baltimore, Maryland, for example, the state provided funds to the city to  cover one of its treated water reservoirs at the Montebello drinking water  treatment plant. Before it was covered, the reservoir was open to birds and  other sources of contamination, and city water managers used a mesh-like  material to try to keep birds from landing on or using the water. When the  project is complete, the reservoir will be a huge, cement tank buried under  soil and vegetation (see fig. 4 for the project under construction in  December 2010).", "According to EPA data, all states met the requirement to use at least 20  percent of their Recovery Act funding for green projects, with $1.1 billion  of total Clean Water SRF program funds going to green projects and $544  million of total Drinking Water SRF program funds going to green projects.  According to EPA, the goal of supporting green projects is to promote  green infrastructure, energy or water efficiency, and innovative ways to  sustainably manage water resources. Green infrastructure refers to a  variety of technologies or practices\u2014such as green roofs, porous  pavement, and rain gardens\u2014that use or mimic natural systems to  enhance overall environmental quality. In addition to retaining rainfall and  snowmelt and allowing them to seep into groundwater, these technologies  can mitigate urban heat islands, and sequester carbon. Figure 5 shows the  amount of Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program funds that states  awarded to green projects by type of project.", "In Annapolis, Maryland, for example, city officials used Clean Water SRF  program funds to construct a green parking lot, a project that helped  retain and filter storm water runoff. (See fig. 6.)", "In Los Alamos, New Mexico, city officials used Clean Water SRF program  funds to install facilities to recycle water at the city\u2019s wastewater  treatment plant; the recycled water will be used as washwater\u2014water that  is used in the plant to clean equipment (see fig. 7). Because New Mexico is  an arid state, the reuse of water saves operating costs for the plant, as well  as scarce water resources.", "Nationwide, the states also met the Recovery Act requirement to provide  at least 50 percent of the Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program  funds as additional subsidies in the form of principal forgiveness, negative  interest loans, or grants (i.e., not loans to be fully repaid). Of the total  Recovery Act funds awarded, 76 percent of Clean Water SRF Recovery Act  funds and 70 percent of Drinking Water SRF Recovery Act funds were  distributed as additional subsidies.

These nine states received a  total of about $832 million in Recovery Act SRF program funds\u2014about  $579 million for their Clean Water SRF programs and about $253 million  for their Drinking Water SRF programs. In total, these funds supported 419  clean and drinking water projects.", "To award SRF program funds, each of the nine states used a system to  score and rank water projects seeking funds to address water quality  problems that were submitted by local municipalities or utilities. The  projects with the most points are considered the highest priority on the list  of projects for funding. For example, Nevada officials told us that  groundwater contamination is their state\u2019s major clean water quality  problem, which their ranking system addresses by designating the  elimination of existing contamination of groundwater as one of the state\u2019s  highest-scoring priorities. In addition, in most of the nine states we  reviewed, compliance is a key aspect of their ranking system, allowing  points to be awarded to infrastructure projects that help the states  eliminate causes of noncompliance with federal or state water quality  standards and permits. Officials in most of the nine states said that they  generally obtain information on their water systems\u2019 compliance with  federal and state water quality standards through discussions with their  program compliance staff and from state databases. Michigan, for  example, assigns a significant amount of points to clean water projects\u2014 such as sewage treatment works\u2014that will help these projects comply  with enforcement actions brought by the state against a municipality.", "In the nine states we reviewed, officials said that Recovery Act priorities\u2014 including the requirements for projects to be ready to proceed to contract  1 year after the passage of the Recovery Act or for green projects\u2014either  changed their priorities for ranking and funding projects or changed the  projects they funded.", "Readiness of a project to proceed to construction requirement. In the nine  states, officials included readiness to proceed and other Recovery Act  requirements in their ranking system and selected projects on the basis of  that ranking system or said that they did not fund\u2014or bypassed\u2014top- ranked projects that were not ready to proceed to construction by  February 17, 2010, 1 year after the passage of the Recovery Act. For  example, Washington State\u2019s two top-ranked clean water projects did not  receive Recovery Act SRF program funds because they could not meet the  February 2010 deadline. The projects were to decommission septic  systems and construct a wastewater treatment plant to reduce phosphorus  discharges to the Spokane River. In Wyoming, many of the projects that  were not ready to proceed were water treatment plants, which state  officials said take longer to design and plan for construction. Although  these higher-ranked projects did not receive Recovery Act funds, at least  two states were able to fund these projects in other ways, such as through  state grants or non-Recovery Act SRF program funds.", "Green project requirement. Three states listed green projects separately  from other projects. For example, Washington State officials who manage  the Clean Water SRF program told us that they established a green  projects category because they had anticipated that projects focused  primarily on energy and water efficiency (green projects) would not score  well under their ranking system, which focuses on water quality protection  and improvements. Other states funded green projects ahead of higher- ranked projects. For example, Nevada did not fund a number of higher- ranked projects and funded a lower-ranked drinking water project that  had green components. Similarly, Maryland bypassed many projects to  fund the first green-ranked project on its list.", "Buy American and Davis-Bacon provisions. State officials identified a  few projects that did not proceed because potential subrecipients either  did not want to meet one or more Recovery Act requirements, such as the  Buy American and Davis-Bacon provisions, or did not want to increase the  cost of their projects. For example, local officials in Alabama withdrew  their application for a drinking water project because the project was  already contracted without Buy American and Davis-Bacon wage  requirements, and an addendum to the contract to meet the regulations  would have increased the project\u2019s cost. Similarly, officials in all nine  states said that a few communities indicated they preferred to have their  projects funded from the base program, or chose not to apply for or  withdrew from the Recovery Act funding process to avoid paperwork or  the additional costs associated with the act\u2019s Buy American or Davis- Bacon requirements. For example, Wyoming officials said that potential  subrecipients for three clean water projects refused funding, citing time  constraints or difficulty meeting Buy American requirements.", "Despite changes in priorities for ranking and funding projects or in the  projects funded, officials reported that they were able to fund projects  with Recovery Act funds that helped resolve their major water problems.  For example,    Wyoming officials told us that Recovery Act clean and drinking water  funds were used to replace aging sewer and water lines, which they  said was one of their major problems.", "Connecticut officials said that Recovery Act funding helped support  four combined sewer overflow projects, which resulted in fewer  discharges of partially treated sewage into the area waterways.", "Nevada officials told us that Recovery Act funding will help with the  rehabilitation and relining of sewer ponds in four rural communities,  eliminating groundwater pollution, a major problem in the state.", "Washington State officials who manage the Drinking Water SRF  program told us that six of their Recovery Act projects addressed  arsenic drinking water contamination, a major water problem in the  state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Supported Economically Disadvantaged Communities, in Part by Using Additional Subsidies Authorized under the Act, although Officials Cited Continuing Difficulty in Helping These Communities", "paragraphs": ["Although the Recovery Act did not require states to target Clean and  Drinking Water SRF program funds to economically disadvantaged  communities, six of the nine states that we reviewed distributed more than  $123 million in clean water funds, and eight of the nine states distributed  almost $78 million in drinking water funds under the SRF Recovery Act  programs to these communities. This amount represents about 24 percent  of the almost $832 million in Recovery Act funds that the states were  awarded. As shown in table 1, a large majority of the funds provided to  these communities were provided as additional subsidies\u2014grants,  principal forgiveness, and negative interest loans.", "According to officials in five of the nine states we reviewed, their states  provided additional subsidies to economically disadvantaged communities  because the communities would otherwise have had a difficult time  funding projects. For example, New Mexico officials told us that they  directed additional drinking water subsidies to economically  disadvantaged communities because these communities have historically  lacked access to capital. Officials in Nevada told us such communities not  only have a difficult time funding projects, they also have some of the  projects with the highest priority for addressing public health and  environmental protection concerns. In addition, officials in a few other  states told us that economically disadvantaged communities often lack the  financial means to pay back loans from the SRF programs or lack funds to  pay for the upfront costs of planning and designing a project. Officials in at  least two states also said that many economically disadvantaged  communities lack full-time staff to help manage the water infrastructure.", "Even with the additional subsidies available for projects, officials in a few  states said that economically disadvantaged communities found it difficult  to obtain Recovery Act funds. For example, Missouri officials told us that  the Recovery Act deadline was the single most important factor hindering  the ability of these communities from receiving funding. New Mexico  officials also told us that because these communities typically do not have  funds to plan and develop projects, few could meet the deadline, and  several projects that sought Recovery Act funds could not be awarded  funding owing to the deadline.", "We gathered information on economically disadvantaged communities  from the nine states we reviewed because EPA did not collect the  information. In April 2011, the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG)  reported that EPA could not assess the overall impact of Recovery Act  funds on economically disadvantaged communities because the agency  did not collect data on the amount of Clean and Drinking Water SRF  program funds distributed to these communities nationwide.

Furthermore, headquarters officials said that they used a regional review  checklist to examine each region\u2019s oversight practices by, for example,  determining whether the regions received and reviewed states\u2019 analyses of  costs (business cases) and if the regions ensured that the states updated  key reporting data for their Recovery Act projects each quarter.  Headquarters officials also said that they briefly reviewed the Drinking  Water and Clean Water SRF program evaluation reports when they  reviewed the regions\u2019 activities. Headquarters officials said they had  imposed a 60-day time frame for completing these reports because the  regional staff were not submitting the reports in a timely manner.", "Additionally, the EPA OIG is conducting performance audits of EPA\u2019s and  states\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds for the Clean and Drinking Water SRF  programs and unannounced site inspections of Recovery Act-funded  projects. Between May 1, 2010, and May 1, 2011, the OIG has conducted  eight unannounced site visits. Six of the eight visits yielded no findings.  The OIG issued recommendations for the other two projects:  In a visit to Long Beach, California, the OIG found that a contractor did  not fully comply with federal and state prevailing wage requirements,  which resulted in underpayments to employees. The OIG  recommended that EPA require the California State Water Resources  Control Board to verify that the city is implementing controls to ensure  compliance with prevailing wage requirements.", "In a visit to Astoria, Oregon, the OIG found that the city understated  the number of FTEs created or retained with Recovery Act funds. In  addition, the OIG found that a change order for one of four contracts  awarded did not meet applicable procurement requirements. The OIG  recommended that EPA Region 10 require the Oregon Department of  Environmental Quality to require the city to correct the number of  FTEs and report the corrected number to the federal government. The  OIG also recommended that the regional administrator of EPA Region  10 require the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to  disallow the costs incurred under the change order unless Astoria was  able to show that the costs met applicable Oregon requirements.

As the EPA Inspector General  noted in May 2011, however, fraud schemes can take time to surface. The  Inspector General cited an ongoing investigation of a foreign company that  received over $1.1 million in contracts for equipment to be used in  wastewater treatment facilities across the United States after falsely  certifying that the equipment met the Recovery Act Buy American  provision.

According to  several state officials, this reporting structure provided an additional level  of review of state agency data. In Maryland, for example, officials said that  their state-level reporting system relieves subrecipients of certain  reporting duties. Subrecipients submitted the FTE and payroll information  to Maryland\u2019s StateStat office, and staff in that office reviewed and  validated the data, completed the required federal reports, and submitted  them to Federalreporting.gov.

Two challenges EPA and state officials  identified in spending Recovery Act SRF program funds may continue as  requirements introduced with the Recovery Act are incorporated into the  base SRF programs. Specifically, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the Clean  and Drinking Water SRF programs were required to include provisions for  green projects and additional subsidies.", "Encouraging green projects. The effort to support green projects was  included in EPA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 and 2011 appropriations for the base  Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs. As we discussed above, under  the requirement to fund green projects in the Recovery Act, in certain  cases state officials said they had to choose between a green water project  and a project that was otherwise ranked higher to address water quality  problems. Similarly, in our May 2010 report, we found that officials in  some of the states we reviewed said that they gave preference to green  projects for funding purposes, and sometimes ranked those projects above  another project with higher public health benefits. In addition to  competing priorities for funding, EPA\u2019s OIG found, in its February 2010  report, that a lack of clear guidance on the \u201cgreen requirement\u201d caused  confusion and disagreements as to which projects were eligible for green  funding. Officials in two of the nine states we reviewed noted that the  goal of supporting green projects was not difficult to achieve because they  had already identified green projects. Officials in four other states said that  while they all met the 20 percent green project goal, it was difficult to  achieve, leading one official to suggest that green projects be encouraged  without setting a fixed percentage of program funds. EPA officials added  that they had also heard that achieving the green requirement may  continue to be difficult in some states, particularly for the Drinking Water  program. However, the officials also said that they were encouraging  states to include green components in their drinking water projects rather  than seeking solely green projects.", "Providing additional subsidies. The fiscal years 2010 and 2011  appropriations for the Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs also  continued the requirement to provide additional subsidies in the form of  principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or grants. The subsidy  provisions reduced the funds available to use as a subsidy from a  minimum of 50 percent of funds required under the Recovery Act to a  minimum of 30 percent of base SRF program funds. As with the Recovery  Act, the appropriations in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 do not require this  additional subsidy to be targeted to any types of projects or communities  with economic need, and as the recent EPA OIG report notes, there are  no requirements for EPA or the states to track how these subsidies are  used. The base Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs were created to  be a sustainable source of funding for communities\u2019 water and wastewater  infrastructure through the continued repayment of loans to states.  Officials in four of the nine states we reviewed identified a potential  challenge in continuing to provide a specific amount of subsidies while  sustaining the Clean and Drinking Water SRF programs as revolving funds.  State officials pointed out that when monies are not repaid into the  revolving fund, the reuse of funds is reduced and the purpose of the  revolving SRF program changes from primarily providing loans for  investments in water infrastructure to providing grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to the Environmental Protection Agency  for review and comment.

(1) To provide more direct focus on Recovery Act programs through the  Single Audit to help ensure that smaller programs with higher risk have  audit coverage in the area of internal controls and compliance, the OMB  Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit  Organizations 2010 Compliance Supplement (Compliance Supplement)  required all federal programs with expenditures of Recovery Act awards to  be considered as programs with higher risk when performing standard  risk-based tests for selecting programs to be audited. The auditor\u2019s  determination of the programs to be audited is based upon an evaluation  of the risks of noncompliance occurring that could be material to an  individual major program. The Compliance Supplement has been the  primary mechanism that OMB has used to provide Recovery Act  requirements and guidance to auditors. One presumption underlying the  guidance is that smaller programs with Recovery Act expenditures could  be audited as major programs when using a risk-based audit approach.  The most significant risks are associated with newer programs that may  not yet have the internal controls and accounting systems in place to help  ensure that Recovery Act funds are distributed and used in accordance  with program regulations and objectives. Since Recovery Act spending is  projected to continue through 2016, we believe that it is essential that  OMB provide direction in Single Audit guidance to help to ensure that  smaller programs with higher risk are not automatically excluded from  receiving audit coverage based on their size and standard Single Audit Act  requirements.", "In May 2011, we spoke with OMB officials and reemphasized our concern  that future Single Audit guidance provide instruction that helps to ensure  that smaller programs with higher risk have audit coverage in the area of  internal controls and compliance. OMB officials agreed and stated that  such guidance is included in the 2011 Compliance Supplement which was  to be issued by March 31, 2011. On June 1, 2011, OMB issued the 2011  Compliance Supplement which contains language regarding the higher- risk status of Recovery Act programs, requirements for separate reporting  of findings, and a list of Recovery Act programs to aid the auditors. We  will continue to monitor OMB\u2019s efforts to provide more direct focus on  Recovery Act programs through the Single Audit to help ensure that  smaller programs with higher risk have audit coverage in the area of  internal controls and compliance.  (2) To address the recommendation for taking additional efforts to  encourage more timely reporting on internal controls for Recovery Act  programs for 2010 and beyond, OMB commenced a second voluntary  Single Audit Internal Control Project (project) in August 2010 for states  that received Recovery Act funds in fiscal year 2010. Fourteen states  volunteered to participate in the second project. One of the project\u2019s goals  is to achieve more timely communication of internal control deficiencies  for higher-risk Recovery Act programs so that corrective action can be  taken more quickly. Specifically, the project encourages participating  auditors to identify and communicate deficiencies in internal control to  program management 3 months sooner than the 9-month time frame  currently required under OMB Circular No. A-133. Auditors were to  communicate these through interim internal control reports by December  31, 2010. The project also requires that program management provide a  corrective action plan aimed at correcting any deficiencies 2 months  earlier than required under statute to the federal awarding agency. Upon  receiving the corrective action plan, the federal awarding agency has 90  days to provide a written decision to the cognizant federal agency for audit  detailing any concerns it may have with the plan. Each participating state  was to select a minimum of four Recovery Act programs for inclusion in  the project.", "We assessed the results of the first OMB Single Audit Internal Control  Project for fiscal year 2009 and found that it was helpful in communicating  internal control deficiencies earlier than required under statute. We  reported that 16 states participated in the first project and that the states  selected at least two Recovery Act programs for the project. We also  reported that the project\u2019s dependence on voluntary participation limited  its scope and coverage and that voluntary participation may also bias the  project\u2019s results by excluding from analysis states or auditors with  practices that cannot accommodate the project\u2019s requirement for early  reporting of control deficiencies. Overall, we concluded that although the  project\u2019s coverage could have been more comprehensive, the analysis of  the project\u2019s results provided meaningful information to OMB for better  oversight of the Recovery Act programs selected and information for  making future improvements to the Single Audit guidance.", "OMB\u2019s second Single Audit Internal Control Project is in progress and its  planned completion date is June 2011. OMB plans to assess the project\u2019s  results after its completion date. The 14 participating states have met the  milestones for submitting interim internal control reports by December 31,  2010 and their corrective action plans by January 31, 2011. By April 30,  2011, the federal awarding agencies were to provide their interim  management decisions to the cognizant agency for audit. We discussed the  preliminary status of these interim management decisions with OMB  officials and, as of May 24, 2011, only 1 of the 10 federal awarding agencies  had submitted some management decisions on the auditees\u2019 corrective  action plans as required by the project\u2019s guidelines. On May 24, 2011,  officials from the cognizant agency for audit, HHS, reemphasized to the  federal awarding agencies their responsibilities for providing management  decisions in accordance with the project\u2019s due dates. In our review of the  2009 project, we noted similar concerns that federal awarding agencies  submitted management decisions on proposed corrective actions in an  untimely manner and made recommendations in this area, which are  discussed later in this report. We will continue to monitor the status of  OMB\u2019s efforts to implement this recommendation and believe that OMB  needs to continue taking steps to encourage timelier reporting on internal  controls through Single Audits for Recovery Act programs.  (3) We previously recommended that OMB evaluate options for providing  relief related to audit requirements for low-risk programs to balance new  audit responsibilities associated with the Recovery Act. OMB officials have  stated that they are aware of the increase in workload for state auditors  who perform Single Audits due to the additional funding to Recovery Act  programs and corresponding increases in programs being subject to audit  requirements. OMB officials stated that they solicited suggestions from  state auditors to gain further insights to develop measures for providing  audit relief. However, OMB has not yet put in place a viable alternative  that would provide relief to all state auditors that conduct Single Audits.  For state auditors that are participating in the second OMB Single Audit  Internal Control Project, OMB has provided some audit relief by modifying  the requirements under Circular No. A-133 to reduce the number of low- risk programs to be included in some project participants\u2019 risk assessment  requirements.", "OMB is taking initiatives to examine the Single Audit process. OMB  officials have stated that they have created a workgroup which combines  the Executive Order 13520\u2014Reducing Improper Payments Section 4 (b)  Single Audit Recommendations Workgroup (Single Audit Workgroup), and  the Circular No. A-87\u2014Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal  Governments Workgroup (Circular No. A-87 Workgroup). The Single Audit  Workgroup is comprised of representatives from the federal audit  community; federal agency management officials involved in overseeing  the Single Audit process and programs subject to that process;  representatives from the state audit community; and staff from OMB. OMB  officials tasked the Single Audit Workgroup with developing  recommendations to improve the effectiveness of Single Audits of  nonfederal entities that expend federal funds in order to help identify and  reduce improper payments. In June 2010, the Single Audit Workgroup  developed recommendations, some of which are targeted toward  providing audit relief to auditors who conduct audits of grantees and  grants that are under the requirements of the Single Audit Act. OMB  officials stated that the recommendations warrant further study and that  the workgroup is continuing its work on the recommendations. OMB  officials also stated that the Circular No. A-87 Workgroup has also made  recommendations which could impact Single Audits and that the  workgroups have been collaborating to ensure that the recommendations  relating to Single Audit improvements are compatible and could improve  the Single Audit process. The combined workgroups plan to issue a report  to OMB by August 29, 2011. We will continue to monitor OMB\u2019s progress  to achieve this objective.  (4) (5) With regard to issuing Single Audit guidance in a timely manner,  and specifically the OMB Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement, we  previously reported that OMB officials intended to issue the 2011  Compliance Supplement by March 31, 2011. In December 2010, OMB  provided to the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts (AICPA) a  draft of the 2011 Compliance Supplement which the AICPA published on  its Web site. In January 2011, OMB officials reported that the production of  the 2011 Compliance Supplement was on schedule for issuance by March  31, 2011. OMB issued the 2011 Compliance Supplement on June 1, 2011.  We spoke with OMB officials regarding the reasons for the delay of this  important guidance to auditors. OMB officials stated that its efforts were  refocused toward priorities relating to the expiration of several continuing  resolutions that temporarily funded the federal government for fiscal year  2011, and the Department Of Defense And Full-Year Continuing  Appropriations Act, 2011, which was passed by the Congress in April 2011,  averting a governmentwide shutdown. OMB officials stated that, as a  result, although they had taken steps to issue the 2011 Compliance  Supplement by the end of March, such as starting the process earlier in  2010 and giving agencies strict deadlines for program submissions, they  were only able to issue it on June 1, 2011. We will continue to monitor  OMB\u2019s progress to achieve this objective.  (6) (7) In October 2010, OMB officials stated that, based on their  assessment of the results of the project, they had discussed alternatives  for helping to ensure that federal awarding agencies provide their  management decisions on the corrective action plans in a timely manner,  including possibly shortening the time frames required for federal agencies  to provide their management decisions to grant recipients. However,  OMB officials have yet to decide on the course of action that they will  pursue to implement this recommendation. OMB officials acknowledged  that the results of the 2009 OMB Single Audit Internal Control Project  confirmed that this issue continues to be a challenge. They stated that they  have met individually with several federal awarding agencies that were  late in providing their management decisions in the 2009 project to discuss  the measures that the agencies will take to improve the timeliness of their  management decisions. Earlier in this report, we discussed that  preliminary observations of the results of the second project have  identified that several federal awarding agencies\u2019 management decisions  on the corrective actions that were due April 30, 2011, have also not been  issued in a timely manner.", "In March 2010, OMB issued guidance under memo M-10-14, item 7,  (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_20 10/m1014.pdf) that called for federal awarding agencies to review reports  prepared by the Federal Audit Clearinghouse regarding Single Audit  findings and submit summaries of the highest-risk audit findings by major  Recovery Act program, as well as other relevant information on the federal  awarding agency\u2019s actions regarding these areas. In May 2011, we  reviewed selected reports prepared by federal awarding agencies that  were titled Use of Single Audit to Oversee Recipient\u2019s Recovery Act  Funding. These reports were required by memo M-10-14 for reports from  the Federal Audit Clearinghouse for fiscal year 2009. The reports were  developed for entities where the auditor issued a qualified, adverse, or  disclaimer audit opinion. The reports identified items such as (1)  significant risks to the respective program that was audited; (2) material  weaknesses, instances of noncompliance, and audit findings that put the  program at risk; (3) actions taken by the agency; and (4) actions planned  by the agency. OMB officials have stated that they plan to use this  information to identify trends that may require clarification or additional  guidance in the Compliance Supplement.", "OMB officials also stated that they are working on a metrics project with  the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to develop metrics  for determining how federal awarding agencies are to use information  available in the Single Audit and which can serve as performance  measures. We attended a presentation of the OMB Workgroup that is  working with the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board in  developing the metrics project in May 2011 and note that it is making  progress. OMB officials have stated that the metrics could be applied at  the agency level, by program, to allow for analysis of Single Audit findings,  along with other uses to be determined. One goal of the metrics project is  to increase the effectiveness and timeliness of federal awarding agencies\u2019  actions to resolve single audit findings. We will continue to monitor the  progress of these efforts to determine the extent that they improve the  timeliness of federal agencies\u2019 actions to resolve audit findings so that  risks to Recovery Act funds are reduced and internal controls in Recovery  Act programs are strengthened."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Open Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that Congress and the public have accurate information on the  extent to which the goals of the Recovery Act are being met, we  recommended that the Secretary of Transportation direct FHWA to take  the following two actions:    Develop additional rules and data checks in the Recovery Act Data  System, so that these data will accurately identify contract milestones  such as award dates and amounts, and provide guidance to states to revise  existing contract data.", "Make publicly available\u2014within 60 days after the September 30, 2010,  obligation deadline\u2014an accurate accounting and analysis of the extent to  which states directed funds to economically distressed areas, including  corrections to the data initially provided to Congress in December 2009.", "In its response, DOT stated that it implemented measures to further  improve data quality in the Recovery Act Data System, including additional  data quality checks, as well as providing states with additional training and  guidance to improve the quality of data entered into the system.
