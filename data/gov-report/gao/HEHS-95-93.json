The centerpiece of the act, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) training program, was designed to provide an increasing percentage of adult AFDC recipients with the education, training, and supportive services they need to become self-sufficient and avoid long-term welfare dependency. FSA aimed to use JOBS to transform the culture of both welfare agencies and recipients so that they viewed AFDC benefits as temporary assistance on the path to employment and not a permanent entitlement. Since its creation, federal and state governments have spent about $8 billion on the JOBS program.", "Despite this landmark welfare legislation, a growing consensus exists among the public, policymakers, and welfare recipients that the AFDC program, which served an average 4.98 million cases per month in 1993, needs to be overhauled. This new call for welfare reform has been fueled by rapidly rising AFDC caseloads; concerns about escalating program costs; and public perceptions that AFDC has become a permanent entitlement, not a transitional route to work. Another major concern among policymakers and program experts is that the JOBS program was not designed to reach a large number of adult AFDC recipients. As states confront the maximum participation rate mandated by law for 1995, they will be required to serve 20 percent of the nonexempt caseload, raising questions concerning JOBS\u2019 ability to effectively transform the welfare culture. Some experts believe that only participation on a large scale, along with an emphasis on work, can transform the welfare culture.", "A number of different federal proposals are being considered to significantly reform welfare. For example, the Personal Responsibility Act of 1995 (H.R. 4), recently passed by the House of Representatives, would eliminate AFDC as an individual entitlement, repeal the JOBS program, convert AFDC funding into a capped block grant to the states, impose time limits on benefits, and deny cash assistance to unwed mothers under 18 years old and their children.", "The states would be required to provide increasing percentages of families on welfare with work-related activities. By contrast, the administration\u2019s proposal, introduced in the 103rd Congress, would continue AFDC as an entitlement but would also set time limits on welfare receipt and require increasing numbers of adult welfare recipients to participate in education and training activities. The administration\u2019s proposal would build on the existing JOBS program to help move adult recipients from welfare to work. In addition to these national proposals, many states are experimenting with welfare waivers and are testing provisions to time-limit benefits and promote work.", "Regardless of the ultimate structure of welfare reform, a central goal will likely remain that of moving more people off welfare and into the work force. While some participants who enter JOBS may be ready for immediate placement into the work force, others may need some level of education or training to prepare them for employment, the ultimate objective of welfare reform. If programs are required to serve more participants faster in a time-limited environment, the capacity of local programs to deliver these services to participants will likely remain a critical factor.", "To assist the 104th Congress in its deliberations on welfare reform, you asked us to examine (1) who is and is not being served under the JOBS program, (2) the range of services JOBS participants are receiving and the extent to which participants\u2019 needs are being met, and (3) the implications of serving participants in a system of time-limited benefits.", "This report is one of three studies we are completing at your request on the JOBS program. It draws upon (1) our analysis of data on adult AFDC recipients and JOBS participants, (2) a national telephone survey that gathered representative data from local JOBS program officials, and (3) qualitative information developed from a series of four discussion groups with JOBS officials (for more information on our methodologies, see app. I). This study looks at the JOBS program\u2019s capacity to provide the up-front education, training, and supportive services necessary to get participants ready for employment; a companion report examines how JOBS programs work with employers to find jobs or create employment opportunities for participants. Finally, a third report studies the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the states\u2019 use of outcome measures in determining whether JOBS participants are finding employment and examines HHS\u2019 progress in measuring JOBS outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Created by the Social Security Act of 1935, the AFDC program provides cash assistance to families with needy children who have been deprived of parental support if a parent is continuously absent from the home, incapacitated, dead, or unemployed. The program is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, with federal funds providing from 50 to about 80 percent of the AFDC benefit costs (55 percent on average) and 50 percent of administrative costs. States administer or supervise the program and set their own benefit levels. In fiscal year 1993, federal and state spending for AFDC totaled $25.2 billion.", "Since 1968, various federal programs have aimed to help adult AFDC recipients become employed. However, early welfare-to-work programs were faulted for low participation rates, insufficient attention to less employable recipients, and inadequate results in reducing welfare dependency.", "In 1988, seeking to rectify these program deficiencies, the Congress passed FSA, creating the JOBS program. FSA was to be the first step in transforming the welfare system from one of permanent entitlement to a program of transitional assistance. Specifically, FSA directed the states to make available to JOBS participants a broad range of services and activities including high school or equivalent education, basic and remedial education, education for those with limited English proficiency, job skills training, job readiness activities, and job development and placement. Further, states were required to offer at least two of the following: group and individual job search, on-the-job training, work supplementation, or community work experience. States could also offer postsecondary education. Finally, FSA provided federal reimbursement for child care, transportation, and other work-related expenses and supportive services when necessary (as determined by the state) for participation in JOBS.(See the glossary for further details on JOBS education and training components.)", "FSA allowed states much flexibility in the design and implementation of their JOBS programs. Programs may emphasize quick movement into the labor force for those who are job-ready, while others may emphasize education and training to increase participants\u2019 employability. However, whatever their emphasis, JOBS programs are required to offer a full range of services.", "Under JOBS, once a participant is enrolled, the program must assess individual educational, child care, and other supportive services needs, taking into account skills, prior work experience, employability, and family circumstances. Based on this initial assessment, the program develops an employability plan, which specifies the services to be provided and sets an employment goal for each participant, considering individual preferences, supportive services needs, available program resources, and local employment opportunities.", "To help clients meet their employment goals, FSA encourages programs to draw on existing community services to meet participants\u2019 needs, especially to the extent that they can be obtained at no cost to JOBS. By emphasizing existing services available at no cost, programs can avoid duplication and ensure judicious use of program funds. When JOBS programs find that such services are not available and must be purchased, they may enter into arrangements and contracts with other service providers to obtain them. Commonly used providers of education and training services include Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, state and local educational agencies, other public agencies, and private organizations (including community-based organizations).", "FSA mandates participation in JOBS for AFDC recipients between 16 and 59 years old, but provides exemptions for certain individuals. FSA exempts individuals who: care for children under 3 years old (or 1 year old, at state option); work 30 or more hours per week; attend elementary, secondary, or vocational school full-time; are ill or incapacitated; care for a household member who is ill or incapacitated; are in at least the second trimester of pregnancy; or live in an area that is remote from a JOBS program or activity. However, exempt individuals may voluntarily participate in JOBS.", "In addition, states must spend at least 55 percent of their JOBS funds on specific target groups, including custodial parents under 24 years old with low levels of education or work experience, long-term adult AFDC recipients, and those whose AFDC eligibility is about to expire due to the age of their youngest dependent child.", "FSA provided $1 billion in federal funds for JOBS in fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993, reaching $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1994, and $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1995. These funds are allocated among the states and tribal organizations according to their percentage of the national AFDC population. To utilize the full amount of the allocation available to them, states must meet certain matching requirements. In recent years, most states have not provided sufficient matching funds to take full advantage of the federal resources available to them. In 1992, overall, states used 68 percent of the federal funding available to them.", "FSA envisioned gradual expansion of JOBS and mandated steadily increasing participation rates for the program. States must meet these participation rates or accept a reduced federal share of JOBS expenditures. This participation rate threshold was 7 percent of the nonexempt caseload in fiscal year 1991, 11 percent in 1992 and 1993, 15 percent in 1994, and 20 percent in 1995. However, many critics remain dissatisfied with this gradual expansion and believe that these requirements do not ensure that JOBS will reach a large share of AFDC households and, thereby, transform the welfare culture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JOBS Serves a Small Percentage of the AFDC Caseload", "paragraphs": ["The JOBS program serves a small percentage of the total AFDC caseload because program rules exempt most adult AFDC recipients from participation and because FSA established minimum participation rate requirements. In addition, the characteristics of the large population of adult nonparticipants differ from those of participants in certain key ways."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Few Adult Recipients Participate in JOBS", "paragraphs": ["JOBS reaches a relatively small percentage of all AFDC households, despite success in meeting the participation rates called for by FSA. As shown in figure 1, in 1992, most adult AFDC recipients (about 59 percent) were exempt from mandatory JOBS participation. Of those 16 years old and older who were exempt from JOBS, 75 percent were exempt because they were providing care for a child under 3 years old. Adult AFDC recipients are also exempt if, for example, the JOBS program is not offered in the recipient\u2019s local area or if the recipient is in at least the second trimester of pregnancy, incapacitated, or caring for another household member who is ill or incapacitated.", "Furthermore, even for those who are not exempt under program rules, JOBS participation rate requirements do not ensure that large numbers of adult AFDC recipients participate. In 1992, about 13 percent of all single female heads of households on AFDC, about one-fourth of the nonexempt adult recipients, were participating each month. By contrast, however, about three-fourths of nonexempt adult recipients were not participating. Even if the participation rate requirements were raised dramatically for nonexempt adults, well over one-half of the AFDC caseload would still be exempt from program participation. Some experts believe that welfare-to-work programs will not be effective in transforming the culture of welfare unless they reach a much larger percentage of AFDC households."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Requirements Result in Differences Between Participants and Nonparticipants", "paragraphs": ["Participants in JOBS differ from nonparticipants in certain key ways that appear related to aspects of program requirements. The most noteworthy differences include the age of the youngest child and the age of the recipient. Nonparticipants were about twice as likely to have children under 3 years old than were JOBS participants. They were also more likely to be 24 years old or younger. This difference is consistent with JOBS\u2019 exemption of parents or other caretakers of a child under 3 years old.", "Additionally, a comparison of JOBS participants with the overall AFDC caseload showed that a larger percentage of JOBS participants have fewer than 9 years of education and a smaller percentage have attended college. The difference in education levels may also be explained by the JOBS requirement that targets young parents who have not completed high school.", "Apart from differences resulting from program requirements, our analysis of program data did not reveal any other significant differences between JOBS participants and nonparticipants. In characteristics such as race, number of children, and prior AFDC history, the two populations appear similar.", "Beyond the differences that are readily observable, however, nonparticipants may differ from participants in ways that are difficult to quantify. According to JOBS administrators who participated in our discussion groups, current nonparticipants may be less motivated and have impediments that make them harder to serve without extra support and services. For example, some may need treatment for more severe drug and alcohol problems before they can fully participate in an education or training program. Others may have mental health problems or learning disabilities that also need to be addressed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Range of JOBS Services Offered, but Some Participants Do Not Receive Needed Services", "paragraphs": ["As envisioned under FSA, JOBS programs offer a range of services and tap into available community resources to serve their participants. Our survey data results show that JOBS programs offer most of the education and training components and supportive services described in the act and that JOBS participants are enrolled in a range of activities. For each specific education or training component that participants needed, however, the percentage of programs that had difficulties providing that service ranged from 30 to 70 percent. In these cases, the programs lacked the capacity to ensure that all the participants received education and training services when they needed them.

Among other reasons selected by a substantial portion of administrators was a need for additional program staff (for example, for counseling, monitoring participants, developing job contacts with employers for work-related components, and conducting case management), and a lack of available services in the community. Additionally, for the work-related components\u2014on-the-job training, work supplementation, and community work experience\u2014the lack of employer interest was a commonly selected reason (see table 2). In addition, some program administrators also volunteered other reasons why participants did not receive the services they needed, such as client choice (when participants drop out, choose not to participate, or fail to cooperate with the program).", "By contrast, when asked whether lack of child care funding was a reason why participants were not receiving a specific education or training component they needed, the percentage of program administrators who selected this reason ranged from about 10 to 30 percent. That a relatively low percentage of program administrators chose this reason can be partially explained by the fact that JOBS participants may have less need for child care than nonparticipants because they tend to have older children who may be in school and do not need child care. Also, as shown in figure 5, only about 12 percent of JOBS programs had difficulties in providing child care to participants who needed it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implications of Welfare Reform", "paragraphs": ["FSA requires states to offer JOBS participants a full range of education and training services, including at least two of four work-related activities.

Results from a survey of state JOBS administrators, included in a GAO report on JOBS outcomes, suggest that many states chose to emphasize work preparation over quick movement into the labor force. The Personal Responsibility Act of 1995 (H.R. 4), recently passed by the House, repeals the requirement for states to offer a range of services and instead requires states to place an increasing percentage of participants in a work-related activity. H.R. 4 would also prohibit states from providing benefits for more than 60 months (whether or not consecutive). If adopted, the proposal\u2019s cap on funding, its elimination of the requirement to offer a range of services, and its increased focus on work activities are likely to change the mix of services offered to participants.
