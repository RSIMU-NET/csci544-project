In some cases the APGs appeared to be internally focused; however, in others GAO's work has shown there are external contributors, but none were listed. In addition, the act requires agencies to identify how, if at all, an APG contributes to any cross-agency priority (CAP) goals set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Although 29 of 102 APGs appeared to support a CAP goal, only two described the link. When agencies do not identify external contributors or links to crosscutting efforts, it is unclear whether agencies are coordinating to limit overlap and duplication.", "Most APGs had performance measures, but many lacked interim targets. The act requires agencies to develop quarterly targets for APGs if they provide data of significant value at a reasonable level of burden. However, OMB's guidance does not fully address this.

Both  Congress and the executive branch have recognized the need for  improved collaboration across the federal government. Accordingly, in  January 2011 the almost two-decades-old Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) was updated with the GPRA Modernization  Act of 2010 (GPRAMA or the act). The act establishes a new framework  aimed at taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing  on results and improving government performance. Effective  implementation of the act could play an important role in clarifying desired  outcomes, addressing program performance that spans multiple  organizations, and facilitating future actions to reduce unnecessary  duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. Furthermore, under GPRAMA,  agencies are to more frequently review and report the results they are  achieving, which could lead to improved performance if agencies take  more timely actions to address performance challenges as they arise.", "Among other things, GPRAMA requires certain agencies, as determined  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to develop a limited  number of agency priority goals (APGs) every 2 years. These goals are  to reflect the highest priorities of each selected agency, as identified by  the head of the agency, and be informed by broad crosscutting federal  government priority goals (also known as cross-agency priority or CAP  goals) as well as input from relevant congressional committees. In  implementing these goals under the act, agencies are to identify the  various federal organizations, programs and activities\u2014both within and  external to the agency\u2014that contribute to each goal, and review progress  on a quarterly basis.

To address both objectives, we reviewed  information about the APGs published on Performance.gov in February  2012 and updated in December 2012, as well as the updated strategic  plans and performance plans agencies published in 2012 to reflect  GPRAMA requirements. To assess the reliability of data presented on  Performance.gov we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed  OMB staff about data quality control procedures. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition,  to accomplish our first objective, we reviewed and assessed agencies\u2019  implementation of selected GPRAMA planning and reporting  requirements for 102 of the 103 APGs. In addition to the requirements,  our assessment was also informed by the Senate committee report  accompanying GPRAMA, relevant OMB guidance, and our past work on  how to effectively implement GPRA.

We then  reviewed the work that we and relevant IGs have conducted over a  number of years related to each of the 21 APGs developed by the five  agencies. Because the 21 APGs are a non-generalizable sample of all  APGs, our views on those APGs cannot be generalized to the entire  universe, but provide insights about each of the 21 APGs, as well as a  theme common to several APGs.

Also, there are not  always interagency mechanisms or strategies in place to coordinate  programs that address crosscutting issues, which can lead to potentially  duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts. GPRAMA establishes a  new framework for taking a crosscutting and integrated approach to  improving government performance, and effective implementation of that  framework could play an important role in clarifying desired outcomes,  addressing performance that spans multiple organizations, and facilitating  actions to reduce unnecessary overlap, duplication, and fragmentation.", "Two provisions in GPRAMA, in particular, direct agencies to link their  APGs with crosscutting federal efforts. First, the act requires agencies to  identify federal organizations, program activities, regulations, policies, and  other activities\u2014both internal and external to the agency\u2014that contribute  to each of their APGs and include this information in their performance  plans and provide it to OMB for publication on Performance.gov. In  addition, OMB\u2019s 2012 guidance directs agencies to include tax  expenditures in their identification of organizations and programs that  contribute to their APGs, as part of their updates to Performance.gov.  Since 1994, we have recommended greater scrutiny of tax expenditures,  as periodic reviews could help determine how well specific tax  expenditures work to achieve their goals and how their benefits and costs  compare to those of programs with similar goals. Second, APGs are to  be informed by the CAP goals. The act also requires agencies to  demonstrate in their performance plans any alignment between their  performance goals\u2014including their APGs\u2014and the CAP goals. Both of  these provisions are important because they show how agencies are  coordinating efforts toward a common crosscutting issue. As we have  previously reported, uncoordinated program efforts can waste scarce  funds, confuse and frustrate program customers, and limit the overall  effectiveness of the federal effort.", "Agencies identified at least one internal contributor for each of their  APGs, though agencies differed in the amount of detail they provided. For  example, the National Science Foundation (NSF), as shown in figure 4,  identified its Directorate of Engineering as a lead organization and its  Innovation Corps activities and programs as contributing programs to its  APG to increase the number of entrepreneurs emerging from university  laboratories.", "DOT, in its fiscal year 2013 performance plan, organized the descriptions  of its planned performance\u2014including its APGs\u2014into broad themes  under its strategic goals.

When  they did identify external contributors, agencies differed in the amount of  detail they provided. The Department of State (State), for instance,  identified in its fiscal year 2013 congressional budget justification external  contributors for six of the eight APGs it jointly developed with the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID). These external  contributors are generally at the department/agency, component, or  program level, such as the Department of Defense (DOD), the  Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development  Assistance and Training, and the Department of Justice\u2019s International  Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, respectively (see  figure 7).", "Similarly, State and USAID identified on Performance.gov external  contributors to their APG to advance low emissions, climate-resilient  development, such as the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Forest  Service (a USDA component), the Environmental Protection Agency, and  international governmental and nongovernmental organizations (see  figure 8).", "We did not verify that agencies included all relevant internal and external  federal contributors to their APGs. However, it was not always clear why  external contributors were not identified for 29 of the 102 APGs. In some  instances this could be explained by the goal being internally focused. For  example, the Department of the Interior listed no external contributors to  its internally-focused APG to \u201cbuild the next generation of conservation  and community leaders by supporting youth employment\u201d at the  department. However, our analysis indicates that 8 of the 29 APGs that  lack external contributors are related to crosscutting areas that we have  identified as at risk of potential fragmentation, overlap, or duplication.  For example, NSF did not list any external contributors to its APG to  develop a diverse and highly qualified science and technology workforce  by having 80 percent of institutions funded through NSF\u2019s undergraduate  programs document the extent of use of proven instructional practices by  September 30, 2013.

As we have previously reported, HUD, USDA, and the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) operate rental housing programs  with overlapping purposes, although the products, areas served, and  delivery methods differed, and recommended that further collaboration be  undertaken and documented in strategic plans and performance plans by  these agencies. HUD and USDA generally agreed with the recommendations; Treasury did not provide comments. As illustrated in  figure 9, HUD identified two tax expenditures (Treasury) as contributors to  its APG targeted at preserving affordable rental housing\u2014the only APG  out of all 102 to have tax expenditures identified as external contributors.

However, our analysis indicates that 27 additional APGs appear to  support at least one of the 14 interim CAP goals, but agencies did not  describe this connection. In part, this could be a result of OMB\u2019s  guidance, which does not state the requirement for agencies to show the  alignment between their performance goals\u2014including their APGs\u2014and  the CAP goals. Instead the guidance directs agencies to refer to  Performance.gov, where the quarterly updates for the CAP goals will  describe how the agency\u2019s goals contribute to the CAP goal. While in a  few instances CAP goals identified contributing APGs, this alignment was  not also provided in the corresponding APG information on the site.

Our past work has shown that although agencies collect a significant amount of performance  information, they have not consistently used that information to improve  management and results. We have previously identified practices for  enhancing agency use of performance information, one of which is to  communicate performance information, including performance against  targets, frequently and effectively. Frequent, regular communication can  help managers to inform staff and other stakeholders of their commitment  to achieve the agency\u2019s goals and to keep these goals in mind as they  pursue their day-to-day activities. Frequently reporting progress toward  achieving performance targets also allows managers to review the  information in time to make improvements.

In  addition, the PIC formed the Goal Setting Working Group to assist  agencies in setting their 2012 to 2013 APGs, and developed draft guides  related to selecting APGs and developing milestones.

Revised guidance could help ensure that agencies  are aware of this requirement and provide information accordingly.  Further, without providing information about external contributors or how  APGs contribute to CAP goals, it is unclear whether agencies have  adequately planned to address performance that spans multiple  organizations, thereby putting these efforts at risk for duplication, overlap,  and fragmentation and potentially wasting scarce funds and limiting the  effectiveness of federal efforts.", "The requirement for agencies to review progress made toward their APGs  on a quarterly basis is intended to increase agencies\u2019 use of the  significant amount of performance information they collect. This, in turn,  can help agencies to improve their performance and results in a more  timely manner\u2014a challenge our work has previously highlighted.  Agencies generally developed performance measures, and collect  information more frequently than in the past. This shows promise for their  ability to use this information to support more timely decision making,  especially when improvements are needed. However, agencies did not  always identify related interim performance targets. This could be  because OMB\u2019s A-11 guidance does not mention the interim quarterly  performance target requirement or define when it would provide data of  significant value and therefore be required, although other OMB guidance  directs agencies to develop these targets. By revising its guidance  documents to consistently include this information, OMB could help  ensure that agencies are meeting its expectation (and the requirement)  that agencies identify interim performance targets for their APGs when  doing so would provide data of significant value. Without clear targets,  which enable a comparison of results against planned performance, it is  unclear if agency managers have the information they need to determine  if they are making sufficient progress toward each APG\u2014a practice our  past work has shown can actually lead to increased use of information  and improved results. In addition, by not providing targets, key  stakeholders have little assurance that an agency is actively managing its  performance to make progress towards its APGs on a quarterly basis,  thereby limiting oversight and accountability opportunities.", "GPRAMA requires agencies to develop clearly defined quarterly  milestones for their APGs, which can help demonstrate that agencies  have identified concrete actions needed to accomplish their goals and  when those actions should be taken.

Based on current  participation, frequent flyers of five airlines as well as individuals enrolled  in other departmental trusted traveler programs\u2014where passengers are  pre-vetted and deemed a trusted traveler\u2014are eligible to be screened on  an expedited basis. This program is intended to allow TSA to focus its  resources on higher risk travelers. Agency officials have reported that  with the deployment of this program and other risk-based security  initiatives, such as modifying screening procedures for passengers 75  and over and active duty service members, TSA has achieved its stated  goal of doubling the number of passengers going through expedited  screening. According to TSA, by the end of calendar year 2013, TSA will  provide expedited screening to 25 percent of the individuals currently  processed through security screening. Achieving this target will mean that  approximately 450,000 of the 1.8 million passengers who travel on  average each day from the nation\u2019s airports will undergo some form of  expedited screening. However, since this goal is focused on passenger  screening, it will not allow TSA to assess its progress in using intelligence  driven information and risk-based decisions in other areas to achieve the  broader outcome of strengthening aviation security counterterrorism  capabilities, such as in screening checked baggage or air cargo. We plan  to initiate a review of TSA\u2019s progress in implementing TSA Pre\u2713\u2122 in  2013.", "In our past work, we found that TSA has taken steps to implement  aviation security mechanisms that are more intelligence-driven and risk- based. For example, TSA implemented the Secure Flight program to  allow it to focus resources on high risk passengers by vetting passengers\u2019  names, dates of birth, and other information against terrorist watch lists.  In May 2009, we reported that TSA had made significant progress in  developing the Secure Flight program but also noted that it faced  challenges in identifying passengers who might use false identifying  information. We also assessed TSA\u2019s efforts to implement a behavior  detection program that seeks to selectively identify potentially high-risk  passengers for additional screening. Our May 2010 report found that  while TSA has taken actions to validate the science underlying the  program and improve performance measurement, among other actions,  more work remains to ensure the program\u2019s effectiveness, such as  developing comprehensive program performance measures. In March  2012, we reported that questions related to the program will remain until  TSA demonstrates that using behavior detection techniques can help  secure the aviation system against terrorist threats.

In its comments on this report, DHS concurred with the  recommendations and stated that TSA is taking steps to implement them.", "In May 2012, we recommended that to help DHS address challenges in  meeting the air cargo screening mandate as it applies to air cargo carried  on passenger flights inbound to the United States, mitigate potential air  cargo security vulnerabilities, and enhance overall efforts to screen and  secure inbound air cargo, the Secretary of Homeland Security should  direct the Administrator of TSA to assess the costs and benefits of  requiring all-cargo carriers to report data on the amount of inbound air  cargo screening being conducted. In comments on the May 2012 report,  DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that TSA was  working on developing a system that will provide the capability for all- cargo carriers to report data on screened high-risk inbound air cargo  shipments. In April 2013, TSA reported that once this system becomes  fully operational, these data will be available for each all-cargo carrier.", "In July 2011, we recommended that TSA develop a plan to deploy  explosives detection systems (EDS) that meet the most recent  explosives-detection requirements and ensure that new machines, as well  as machines deployed in airports, will be operated at the levels  established in those requirements. This plan should include the estimated  costs for new machines and upgrading deployed machines, and the time  frames for procuring and deploying new machines. In commenting on this  report, DHS concurred with the recommendation. As of March 2013, TSA  has a plan in place to evaluate and implement the most recent certified  algorithms on the existing fleet of deployed EDSs. However, our  recommendation calls for a plan to deploy new EDSs as well as to  upgrade existing EDSs in airports to meet the 2010 EDS explosives  detection requirements. Our recommendation was intended to ensure that  all EDSs operating in airports meet the most recent requirements, which  are currently the 2010 requirements.

In September  2009, we reported that HUD had received almost 1,800 applications for  the funds and that its review process had been slower than expected.  According to HUD officials, this was due to the number of applications  with lengthy narratives needing review. Further, HUD officials stated that  their staff were reviewing these applications while carrying out their  ongoing responsibilities related to managing the public housing capital  fund program.

We  concluded in October 2008 that waiting to take action could result in years  more of some manufactured homes being built without improved energy  standards.  HUD has worked with DOE in developing more stringent  energy standards for manufactured homes.

Specifically, we found that although HUD offered several  incentives to keep property owners in the program, some property  owners, managers, and industry representatives cited concerns with  certain HUD policies and practices, especially the one-to-one  replacement policy (which prohibited reductions in the total number of  program units in a property when a contract was renewed), and the  reimbursement process for operating costs in high cost areas. In 2011,  HUD modified this policy and revised the way it calculates reimbursement  for operating costs.

Property owners, managers, and industry representatives with  whom we spoke as part of our April 2007 report indicated that market  conditions were the primary factors in owners\u2019 decisions to leave or  remain in the program. Similarly, HUD has implemented a  recommendation we made in November 2005 to address late housing  assistance payments to landlords, which may encourage owners to  participate in HUD\u2019s project-based program.

Specifically, excess reserves in the voucher program could  be used to serve additional families, if authorized by Congress. In  addition, certain rent reform options (that is, changes to the calculation of  households\u2019 payment toward rent) may allow HUD to serve more people.

As we reported in September 2012, FAA has experienced delays in  deploying ERAM, which affected overall acquisition and maintenance  costs as well as time frames for other programs. Specifically, the ERAM  program is almost 4 years behind its original schedule and about $330  million, or about 15 percent, over its original budget because of the  following factors: unanticipated risks associated with operational complexities at the  field sites,  insufficient testing to identify software issues before deployment at the  field sites,  insufficient communication between the program office and field sites,  and  insufficient stakeholder (e.g., air traffic controller) involvement during  system development and deployment.", "The delays added an estimated $18 million per year to the costs of  maintaining the system that ERAM was meant to replace.", "Since new budget and schedule baselines for the ERAM program were  established in June 2011, according to FAA reports, the program has  made progress toward its goal of initial operating capability of ERAM by  September 30, 2013.

The federal government had not historically  had a strong leadership role in intercity passenger rail but this changed in  2009 when the HSIPR program was authorized. The program provides  grants to states and other entities to develop high speed intercity  passenger rail corridors and projects. As of January 2013, FRA had  awarded grants for 150 high speed intercity passenger rail projects. Of  these projects, FRA had obligated about $9.2 billion for 9 corridor  programs and 57 individual high speed rail projects as of December  2012. According to FRA, by this same date, states and other project  sponsors had begun construction on 5 of the high speed rail corridors and  33 of the individual high speed rail projects. By the end of fiscal year  2013, FRA\u2019s goal is to begin construction on a total of 7 corridor and 36  individual high speed rail projects.", "The fundamental weaknesses of the HSIPR program include not having  well-defined goals, a clear strategic vision, and performance measures to  track program progress. In March 2009, before the HSIPR program was  established, we reported that several principles could help guide the  potential federal role in high speed rail. These principles included, among  other things, creating well-defined goals based on identified areas of  national interest, incorporating performance and accountability for results  into funding decisions, and employing the best analytical tools and  approaches to emphasize return on investment. Similarly, in June 2010,  we reported that FRA\u2019s strategic vision for high speed rail, as outlined in  the agency\u2019s April 2009 Vision for High-Speed Rail in America, did not  define the goals, stakeholder roles, or objectives for federal involvement  in high speed intercity passenger rail and that the agency\u2019s preliminary  national rail plan did not include recommendations for future action.  Further, although states would be among primary HSIPR grant recipients,  many did not have rail plans that would establish strategies and priorities  for rail investments or identify the public benefits of such investments.  Many of these weaknesses continue. For example, in September 2012  the DOT IG reported that FRA\u2019s HSIPR goals lacked the thoroughness  needed to ensure that grant managers and decision makers, including  Congress, could understand them, and that FRA generally lacked  performance measures needed to assess the program\u2019s progress in  achieving its goals as well as complete monitoring mechanisms.  According to DOT, FRA has taken action to address some of the issues  reported by the DOT IG, including developing a standardized mechanism  for collecting and tracking HSIPR grantee performance and compliance  metrics, and developing a comprehensive grants management training  curriculum.", "There are also weaknesses in how the HSIPR program is administered  starting with how HSIPR grants are awarded. In March 2011 we reported  that, although FRA had applied its established criteria during the eligibility  and technical reviews of the HSIPR grant applications, we could not verify  whether it applied its final selection criteria because the documented  rationales for selecting projects were typically vague. We concluded that  without a record that provided insight into why decisions were made, FRA  invited skepticism about the overall fairness of its decision making. Other  program weaknesses include the lack of guidance issued to HSIPR  applicants and FRA\u2019s grants administration framework. In March 2009 we  recommended the Secretary of Transportation develop guidance and  methods for ensuring reliability of ridership and other forecasts used to  determine the viability of high speed rail projects. In March 2012, the DOT  IG also reported that FRA had established only minimal requirements and  guidance on the information HSIPR grant applicants must provide to FRA  on project viability which did not provide enough detail to minimize bias  and ensure accuracy in project viability assessments. In addition, in  September 2012, the DOT IG reported that FRA had issued the policies  and procedures for HSIPR grants management several years after the  program had been established and that insufficient staffing and training  undermined FRA\u2019s efforts to effectively administer and ensure the  accountability of HSIPR grant funds once they are awarded. FRA\u2019s  Grants Management Manual was not issued until April 2012, almost 3  years after the HSIPR program was authorized. FRA\u2019s monitoring plan,  which will, among other things, guide performance and compliance  monitoring for the HSIPR program, was not finalized until March 2012.", "Aside from program weaknesses, we have found that implementing high  speed rail projects is difficult. This difficulty could affect achievement of  program goals.

DOT reported that from 2009 through  2011 FAA exceeded its targets for reducing commercial air carrier  fatalities, well below its 2013 goal.

CAST  has reduced commercial aviation risks by focusing on areas including  controlled flight into terrain, loss of control, and runway incursions. CAST  analyzes accident and incident data to identify precipitating conditions  and causes, and then formulates an intervention strategy designed to  reduce the likelihood of a recurrence. According to CAST, its work\u2014along  with new aircraft, regulations, and other activities\u2014reduced the  commercial aviation fatal accident rate by 83 percent from 1998 to 2008  and is an important aspect of FAA\u2019s efforts to improve aviation safety by  sharing and analyzing data.

SMS represents a proactive  approach to safety and is intended to continually monitor all aspects of  aviation operations and collect appropriate data to identify emerging  safety problems before they result in death, injury, or significant property  damage. SMS implementation is required for FAA and several of its  business lines and the agency is taking steps to require industry  implementation. Several challenges remain that may affect FAA\u2019s ability  to effectively implement SMS. FAA is taking steps to address some of  these, but challenges related to data concerns, its capacity to conduct  analysis and oversight, and standardization of policies and procedures  could negatively affect FAA\u2019s efforts to implement SMS in a timely and  efficient manner and require some skills that agency employees do not  have.

The GAJSC, a government-industry partnership similar to the  CAST approach for commercial aviation, focuses on analyzing general  aviation accident data to develop effective intervention strategies. We  believe that the GAJSC has the potential to contribute to a reduction in  general aviation accidents and fatalities over the long term. However, the  5-year strategy has shortcomings that jeopardize its potential for success  because, among other things, the strategy lacks performance measures  for significant activities. Without a strong performance management  structure, FAA will not be able to determine the success or failure of the  significant activities that underlie the strategy.

Specifically, in  January 2005 we first placed DOD\u2019s security clearance program\u2014which  comprises the vast majority of government-wide clearances\u2014on our High  Risk List because we identified significant delays in completing security  clearances, which sometimes took up to a year to complete. OPM is  currently the investigative service provider for the majority of the  executive branch, including DOD. We removed the high-risk designation  from DOD\u2019s program in February 2011 due to both high-level attention  from various executive branch agencies, including DOD, OMB, and the  Director of National Intelligence and improvement in the timeliness of  DOD clearances, among other things. For example, we found in January  2011 that DOD met the congressionally directed Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 goal of 40 days for initial investigations  throughout fiscal year 2010. This timeliness measure does not include  data on periodic reinvestigations. Timeliness data for investigations is  OPM\u2019s responsibility as the investigative service provider for DOD. For  example, the fastest 90 percent of DOD initial clearance investigations  were processed by OPM in an average of 35 days in fiscal year 2010. In  addition, in 2010 the Performance Accountability Council (PAC) reported  that OPM was meeting investigation timeliness goals for many of the  agencies for which it conducts national security background  investigations. However, we have not comprehensively reported on the  timeliness statistics for all of the national security background  investigations conducted by OPM. Instead, our previous work has  focused on the timeliness of DOD clearances because DOD\u2019s program  was on our High Risk List.", "While OPM conducts background investigations for most of the federal  government, executive branch agencies conduct other phases in the  federal government\u2019s personnel security clearance process. For example,  the requesting agency determines which positions\u2014military, civilian, or  private-industry contracts\u2014require access to classified information and,  therefore, which people must apply for and undergo a security clearance  investigation. OPM, in turn, conducts these investigations using federal  investigative standards and OPM internal guidance as criteria for  collecting background information on applicants. Adjudicators from the  requesting agencies use the information contained in the resulting OPM  investigative reports and consider federal guidelines to determine whether  an applicant is eligible for a personnel security clearance.", "During the time while DOD\u2019s security clearance program was on our High  Risk List, the executive branch initiated actions to reform the government- wide security clearance process, in which OPM had a role as the  investigative service provider. As part of this government-wide reform  effort, Executive Order 13467 established a leadership structure by  creating the PAC. The order appointed the Deputy Director for  Management at OMB as the chair of the council and designated the  Director of National Intelligence as the Security Executive Agent and the  Director of OPM as the Suitability Executive Agent. The PAC is  responsible for holding agencies accountable for the implementation of  suitability, security, and, as appropriate, contractor employee fitness  processes and procedures. In turn, the PAC issued a Strategic  Framework in February 2010, which set forth a mission and strategic  goals, performance measures, a communications strategy, roles and  responsibilities, and metrics to measure the quality of security clearance  investigations and adjudications. Some of the goals and performance  measures developed by the PAC were aimed at addressing the  timeliness of initial security clearance investigations. In addition to the  timeliness of initial investigations and as the result of our work, members  of Congress and federal agencies have expressed concerns about the  quality of the background investigations. The leaders of the PAC also  committed to measuring the quality of investigations by further developing  quality metrics in a memorandum to Congress on May 31, 2010. While  OPM\u2019s agency priority goal to measure timeliness is important; it does not  capture the competing priority of measuring the quality of the  investigations. Finally, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention  Act required the executive branch to annually report on timeliness of  background investigations; however, this requirement expired in 2011, so  there is no mechanism to report the timeliness of the end-to-end  clearance process\u2014including timeliness of initiation and adjudication  phases of the process, the timeliness of investigations that took OPM  longer than 40 days to complete, or other security clearance reform- related goals\u2014to Congressional oversight committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Key Open Recommendations and Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In our May 2009 report, we recommended that the Director of OPM direct  the Associate Director of OPM\u2019s Federal Investigative Services Division to  measure the frequency with which its investigative reports meet federal  investigative standards in order to improve the completeness of future  investigation documentation. As of March 2013, OPM has not  implemented the recommendation to measure how frequently  investigative reports meet federal investigative standards. Instead, OPM  assesses the quality of investigations based on voluntary reporting from  customer agencies. Specifically, OPM tracks investigations that are (1)  returned for rework from the requesting agency; (2) identified as deficient  using a web-based survey; and (3) identified as deficient through  adjudicator calls to OPM\u2019s quality hotline. In our past work, we noted that  the number of investigations returned for rework is not by itself a valid  indicator of the quality of investigative work because adjudication officials  said they were reluctant to return incomplete investigations in anticipation  of delays that would impact timeliness. Further, relying on agencies to  voluntarily provide information on investigation quality may not reflect the  quality of OPM\u2019s total investigation workload. One of OPM\u2019s customer  agencies, DOD developed and implemented a tool known as RAISE to  monitor the quality of investigations completed by OPM, However, OPM  does not use DOD\u2019s tool. According to an OPM official, OPM is working  through the PAC to decide how the executive branch will measure quality  government-wide. While the PAC considered using DOD\u2019s RAISE tool,  among others, according to the OPM official, they opted to develop  another tool that better captures quality. Further, the OPM official stated  OPM\u2019s intent to implement that tool once it is developed by the PAC, but  did not provide an estimated timeframe for development and  implementation.

More recently, in January 2012, OPM released a new plan to improve  retirement processing that aims at targeted, incremental improvements  rather than a large-scale modernization. Under this plan, the agency  expects to eliminate its retirement processing backlog by July 2013 and  accurately process 90 percent of its cases within 60 days. To meet this  goal, OPM reported that it plans to hire and train 76 new staff to address  retirement claims; establish higher production standards and identify  potential retirement process improvements; and work with other agencies  to improve the accuracy and completeness of the data they provide to  OPM for use in retirement processing. However, as we have previously  noted in February 2012, the plan does not address improving or  eliminating the legacy information systems that currently support  retirement processing. Although we have not assessed OPM\u2019s actions or  progress toward fulfilling its January 2012 plan, Performance.gov was  updated to include information about the agency\u2019s progress in December  2012. For example, the agency reported that it had met its targets for  hiring new staff, as well as improving the accuracy and completeness of  retirement data other agencies provide to OPM."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Key Open Recommendations and Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We currently have no open recommendations or matters for  congressional consideration related to this priority goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected GAO Reports", "paragraphs": ["OPM Retirement Modernization: Progress Has Been Hindered by  Longstanding Information Technology Weaknesses.
