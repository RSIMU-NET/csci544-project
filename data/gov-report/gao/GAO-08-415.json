Benefits are issued through Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards, similar to debit cards, to purchase eligible foods at authorized retail stores. The diets of many low-income individuals, like the U.S. population overall, do not meet federal dietary guidelines. One potential strategy for increasing the purchases of targeted foods that contribute to a healthy diet is to incorporate into the program financial incentives for purchasing these foods. GAO was asked to identify (1) what is known about the effectiveness of financial incentives and other approaches intended to increase the purchase of targeted foods, (2) the key factors to consider in designing a financial incentive program, and (3) options available to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) for implementing financial incentives. GAO interviewed agency and state officials, retailers and associations, private EBT contractors, and other stakeholders; convened a panel of 17 experts; and conducted a literature review. In commenting on this report, FNS generally agreed with GAO's findings and concluding observations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A variety of approaches, including financial incentives and nutrition education, can increase the consumption of targeted foods, but little is known about the effectiveness of efforts to increase access to targeted foods. A few studies examining the effectiveness of financial incentives have demonstrated short-term positive effects on purchases, consumption, or weight loss. A study that reviewed 92 nutrition education studies found that most studies reported significant positive effects on consumption. Because of a lack of reported research, little is known about the effectiveness of approaches intended to improve access to targeted foods. Factors to consider in designing a program that delivers financial incentives through an additional food stamp allotment tied to the purchase of targeted foods include the following: (1) Selection of foods: Selecting which foods to promote could be a controversial and challenging part of designing an incentive program. (2) Incentive amount: The amount of the incentive will affect participant response and program costs. (3) Informing participants: Participants must be informed of the availability of incentives to take full advantage of a new incentive program. (4) Program monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and evaluating the incentive program is critical to maintaining program integrity and determining the effects of the program. An incentive program could be implemented through either electronic or paper methods, and the different options would have implications for ease of implementation, program integrity, and cost. Electronic options include adding food benefits to the EBT cards currently used or to a separate card on the basis of the amount that participants spend on targeted foods. Providing incentives using existing EBT cards would build on the current checkout technology and process, and could require less time to complete transactions compared with using a separate card. However, delivering financial incentives to participants' EBT accounts on the basis of their purchases of certain foods would require several changes to the EBT system, such as modifications to retailer and EBT contractor software to separately track the amount spent on the targeted food items. Administering incentives using a separate card, such as an additional EBT card, may be more costly and complicated to implement. Alternatively, providing participants with paper vouchers for the purchase of targeted foods would not require changes to the EBT system, but could be more burdensome to use, increase fraud risk, and increase state administrative costs. With the new authority provided as part of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, FNS will have the opportunity to develop and administer a pilot incentive program and to determine both its effects on participant purchasing and consumption patterns and the costs associated with such a program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The diets of many low-income individuals, like the U.S. population overall,  The diets of many low-income individuals, like the U.S. population overall,  do not meet federal dietary guidelines.

States are responsible for coordinating  and managing the EBT system in their state, but they generally award  contracts to private sector companies to develop and operate the system.  Under the EBT system, FSP participants receive an EBT card imprinted  with their name and account number. FSP benefits are automatically  credited to the participants\u2019 accounts once a month. According to FNS,  more than half of the states use EBT cards to distribute benefits from  other federal programs, such as TANF cash assistance.", "The EBT system uses magnetic strip EBT cards that work like commercial  debit cards and an online system where transactions are processed as they  occur. As shown in figure 1, to complete a FSP EBT purchase, the store  clerk totals the amount of eligible items on the cash register, and the  amount of the EBT purchase is entered into the retailer\u2019s POS device. The  EBT card is then swiped through the POS device at the grocery checkout  counter, and the participant enters a PIN to access the account.

Many large volume retailers have integrated checkout systems that  automatically identify and subtotal the FSP-eligible items when items are  scanned and display the EBT purchase amount on the POS device.  Retailers with scanning systems develop and maintain a computer file that  contains the prices associated with the Universal Product Codes (UPC)  and Price Look-Up (PLU) codes of the items sold in the store. The  computer file can be programmed to contain a FSP eligibility \u201cflag\u201d  associated with each item, which can help the retailer ensure that only  FSP-eligible items are purchased with EBT cards. Some retailers use  commercial POS equipment that can accept multiple payment types, such  as EBT, debit, and credit cards. Retailers that do not accept debit or credit  cards but average more than $100 in monthly FSP sales often have state- provided, stand-alone POS equipment that can only process EBT  transactions.

The studies evaluated the provision of WIC farmers\u2019 market  coupons, price discounts on low-fat items offered in school and work-site  vending machines, and payments contingent on weight loss. For example,  an evaluation of a Farmers\u2019 Market Nutrition Program implemented in a  county in Michigan studied the following approaches with WIC and  Commodity Supplemental Food Program participants: education about the  use, storage, and nutritional value of fruits and vegetables; farmers\u2019 market  coupons; both education and coupons; and no education or coupons.

This study also found that the maximum  impact of the intervention on attitudes about fruit and vegetable  consumption and intake was achieved through a combination of education  and coupons. Additional evidence from the WIC program suggests that  providing cash value vouchers for purchasing fruits and vegetables can  increase the consumption of these items. New York State found that 81  percent of the $5 checks that were provided to households with children  in the WIC program for the purchase of fruits and vegetables were  redeemed.

A 20 percent reduction in price would raise consumption by  about \u00bc cup, bringing total daily consumption up to 2.20 cups.", "In contrast, another ERS study suggested that a modest increase in income  would not result in increased spending on fruits and vegetables in low- income households. ERS examined the relationship between increased  income, which could be spent on any food or nonfood item, and fruit and  vegetable expenditures in low-income households. This study found no  relationship between a 10 percent increase in income and expenditures on  fruits, vegetables, eggs, dairy products, or baked foods among low-income  households.

Less intense  approaches, such as telephone contacts and computer-generated  information tailored to the participant, can also be effective. Increases in  fruit and vegetable consumption ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 servings per day in  approaches used for healthy adults. Nutrition education approaches  appeared to be more successful at positively changing dietary behavior  among populations at risk of or diagnosed with disease than among  general, healthy populations, according to two study reviews. According  to the study reviews, these approaches may be more successful because  (1) higher-risk individuals are more motivated to change and (2)  approaches with higher-risk populations, such as those offered in health  care settings, may be more intense than approaches used with lower-risk  populations in community, workplace, or school settings.", "Providing nutrition information at the point of purchase\u2014such as posters,  brochures, and shelf and food labels\u2014is another nutrition education  approach that can positively affect food purchasing behavior, although the  results from reported research on this approach are mixed.

The grocery store  intervention studies that showed the greatest changes in behavior lasted  for 2 years, involved a large supermarket chain, and involved multiple  components. One of the studies reviewed found significant increases in  the sales of low-calorie or reduced-calorie foods after a 2-year effort  involving shelf labeling, pamphlets, and advertisements on television and  radio and in newspapers. The authors of this review concluded that  nutrition information approaches and financial incentives appear to be  more successful in settings where food choices are limited, such as  workplace cafeterias or school settings, rather than in grocery stores.  Food labels may also have an effect on dietary intake. In a study  estimating the effect of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990,  which took effect in 1994 and made nutrition labeling mandatory for most  processed foods, researchers found that the new labels were associated  with a decrease in body weight and the probability of obesity among   non-Hispanic white women.

For example,  FNS reported that food restrictions would increase program complexity  and cost, since either FNS or food manufacturers and producers would  need to assess and certify a large number of food products that meet new  federal standards. ERS reported that restricting purchases of \u201cunhealthful\u201d  foods and beverages may not be a promising strategy for dietary  improvement, in part because FSP participants may use their own money  to buy prohibited items or substitute the prohibited foods for other foods  similar to the prohibited items."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Information on Costs and Sustained Effects and Methodological Differences among Studies Make It Difficult to Identify the Most Effective Approaches", "paragraphs": ["The studies reviewed provided little information about the cost or  sustainability of the nutrition promotion approaches.

Food manufacturers may want the targeted foods to  include a wide variety of products because they could see financial gain,  nutritionists may not agree on which foods are the healthiest, and  advocacy groups may not want FSP participants to be restricted in their  food choices. States may also advocate for locally grown or produced  foods to be targeted for promotion.", "Developing a list of individual food items that either meet certain  nutritional criteria or contain a particular ingredient, such as whole grains,  would be challenging because the nutritive content of thousands of food  items would need to be evaluated to identify the eligible items.

However, using a general food category could allow some foods with less  nutritive value to be included in that category. For example, the nutritive  value of fruits and vegetables varies extensively from one to the other.  Offering incentives for purchasing all fruits and vegetables would include  frozen or canned items that may contain added sugar or salt, thereby  making them less healthy.", "In addition, availability of the targeted foods may be limited in some areas,  depending on the foods selected. Some stakeholders we interviewed said  small retailers serving large urban areas may not stock certain foods, such  as fresh produce.

In this scenario, the retailer would ring up the targeted food  purchases, the participant would swipe their EBT card for the purchase  amount, and the retailer would give the participant a portion of the  purchase amount in cash and pocket the difference. FNS officials  suggested that limiting the amount of targeted food purchases that would  trigger the incentive may reduce the risk of fraud and the cost of the  incentive program (e.g., participants can receive incentives for purchasing  up to $50 of the targeted foods per month). FNS indicated that it would  need to incorporate any new program into its existing oversight activities  by monitoring the total amount spent on the targeted foods and developing  criteria to flag suspicious transactions.

Appropriate sample sizes would need to be  determined to allow meaningful comparisons of these two groups.  However, alternative research designs could be used if randomly assigning  participants to comparison groups is not possible.

Any research design would have to take into account an  appropriate time frame for the pilot, allowing time for retailers to change  their operations to be able to implement the pilot and for participants to  change their purchasing habits in response to the incentives. In light of  these concerns, when ERS was consulted by California on its proposed  pilot, ERS suggested that the evaluation include a before-and-after review  of the purchases made by participants and nonparticipants, and that pilot  counties be randomly selected.", "Measuring results: Researchers could measure changes in participants\u2019  food purchases, consumption, or health outcomes to determine the effects  of a financial incentive program. Measuring health outcomes would  require tracking participants over an extended period. California\u2019s  legislation authorizing a pilot incentive program requires researchers to  assess whether the pilot program resulted in FSP participants\u2019 increased  purchases of fresh fruits and vegetables. FNS officials suggested that a  study could compare FSP participants\u2019 purchases with federal dietary  guideline recommendations before and after an incentive program was  piloted. If the purpose of the program were to encourage a diet that meets  federal dietary guidelines and improves the health of participants, the  effect on participant\u2019s consumption and health could also be examined.", "Options for measuring changes in food purchasing behavior include  collecting participant-reported information or collecting food purchase  records from retailers. Understanding whether participants increased  their purchases of targeted foods would require gathering information on  how the participants spent their entire food budget, since participants may  pay for food several ways (e.g., cash, TANF cash benefits, EBT, or credit  cards) and shop at multiple stores. Researchers would need this  information to know if more targeted foods were being purchased or if  participants were substituting the new targeted benefits for money they  were already spending on those foods. Gathering this information may be  challenging, depending on how the financial incentives are delivered. For  example, FNS officials said one disadvantage of using paper vouchers is  that the redeemed vouchers may not be linked to the rest of the family\u2019s  purchases or household demographic information. Using participant- reported information on purchases to measure effectiveness can be  problematic if participants cannot recall the information or if they  otherwise misreport purchases. Using purchase data to analyze changes in  purchases would be more accurate but could be difficult to collect and  analyze. For example, collecting purchase data would likely require  researchers to enter into data-sharing agreements with multiple retailers,  which would need to include provisions to protect participants\u2019 privacy.

Programming the additional field  would enable the cash register system to automatically ring up and  subtotal the targeted food purchase when the items\u2019 product codes are  scanned. Maintaining an updated list of the eligible items could be  challenging because UPC and PLU codes can change when new products  are added or certain foods are included in special promotions. Also, fresh  produce vendors use varying PLU codes for the same fruits and  vegetables. Smaller retailers without scanning technology and a  computerized price file system would need to manually sort out and  subtotal up to three piles of food: one for the targeted foods that are  eligible for the incentive, one for other FSP-eligible items, and one for   non-FSP-eligible items.", "Successfully implementing an incentive program depends in part on the  level of guidance retailers receive regarding foods that qualify for the  incentives. Generally, there are two ways that retailers could identify  which foods sold in their stores are the targeted foods eligible for  incentives: that is, (1) FNS or states could develop a detailed list of the  targeted foods and associated product codes or (2) FNS or states could  provide a broad definition of the targeted foods and retailers could decide  which of the foods in their stores would qualify. Retailer representatives  and state officials we interviewed preferred that the foods eligible for  incentives be defined at the federal level to assist retailers operating in  multiple states and to minimize the burden on states. Retailer  representatives on the expert panel said it would help retailers implement  the program if FNS provided a detailed list of the targeted foods and  associated product codes. However, FNS officials on the panel said FNS  lacks the resources to develop and maintain a detailed list and would  prefer to provide a more general definition of the foods targeted for  promotion.", "Tracking purchases of targeted foods: The total amount spent on the  targeted foods must be tracked separately from other purchases to  calculate and apply the incentives to participants\u2019 EBT accounts. To  process the transactions, expert panelists agreed that the total amount  spent on the targeted foods should be communicated through the EBT  system, rather than requiring retailers to complete additional reporting. A  few retailers commented that any ongoing reporting on individual  purchases in addition to the reporting that takes place during EBT  transactions at the POS would be burdensome, especially for smaller  retailers that may not have detailed accounting procedures. Tracking the  total amount spent on the targeted foods separately from other FSP- eligible items would require software modifications to retailers\u2019 POS  devices.", "Calculating and applying the incentive: To apply incentives to  participants\u2019 EBT accounts, EBT contractors would need to develop  software for calculating and applying the incentives and to modify their  software to include a new transaction type that tracks the amount spent  on the targeted foods. The interface between the EBT contractors\u2019 systems  and state information systems that contain benefit issuance data may need  to be modified. EBT contractors would also need to modify their retailer  and participant complaint processes, modify automated telephone  systems, and train customer service representatives to support the new  benefit.", "Modifying and updating the retailer cash register systems and POS devices  could be challenging with different types of equipment and varying levels  of technical support. Smaller independent grocery stores that install and  maintain their own equipment may face significant challenges in making  technical changes if they do not have ongoing technical support.

A retailer  representative that works with small grocery stores suggested that the  easiest and least expensive method to pilot an incentive program would be  for the state to provide participants with the coupons and reimburse  retailers when the coupons are redeemed, since none of the EBT-related  systems would need to be changed. Figure 7 illustrates one way that  financial incentives could be delivered using paper vouchers. In this  example, participants are provided with paper vouchers valued at $10,  which are to be spent on the targeted foods, rather than with a bonus that  is based on the amount spent on the targeted foods.", "Paper vouchers have been used successfully to facilitate the purchase of  fruits and vegetables in other programs. FNS\u2019s farmers\u2019 market programs  and the WIC fruit and vegetable pilot program provided paper vouchers to  WIC participants and elderly individuals so that they could purchase fruits  and vegetables. For example, California piloted a program that provided  vouchers for fruit and vegetable purchases for low-income women  participating in the WIC program. A study evaluating the California WIC  fruit and vegetable pilot reported that low-income women used the  supplement almost fully and purchased a wide variety of fresh fruits and  vegetables with the vouchers.

In addition, participants may  not use the financial incentives if they perceive that a stigma is associated  with using paper vouchers at the grocery store.

Although  research has found that financial incentives and nutrition education both  show promise, not enough is known about the costs and long-term  effectiveness of these approaches, either alone or in combination.  Moreover, the financial incentives studied included coupons. Incentives  using the current EBT technology, although technically feasible, are  largely untested at this point. Also, the success of efforts to improve  dietary intake may hinge in part on the availability of targeted foods,  which may be limited in certain areas, such as small stores in large urban  areas. Little is known about efforts to increase access to healthy foods.  Only by testing these approaches, either alone or in combination, can the  costs of such a program be estimated. Depending on the approaches  selected for testing, estimates would need to include the costs of  developing and administering the program, changing retailer checkout  systems, training employees, educating participants, and providing  increased benefit amounts. Program outcomes, such as changes to  participant purchasing and consumption patterns, will also be challenging  to assess and will not be useful unless similar outcome measures are  developed that can be used across different projects to allow comparison.  Evaluating the long-term effect of the changes on the health of program  participants will likely prove to be even more difficult to assess.
