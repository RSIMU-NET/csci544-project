For example, in 2012, when developing a web-based search tool to help potential customers identify relevant federal technology transfer opportunities across federal laboratories (labs), FLC discussed how to implement the tool with its federal member labs and agencies. However, FLC did not assess the information needs of potential customers to ensure the tool would provide relevant information in a format that customers consider useful, as called for by leading practices and federal internal control standards on communicating with and obtaining information from stakeholders. FLC officials said they conducted testing to ensure the new website functioned as intended before launching it, but did not involve potential customers in these tests. Moreover, after developing the tool, FLC did not communicate with potential customers to collect feedback from them consistent with leading practices regarding the extent to which the tool met their needs or how it might be improved before implementing it.

For example, FLC collects data on the general use of its clearinghouse initiatives, such as the number of technology transfer inquiries it receives, the number of unique views of its web pages, and the average time spent on a web page. However, FLC has not developed performance goals or measures related to the key strategic goals to which its clearinghouse initiatives contribute. Without performance measures, FLC is unable to determine whether its initiatives are having their desired effect or how their performance might be improved.

Technology transfer is the term used to refer to the process by which  technology or expertise developed for one purpose is used for another  purpose. In some instances, it involves the transfer of legal rights, such  as licensing a government-owned patent to a private-sector entity.  Technology transfer also includes collaboration between private  companies and federal labs, for example, in the testing of advanced  batteries. In other instances, technology transfer involves the informal  transmission of information, knowledge, and skills through person-to- person or organization-to-organization interaction.

We also  interviewed FLC officials, including members of FLC\u2019s national and  regional leadership, such as the FLC chair and several of FLC\u2019s six  regional coordinators. We used this information to identify how FLC  develops initiatives and measures results, including how FLC engages  with potential customers that may want to participate in technology  transfer opportunities, such as small and large businesses,  entrepreneurs, and organizations focused on state and local economic  development. We compared FLC\u2019s efforts to design, implement, and  measure the results of its initiatives to leading federal practices outlined in  Executive Order 12862, HowTo.gov, the GPRA [Government  Performance and Results Act] Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA),  and GAO standards for internal control in the federal government.", "In addition, we conducted interviews using a standard set of questions  with nonprobability samples of officials from the technology transfer offices at four federal agencies:  the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA), Department  of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department  of Defense (DOD) to obtain their views on FLC and its clearinghouse  initiatives;  representatives from six technology transfer organizations to learn  about their technology transfer clearinghouse initiatives and key  features their customers found useful; and  representatives from eight customer groups who could potentially use  the information provided through FLC\u2019s clearinghouse initiatives.", "Our selection of agencies, technology transfer organizations, and  potential customer group representatives was based on nonprobability  samples and their views are not generalizable to those we did not  interview but provide illustrative examples.

One of the first  technology transfer laws, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation  Act of 1980, articulated the need for a strong national policy supporting  domestic technology transfer and required federal labs to establish an  office of research and technology applications and devote budget and  personnel resources to promoting technology cooperation and the  transfer of federal technologies. These offices (which we refer to as  technology transfer offices) are generally responsible for coordinating  each lab\u2019s efforts to identify technologies available for transfer, obtaining  patents or other legal protections for lab technologies, and negotiating  technology transfer agreements with outside parties. In addition, the  administration has emphasized the importance of technology transfer  from federal labs. For example, in his October 2011 memorandum,  President Obama directed federal agencies to take actions to accelerate  technology transfer and support private sector commercialization in an  effort to promote innovation and increase the economic and societal  impact of federal R&D investments. Moreover, President Obama\u2019s fiscal  year 2015 budget identified a new Lab-To-Market cross-agency priority  goal to support innovation, economic growth, and job creation.  Specifically, the goal outlines several actions to, over the next four years,  accelerate and improve the transfer of technologies from federal labs to  the commercial marketplace, including optimizing the management,  discoverability, and ease-of-license of federally funded patents and  increasing the utilization of federally funded research facilities by  entrepreneurs and innovators.", "Even with this emphasis on technology transfer, we and others have  identified a number of challenges associated with technology transfer  from federal labs. These challenges include the following:", "Technology transfer is often not a priority for lab managers and  funding tends not to allow for widespread technology transfer  outreach.", "Scientists may not understand the potential commercial applicability of  their innovations.", "Rules and requirements that labs must follow in transferring  technology, as well as a lack of standardization thereof, increase the  complexity and length of time of the negotiation process with potential  partners, and create a disincentive to working with the labs.", "Lab technologies are often not well-developed enough for use in  market-ready products and may require investment of additional time  and money to develop.", "Companies are often not aware of the potentially useful technologies  being developed in federal labs.", "Companies and entrepreneurs often prefer access to and personal  contact with researchers to turn an early stage innovation into a  market-ready product, and this may be difficult because conflict-of- interest rules that ensure that public employees do not unfairly benefit  from federally funded inventions prevent scientists from being  involved in business ventures.", "One of the federal efforts to facilitate technology transfer from federal labs  to the private sector and others was the creation of FLC. FLC was  established by law in the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 to,  among other things, (1) develop training for federal lab employees  engaged in technology transfer and (2) facilitate communication and  cooperation between federal lab technology transfer offices and regional,  state, and local technology transfer organizations. The Federal  Technology Transfer Act also established requirements for FLC\u2019s  membership and funding.", "Since its establishment in 1986, FLC\u2019s mission has evolved. Earlier in its  history, FLC\u2019s efforts, in large part, focused on providing training and  networking for federal technology transfer staff. However, FLC has, in  recent years, taken on more responsibility for helping federal agencies  provide potential customers with information on available technology  transfer opportunities and for functioning as a clearinghouse. These  efforts were bolstered by the President\u2019s 2011 memorandum calling for  an online clearinghouse of federal technologies, and FLC took the lead  role in establishing such a tool. Changes to how FLC defines its mission  from being primarily focused on the federal labs to expanding its focus  beyond the federal labs reflect this transition. For example, in FLC\u2019s 2009  annual report to the President and Congress, FLC defined its mission as  to help federal labs transfer technologies developed through the federal  government\u2019s R&D efforts. In FLC\u2019s 2012 annual report to the President  and Congress, FLC defined its mission as to promote and facilitate the  rapid movement of federal lab research results and technologies into the  mainstream of the U.S. economy.", "FLC\u2019s standing committees include a state and local government committee and a  communications committee, among others.

Since 1987, FLC has provided a  Technology Locator service whereby an FLC staff member will try to  connect customers with relevant labs based on technology needs  submitted by customers through a phone call, e-mail, or online form.  FLC\u2019s online form provides a space for potential customers to explain  their technology request or problem, desired results, and expectations  of a federal lab, among other information. Using this information, FLC  will identify laboratory resources and contacts that can respond to  specific requests and will facilitate communication between the  potential customer and the lab contacts. Once contact is made, further  discussion or negotiation of a technology transfer agreement occurs  between the potential customer and the lab representative. FLC  officials said customers who submit requests usually receive a  response within 48 hours.", "Available Technologies tool. In 2012, FLC released the Available  Technologies tool to provide a web-based search tool for collecting  and disseminating information on publicly available federally owned  inventions and, when available, licensing agreements. The tool can  help potential customers identify more than 20,000 available lab  technologies across approximately 225 labs by searching the  websites of 13 participating agencies. FLC reported spending  approximately $30,000 for a contractor to develop the tool, which  relies on a customized Google search tool to link potential customers  to the existing information on agencies\u2019 technology transfer websites  based on key words the customer enters. The key word search can  be refined to include or exclude certain words and may also be  focused on technologies published within a certain time period. In  addition, the Available Technologies tool webpage includes a listing of  the latest technologies available for transfer from federal labs.  According to FLC, it plans to continue to develop this tool as it gains  access to additional data from federal labs through various  government-wide initiatives.", "FLCBusiness. FLC is developing a new web-based search tool called  FLCBusiness that is scheduled to become publically available in fall  2014, according to FLC officials, and is intended to allow potential  customers to search for technology development programs, available  funding, and to learn about the capabilities of federal lab facilities. The  tool is designed to allow potential customers to perform key word  searches for labs, or funding or technology development programs,  and to refine searches to a specific agency, geographic location, or  technology area. The tool also is to provide links to additional  information on licenses, CRADAs, and other technology transfer  methods. As of August 2014, FLC reported spending approximately  $150,000 to develop the tool.", "In addition, FLC has utilized various communication tools, such as social  media, outreach by regional FLC members to local technology transfer  organizations, its annual meeting, and an online newsletter and news  forum, to communicate with potential customers and promote its  clearinghouse initiatives and technology transfer success stories. For  example, in 2013, FLC began providing an opportunity for industry  representatives from large corporations to present their companies\u2019  technology needs to participating federal lab officials as part of its annual  meeting, according to an industry representative we interviewed. During  the 2014 FLC annual meeting, we observed that industry representatives  described technology needs ranging from advanced materials to robotics.  FLC used the opportunity to do a presentation to publicize its  clearinghouse initiatives and, after the presentation, industry  representatives and agency members had an opportunity to interact and  exchange contact information.", "FLC\u2019s process to design and implement its primary clearinghouse  initiatives involves FLC committees and regional coordinators annually  proposing new ideas for consideration by FLC\u2019s Executive Board.  According to FLC officials, the Executive Board considers proposals in  relation to available resources and conducts outreach to agency and lab  members. For example, in 2012 when developing its Available  Technologies tool, FLC reached out to its agency and lab members when  considering possible options for designing a clearinghouse of available  technology transfer opportunities. After receiving input from agency and  lab members, including concerns about the burden, ability, or willingness  to compile data on available technology transfer opportunities for FLC,  FLC officials said they designed the Available Technologies tool to  minimize the burden on agencies to collect and share their data.  Specifically, rather than ask agencies to gather relevant data on federally  owned inventions, which were not already centralized and did not exist in  a standard format, FLC developed a web-based search tool that would  direct potential customers to existing information on federal labs\u2019  websites. FLC officials determined this tool (1) would not require FLC  resources to manipulate agency data and (2) would not require agency  members to update information separately from what they already  planned to include on their websites. FLC officials said they considered  FLC to be best-positioned to take the lead in developing the kind of  clearinghouse tool described in the President\u2019s 2011 memorandum  because it was an interagency body, had already developed a  clearinghouse tool when the memorandum called for the creation of a  similar database, and because FLC\u2019s funding for the clearinghouse tool  was potentially more stable than if the tool were funded by a specific  agency appropriation that needed to be approved each fiscal year.", "However, FLC did not assess the information needs of potential  customers of federal lab technologies to ensure the Available  Technologies tool would provide relevant information in a format that  customers consider useful, as called for by leading practices. Federal  leading practices outlined in Executive Order 12862 and HowTo.gov  direct agencies to assess customer needs when designing and  implementing initiatives. For example, Executive Order 12862 directs  agencies to identify and survey customers to determine the kind and  quality of services they want in an effort to develop and meet customer  service standards. HowTo.gov also outlines the need to engage with  customers to collect and address customer feedback through, for  example, online surveys or focus groups, and indicates a need to conduct  regular user testing of government websites with actual customers. In  addition, according to federal standards for internal control, federal  management should ensure that there are adequate means of  communicating with and obtaining information from external stakeholders  that may have a significant impact on an agency\u2019s achieving its goals.  FLC has not taken such steps as part of its approach to design and  implement its clearinghouse initiatives. For example, FLC officials said  that when designing the Available Technologies tool, they conducted  testing to make sure searches on the site functioned as intended, but that  potential customers were not involved in this testing. Moreover, after  developing the tool, FLC did not communicate with potential customers to  collect feedback from them consistent with leading practices regarding  the extent to which the tool met customers\u2019 needs or how it might be  improved before implementing it. Similarly, we found that, while FLC is in  the final stages of developing its new web-based search tool,  FLCBusiness, FLC officials said potential customers had not seen early  versions of the tool and had an opportunity to provide feedback. Instead,  FLC officials said the tool was extensively tested by its web-design  contractor and reviewed by members of its Executive Board. FLC officials  told us that they demonstrated the tool for agency members and sent the  early, or beta, version to laboratory representatives for user testing and  data input. The tool was introduced at FLC\u2019s 2014 annual meeting,  although it was not clear whether any feedback was collected from  potential customers based on our observation of the meeting. Without  communicating with potential customers on FLC\u2019s tools, allowing for  customers to test them, and collecting feedback on their usefulness, FLC  is not following internal control standards or leading practices and does  not have assurance that its tools will meet customer needs.", "According to some representatives from customer groups and one technology transfer  organization, federal lab patents may not afford adequate intellectual property protection  to support commercialization because they sometimes protect only the specific version of  the invention relevant to the lab\u2019s mission from infringement, which would potentially allow  a competitor to offer a similar product. across multiple labs, but these may be difficult to identify through  FLC\u2019s Available Technologies tool because labs and agencies  describe technologies differently. For example, some technologies  from NASA are presented as scientific research results, while  technologies with similar search terms from DOD are presented as  potential product components. A representative from one technology  transfer organization we interviewed said that a small company he  worked with would not have been able to identify relevant patents on  its own because the company needed patents from 11 different  federal labs to cover different components of a product it was  developing to filter water used in oil and natural gas drilling. Other  representatives of potential customer groups and technology transfer  organizations said that while large companies have the time and  money to search for technologies across numerous labs, smaller  companies generally do not.", "Limited information on technologies\u2019 market relevance: Customers  may benefit from more information on the potential market relevance  of technologies, which is not always provided in the agency and lab  information available through FLC\u2019s Available Technologies tool. For  example, one representative from a technology transfer organization  said that clearinghouse search results that are highly technical\u2014as  with those in FLC\u2019s Available Technologies tool that are primarily  based on patents\u2014may make sense to research scientists who know  relevant technical terms, but not necessarily to entrepreneurs who  may not be aware of the technical key words relevant to a variety of  potential solutions to their technology needs. In addition, some  customer representatives said information on market relevance is  useful because federally patented technologies are generally not  close to being market-ready, and additional R&D is needed to bring  products to market.", "We observed a few of these limitations during a keyword search we  conducted using FLC\u2019s Available Technologies tool. In particular, when  we attempted to identify similar technologies across agencies and labs  based on a keyword search, the results were not standardized, and some  results from some agencies offered different information than others. For  example, a result from one agency provided a link to a 15-page research  publication related to the technology, while a result from another provided  a one-sentence overview of the technology\u2019s potential market relevance.  Moreover, not every result included contact information for researchers  affiliated with the technology. For instance, one result provided a list of  links to agency-wide opportunities for partnerships between the private  sector and the agency, but this list did not include contact information for  any researchers, nor was it clear which links on the page related to the  original search term. Figure 2 shows the different types of information that  may be included in FLC search results.", "FLC has taken steps that may help address some of the issues  representatives of technology transfer organizations and other potential  customer groups identified and that we observed. For example, in 2012,  FLC began a systematic effort to identify potential customers of federal  technology transfer opportunities, including entrepreneurs and small  businesses, in different regions of the country. This effort started with an  initial study conducted in FLC\u2019s Midwest region that found a number of  unmet customer needs related to technology transfer, including a need for  technical and financial help for entrepreneurs and improved customer  service and dissemination of information on available technologies.  Although this effort represented an important step in engaging with  potential customers, it did not focus on obtaining their input on what  information they might want from an FLC clearinghouse tool and in what  format. In addition, FLC\u2019s clearinghouse tools, taken together when  FLCBusiness becomes publically available, could provide potential  customers with more information on available technology transfer  opportunities than FLC currently provides through the Available  Technologies tool. For example, FLC anticipates using FLCBusiness to  provide information on lab facilities, which representatives of potential  customer groups and other technology transfer organizations noted is  generally missing from the Available Technologies tool. Moreover, if a  potential customer is unable to find a facility or technology in  FLCBusiness or the Available Technologies tool, the potential customer  could contact the Technology Locator service to get in touch with a  laboratory representative. Figure 3 depicts how FLC\u2019s clearinghouse tools  could work together to help potential customers identify technology  transfer opportunities to meet their needs. However, since FLC has not  fully communicated with and obtained feedback from potential customers  in developing FLCBusiness, it lacks assurance that FLCBusiness or its  suite of clearinghouse tools will meet customers\u2019 needs.", "FLC faces challenges in its ability to more fully communicate with  potential customers to facilitate technology transfer from federal labs  without also engaging FLC\u2019s agency and lab members. FLC\u2019s web-based  clearinghouse tools depend on information provided by agency and lab  members to help build or update the databases on which the tools are  based. For instance, FLC officials said the Available Technologies tool  depends on information about agency technologies available to FLC  through existing agency websites. As noted above, this information often  varies across agencies and can present similar technologies differently or  use different technical terminology, and representatives of potential  customers said these differences could make it difficult for outside parties  to find the most appropriate information to meet their needs. Agency  officials from NIH, DOE, DOD, and NASA also told us that it could be  challenging for them to justify gathering new or different information  related to technology transfer opportunities until FLC demonstrated that  customer needs would be better met with additional information  presented in a different format. They also noted that FLC may not be well- positioned to conduct additional customer outreach to collect feedback  without working with agency and lab members, making it difficult for the  consortium to improve its existing search tools on its own. Some agency  officials said that any improvements based on customer feedback would  require a significant collaborative effort on the part of FLC and its agency  and lab members, given the relatively small size of FLC\u2019s annual budget  and available staff. By working collaboratively with agency and lab  members to collect feedback on its initiatives\u2019 usefulness, FLC can take  advantage of its members\u2019 knowledge and expertise to better  communicate with potential customers consistent with federal leading  practices.", "Even with the challenges FLC faces, several FLC and agency officials as  well as representatives of other technology transfer organizations  supported FLC\u2019s clearinghouse initiatives. Representatives from some  other organizations that provide information on federal technology  transfer opportunities said they only have information about technology at  a small number of federal labs, and one organization said it charges  users or labs a fee for use of its tools. In contrast, some FLC and lab  officials said FLC\u2019s clearinghouse initiatives serve an important function  because they have the potential to provide more comprehensive  information about technology transfer opportunities at federal labs at no  cost to potential customers. One FLC official also noted that, while the  Available Technologies tool has limited capability since the data it reports  are unstructured and not standardized in any way, the relatively low cost  of the tool and the quick time frame over which it was developed made it  an important interim step to providing a global search capability for  available federal technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FLC Has Not Measured the Performance of Its Clearinghouse Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Although FLC collects some data related to the use of its clearinghouse  initiatives, it has not used performance goals and measures consistent  with federal agency leading practices to measure results and does not  have the information necessary to determine the extent to which its efforts  help achieve FLC\u2019s overall strategic goals.", "FLC tracks the number of requests for assistance it receives through its  Technology Locator service by (1) the technology area the customer is  interested in (e.g., energy, pharmaceutical, or manufacturing); (2) the  nature of the customer\u2019s interest (e.g., informational or technology need);  and (3) type of customer that submitted the request (e.g., academic,  investor, or small business). According to FLC officials, in 2013, the  Technology Locator service received 172 requests for assistance. This  number represented a decrease from the 203 requests for assistance  FLC received in 2012. In addition, FLC collects success stories, which it  posts on its website. For example, one of the success stories describes a  business owner who placed a Technology Locator request to ask for help  with software development\u2014the Locator successfully put her in touch  with relevant staff at federal labs who were able to offer assistance. FLC  also collects data on the general use of the Available Technologies tool,  such as the number of unique views of web pages and the average time  spent on a web page. One report showed that, from January 1 through  July 14, 2014, FLC\u2019s Available Technologies tool had 2,010 page views  from unique customers and 3,240 page views overall.", "FLC has developed a number of strategic goals over the years. The last  strategic plan FLC developed was for 2009 and it contained three goals:  (1) develop FLC members to be leaders in technology transfer; (2) foster  an environment for technology transfer; and (3) enhance the professional  organizational structure of FLC. More recently, in its 2012 annual report to  the President and Congress, FLC identified four strategic goals for all  FLC activities: (1) outreach/communication, (2) training/education, (3)  networking, and (4) recognition. An FLC workgroup is currently working  on a new strategic plan, which FLC reported will not be ready until the  end of 2014.", "FLC has not, however, developed performance goals or measures to  align its initiatives with its strategic goals, as recommended by leading  practices to improve government performance and results. In particular,  GPRAMA requires that agencies develop strategic plans that include  general, long-term goals and objectives, along with an agency  performance plan that describes how specific performance goals for the  current and subsequent fiscal year contribute to an agency\u2019s strategic  goals and objectives. The performance plan should contain, among other  things, a description of how the performance goals are to be achieved,  including clearly defined milestones, and establish a balanced set of  performance indicators, or measures, that will help demonstrate progress  toward achieving the performance goals. We have found that these  requirements also can serve as leading practices for strategic planning at  lower levels within federal agencies, such as planning for individual  divisions, programs or initiatives. Among these leading practices is  developing and using performance measures, which allow an agency to  track the progress it is making toward its mission and goals, provide  managers information on which to base their organizational and  management decisions, and create powerful incentives to influence  organizational and individual behavior. Further, federal leading practices  outlined by HowTo.gov state that agencies should use performance  metrics to influence the design of and drive improvements for government  websites.", "However, FLC did not translate the strategic goals identified in its 2012  annual report into performance goals and measures. In particular, FLC  did not develop any performance goals or measures related to its  strategic goals of outreach or networking, which are, as FLC officials  stated, the current goals to which its clearinghouse initiatives would   In addition, while FLC tracks usage of its clearinghouse contribute. initiatives, FLC has not established performance measures for these  initiatives that would help it assess the extent to which the initiatives are  achieving FLC\u2019s goals of outreach and networking or how performance  might be improved. For example, FLC does not collect information on the  number of connections between lab staff and potential customers that  resulted from use of the Available Technologies tool. As a result, some  agency officials told us it was unclear how well the tool helps to facilitate  technology transfer from federal labs. Working collaboratively with agency  and lab members to develop and collect data on performance measures  for FLC\u2019s clearinghouse initiatives could help FLC demonstrate the  usefulness of its tools to its members while also helping FLC measure  progress toward achieving its own goals. Some representatives of other  technology transfer organizations we interviewed said they measure the  results of their efforts using performance measures, such as the number  of companies formed, the number of joint investment agreements  between labs and private companies, and the number of successful  technology transfer partnerships they help to facilitate. Without some type  of performance measures, FLC will be unable to assess whether its  initiatives are meeting FLC\u2019s goals of outreach and networking. Further,  given that FLC has not developed such measures, its annual report to  Congress does not contain information on the progress toward the  achievement of FLC\u2019s goals of outreach and networking, limiting the  information that the administration and Congress receive on the  effectiveness of FLC\u2019s initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Recognized as one of 15 cross-agency priority goals in the President\u2019s  2015 budget, technology transfer has become an increasingly important  strategy to support economic growth, create jobs, and increase the global  competitiveness of U.S. industries. As FLC\u2019s role in promoting technology  transfer has expanded, particularly following the President\u2019s 2011  memorandum, the consortium has launched important initiatives to make  information about federal technology transfer opportunities more available  to potential customers. FLC is uniquely positioned to contribute to the  President\u2019s goal of supporting innovation, economic growth, and job  creation as the only interagency body federally mandated to facilitate  technology transfer.", "However, FLC\u2019s efforts to communicate with potential customers often  are not consistent with federal standards for internal control on  communicating with and obtaining information from stakeholders and do  not incorporate leading practices that call for agencies to consider  customer needs when designing and implementing government services.  Without better communicating with potential customers during the design  and implementation of clearinghouse initiatives, FLC may not be able to  effectively assess customer needs, conduct user tests of its web-based  initiatives, and collect customer feedback. As a result, FLC does not have  assurance that its initiatives will meet customer needs, and  representatives of potential customer groups indicated that there was a  significant mismatch between the information that would allow them to  identify opportunities and what FLC\u2019s initiatives currently provide.", "While commercialization of technological innovations is a private sector  role rather than a responsibility of the federal government,  representatives of potential customer groups stressed that federal labs  have extensive value and expertise that they find difficult to access.  Officials from federal agencies told us that any improvements to FLC\u2019s  initiatives based on customer feedback would require a significant  collaborative effort on the part of FLC and its agency and lab members,  given the relatively small size of FLC\u2019s annual budget and available staff.  Also, because the information FLC provides through its initiatives  depends on what is available from its agency and lab members, agency  officials said that FLC would need to collaborate with them to help  determine what additional or different information they could provide to  help meet customers\u2019 needs based on any feedback received. By working  collaboratively with agency and lab members to collect feedback on its  web-based initiatives\u2019 usefulness, FLC can take full advantage of its  members\u2019 collective knowledge and expertise to better communicate with  potential customers consistent with federal internal control standards and  leading practices to determine those customers\u2019 needs, enhancing the  clearinghouse initiatives in achieving their technology transfer goals.", "In addition, FLC has not established performance goals and measures  that would help it assess the extent to which the initiatives are meeting  FLC\u2019s goals of outreach and networking or how performance might be  improved.

FLC also stated that it is examining how it is organized and is  considering making changes to better leverage government and industry  best practices for the use of digital systems.", "In its written comments, FLC also stated that although it generally agrees  with the report\u2019s findings, there are some areas that it believes require  some additional clarification. First, FLC stated that the report implies that  FLC recently assumed a clearinghouse function when it has been  performing this function since its establishment and that it more recently  began to provide digital-based services. We agree that the recent change  in FLC\u2019s clearinghouse efforts has been to provide web-based tools, and  we acknowledged that FLC has offered one of its primary clearinghouse  initiatives\u2014the Technology Locator service\u2014since 1987. In response to  FLC\u2019s comment, we clarified portions of the report to indicate that FLC  has, over time, served as a clearinghouse, but has increased its efforts in  this regard in recent years. Second, FLC noted that it developed the  Available Technologies tool as an initial Phase I version, not as a final  product and that it plans to continue to develop it as additional structured  data from laboratories become available. We revised the report to  acknowledge that FLC plans to further develop this tool. Moreover, our  recommendation that FLC increase communication with potential  customers to obtain feedback on how the tool might be improved will help  ensure the effectiveness of FLC\u2019s efforts. Third, FLC stated that we  should include additional organizations in appendix I. We did not  incorporate FLC\u2019s comments in appendix I because the suggested  additions would have been beyond the scope of the appendix, which was  to provide information on other technology transfer organizations with  technology search tools that we examined during the course of our  review.", "DOD, DOE, NASA, and OSTP indicated by e-mail that they had no  technical or written comments.
