TRANSCOM  developed these preliminary cost estimates in part by requesting and  collecting information from the military services about their current costs  under DP3.

TRANSCOM\u2019s cost estimates associated with the number of  government personnel that (1) will counsel servicemembers and (2)  oversee contractor performance under the contract had weaknesses.  Specifically, these estimates relied on assumptions that may have  resulted in over- or underestimating some costs.", "First, TRANSCOM\u2019s preliminary DP3 cost estimates associated with  moving to the Global Household Goods Contract assume that DOD\u2019s  costs related to government personnel will be equivalent to those under  the current DP3. However, TRANSCOM officials acknowledge that this  assumption is based on discussions with military service officials that  occurred before the Global Household Goods Contract draft request for  proposals was issued in April 2019. Furthermore, military service officials  told us they have not decided how much of the counseling function their  service has provided will be moved to the planned contract, and the  services\u2019 approaches will likely differ. TRANSCOM officials pointed out  that while the Global Household Goods contractor will perform some level  of servicemember counseling, the contract will allow the individual military  services to decide how much of the counseling responsibility to retain.", "Second, TRANSCOM\u2019s cost estimates do not account for the number of  DOD contracting officer\u2019s representatives and quality assurance  evaluators required to oversee contractor performance under the  contract. According to TRANSCOM officials, the command\u2019s preliminary  cost estimates assume that government personnel who have been  relieved of servicemember counseling responsibility will perform contract  oversight and quality assurance responsibilities under the planned  contract. For example, TRANSCOM officials told us that quality  assurance inspectors under the current DP3 will transition to serve as  quality assurance evaluators once the contract is in place. However,  TRANSCOM officials acknowledge that it is possible that workload (and  personnel costs) for the military services under the current DP3 will  change under the planned contract. Moreover, if government personnel  do switch roles and responsibilities, TRANSCOM did not take into  account the cost to transition and train personnel to execute their  contracting officer\u2019s representative and quality assurance evaluator  responsibilities under the contract.", "TRANSCOM officials told us that they were unable to determine with any  precision the number and associated costs of government personnel  required to counsel servicemembers and oversee the contract because of  the fractured nature of the current DP3. Nonetheless, in September 2019,  TRANSCOM tasked LMI with developing a BCA with refined cost  estimates. LMI finalized the BCA and we received it on January 17,  2020. When we assessed the BCA, we found that like us LMI  determined that it did not have complete information to fully calculate the  cost of a DP3 that incorporates the Global Household Goods contract.  Specifically, LMI acknowledged some of the same limitations in its cost  estimates that we identified in TRANSCOM\u2019s preliminary cost estimates,  such as uncertainty about the number of government personnel required  to oversee the Global Household Goods Contract. For example, LMI  states in its BCA that the Global Household Goods Contract may reduce  DOD staffing requirements for functions such as counseling; however,  roles such as quality assurance evaluators and contracting officer\u2019s  representatives to oversee contractor performance may increase DOD  staffing requirements.", "When we raised concerns about these unanswered questions and their  potential cost implications with TRANSCOM officials, they told us that the  move to the Global Household Goods Contract is less about saving  money than it is about representing the best value to DOD when both  cost and program performance are considered. They also told us they  have developed a plan of action for the phase-in of the Global Household  Goods Contract, and that plan includes conducting a manpower study  during the third year of the contract. As described earlier in this report, the  initial 3 years of the contract involve a gradual phase-in of household  goods move volume for the contractor, and in the third year the contractor  will be responsible for all of DOD\u2019s household goods move volume.  According to these officials, by waiting until year 3 of the contract to  conduct a manpower study, DOD will have data to more precisely  determine the number (and cost) of government personnel required to  counsel servicemembers and oversee the contract, such as contracting  officer\u2019s representatives and quality assurance evaluators.", "However, we have determined that TRANSCOM does not have a process  in place to track data that would inform its manpower study in year 3,  such as how many personnel within each military service are needed to  perform contract oversight duties and the costs associated with these  personnel. We have reported that organizations should determine their  personnel requirements as part of a systematic requirements- determination process that includes (1) identifying an organization\u2019s  mission, functions, and tasks and (2) determining the minimum number  and type of personnel\u2014military, civilian, and contractor\u2014needed to fulfill  those missions, functions, and tasks by conducting a workforce  analysis. Without a way to track key data, DOD risks conducting a  manpower study that does not allow it to fully understand the personnel  and cost implications of its move to a DP3 that incorporates a Global  Household Goods Contract. Notably, in its BCA LMI recommended that  DOD reexamine the BCA when additional relevant information becomes  available, such as when DOD completes its manpower study.  TRANSCOM officials told us they are in agreement with this  recommendation.

Examples of performance indicators include:  settling 90 percent of all loss and damage claims valued at less than  $1,000 within 30 days and settling 95 percent of all claims, regardless  of value, within 60 days; delivery of household goods on the scheduled date 95 percent of the  time per month; and overall customer satisfaction rating of satisfactory at least 95 percent  per month.", "Based on a DP3 briefing TRANSCOM provided us, the command has  also developed metrics for assessing other contracted DP3 activities,  such as the transport of privately owned vehicles and non-temporary  storage, which TRANSCOM captures under contracts separate from the  Global Household Goods Contract.

Although TRANSCOM\u2019s draft quality assurance surveillance plan includes  a performance indicator to assess the contractor\u2019s performance with  respect to servicemember counseling, TRANSCOM officials told us the  command has not developed commensurate metrics to assess the  military services\u2019 performance in providing servicemember counseling.  TRANSCOM officials also noted that while the military services\u2019 claims  offices will be responsible for handling unresolved loss and damage  claims between the servicemember and the contractor, the command has  not developed metrics associated with this DP3 activity.", "Second, we found that, while TRANSCOM has articulated overarching  DP3 goals, it has not clearly articulated how its performance metrics align  with each of these goals.

Quality may improve with  on-time performance and minimized loss or damage.", "Capacity is the availability of industry providers to meet the program\u2019s  demands at a given time. This can be during peak or non-peak  season.", "Accountability refers to the government\u2019s ability to affix responsibility  to the contractor and their supplier network for performance.", "Responsibility encompasses the authority of the government and  how each government stakeholder will be held responsible for  accomplishing their assigned tasks.", "Planned contract performance indicators and metrics are intended to  assess contractor performance, but they may also provide information  that TRANSCOM could use to more broadly assess the extent to which  DP3 is meeting its overarching program goals. However, TRANSCOM  has not clearly articulated which of the performance metrics it has  established under the Global Household Goods contract align with which  program goals. For example, one performance indicator for the Global  Household Goods Contract is for contractor delivery of household goods  to be on-time at least 95 percent of the time. While it appears that this  performance indicator could relate to the quality and capacity goals,  TRANSCOM has not established linkage between this performance  indicator and either of these goals. Determining how it will assess  improved capacity is particularly important. When we spoke with them  about the move to the Global Household Goods contract, some military  service officials, representatives of the moving and storage industry, and  members of TRANSCOM\u2019s Personal Property Relocation Advisory Panel  told us that they doubt whether the Global Household Goods Contract  will, indeed, improve capacity.", "Moreover, none of the existing performance indicators appear to relate to  TRANSCOM\u2019s responsibility goal. It is not surprising that the Global  Household Goods Contract does not include performance indicators on  how government stakeholders are to be held responsible for various program activities, because indicators under the contract are intended to  evaluate contractor performance. However, we would expect to see  performance metrics outside of the contract to measure government  stakeholders\u2019 performance.", "When we spoke with TRANSCOM officials about the gaps we identified in  their performance assessment approach, they agreed that clarifying the  linkage between performance metrics and the overarching program goals  and ensuring there are performance metrics for assessing each of the  goals would improve the command\u2019s ability to assess overall program  performance. While the performance indicators and metrics related to the  various contracts, including the Global Household Goods Contract, are  intended to assess contractor performance, they could also provide  information that TRANSCOM could use to more broadly assess the  extent to which DP3 is meeting its overarching program goals. DOD  Instruction 4500.57, Transportation and Traffic Management, calls for  TRANSCOM, in coordination with DOD components, to conduct annual  program reviews to ensure the overall effectiveness of the DP3. The  instruction calls for these reviews to include a metrics-based evaluation of  the program, and assessments of TSP and service-provider cost and  performance, information technology systems and contracts that support  DP3, and external factors that impact the program such as industry  capability and changes to servicemember shipping entitlements.  Moreover, the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  call for management to define objectives (or metrics) in terms of what is to  be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time  frames for achievement so that performance toward achieving those  objectives (or metrics) can be assessed.

The need to take these steps is particularly important, given  some of the skepticism that TRANSCOM faces with its move to a DP3  that incorporates the Global Household Goods Contract.

We did not evaluate Department of Defense  (DOD) Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) activities that will not  be a part of the Global Household Goods Contract, which include the  long-term storage of household goods and the movement and storage of  servicemembers\u2019 privately owned vehicles. We did, however review  metrics being tracked for these activities to determine the U.S.  Transportation Command\u2019s (TRANSCOM) ability to assess performance  for the broader DP3.", "During our review, we coordinated with officials from the DOD Office of  the Inspector General to gain an appreciation for the objectives, scope,  and methodology of their ongoing audit on the timeliness of household  goods deliveries and claims resolution under the current DP3. The  resulting audit report contained several recommendations, including that  TRANSCOM issue warnings or letters of suspension to transportation  service providers (TSPs) within 14 days of missing the agreed-upon  delivery date from storage, and that TRANSCOM help servicemembers  and their families file inconvenience claims with TSPs within 14 days of a  missed delivery date.", "To inform both of our objectives, we met with officials from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense (OSD), TRANSCOM, the military services, the  Coast Guard, and the DOD Office of the Inspector General. We also met  with external stakeholders, including associations representing the  moving and storage industry, the Small Business Administration, the  American Federation of Government Employees, and members of  TRANSCOM\u2019s Personal Property Relocation Advisory Panel.", "For objective one, we assessed preliminary cost estimates TRANSCOM  developed in connection with the move to a DP3 approach that  incorporates the planned Global Household Goods Contract against best  practices in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The guide  states that valid and useful historical data are important in developing  sound cost estimates, and that risk and uncertainty and sensitivity  analyses should be performed to mitigate the effects of changing  assumptions.", "We analyzed TRANSCOM\u2019s preliminary cost estimates, and discussed  with TRANSCOM officials assumptions that were used to develop the  estimates and techniques that were applied to account for variability in  the assumptions. Given that TRANSCOM\u2019s cost estimates were  preliminary and likely to change based on the Logistics Management  Institute\u2019s (LMI) ongoing business case analysis (BCA), we did not  conduct a reliability assessment of TRANSCOM\u2019s cost estimates. We  instead focused on TRANSCOM\u2019s treatment of evolving assumptions in  its preliminary cost estimates. We met with representatives from LMI to  discuss their process for updating TRANSCOM\u2019s preliminary cost  estimates as part of a BCA that it was preparing for the command. We  evaluated these cost estimates, including the cost estimates in the BCA  that was issued in January 2020, using criteria from GAO\u2019s Assessment  Methodology for Economic Analysis that outlines five key elements for an  economic analysis. Our assessment of LMI\u2019s BCA is included in   appendix II.", "For objective two, we reviewed relevant DOD guidance, including DOD  Instruction 4500.57, Transportation and Traffic Management. The  instruction requires TRANSCOM, in coordination with the DOD  components, to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the DP3. We also  reviewed the Global Household Goods request for proposals and  TRANSCOM\u2019s draft quality assurance surveillance plan. The draft quality  assurance surveillance plan outlines how DOD will oversee the move  manager\u2019s performance under the Global Household Goods Contract and  describes the performance indicators that will be used to assess contractor performance. Using the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, which calls for management to define objectives (or  metrics) in terms of what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will  be achieved, and the time frames for achievement so that performance  toward achieving those objectives can be assessed, we also assessed  DOD\u2019s DP3 performance metrics. Additionally, we discussed with  TRANSCOM officials their approach for overseeing the Global Household  Goods Contract, including the linkage between performance measures for  those DP3 activities that will and will not be a part of the contract and  DP3\u2019s overarching goals.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO\u2019s Assessment of the Logistics Management Institute\u2019s (LMI) Business Case Analysis (BCA)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: GAO\u2019s Assessment of the  Logistics Management Institute\u2019s (LMI)  Business Case Analysis (BCA)", "We assessed the cost and benefit information in LMI\u2019s BCA against our  Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis. Our assessment  methodology identifies the following five key components of an economic  analysis:  We found that the BCA informs decision-makers and stakeholders, with  caveats, about the economic effects of the proposed Global Household  Goods Contract. Further, we found that the BCA fully met four and  partially met one of the five key components of an economic analysis.
