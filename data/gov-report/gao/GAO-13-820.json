For example, narrowly limiting the activities for which fees may be used heightens congressional control over the funds; however, doing so can also reduce an agency's flexibility to reallocate resources as needs change and may increase administrative costs. Design decisions also have program management implications. For example, the frequency of fee reviews and adjustments affects the alignment between collections and costs. Failing to review fees regularly has sometimes resulted in large increases when fees are eventually updated, creating costly challenges. Understanding the implications of fee design is important to avoid such unintended consequences.", "Identifying and understanding unobligated balances--the portion of obligational authority that has not yet been obligated--in fee-based accounts is challenging. There is no single list of all federal user fees, and in general, budget accounts are not labeled in a way that indicates whether an account contains fee collections. This makes it challenging to identify whether (or which) unobligated balances in an account are fee-related. Further, some fee designs include dedicated reserves that appear as unobligated balances. Despite these challenges, funding a program or agency through fees does not eliminate the need for careful monitoring and managing of unobligated balances.", "Considering key questions about costs and collections can enable Congress and agencies to identify and manage potential fluctuations in fee collections-known as revenue instability-as well as potential consequences. Importantly, decision makers need to understand potential vulnerabilities in the context of a fee's design. Examples of such questions include: what is the risk that fee revenue instability will affect a program? What analysis is needed to understand factors such as cost drivers and elements that influence collections? Are there data limitations that could add uncertainty to collection estimates? Can the agency quickly respond to changing costs? What factors affect the timing and pattern of collections and spending? If revenue instability is a function of a fee's design, the most sustainable solutions are often found by realigning costs and collections. In other cases, maintaining a reserve can help address sudden or temporary fluctuations in collections and/or costs and can minimize the effect of revenue instability on operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report.

Agencies derive their authority to charge fees either from the  Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or from a specific  statutory authority.  Overall, fees established under the IOAA must be (1)  fair and (2) based on costs to the government, on the value of the service  or thing to the recipient, on public policy, or on interest serviced. Agencies  that established fees under the IOAA, however, are only authorized to  charge the fee; a separate authority is required to use the fee collections.  However, Congress has frequently provided agencies with the authority  via authorizing or appropriations legislation both to collect fees and to use  the collections. In these specific fee authorities, Congress determines the  degree of flexibility to make fee design and implementation decisions that  will be retained or delegated to the agency.", "Regardless how the imposition of fee collections is authorized,  Congressional action is required for agencies to use those collections.

IOAA requires that agency regulations  establishing a user fee are subject to policies prescribed by the President. OMB provides  such guidance to executive branch agencies under this authority through OMB Circular  No. A-25.", "Depending on the type of legislation providing the authority to collect or spend the fees,  these funds are either mandatory or discretionary.

The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of  2011 provides USPTO the authority to set all fee amounts through the regulatory  process. USPTO is authorized to spend the fee amounts collected each year, up to the  amount appropriated by Congress.

At each  decision point, Congress can delegate some flexibility to agencies, or it  can retain that control. In the aggregate, these decisions enable  Congress to design a fee that strikes its desired balance between agency  flexibility and Congressional control. It is important to note that regardless  of how Congress designs a fee, it always retains oversight over the fee  and over the goods and services the fee supports. Figure 1 identifies six  key fee design decisions for Congress that have a direct bearing on how  much control Congress will retain and how much flexibility will be  delegated to an agency. For each design question, we have identified at  least two options, one granting the agency more flexibility and the other  retaining more control for Congress. In some cases, Congress selects an  option that falls in between the two options shown in figure 1. For  example, Congress can grant an agency the authority to set some of its  fee rates by regulation while setting other fees, or requirements for any of  the rates such as provisions for exemptions, waivers, and caps, in statute.", "Congress\u2019s fee design decisions have implications for fee program  management beyond striking the desired balance between agency  flexibility and Congressional control. Below, we discuss in more detail the  key fee design options introduced in figure 1\u2014setting, using, and  reviewing\u2014and the implications that flow from decisions about each  design option. Understanding these implications, especially in the context  of Congress\u2019s own priorities and goals, can help to avoid unintended  consequences in fee design.", "Figure 2 shows the key design options related to how fee rates are set.", "The frequency of fee review and adjustment, and the ability to keep fees  and costs aligned, have a number of potential implications for agencies.  The CFO Act requires federal agencies to review user fees biennially  and OMB\u2019s Circular A-25 directs agencies to set fees to recover all direct  and indirect costs to the federal government of a good or service.  We  have previously reported that the failure to review fees regularly can  result in large fee increases when the fees are eventually updated, which  creates costly challenges. For example, the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Service (USCIS) is authorized to charge fees for the  adjudication of immigration and naturalization applications. Although  USCIS has the authority to adjust its fees through the regulatory process,  in 2007 it conducted its first comprehensive fee review in nine years. As  a result, USCIS had to increase fees by an average of 86 percent to align  them with its costs.    During the month before the fee increase took  effect, the number of applications received increased an unprecedented  100 percent over the prior month, far outpacing the agency\u2019s processing  capacity. This contributed to a backlog of 1.47 million applications and  unplanned costs to secure additional facilities to store these applications.  In 2012, we found that prior to the passage of the AIA, fees generating  over 80 percent of the USPTO\u2019s revenues were set in statute. This  limited the USPTO\u2019s ability to adjust fee rates as costs changed. Other  than periodic increases to reflect inflation, these statutorily-set fees had  not been reviewed or adjusted for the 7 years before 2012.", "In contrast, there are other examples of intentional deviation from cost-fee  alignment. In some cases, a less precise alignment between costs and  each fee is chosen in order to achieve a policy or administrative goal. A  fully fee-funded agency covers program costs in the aggregate, but not  necessarily on a fee-by-fee basis. For example, within the suite of  USCIS\u2019s immigration and naturalization fees, Congress directed that fees  providing adjudication and naturalization services be set to ensure  recovery of full costs of providing such services. This includes the costs of  similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other  immigrants. As a result, the costs of processing applicants granted the  fee waivers are distributed to other fee payers as a flat-rate surcharge.  However, unintentional misalignment between fees and costs can  increase the demand for more expensive services, because fee payers  do not bear the agency\u2019s total cost of the service. This can result in some  fee payers subsidizing others with no public policy purpose.", "We have found over the years that fees set through the regulatory  process may be updated more frequently than fees set in statute:  therefore, they may more consistently align collections with costs. However, we have also previously reported that, in the past, stakeholders  expressed concern about the agency incentive to inflate costs or the lack  of incentive to restrain costs. This risk may be reduced, and tools for  Congressional and stakeholder oversight may be enhanced, if the agency  clearly reports its methods for setting the fee, including an accounting of  program costs and the assumptions it uses to project future program  costs and fee collections. Further, federal agencies must also follow  guidelines regarding their cost accounting information, providing some  safeguards against artificial inflation of program costs.", "Figure 3 shows the key design options related to an agency\u2019s access to  and use of its fee collections.", "For examples, see GAO-08-386SP and GAO-12-514R.", "GAO-12-514R. technology systems to modernize the USPTO. In 2012, we reported a  backlog of over 640,000 patent applications.", "Limiting the availability of fee collections may also have future budgetary  implications for Congress. For example, as mentioned above, USPTO  collections in excess of appropriations are deposited into the Patent and  Trademark Fee Reserve Fund and are not available to the agency without  additional Congressional action. If these amounts are made available in  future years rather than in the year the fees were collected, the action will  count or \u201cscore\u201d as new budget authority against discretionary spending  limits in place in a given future fiscal year, and will not offset against  budget authority made available that year. The effect of this scoring may  make the fee-funded activities appear more costly and can make granting  access to previously collected amounts a less desirable option for  Congressional fee designers. The outcome can lead to the buildup of  unavailable and unobligated balances.", "Figure 4 shows the design decisions related to the kinds of specific  reporting or review requirements Congress may wish to impose, beyond  the standard biennial review requirement in the CFO Act.", "When designing a fee, Congress must balance granting more autonomy  to an agency (by requiring no additional reporting and review beyond that  required in the CFO Act) with stronger control for itself (via additional  reporting and oversight requirements over and above the CFO Act  requirements). When a fee\u2019s authorizing statute does not specify review  and reporting requirements or if a fee derives its statutory authority from  the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952, the CFO Act  requires and OMB Circular No. A-25 directs agencies to review their fees  biennially and to recommend fee adjustments as appropriate. In addition,  OMB Circular No. A-25 directs agencies to include non-fee-funded  programs in these reviews to determine whether fees should be initiated  for government services or goods for which fees are not currently  charged. Further, if imposing such fees is prohibited or restricted by law,  agencies are to recommend legislative changes as appropriate.  Moreover, OMB Circular No. A-25 directs agencies to discuss the results  of these reviews and any resulting proposals, such as adjustments to fee  rates, in annual reports, such as performance and accountability reports.  However, our 2011 survey of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act  and OMB Circular No. A-25 suggested that agencies are reviewing more  fees than they are discussing in their annual reports. While these  reviews may provide information for agency management and decision  making, the extent to which this information is being shared with  Congressional decision makers or other stakeholders appears far more  limited. In 2012, we concluded that OMB should do more to ensure that  agencies comply with requirements and recommended that OMB use its  budget reviews to ensure agencies are adhering to this guidance. As of  March 2013, OMB had not taken action on this recommendation.", "Additional reporting requirements can further increase information  available to Congress about fee programs. We previously concluded that  whether fee rates are set by the agency in regulation or by Congress in  statute, agencies must substantively review and report on all cost-based  fees regularly to ensure decision makers have complete information  about program costs and activities. A variety of reporting requirements can be included in appropriations, authorizing legislation, or committee  reports. For example, AIA requires USPTO to report on the  implementation of the AIA, which includes fee-setting authority. In  addition, USPTO\u2019s 2012 appropriations required a spending plan to  access funds in the Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund. Similarly,  the Mint is required to report to Congress biennially on the status of coin  production costs, and annually on the operation of the Mint\u2019s Numismatic  Public Enterprise Fund, as well as provide quarterly financial reports on  the Funds.", "Reporting requirements sometimes contain requirements to include  stakeholders during the course of reviews. For example, in accordance  with the AIA, USPTO is required to work with the relevant public advisory  committee to hold public hearings on fee-setting, to consider and analyze  any comments, advice or recommendations from the advisory committee,  and to publish proposed and final rules in the Federal Register, including  the purpose, rationale, and possible benefits resulting from the change.  Our previous work has found that including stakeholders in the fee review  process can increase success for substantive, two-way communication  and understanding/buy-in on the fee setting process, and that effectively  communicating with stakeholders involves sharing relevant analysis and  information as well as providing opportunities for stakeholder input."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Manage Unobligated Balances Differently Depending on Whether They Represent Operating Reserves or Reflect the Timing of Collections and Outlays", "paragraphs": ["Identifying and understanding unobligated balances in fee-based  accounts is challenging.

As recognized in the Statement of Federal Financial  Accounting Standards 4: Managerial Cost Accounting Standards and  Concepts, agency cost information should be sufficient to be used by  Congress and federal executives in making program and resources  decisions, as well as for setting fees, but the analysis does not  necessarily need to be complex, costly, or require special resources.  Agencies should seek to leverage data and analysis that already exists.  For example, agencies may use proxies, or leading or lagging indicators  to forecast key changes, rather than undertake complex, original analysis  to do the same. USCIS is almost entirely funded from immigration and  naturalization application fees and uses data from DHS\u2019s Office of  Immigration Statistics, among other sources, to project the volume of  incoming applications.", "Are there limitations to the available data (such as preliminary  estimates) that could add uncertainty to collection estimates?", "Indicators that are drawn from early estimates may add vulnerabilities to  demand or collection forecasts. For example, each quarter, Universal  Service Administrative Company projects the next quarter\u2019s anticipated  USF demand and assessable industry revenues. The FCC uses this  information to determine the applicable contribution factor (percentage of  assessable revenues) for the following quarter. FCC officials have found  that their use of projected data in setting the USF contribution factor has  led to collections that are more or less than initially expected.", "How frequently should this analysis be conducted?", "Once the necessary analysis has been identified, agencies should  consider how frequently to perform the analysis. Although agencies are  required to conduct biennial fee reviews per the CFO Act, revenue  instability may occur over a shorter time horizon and may demand more  frequent examinations. In particular, agencies should balance  informational and reporting needs with the cost of performing the  analysis.

Asking the following  questions could help decision makers plan for contingencies.", "How frequently are fees collected?", "User fees are not always received at regular or predictable intervals  throughout the year. The frequency of collections is sometimes related to  how and by whom fees are collected and paid to the Treasury. For  example, airlines collect international air passenger inspection fees at the  time a ticket is sold, but remit fees to the government quarterly on behalf  of the passengers. Collections that come in small increments on a rolling  basis or late in the fiscal year may inhibit an agency\u2019s ability to identify  patterns and fluctuations in collections in the aggregate, or may create  cash flow challenges. For example, USCIS receives application fees  throughout the fiscal year but enters into year-long contracts at the start  of the fiscal year. Because of the kind of legal authority USCIS has to  obligate funds, USCIS must have collections equal to the full contract  value available for obligation at the start of the year. (See also: What is  the timing and pattern of spending?)", "What remittance compliance issues may exist, and what are the  tools for ensuring compliance?", "Agencies may not collect amounts they are owed because of external  factors affecting payers or because of vulnerabilities in the remittance  process. For example, the FCC adjusts contribution rates and payments  due from telecommunication service providers quarterly; however, abrupt  changes in a company\u2019s finances (such as bankruptcy) can affect the  actual remittance amounts. On the other hand, CBP has lost an unknown  amount of revenue because it does not verify that it collects applicable  user fees for every commercial truck, private aircraft, and private vessel  for which the fees are due.", "In the event payers do not remit fees in a timely manner, the agency may  need tools such as penalties to ensure remittance compliance. For  example, CBP can levy interest charges or deny landing rights to airlines  for non- or late remittance of the international air passenger inspection  fees.fees or USF contributions in \u201cRed Light\u201d status, which results in  withholding Commission action in any licensing or similar proceeding until  the payment or other satisfactory arrangements are made.", "What external known or unknown events could affect fee  collections?", "Understanding external influences \u2013 for example, weather, world events,  or changes in technology\u2014 allows for the proper planning of resources or  the use of limited funding in the face of changing revenue. For example,  according to USPTO officials, economic activity, like a recession, is an  important consideration when developing workload forecasts, primarily  patent and trademark application filings. In addition to economic factors,  officials stated that USPTO considers overseas activity, policies and  legislation, process efficiencies, and anticipated applicant behavior when  preparing estimates. Estimates of incoming workload are developed after  researching and modeling these elements, which helps USPTO plan.  There may be indirect influences as well. For example, a fee on imports  may be tied to the exchange rate. When currency exchange rates are  favorable, the demand for cheaper items from foreign countries may  increase. In this example the fee revenue would go up, or conversely, it  would go down with a weaker exchange rate. Programs should regularly  conduct environmental scans to identify new influences, or significant  changes to existing influences.", "Program management decisions can also influence the level of demand  for a fee-funded activity, for example, when services are delivered  through a third party. In 2010, we found that FCC had allowed certain  prepaid wireless providers to be eligible telecommunications carriers in  order to expand the availability of its Lifeline program. Both participation  in the program and payments to providers increased, but the program\u2019s  internal controls were not addressing the risks of the telecommunication  providers\u2019 inconsistent adherence to applicant eligibility requirements.", "In programs where fees for some activities subsidize the costs for other  activities, payers\u2019 overuse of the subsidized activity may affect the  agency\u2019s ability to cover costs. For example, according to USPTO  officials, USPTO has intentionally designed fees to encourage innovation  by reducing up-front fees for patent applicants and imposing higher  maintenance fees later in the process, after users have already obtained  a patent. Moreover, higher than aggregate costs must be charged of  applicants and owners that do not qualify for reduced fees as a small or  micro entity applicant. However, if applicants pay only the lower  application filing fee and then decide against maintaining the patent, the  higher maintenance fees are lost to USPTO. Because USPTO incurs the  same cost to process an application whether the patent is maintained or  not, and because costs are fully recovered in the aggregate over time and  not at each step in the patent process, USPTO\u2019s patent examination  costs do not match collections if maintenance fees are not collected.", "How quickly is a change in collection amounts likely to occur?", "External events or changes to internal policies can affect collections, in  either the short or long term. For example, USPTO officials said rates of  collections can change rapidly in response to economic events. During  the 2009 recession, fewer patent applications were filed and maintained  than were anticipated in the 2009 fiscal year, which reduced fee  collections. Policy changes can affect collections as well, as when USCIS  experienced a 100 percent increase in immigration and naturalization  applications before USCIS increased its fees by an average of 86 percent  in July 2007.

For  example, according to USPTO officials, when USPTO began redesigning  its fees under AIA in 2011, it used an activity-based cost accounting  system to understand all agency costs as they relate to the activities  performed supporting the fees collected. USPTO\u2019s Activity Based  Information helps officials identify and analyze current activity costs on an  ongoing basis, which helps with planning decisions as well as justifying  budget requests.", "What is the timing and pattern of spending?", "Program management needs to understand the timing of program  obligations in relation to the timing of collections during the fiscal year.

Other obligations may occur in a less  predictable pattern.", "Large upfront costs (such as IT investments or capital asset purchases)  should be identified in time to capture those costs when setting fee rates,  especially if the costs are ongoing (see also: Develop and Maintain a  Reserve Fund). Fee-funded programs may require specific efforts to  ensure that necessary infrastructure improvements are not neglected in  cost accounting methods. For example, in 2007, USCIS stated in its fee  review its intention to use all premium-processing fee collections toward  investments in information technology and business-system  transformation, two planned infrastructure improvements.", "Can the agency quickly respond to changing costs?", "Fee-funded programs may have flexibility to adjust program activities in  response to rising costs, but certain types of costs create vulnerabilities if  not considered in advance. For example, if fee-funded activities are  inherently governmental in nature, and therefore required to be performed  by federal employees, a reduction in fee revenue may be more  challenging, because it takes longer to increase or decrease the number  of federal employees than it would to adjust the number of contractors.", "Data analysis can help program managers understand how quickly  changes in costs could affect program activities. For example, USF  sometimes experiences short-term changes in demand, stemming from  program changes (such as the creation of pilot programs), revised  eligibility rules, or program growth due to outreach efforts. The FCC and  USAC regularly monitor potential changes in the level of USF  commitments, and calculate the telecommunication companies\u2019  contribution levels on a quarterly basis. This allows USF collections to be  more responsive to mid-year changes in obligations.", "What is the relationship between costs and revenue?", "Without data analysis, it is difficult to fully understand the relationship  between costs and revenue. If costs increase and there is no  corresponding increase in collections, programs will likely experience a  cost-collections gap that needs to be addressed. However, increasing  costs are sometimes due to improvements in service delivery (which can  be more expensive), and over the course of time may lead to increased  revenue. For example, a USPTO official said that spending more on  overtime can increase production, which in this case is increasing the  number of patent applications being examined. Since fees are required  for many responses during examination, the increase in overtime costs  generates more fee revenue as a result of the increase in applications  examined and the replies necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decision Makers Can Manage Revenue Instability By More Closely Aligning Fees and Costs and Using Reserve Funds", "paragraphs": ["To manage revenue instability actively and ensure continuity of goods or  services, fee-funded agencies can better align fees with costs and create  reserve funds. First, ensuring that program costs and fee rates remain  aligned will minimize the chance of a cost-collections gap over the long- term. If revenue instability is a function of a fee\u2019s design, the most  sustainable solutions will be found by realigning costs and collections. Not  all fee revenue instability can be completely addressed in this way,  however, and some agencies may need to take additional action.  Maintaining a reserve can help address sudden or temporary fluctuations  in collections and/or costs, and can minimize the effect of revenue  instability on operations. Reserve funds can both help manage revenue  instability, and where appropriate, serve as a mechanism for  accumulating revenue for identified future capital investments.", "To determine whether closer cost-collection alignment could sufficiently  and timely address revenue instability, agencies should consider the  following questions.", "How quickly can the program adjust fee rates in response to  changes in collections or costs?", "Adjusting fees through either statutory or rulemaking processes can be a  lengthy process, so it is important to plan ahead. Regular fee reviews  ensure that Congress, stakeholders, and agencies have complete  information about changing costs and whether a fee needs to be  changed.", "Are fees set at a rate that enables the program to respond to  spikes or surges?", "Fee reviews can help agencies determine if they are prepared for spikes  or surges in demand, which may occur more or less frequently,  depending on the good or service. Over-staffing or excess capital creates  waste and establishes a higher-than-needed unit cost for the service;  however 100 percent efficiency provides for no flexibility to address surge  capacity.", "Does the program have other sources of funding that may mitigate  initial revenue shortfalls, or is the program fully fee-reliant?", "Fully fee-funded programs typically experience some lag time before  initial collections are realized. To cover costs before collections are  realized, the program may require another source of initial funding.  Congress has sometimes provided this initial funding through an  appropriation that may or may not be reimbursed over time. If an  appropriation is to be reimbursed, reimbursement is generally done  through incoming fee collections.", "When the risks of revenue instability are greater than the agency can  manage by aligning costs and fees, having a reserve can enable the  agency to continue providing goods and services despite fluctuations in  collections, and to act quickly in response to changing conditions.  Reserve funds can also be a tool for fee-funded programs in planning for  capital investments. Agencies should consider the following questions in  developing a reserve fund.", "What legal authority does the program or agency have to develop  and fund a reserve?", "Before an agency commits to building a reserve, agencies must  understand their statutory structures. Agencies with no-year funds\u2014that  is, collections that remain available for obligation until expended \u2013  allowing the agency to carry over balances indefinitely.  This gives the  agency  the flexibility to build or maintain an internal reserve fund within  their existing fee accounts. Also, agencies with multiyear collections, or  collections available for obligation for a fixed period of time beyond one  fiscal year, may also be able to maintain a reserve fund. Absent those  authorities, agencies would require additional authority from Congress to  develop and maintain a reserve. If not specified in statute, agencies  should verify their legal authority to keep funds in reserve.", "Further, individual authorizing statutes may require or restrict a fee  reserve. For example, the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of  1985 (COBRA) requires CBP to maintain a $30 million reserve in the  existing COBRA fee account, and the United States Department of  Agriculture\u2019s AQI program is authorized to develop and maintain a fee  reserve in the existing fee account.", "Does the agency need to notify Congress or seek permission,  beyond its existing authority, to use its reserve fund?", "Money in the reserve may only be accessible up to a set amount or within  a specified time frame. Decision makers can also limit use of the reserve  in other ways, such as money in the reserve may only be available for specified purposes or  in response to a trigger, like a natural disaster; agencies may only have access to reserves in specific amounts, such  as a percentage at a time in order to avoid total depletion of funds, or agencies may be required to report on their level of use and their plan  for ending their use of the reserve.", "Alternative budget account structures like a reimbursable account or  revolving fund could help mitigate budgeting or timing challenges without  compromising accountability for federal funds. Program managers may  also consider what mechanisms exist within the agency to track reserve  balances.", "What is the goal of the reserve?", "Regardless of the authority under which a reserve is created, setting clear  goals for the reserve and clarifying how the reserve will be implemented  helps ensure accountability and transparency both to Congress and users  of fee-based programs. For example, some agencies may wish to use a  reserve to help ensure the long\u2010term financial stability of the agency or to  position the agency to respond to varying economic conditions. Others  may seek a reserve to smooth expected fluctuations in costs or  collections, or to build capital for necessary infrastructure improvements.", "Still other programs may seek a reserve as a means to mitigate  unforeseen and unavoidable revenue shortfalls.", "Historical data can demonstrate to Congress, to stakeholders, and to fee  payers why a reserve is needed. For example, based on USPTO\u2019s  experience with a rapid decline in collections during the recession in  2009, and to address other sources of revenue instability, officials told us  they are building an operating reserve to avoid a slowdown in operations  should collections suddenly decline. According to officials, the agency  used risk assessments of spending levels and revenue streams to explain  to stakeholders why fees were being increased to build an operating  reserve.
