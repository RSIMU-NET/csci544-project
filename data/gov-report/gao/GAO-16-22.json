The AAV has a water speed  of approximately six knots, and is usually deployed from within sight of  the shore, a factor that poses survivability risks in certain threat  environments. According to USMC officials, the AAV has become  increasingly difficult to maintain and sustain. As weapons technology and  the nature of threats have evolved over the past four decades, the AAV is  viewed as having limitations in water speed, land mobility, lethality,  protection, and network capability. According to DOD, the need to  modernize USMC\u2019s ability to move personnel and equipment from ship to  shore is essential. In the last 15 years, USMC has undertaken a number  of efforts to do this.", "EFV: USMC began development of the EFV in 2000. The EFV was to  travel at higher water speeds\u2014around 20 knots\u2014which would have  allowed transporting ships to launch the EFV further from shore than the  AAVs it was to replace. However, following a 2007 breach of a statutory  cost threshold, that program was restructured and subsequently, in 2011,  canceled by DOD due to affordability concerns.", "ACV: In 2011, the USMC completed initial acquisition documentation  providing the performance requirements for a new replacement  amphibious vehicle called the ACV. The ACV was expected to be self- deploying with a water speed of 8 to 12 knots which would permit  deployment beyond the visual range of the shore, but would not achieve  high water speed. It was also expected to provide for sustained  operations on shore with improved troop protection. However, USMC  leadership then requested an affordability analysis be completed that  would explore the technical feasibility of integrating high water speed into  ACV development. According to DOD officials, the analysis indicated that  achieving high water speed was technically possible but required  unacceptable tradeoffs as the program attempted to balance vehicle  weight, capabilities, and cost. Meanwhile, the USMC retained a  requirement to provide protected land mobility in response to the threat of  improvised explosive devices\u2014a requirement the AAV could not meet  due to its underbody design. In 2014 we reported that, according to  program officials, the program office was in the process of revising its  ACV acquisition approach based on this affordability analysis.", "ACV 1.1, 1.2 and 2.0: In 2014, the USMC revised its ACV acquisition  approach, adopting a plan to develop the ACV in three increments:", "The first increment of ACV development\u2014ACV 1.1\u2014is planned to be  a wheeled vehicle that would provide improved protected land mobility  and limited amphibious capability. The ACV 1.1 is expected to be part  of an amphibious assault through the use of surface connector craft to  travel from ship to shore. Surface connectors are vessels that enable  the transportation of military assets, including personnel, material, and  equipment, from a sea base or ship to the shore. ACV 1.1, a  successor to the previously suspended Marine Personnel Carrier  program, is using prototypes, demonstration testing, and other study  results from that program. DOD officials estimated that, in comparing  the past Marine Personnel Carrier program and the ACV 1.1 as  currently envisioned, the two are about 98 percent the same.

These technology exploration efforts are seeking  design options that may enable high water speed capability without  accruing unacceptable trade-offs in other capabilities, cost or  schedule. According to officials, ACV 2.0 is a conceptual placeholder  for a future decision point when the Marine Corps plans to determine  how to replace the AAV fleet, which is expected to occur in the mid- 2020s.

The ACV program plans to utilize mature  technology in ACV 1.1 development. According to acquisition best  practices, demonstrating a high level of maturity before allowing new  technologies into product development programs puts programs in a  better position to succeed. To support a decision to begin development,  a technology readiness assessment (TRA) was performed to assess the  maturity of critical technologies to be integrated into the program. DOD  defines critical technology elements as new or novel technology that a  platform or system depends on to achieve successful development or  production or to successfully meet a system operational threshold  requirement. In a TRA, identified critical technologies are assessed  against a technological readiness level (TRL) scale of 1 to 9. Specifically,  a rating of TRL 1 demonstrates \u201cbasic principles observed and reported,\u201d  and TRL 9 demonstrates \u201cactual system proven through successful  mission operations.\u201d Overall, the completed ACV 1.1 TRA assessed the  program at TRL 7, indicating demonstration in an operational  environment.

While the program has identified additional risk mitigation  strategies\u2014including planned component testing during development and  development of preventative maintenance procedures\u2014this technology  could entail a somewhat higher level of risk than the TRL level suggests  and may require additional attention as development begins.", "Competition. According to our prior work, competition is a critical tool for  achieving the best return on the government\u2019s investment. The ACV  acquisition approach has fostered competition in the acquisition process,  both through competitive prototyping that took place prior to the start of  development and with competition that continues through development  until production. Specifically, before the Marine Personnel Carrier  program was suspended, the government awarded a contract to test  critical sub-systems including the engine, transmission, suspension and  hydraulic hardware systems. The government also awarded four  contracts for system-level prototypes demonstrating the swim capability,  personnel carry capability, and survivability of each company\u2019s vehicle.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics\u2014the ACV Milestone Decision Authority\u2014has certified to the  congressional defense committees that the ACV program had met the  competitive prototyping requirement based on the work done under the  Marine Personnel Carrier program. In addition, after development begins,  the program plans to award ACV 1.1 development contracts to two  vendors, maintaining competition until they select one vendor at the start  of production.", "Contract strategy. When development begins, the ACV program plans  to award hybrid contracts to each of the to-be-selected developers.  According to program plans, each contract is to utilize three different  pricing structures for different activities: fixed-price-incentive for ACV 1.1  vehicle development, firm-fixed-price for the delivery incentive to deliver  test vehicles early, and cost-plus-fixed-fee for test support and  advanced capability improvements and studies. According to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, it is usually to the Government\u2019s advantage for the  contractor to assume substantial cost responsibility and an appropriate  share of the cost risk; therefore, fixed-price incentive contracts are  preferred when contract costs and performance requirements are  reasonably certain. Manufacturing the development vehicles is the  largest anticipated portion of ACV development contract costs. According  to the ACV 1.1 acquisition strategy, a fixed-price-incentive contract is  considered the most appropriate contract type to utilize for the vehicle\u2019s  development because the vehicles themselves are non-developmental in  nature but there is some risk related to the integration of selected  systems, such as the Remote Weapon Station, and other modifications  required to meet USMC requirements. Meanwhile, the strategy states that  the delivery incentive is to be a firm-fixed-price, as the fee is a set dollar  amount based on how early the vehicles are delivered and is not subject  to adjustment based on the vendor\u2019s costs.", "Under cost-reimbursement contract types, such as a cost-plus-fixed-fee  contract, the government bears the risk of increases in the cost of  performance. Cost-reimbursement contract types are suitable when  uncertainties in requirements or contract performance do not permit the  use of fixed-price contract types. A cost-plus-fixed-fee structure is  planned for test support before and after the start of production, vehicle  transportation and other test-related activities. According to program  officials, the scope and nature of these activities are difficult to predict,  making the cost-plus-fixed-fee structure appropriate. Officials also stated  that the cost-plus-fixed-fee activities are expected to comprise about 11  percent of the total contract value.", "Requirements and cost estimates. Additional key documents have  been prepared, or are underway, in accordance with DOD policy. The  ACV 1.1 Capabilities Development Document, providing the set of  requirements for development, is tailored specifically for ACV 1.1. In  accordance with DOD policy, the ACV 1.1 Capabilities Development  Document was validated prior to the release of the ACV 1.1 request for  proposal in March 2015. In addition, best practices and DOD policy also  call for the development of an independent cost estimate prior to the start  of development.

An AOA is a key first step  in the acquisition process intended to assess alternative solutions for  addressing a validated need. AOAs are done or updated to support key  acquisition decision points. The USMC completed an AOA update for  ACV 1.1 in late 2014 to support the release of the ACV 1.1 request for  proposal. Over the years, other AOAs have been completed for related  acquisitions, including the EFV, the Marine Personnel Carrier and the  previous version of the ACV considered in 2012.

Further, four of the remaining best  practices were substantially met, two were partially met, and one was  minimally met. For example, best practices call for the documentation of  all assumptions and constraints used in the analysis. We found that the  2014 AOA does not include a full list of assumptions and constraints and  any assumptions or constraints from previous analysis, if relevant, were  not updated or referenced in the new analysis. As a result, it could be  difficult for decision makers to make comparisons and trade-offs between  alternatives.

In addition, according to program  officials, as a result of the aggressive acquisition schedule, the program  plans on a higher level of concurrency between development testing and  production than would take place under a more typical acquisition  schedule. This aggressive schedule may likely have congressional  decision makers approve funds to begin production based on little to no  evidence from the testing of delivered ACV 1.1 prototypes. Some factors  may mitigate the risk posed by this acceleration, for example, program  officials have stated that all required testing will take place prior to the  start of production. However, further attention may be warranted in our  future reviews of the program\u2019s schedule.", "The ACV 1.1 program is planning to hold its PDR about 90 days after  development begins and to combine its PDR and the critical design  review (CDR) into one event. Best practices recommend that the PDR is  held before development begins in order to increase the knowledge  available to the agency when development starts, for example, increasing  confidence that the design will meet the requirements established in the  Capabilities Development Document. The absence of a PDR introduces  some risk by postponing the attainment of knowledge until after  development begins and reducing scheduled time to address any design  issues that may arise. In addition, it is a best practice to demonstrate  design stability at the system-level CDR, completing at least 90 percent of  engineering drawings at that time. Combining the PDR and CDR may  limit the time available to the program to address any issues identified  and ensure that sufficient knowledge is attained prior to the program  moving forward. For example, in a 2006 report, we found that the EFV  program\u2019s CDR was held almost immediately after the start of  development\u2014similar to the approach for ACV 1.1\u2014and before the  system integration work had been completed. Testing of the early  prototypes continued for three years into system development, well after  the tests could inform the CDR decision. Best practices call for system  integration work to be conducted before the CDR is held. According to  DOD officials, the ACV 1.1 PDR will be held after Milestone B because  contracts are not planned to be awarded prior to that time. In addition,  DOD officials stated that the technological maturity of ACV 1.1 reduces  risk and permits both the waiver of the PDR requirement and the  consolidation of the reviews. While the use of mature technology could  suggest a reduced risk from this deferral, we believe that contracts could  have been awarded earlier in the acquisition process in order to facilitate  a PDR prior to development start.", "The current ACV 1.1 program schedule demonstrates concurrency  between testing and production that could represent increased program  risk. According to agency officials, approximately one year of  development testing will take place prior to the program\u2019s production  decision in order to assess production readiness. Another ten months of  testing will continue after the start of production. The intent of  developmental testing is to demonstrate the maturity of a design and to  discover and fix design and performance problems before a system  enters production. According to agency officials, the adoption of an  accelerated fielding schedule is behind the level of overlap between  developmental testing and production. They stated that they plan to have  completed all development testing and operational assessment required  to support the production decision by the time that decision is made. DOD  policy allows some degree of concurrency between initial production and  developmental testing and, according to our prior work, some  concurrency may be necessary when rapidly fielding urgently needed  warfighter capabilities. However, our past work has also shown that  beginning production before demonstrating that a design is mature and  that a system will work as intended increases the risk of discovering  deficiencies during production that could require substantial design  changes and costly modifications to systems already built. A detailed test  plan will not become available until Milestone B as is expected for  acquisition programs. When such a plan is available, we will further  assess the risk presented by this approach.", "Moreover, under the current ACV 1.1 program schedule, Congress may  likely be called upon to provide production funding for ACV 1.1 production  based on little to no evidence from the testing of delivered ACV 1.1  prototypes.

Navy officials said the SSC program plans to  continue testing these technologies and remains on-schedule. However,  the SSC program entered production in 2015, more than 2 years before  the estimated delivery of the test vehicle. This concurrency of  development and production creates a potential risk of schedule overruns  if deficiencies in the design are not discovered until late in testing and  retrofits are required for previously produced craft.

Based on tests and demonstrations to date, program officials also  expressed confidence that ACV 1.2 will build on the ACV 1.1 capabilities  and have the ability to self-deploy from ships. However, according to  DOD officials, the capabilities of the ACV 1.2 are dependent upon the  success of ACV 1.1 development. If the ACV 1.1 does not demonstrate  the expected amphibious capabilities, then more development than  currently anticipated may be required for ACV 1.2 to achieve ship to  shore amphibious capability and greater effort may be needed to retro-fit  ACV 1.1 vehicles to achieve the same capabilities. However, if ACV 1.1  demonstrates greater than expected amphibious capability, then the  progression towards achieving the plans for the ACV 1.2 may be easier.  Program documentation and analysis to date have been done to develop  the ACV 1.1 strategy and plans and to support ACV 1.1 decisions.  According to DOD officials, the USMC has not yet determined whether  the development of ACV 1.2 will be done through improvements within  the same program or as a separate program from ACV 1.1. DOD officials  stated that the development of ACV 1.1 and 1.2 amphibious capabilities is  also expected to impact the nature of ACV 2.0.

According to USMC officials,  over time, the ACV program plans to replace portions of the AAV fleet  with ACV increments as they become available. This USMC strategy, and  the analysis that supports it, is based on the assumption that ACV 1.2 will  reach a desired level of amphibious capability and that ACV 1.1 vehicles  can be upgraded to that level. If, however, those or other key capabilities  cannot be achieved, revisiting the USMC\u2019s strategy prior to making  production decisions for ACV 1.1, particularly addressing changes to its  overall amphibious strategy and potentially updating its analysis of  alternatives, will be important. In addition, when and how the USMC will  achieve the amphibious capability envisioned for ACV 2.0 remains to be  determined, according to DOD officials.

GAO has identified 22 best practices for an AOA process  by (1) compiling and reviewing commonly mentioned AOA policies and  guidance used by different government and private-sector entities and (2)  incorporating experts\u2019 comments on a draft set of practices to develop a  final set of practices.", "These practices can be applied to a wide range of activities in which an  alternative must be selected from a set of possible options, as well as to a  broad range of capability areas, projects, and programs. These practices  can provide a framework to help ensure that entities consistently and  reliably select the project alternative that best meets mission needs. The  guidance below is meant as an overview of the key principles that lead to  a successful AOA process and not as a \u201chow to\u201d guide with detailed  instructions for each best practice identified.", "The 22 best practices that GAO identified are grouped into the following  five phases:  1.  Initialize the AOA process: includes best practices that are applied  before starting the process of identifying, analyzing, and selecting  alternatives. This includes determining the mission need and  functional requirements, developing the study time frame, creating a  study plan, and determining who conducts the analysis.      2.  Identify alternatives: includes best practices that help ensure the  alternatives to be analyzed are sufficient, diverse, and viable.    3.  Analyze alternatives: includes best practices that compare the  alternatives to be analyzed. The best practices in this category help  ensure that the team conducting the analysis uses a standard,  quantitative process to assess the alternatives.     4.  Document and review the AOA process: includes best practices  that would be applied throughout the AOA process, such as  documenting all steps taken to initialize, identify, and analyze  alternatives and to select a preferred alternative in a single document.  5.  Select a preferred alternative: includes a best practice that is  applied by the decision maker to compare alternatives and to select a  preferred alternative.", "The five phases address different themes of analysis necessary to  complete the AOA process and comprise the beginning of the AOA  process (defining the mission needs and functional requirements) through  the final step of the AOA process (select a preferred alternative).", "There are three key entities that are involved in the AOA process: the  customer, the decision maker, and the AOA team. The customer refers to  the program office, service, or agency that identifies a mission need (e.g.  a credible gap between current capabilities and those required to meet  the goals articulated in the strategic plan). The decision maker is the  person or entity that signs off on the final decision and analysis  documented by the AOA report. The decision maker refers to the program  manager (or alternate authority figure identified early in the AOA process)  who will select the preferred alternative based on the established  selection criteria. The AOA team is the group of subject matter experts  who are involved in the day-to-day work of the AOA process and work to  develop the analysis that is the foundation of the AOA process.", "Conforming to the 22 best practices helps ensure that the preferred  alternative selected is the one that best meets the agency\u2019s mission  needs. Not conforming to the best practices may lead to an unreliable  AOA, and the customer will not have assurance that the preferred  alternative best meets the mission needs. Table 1 shows the 22 best  practices and the five phases.", "Some best practices included in a phase can take place concurrently and  do not have to follow the order presented in table 1. The phases should  occur in sequence to prevent bias from entering the analysis and adding  risk that the AOA team will analyze alternatives that have not been  defined. However, the document and review phase can be done at any  stage throughout the AOA process. For example, best practice 5 (define  selection criteria) can be done at the same time as best practice 6 (weight  selection criteria). On the other hand, best practice 20 (ensure AOA  process is impartial) can be done at the end of every step or every phase  to ensure the impartiality of the AOA as it progresses. The best practices  represent an overall process that results in a reliable AOA that can be  easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.

It is important that the AOA process and its results be validated by an  organization independent of the program office and the project\u2019s chain of  command, to ensure that a high-quality AOA is developed, presented,  and defended to management. This process verifies that the AOA  adequately reflects the program\u2019s mission needs and provides a  reasonable assessment of the cost and benefits associated with the  alternatives.", "One reason to independently validate the AOA process is that  independent reviewers typically rely less on assumptions alone and,  therefore, tend to provide more realistic analyses. Moreover, independent  reviewers are less likely to automatically accept unproven assumptions  associated with anticipated savings. That is, they bring more objectivity to  their analyses, resulting in a reality check of the AOA process that  reduces the odds that management will invest in an unreasonable  alternative.", "To that end, we established four characteristics that identify a high- quality, reliable AOA process.

Different pieces of each report or analysis in the full body of work were  relevant to different best practices. Because the 2014 ACV AOA is part of  a larger body of related work that informs this analysis, we then worked  with GAO specialists to discuss the 22 AOA best practices and categorize  each as either \u201cindividual\u201d or \u201ccombined.\u201d Best practices labeled  \u201cindividual\u201d have been assessed based on only the 2014 ACV Analysis of  Alternatives final report.

We used a five-point scoring system to  determine the extent to which the AOA conforms to best practices. To  score each AOA process, (1) two GAO analysts separately examined the  AOA documentation received from the agency and then agreed on a  score for each of the 22 best practices, then (2) a GAO AOA specialist  independent of the engagement team reviewed the AOA documentation  and the scores assigned by the analysts for accuracy and cross-checked  the scores in all the analyses for consistency.
