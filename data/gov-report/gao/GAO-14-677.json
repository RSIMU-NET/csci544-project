GAO's analysis shows that in concept the current General Schedule (GS) classification system's design incorporates several key attributes including internal and external equity, transparency, simplicity, and rank in position. However, as OPM implemented the system, the attributes of transparency, internal equity, simplicity, flexibility, and adaptability are reduced. This occurs, in part, because some attributes are at odds with one another so fully achieving one attribute comes at the expense of another. Thus, OPM, working with its stakeholders, is challenged to determine how best to optimize each attribute.", "While the GS system's standardized set of 420 occupations, grouped in 23 occupational familes, and statutorily-defined 15 grade level system incorporates several key attributes, it falls short in implementation. For example, the occupational standard for an information technology specialist clearly describes the routine duties, tasks, and experience required for the position. This kind of information is published for the 420 occupations, so all agencies are using the same, consistent standards when classifying positions\u2014embodying the attributes of transparency and internal equity. However, in implementation, having numerous, narrowly-defined occupational standards inhibits the system's ability to optimize these attributes. Specifically, classifying occupations and developing position descriptions in the GS system requires officials to maintain an understanding of the individual position and the nuances between similar occupations. Without this understanding, the transparency and internal equity of the system may be inhibited, as agency officials may not be classifying positions consistently, comparable employees may not be treated equitably, and the system may seem unpredictable. Several studies have concluded that the GS system was not meeting the needs of the modern federal workforce or supporting agency missions, and some studies suggested reductions in the number of occupational series and grade levels to help simplify the system. In addition, over the years agencies have sought exceptions to the GS system to mitigate some of its limitations either through demonstration projects or congressionally-authorized alternative personnel systems\u2014often featuring a broadband approach that provided fewer, broader occupational groups and grade levels. By using lessons learned and the results from prior studies to examine ways to make the GS system more consistent with the attributes of a modern, effective classification system, OPM could better position itself to help ensure that the system is keeping pace with the government's evolving requirements.", "The proportion of federal employees covered under alternative personnel systems increased from 6 percent to 21 percent of the white-collar workforce from 1988 to 2013.

Of the GS system's 23 occupational families, the 6 with the largest increase from GS to an alternative system were mostly concentrated in STEM occupations (See figure below).

From 2003 to 2014, OPM established 14 new occupational standards and revised almost 20 percent of the occupational standards. However, there was no published review or update of 124 occupations since 1990. OPM officials said they first review occupations identified in presidential memorandums as needing review; however OPM does not systemically track and prioritize the remaining occupational standards for review. Therefore, OPM has limited assurance that it is updating the highest priority occupations. Further, OPM is required by law to oversee agencies' implementation of the GS system.

In the regression, we controlled for several factors including  employees\u2019 years of federal service, age, education, and pay basis  (hourly, annually). We estimated this model for occupations with at least  2.5 percent employee representation in both systems and which  contained at least 0.125 percent of the federal government, or about 90 of  more than 400 possible occupations.

Importantly, the weight that policymakers and stakeholders  assign to each attribute\u2014and the trade-offs made among competing  attributes\u2014are important in evaluating alternative classification designs  like those found in demonstration projects or the Partnership for Public  Service\u2019s recent model.", "Moreover, while the attributes listed below were frequently cited by  subject matter specialists and the literature we examined, there was no  consensus in priority or in degree of these attributes. Subject matter  specialists agreed that any changes to the classification system should  align with the guiding principle of equal pay for work of substantially equal  value.", "The eight attributes of a modern, effective classification system are as  follows:  Internal equity.

There are two main design features of the  GS system: (1) a set of standardized occupations, and (2) statutorily  defined grade levels and steps. We found, in concept, these features  incorporate several of the key attributes including internal and external  equity, transparency, simplicity, and rank-in-position. However, as  agencies implement the GS system the attributes of transparency,  internal equity, simplicity, flexibility, and adaptability are reduced. This  occurs, in part, because as discussed earlier in this report, some  attributes are at odds with one another, so fully achieving one attribute  comes at the expense of another.", "OPM publishes and defines a set of occupational standards that describe  and differentiate all of the different types of work performed across the  government, which agencies then use to develop position descriptions.  Providing standard government-wide occupational standards is an  example of how transparency and internal equity are built into the  system. For example, the occupational standard for an information  technology specialist clearly describes the routine duties and tasks, and  experience required for the position. This information is published for all  of the 420 occupations defined in the GS system, so all agencies are  using the same, consistent standards when writing position descriptions.  At the same time, any occupation with the same education, experience,  and other requirements should be assigned the same grade level and  same base pay range, contributing to internal equity. The GS system  defines occupations narrowly, meaning that different occupational  definitions may exist even for closely related occupations, like electrical  engineers and electronics engineers. These two occupations both require  similar backgrounds in understanding the theories of advanced  mathematics, economics, and computer science. However, in application,  electrical engineers tend to concentrate on the electrical systems of  physical infrastructure, among other areas, while electronics engineers  tend to concentrate on the electrical systems of devices such as satellites  and communication systems. The precisely defined occupational  standards can also enable comparisons to those occupations in the  private sector, providing some level of external equity.", "However, in practice having numerous, narrowly-defined occupational  standards may actually inhibit the system\u2019s ability to optimize these  attributes for reasons including the following:", "Classifying occupations and developing position descriptions in the  GS system requires officials to maintain an understanding of the  potential responsibilities of the individual position and of the nuances  between similar occupational definitions. Without this understanding,  having numerous occupations from which to choose may inhibit  transparency and internal equity. For example, one subject matter  specialist said that the requirements of a particular position may be  met by the qualifications of more than one occupational definition. As  a result, officials may not be classifying positions consistently,  comparable employees may not be treated equitably, and the system  may seem unpredictable.", "Having many\u2014more than 400\u2014occupations can limit the simplicity  of the system. For example, since individual occupations may have  their own career ladders or a set number of grades for potential  advancement, it can be challenging for agencies to move employees  according to their core skills within and across agencies to address  evolving needs. Likewise, qualified employees may be limited in their  ability to advance in their general fields as related but distinctly  defined occupations may require specific experiences in that  occupation.  Interdisciplinary occupations\u2014those that involve duties and  responsibilities closely related to more than one professional  occupational standard, such as those in certain scientific research  fields like natural resources management and biological sciences\u2014 provide some flexibility to agencies as they allow agencies to  combine the work of multiple occupations. This is because the  position could be classified in two or more occupational series and the  employee with education and experience in either of two or more  professions may be considered equally qualified to do the work. The  final classification of the position is determined by the qualifications of  the employee. However, interdisciplinary occupations decrease the  simplicity of the system. This is because employees, management,  and taxpayers may not be able to easily understand how one  occupation differs from another, especially when position descriptions  have overlapping responsibilities.", "Finally, a system composed of numerous occupational series can be  cumbersome to systematically review, limiting the system\u2019s  adaptability. This is because reviewing and revising occupational  series can be a time-consuming effort, partially due to analysis  required to understand the differences between and potential effect of  closely related occupations, ensure government-wide applicability and  gain consensus.", "The second key design feature of the GS system is the 15 statutorily  defined grade levels intended to distinguish the degrees of difficulty within  an occupation, which are designed to simplify the system and provide  internal equity. Agency officials assign a grade level to a position after  analyzing the duties and responsibilities according to the factor evaluation  system. This allows for easy comparisons of employees in the same  occupation and grade level but in different agencies, providing simplicity  and internal equity to the system, and it may help employees move  across agencies. Within the 15 grades there are 10 steps\u2014 time-based  increases that determine a GS employee\u2019s rate of pay\u2014providing  transparency to the system by creating a clear, predictable process.", "This design feature emphasizes the GS system as a rank-in-position  system that focuses on the position and the time spent in that position  over the specific characteristics or performance of the incumbent, as a  rank-in-person system would do.", "However, in practice the 15 grades and the 10 steps may actually inhibit  the system\u2019s ability to optimize these attributes for reasons such as the  following:", "The 15 grades require officials to make meaningful distinctions  between such things as the nature and extent of the skills necessary  for the work at each level, which may be more difficult in some white- collar occupations where those differences may not be clear cut. For  example, officials must be able to determine how the work of a GS-12  accountant is different from a GS-13 accountant. But making clear  distinctions between these occupations may be more nuanced, as the  basis for them hinges on, for example, how agency officials determine  the degree of complexity of the work or the most important duties of  the position. As a result, having 15 grade levels may make the system  seem less transparent, as distinguishing between the levels may not  be precisely measured by the elements of the factor evaluation  criteria. Otherwise, agencies risk having two employees performing  substantially equal work but receiving unequal pay, which decreases  the degree to which the system can ensure internal equity.", "Further, having so many grades defined by statute, makes it hard to  review and revise the grades, thereby limiting the adaptability of the  GS system. As the nature of work and the workforce changes, the  system is constrained, since some revisions to the system would  require legislative action. As we concluded in our 2003 report, for  example, \u201c\u2026today\u2019s knowledge-based organizations\u2019 jobs require a  much broader array of tasks that may cross over the narrow and rigid  boundaries of job classifications. The federal job classification process  not only delays the hiring process, but more importantly, the resulting  job classifications and related pay might not match the actual duties of  the job. This mismatch can hamper efforts to fill the positions with the  right employees.\u201d", "To address some of the issues we found in our 2003 report, among other  things we recommended that OPM \u201cstudy how to simplify, streamline, and  reform the classification process.\u201d In response, OPM published a report  which outlined several strategic principles to modernize the civil service  system, while preserving the merit system principles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Broadband Systems Incorporate Attributes of a Modern, Effective Classification System Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, agencies, either through the use of demonstration  projects or congressionally authorized alternative personnel systems,  have sought exceptions to the GS system to mitigate some of its  limitations.

By using lessons learned  from the alternative systems and results from prior studies of the GS  system to examine ways to make the GS system more consistent with the  attributes of a modern, effective classification system, OPM could better  position itself to help ensure that the system is keeping pace with the  government\u2019s evolving requirements. Further, stakeholders like the  CHCO Council, unions and others can provide insight into the design and  implementation of these alternatives. According to the subject matter  specialists and OPM and agency evaluations of alternative personnel  systems, most of the alternative systems either retained GS occupations  and grades but with higher pay rates to address difficulties in recruiting or  retaining well-qualified employees or implemented a broad-banded  approach to pay and classification. Broadband systems can provide fewer  occupations and fewer grade levels which align with fewer, but broader  ranges of pay for that occupation.", "Broader bands that combine groups of GS-equivalent occupations into  larger occupational families may have broadly defined occupational  definitions, increasing agency flexibility to use employees according to  their skills and competencies\u2014thereby embodying an element of rank-in- person. For example, in 1996, the Department of Defense authorized the  Civilian Acquisition Workforce Personnel demonstration project to provide  employees and management flexibility concerning work assignments.  Employees in acquisition occupations with similar characteristics were  grouped together into three career paths and assigned broader bands  that provided both a broader range of pay and broader spectrum of  duties. For example, employees were assigned to projects, tasks, or  functions, but did not have their in-position descriptions changed. On  the other hand, broader occupational definitions can provide less  transparency to the specific skills required of a position and can make it  more challenging to monitor internal equity\u2014as employees in a single  broad band may vary widely in their qualifications and responsibilities. In  addition, broad-banded systems can combine multiple GS grade  equivalents into a smaller range of bands, often between three and five.  Just as the bands represent a broader range of grade levels, broad- banded systems often align with broader ranges of pay than the GS  system. Broad ranges of grades and pay can enable greater external  equity by giving agencies more latitude in matching market pay rates. In  addition, having fewer broad bands can increase the simplicity of the  system because broad bands do not require such a precise analysis of  the degree of difficulty of an occupation.", "While fewer occupational bands are designed to create a more simple  system, as implemented this may also decrease transparency because  two employees in the same occupation may have a variety of different  responsibilities, thus limiting cross-agency and government comparisons.  While increasing agency flexibility to use employees according to their  skills and competencies, in practice it may limit the transparency of the  system, because employees and others (e.g., Congress and taxpayers)  may be less certain of career-path options.

For example, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and  Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) granted certain federal financial  regulatory agencies, which had been taken out of the GS classification  system, the flexibility to establish their own compensation systems.

OPM officials  said that they do not track all of the agency requests they receive  because, in some cases, an agency requested an occupational review  from OPM, but after speaking with the agency and evaluating the need for  a review, OPM officials determined that no review was necessary. OPM  officials said at times they conduct a study to establish an occupation, but  find the work is appropriately addressed by an existing occupation and  that a new occupation is not warranted. For example, OPM officials said  they studied whether a new occupation was needed for positions related  to implementing the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. However, OPM  officials said they determined that the position responsibilities fell under  the current duties of management and program analysis occupations.", "Because OPM does not systematically track all agency requests it  receives and its subsequent decision on whether or not to review  occupational standards, it is unclear whether OPM\u2019s decisions are  meeting agency needs. In our previous work looking at strategies that  help agencies meet their missions, CHCOs said if the position description  and job announcements are based on outdated standards, they are less  likely to reflect the specific skills needed, making it challenging for  agencies to recruit and hire the right individuals.", "OPM officials also said that updating the standard for a specific  occupation is a resource-intensive process that often takes 6 months to a  year to complete. Officials also said reviewing an occupational family,  which includes a number of individual occupations, can take multiple  years to complete. Further, officials said that some occupations are more  dynamic than others and may need to be reviewed more frequently. For  example, an emerging occupation or one in the information technology  field may need to be updated more frequently as the nature of the work is  clarified or changes.", "OPM does not know if it is keeping pace with agencies\u2019 needs to meet the  evolving nature of government work. Without a more strategic approach  for systemically tracking and prioritizing updates to occupational  standards, especially for more dynamic and emerging occupations, OPM  does not have reasonable assurance that it is fulfilling its responsibilities  to establish new or revise existing occupational standards based on the  highest priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Is Not Conducting Oversight of Agency Classification Programs", "paragraphs": ["OPM has not reviewed agency classification programs since the 1980s.

While the law does not indicate a minimum  number of positions and occupations that OPM should review, nor  specific time frames for review, OPM said it is not currently conducting  this oversight at any federal agency. OPM is also authorized to revoke or  suspend an agency\u2019s classification authority if OPM finds that an agency  is not following classification guidance; however, it has not done so in  more than two decades.", "OPM officials said the agency stopped conducting oversight reviews in  the 1980s because OPM determined that the reviews were ineffective at  overseeing agency compliance with the occupational standards.  Specifically, officials said the reviews were time consuming and agencies  did not agree with how OPM selected the position descriptions to review.  OPM officials said agencies frequently contested the results of the  reviews leading to another time- and resource-intensive review process  for both OPM and the agencies. Further, OPM officials said revoking an  agency\u2019s classification authority requires OPM to provide classification  support to the agencies, another time- and resource-intensive process.", "OPM officials said in 2014 they had 6 full-time classification policy  specialists tasked with maintaining the classification standards, compared  to 16 in 2001, and many more in the 1980s. OPM officials said that lower  staffing levels limit the agency\u2019s ability to perform oversight. However,  OPM, like all agencies, must make tradeoffs between competing  demands with its limited resources during an era of constrained  resources. According to OPM officials, the reduction in employees with  classification experience has declined government-wide. In our 2013  high-risk update, we found that an OPM-led working group identified the  human resources specialist series\u2014which includes classifiers\u2014as a  mission-critical skills gap.resources specialist series can be traced back to the mid-1990s.", "The decrease in classifiers within the human  OPM officials said they rely on agencies\u2019 internal oversight programs to  ensure proper application of the classification policies.

Agencies are responsible for classifying  positions consistent with OPM occupational standards and guidance.  According to OPM officials, oversight functions for classification vary by  agency.", "OPM officials told us that employees have the right to appeal  classification decisions regarding their position if they believe that their  position has not been correctly classified by an agency. OPM officials  said the appeals published in the Digest of Significant Classification  Decisions and Opinions provide interpretative guidance to agencies to  assist them in applying standards. According to OPM officials, employees  commonly appealed the assigned grade level of a position when the job  duties described in a position description were not consistent with  classification standards. OPM officials said that they may require  agencies to conduct classification consistency reviews as a result of a  classification appeals decision. While reviewing classification appeals can  give OPM a sense of an agency\u2019s ability to classify individual positions, it  does not address OPM\u2019s responsibility to oversee the classification  process.

While these examples of assisting agencies to better implement  the GS on a case-by-case basis are helpful, they are not fully addressing  the fundamental challenges facing the GS system, which we and others  have said is not meeting the needs of federal agencies. For example, as  noted in this report, at the March 2014 interagency classification forum  that we observed, OPM provided status reports on classification projects  such as its study on pay equity and closing critical skills gaps. OPM also  discussed its new procedures for collecting agency comments during  occupational reviews. OPM stated that the studies and lessons learned of  alternative personnel systems and demonstration projects focused on pay  rather than classification. However, as we noted in the report,  classification and pay are closely related, and we continue to believe that  the lessons learned from these efforts should be used to examine ways to  make the GS system more consistent with the attributes of a modern,  effective classification system. OPM also discussed its new procedures  for collecting agency comments during occupational reviews.  We are  encouraged at OPM\u2019s plan to leverage partnerships with key stakeholders  to inform future strategies and action plans, and continue to recommend  that OPM uses these efforts examine ways to make the design and  implementation of the GS system more in line with the attributes of a  modern, effective classification system.", "OPM stated that it did not concur with our recommendation to develop a  strategy to systematically track and prioritize updates to occupational  standards.

Our discussion groups included over 25 subject matter  specialists. We selected these subject matter specialists because they  represented various perspectives on and experiences with federal  classification. Specifically, we conducted sessions covering the following  areas: (1) the public policy arena, with representatives such as the  Partnership for Public Service, Project on Government Oversight,  American Enterprise Institute, Booz Allen Hamilton, the Federal Salary  Council, Human Resources Research Organization, and American  Society for Public Administration; (2) federal employee organizations, with  representatives such as the American Federation of Government  Employees, National Treasury Employees Union, International Federation  of Professionals and Technical Engineers, and the National Federation of  Federal Employees; (3) academia with representatives from American  University and Rutgers University; (4) an official from the Federal  Managers Association; (5) former employees of OPM, including high- ranking officials and prior OPM directors; and (6) officials who were  formerly in personnel positions at federal agencies that have employees  on alternative personnel systems, such as the Departments of Defense,  Energy, and Homeland Security. We collaboratively analyzed major  themes through repeated review and discussion of detailed notes of the  discussion groups to identify the attributes of a modern, effective  classification system along with other themes for consideration. We  provided the subject matter experts and OPM officials the opportunity to  comment on the attributes, and modified the attributes or definitions as  appropriate. For additional perspectives on the attributes of a modern,  effective system we reviewed relevant literature on the GS system  published from 2000 to 2014 from OPM, academic journals, and public  policy organizations. In addition, we reviewed relevant literature on  selected alternative personnel systems, applicable federal laws, and  statutes pertaining to classification, and OPM\u2019s classification guidance,  such as The Classifier\u2019s Handbook and The Introduction to the Position  Classification Standards. Because OPM is not responsible for the  oversight of alternative personnel systems, it does not have a listing of all  alternative personnel systems. Therefore, the universe of alternative  personnel systems is unknown and our analysis did not attempt to  catalogue all of the alternative personnel systems. When we refer to  alternative personnel systems in this section, we refer to systems that are  broader than alternative pay plans that we analyze in objective 2.

Our  analysis included nonsenior executive, white-collar occupations in the 24  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies, which represent the major  departments, such as the Department of Defense and most of the  executive branch workforce.  Our trend analysis begins with fiscal year  1988 because it was the first year for which data were available, and  ends with 2013 because it was the most recent, complete fiscal year of  data available during our review. To determine trends in the proportion of  the federal nonexecutive, white collar workforce covered by alternative  personnel systems, we analyzed for each fiscal year the proportion of  those employees\u2014government-wide and within CFO Act agencies and  occupational families\u2014covered under general schedule pay plans (GS,  GL, GM) compared to all other pay plans.", "To analyze the pay differences between employees on the GS system  and employees on alternative personnel systems, we performed a  multivariate regression analysis on EHRI data for fiscal year 2013.  Consistent with standard practice in studies of the determinants of  earnings, we attempted to explain the differences by predicting the  logarithm of annual adjusted pay on characteristics of federal workers. In  the regression, we controlled for employees\u2019 years of federal experience,  age, education, type of service (competitive or excepted), type of  appointment (permanent or nonpermanent), veterans\u2019 preference,  schedule (full or part-time), and pay basis (hourly, annually). We also  included a set of indicator variables for agency of employment,  occupational series, and geography. By including these indicator  variables, we controlled for the possibility that agencies might have higher  pay rates and occupations might earn different rates of pay regardless of  whether they were in the GS or an alternative system. We estimated this  model for occupations with at least 2.5 percent employee representation  in both systems, and which contained at least 0.125 percent of the federal  government, or about 90 of more than 400 possible occupations.", "We assessed the reliability of the EHRI data through electronic testing to  identify missing data, out of range values, and logical inconsistencies.
