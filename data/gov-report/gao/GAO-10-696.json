To determine how well the Department of Defense (DOD) and the services are developing their medical and dental personnel requirements, GAO evaluated (1) the extent to which the services have incorporated cross-service collaboration in their medical personnel requirement processes, and (2) the service-specific processes for determining their requirements for military and civilian medical personnel. To conduct this review, GAO evaluated manpower policies, analyzed the services' requirements data and determination processes, and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and each of the services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DOD's 2007 Military Health System Human Capital Strategic Plan emphasizes developing human capital solutions across the services to enable departmentwide decision making and analyses, the services' collaborative planning efforts regarding requirements determination for medical personnel working in fixed military treatment facilities have been limited. In one effort to integrate operations, DOD is consolidating medical facilities in the Washington, D.C., area under a joint task force that calls for joint staffing of the military treatment facilities in the region. However, officials have faced challenges in developing the manpower requirements for the joint facilities due to the use of outdated planning assumptions. Separately, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored another joint medical effort to develop a cross-service medical manpower standard for mental health personnel. This standard is being used to determine the amount of personnel needed to meet common, day-to-day psychological health needs of eligible beneficiaries across the services. However, to date, this standard is the only one of its kind, and OSD officials said that no other similar efforts currently exist. The services' continued focus on separate medical personnel requirements processes may not be consistent with the DOD strategic plan's vision of a more integrated approach, and the services may have missed opportunities to collaborate and develop cross-service manpower standards for common medical capabilities that are shared across military treatment facilities. Sustained and committed leadership emphasis on developing more effective ways of doing business, such as the use of cross-service medical manpower standards, is key to successful, collaborative human capital strategic planning. To the extent that the services need to maintain separate processes, GAO also found that their requirements processes are not, in all cases, validated and verifiable, as DOD policy requires. Selected specialty modules in the Army's model contain some outdated assumptions, such as the level of care currently being provided, and only a portion of the modules have been completely validated. While the Navy has employed an approach that uses current manning as a baseline and adjusts its requirements based on emerging needs or major changes to missions, the approach is not validated or verified as required by DOD guidance. The Air Force said it may not know its true medical requirements as the model it has relied on also is not currently validated or verified. Each of the services has recognized the need to have processes that can be validated and verified, and has taken steps to address these issues in recent years. However, without processes that are validated and verifiable, the services cannot be certain they are determining their medical personnel requirements in the most effective and efficient manner. Also, the services do not centrally manage their processes for their civilian medical personnel requirements. While local commanders determine these requirements, the services may be missing the opportunity to make a strategic determination of how many civilian medical professionals are needed to carry out their expected workloads."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OSD and the services emphasize a long-term joint approach to medical personnel requirements determination by identifying the common medical capabilities shared across the services and developing cross-service medical manpower standards, where applicable; and that the services take actions to improve their respective medical requirements determination processes. In written comments to a draft of this report, DOD generally concurred with these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The physicians, dentists, nurses, and other health care personnel who  work for the Department of Defense (DOD) are in great demand due to  projected nationwide medical personnel shortages over the next decade  and are essential to maintaining DOD\u2019s substantial health care delivery  capability, which provides a full range of medical care to active duty  military personnel and all other eligible beneficiaries sometimes at no  cost. With more than 9.6 million eligible beneficiaries receiving care from  DOD\u2019s 59 inpatient medical facilities, 364 health clinics, and, at times,  private-sector providers, the cost of DOD\u2019s medical system has risen from  $17.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 to approximately $50 billion in fiscal year  2010, and it currently represents more than 9 percent of the DOD budget.  Moreover, health care costs are expected to continue to escalate in the  future. Because this amount does not include the cost of health care that is  needed overseas to support two concurrent wars, or the costs to recruit  and retain military personnel, the total amount DOD is spending on  military health care is even higher. U.S. forces are expected to continue  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and, as a result, add to the workload of  military treatment facilities for servicemembers who become injured or ill.  Although tremendous advances in military medicine have led to reduced  mortality rates among U.S. servicemembers, these patients may require  lengthy hospital stays and extensive rehabilitation with highly trained staff  to meet their medical care needs. A higher demand for health care  personnel is also anticipated due to the increased numbers of overall  personnel in both the Army and the Marine Corps from an effort known as  Grow the Force. Key in its efforts to address the challenge of managing the  medical forces across the services and determining the right number and  mix of medical personnel to meet the various needs of the Military Health  System is DOD\u2019s plan to promote collaboration and integration in human  capital management, while simultaneously respecting service-specific  doctrine. Further, DOD\u2019s implementation of several strategic initiatives,  such as Base Realignment and Closure decisions and the development of  several joint ventures under its evolving framework for a Joint/Unified  Medical Command, have forced the department to undertake steps  designed to re-examine, among other things, its medical personnel  requirements.", "Our previous work has highlighted a range of long-standing issues  surrounding DOD\u2019s Military Health System. For example, we reported in  March 1995 that interservice rivalries and conflicting responsibilities  hindered Military Health System improvement efforts. We noted in that  report that the services have historically resisted efforts to change,  preferring to maintain their own health care systems, primarily on the  grounds that each service has unique medical activities and requirements.  In our February 2005 report on challenges facing the U.S. government   in the 21st century, we identified DOD\u2019s health care system as an area in  which DOD could achieve economies of scale and improve delivery by  combining, realigning, or otherwise changing selected support functions.  That report noted that although DOD\u2019s civilian and military leaders appear  committed to reform, DOD must overcome cultural resistance in the  individual services, as well as the inertia of various organizations, policies,  and practices (such as \u201cstovepiping\u201d or compartmentalizing of information  or functions) that became well rooted in the Cold War era. In October  2007, we reported that DOD had taken incremental steps toward  improving efficiencies within its Military Health System by establishing a  joint medical effort in the National Capital Region, as well as the Joint  Medical Education and Training Center in San Antonio, Texas. While we  recognized that incremental improvements are sometimes appropriate, we  recommended that DOD take steps to measure whether its efforts were  meeting the goal of eliminating unnecessary duplication. DOD concurred  with this recommendation and has identified the steps that the department  has taken to address it. Further, DOD\u2019s April 2006 Quadrennial Defense  Review Roadmap for Medical Transformation recognized the  department\u2019s need to transform its Military Health System, and the 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review acknowledged that DOD needs to reform  the way in which it does business and to eliminate challenges that hinder  its success.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee, in its report accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, directed GAO   to report to congressional defense committees on medical and dental  personnel requirements of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air  Force, including their reserve components, in order to, among other  things, meet their medical missions in support of contingency operations  and deliver high quality health care to eligible beneficiaries. In April 2009,  we responded to that mandate in a published briefing to the defense  committees on personnel authorizations and end strengths, by medical  specialty. Subsequently, we agreed with congressional defense  committees to undertake additional related work and initiated two reviews  on issues related to military medical and dental personnel requirements in  support of (1) fixed military treatment facilities and (2) contingency  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. For this report, we focused on  medical and dental personnel requirements in support of DOD\u2019s fixed  military treatment facilities. We evaluated (1) the extent to which the  services have incorporated cross-service collaboration in their planning  efforts for determining their medical personnel requirements, and (2) the  service-specific processes for determining their requirements for military  and civilian medical personnel.", "For our first objective, we analyzed DOD and Army, Navy, and Air Force  policies, directives, and other relevant strategic planning documents. We  also obtained and analyzed memoranda and other documents related to  DOD and the services\u2019 ongoing collaborative efforts. Further, we  interviewed various officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs and each of the services to obtain a more  detailed understanding of the history, objectives, status, and challenges of  their ongoing cross-service medical efforts. For our second objective, we  analyzed instructions concerning personnel management procedures from  each of the services. We also obtained and examined personnel  requirements and authorized positions data for selected medical  specialties for fiscal year 2009 and evaluated the reliability of the data we  obtained and analyzed. We found it sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this audit. Additionally, we obtained and analyzed existing service  requirements models in use and interviewed officials from each of the  services in order to understand the processes they implement to determine  their specific service\u2019s medical personnel requirements. For more detailed  information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 through July 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Within the Army, the Army Surgeon General simultaneously  heads the Army Medical Department and the Army Medical Command. In  leading the Army Medical Department, the Surgeon General serves as the  primary advisor to the Secretary of the Army on all health and medical  issues. In addition, the Army Surgeon General has overall responsibility  for the Armywide health services system to include development, policy  direction, organization, and management of the system through such  activities as recruiting, organizing, equipping, supplying, and training, as  assigned by the Secretary of the Army.

These facilities consist of 59 hospitals capable of  providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and inpatient care, as well as hundreds  of clinics that primarily handle health screenings and ambulatory care.   The Army, Navy, and Air Force staff their military treatment facilities with  active duty, reserve, and civilian personnel. Contractors also play a role in  the execution of the Military Health System mission by providing medical,  clinical, and administrative staff and support services within both the  military treatment facilities and the network of private hospitals and  providers in the community. Reliance on contractors in the medical  community varies by location and need. DOD is not required by law to  include the number of medical contractors it employs in its annual Defense  Manpower Requirements Report; therefore, the number of medical  contractors onboard at any point in time is not readily available. DOD\u2019s  medical force is comprised of approximately 228,000 personnel, including  about 116,000 active duty personnel, 67,000 reserve component personnel,  and 45,000 civilians.

Civilians comprise 20 percent of the medical  workforce. In providing technical comments to a draft of this report,   DOD noted that among the military services, the Army has the highest  percentage of civilians.

This effort stems from a 2005  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommendation to  relocate patient care activities from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center  Washington, D.C., to the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda,  Maryland, and to a new community hospital at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The  BRAC Commission presented its list of final recommendations to the  President of the United States, which included a cost/savings estimate for  this joint medical effort. The President approved the recommendations in  their entirety and subsequently forwarded them to Congress, and they  became effective in November 2005. Our analysis of DOD fiscal year 2010  BRAC budget showed that the cost to implement this realignment is  estimated to be $2.4 billion, consisting primarily of $1.7 billion in  construction costs. That analysis also showed that DOD projects its net  annual recurring savings of this effort to be $172 million.", "In September 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a  memorandum that formally established Joint Task Force National Capital  Region Medical. One of its two facilities, the new Walter Reed National  Military Medical Center, will be located on the Bethesda campus, and  according to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is expected to deliver  effective and efficient, world-class military health care, as well as  consolidate and realign military health care in the region. Its medical  services will include primary care, secondary care (that is, care provided  by a consulting physician at the request of a primary physician), and  tertiary care (that is, very specialized care performed by physicians with  facilities and skills for special investigation and medical treatment). DOD  plans to close the current Walter Reed Army Medical Center facility by  September 2011. The second facility at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, is being  expanded to provide comprehensive primary and secondary patient care  services.

According to a statement in the 2010 Comprehensive Master Plan for the  Nation Capital Region Medical, this medical realignment represents a  merger of nearly 10,000 healthcare and support staff. The document also  states that the department has currently determined an active duty  personnel distribution between the new Walter Reed National Military  Medical Center in Bethesda and the Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, and  that the services have identified the resources to meet the manning  requirements. Joint Task Force National Capital Region Medical, which  reached fully operational capability status on September 30, 2008,  represents an important initiative within the Military Health System  because, if successful, Joint Task Force officials believe it will be a model  for the future of military medicine. Officials also noted to us that this joint  medical effort in Washington, D.C., is a new process and, Joint Task Force  officials are working with the services to work through details to achieve  joint medical commands in the National Capital Region.", "Officials, however, have faced challenges in consolidating and realigning  the medical manpower portion of this newly formed joint medical effort  within the National Capital Region. Additionally, according to officials we  spoke with, several assumptions used throughout the development of the  joint manning document\u2014that (1) the population served would remain  static from 2004, (2) the clinical workload to be met would be based on  that of 2004, and (3) the 2004 medical missions would remain constant\u2014 have become outdated. According to officials, the military treatment  facilities in the National Capital Region have seen a significant increase in  their clinical workload over 2004 levels as a result of injuries sustained by  servicemembers following the acceleration in overseas operations in Iraq  that was announced in 2007. Further, they said these injuries entail  additional medical missions that the Joint Task Force officials have not  been able to fully incorporate into the clinical workload or the personnel  requirements determination. Such additional missions include an  increased need for advanced limb and wound care, and traumatic brain  injury care. Also, in order to develop the joint manning document for the  newly formed and jointly staffed facilities, officials had to fuse the results  of the services\u2019 dissimilar medical personnel requirements determination  processes. In doing so, they found that the services\u2019 official manning  documents contained inaccuracies. Several civilian and military Joint Task  Force officials, who analyzed manpower documents to determine the  levels of medical personnel currently on board for each service, told us  that the services had employed civilian and contract personnel at their  facilities but not recorded them on the manpower documents upon which  these officials based the development of the joint manning document.   For these various reasons, the joint task force officials have encountered  significant challenges in developing an accurate, complete, and realistic  joint manning document that lays out the medical requirements by  specialty for the newly formed joint facilities.", "DOD officials attribute the problems to formative, early stage development  issues, and acknowledged that, if service manpower determination  processes had used similar language, nomenclatures, and approaches,   the creation of the joint manning document would have been a more  straightforward process.

PHRAMS represents the culmination of a  collaborative manpower requirements effort to develop a standardized,  more consistent approach across the services for determining mental  health personnel requirements. Health Affairs sponsored the development  of the cross-service PHRAMS manpower standard to address the growth   in demand for mental health services, as well as to give the services a  standard by which to develop mental health requirements needed to meet  the common, day-to-day psychological health needs of eligible  beneficiaries across the services. The model projects mental health  medical requirements over a 5-year planning horizon and provides a gap  analysis for the first year, in order to assist the services in addressing near- term personnel shortages.

The Automated Staffing  Assessment Model consists of over 240 modules for determining essential  medical requirements for many medical specialties such as physicians,  nurses, dentists, medical service corps, and veterinarians, to name a few,  at the work center level across Army fixed military treatment facilities.  The model uses the current population of the various military treatment  facilities as the major determinant of the number of medical personnel  needed at each facility.

However, if a module is based solely on data  provided by subject matter experts and functional estimates of the primary  tasks associated with the specialty, the model will be approved for 1  year\u2014as is the case for the recently validated veterinary specialty module.  According to Army officials, prior to 2008, the Army required a random  sample of 2 percent of the requirements models to be validated for  reasonableness; however, currently, it uses a more stringent approach that  requires all models to be validated. Army documents show that the Army\u2019s  manpower analysis agency completed validation of 4 of the 240 modules in  2009 and 2 more so far in 2010. In addition, 12 more modules have either  been submitted for review and approval or are nearing submission. In  technical comments to a draft of this report, DOD noted that the Army  believes the number of requirements covered by its staffing assessment  model is more important than the number of modules as we have  discussed. As such, the Army noted that nearly 20 percent of its medical  personnel requirements have been updated and about another 20 percent  of its requirements have been submitted for validation however are  pending approvals. Moreover, Army Medical Command officials have been  working with representatives from the Army Manpower Analysis Agency  to develop a specific time line and priorities for validation of the remaining  modules, but currently no definitive schedule has been set yet for  completing the validation.", "Army officials recognized that the approach to model validation that they  had been using, including its previous reliance on sampling methods, was  not providing the Army with complete and sufficient information. With  committed and sustained leadership emphasis to complete and maintain  the validation of all the modules, the Army will be in a better position to be  certain it is determining its medical personnel requirements in an effective  and efficient manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Does Not Have a Validated and Verifiable Process but Is Moving toward a Validated Model", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has not used a model to determine the medical personnel  requirements for its fixed military treatment facilities.

Additionally, Navy officials explained that local  military treatment facility commanders prepare annual business plans for  their medical facilities and include proposed changes to the facilities\u2019  personnel requirements based on such information as enrolled population,  utilization rates, and on expert functional knowledge at the military  treatment facility. These business case analyses are then submitted and  reviewed through the chain of command and approved by the Navy  Surgeon General as medical resources allow. While the Navy routinely  employs this approach to determine its medical personnel requirements, it  is not a validated or verified methodology as required by DOD guidance.", "To better assess its medical personnel requirement needs at the medical  specialty level, the Navy is beginning to develop medical manpower  standards which officials indicate will be used as the basis for future  requirements determination. According to Navy officials, they plan to use  the Navy Medicine Benchmark Model for its 93 medical functional areas.  As this model will determine the benchmark for the number of personnel  needed in a medical specialty at a military treatment facility, the model  will be used to identify surpluses or shortages in personnel at each facility  and identifying the optimal military, civilian, and contractor mix. DOD  noted in technical comments responding to a draft of this report that the  Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Headquarters is the approval  authority for determining whether a medical personnel requirements  model or process is valid and verifiable. Navy medical officials explained  that they are still in the process of determining the model\u2019s validity for  each of its medical specialty areas, and they did not provide a time  schedule as to when this would be completed. Although the Navy is  implementing this model to help determine its medical personnel  requirements, Navy officials asserted to us that the Navy does not have  any unmet requirements, as it uses private-sector medical care when  military treatment facilities are unable to provide the care.", "Navy officials recognized the business case analysis process did not  provide the validated and verifiable approach needed to determine their  medical manpower requirements. With committed and sustained  leadership emphasis to implement and maintain a fully validated  benchmark model, the Navy similarly will be in a better position to be  certain it is determining its medical personnel requirements in an effective  and efficient manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Currently Uses a Nonvalidated, Nonverifiable Model and Other Information to Determine Its Medical Requirements but Has Begun Developing a Newer Model", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Air Force Surgeon General collaborated with the private  sector to design the Product Line Analysis and Transformation Tool that  produced medical manpower staffing models utilizing industry standards  and research and the experiences of Air Force medical personnel. While  the models were presented in 2003 for validation and approval, the   Air Force leadership did not approve this model for determining  manpower standards for its medical specialties because the models were  not based on objectively quantifiable data sources. Although the Air Force  considered any medical requirements developed using the model as  unverifiable, it allowed Air Force medical officials to continue to use the  models as a part of its requirements determination process. Currently,   Air Force medical officials use, in addition to the model, historical  workload, historical and like-size facility manning, industry models,  functional models, and statistical analysis of variance by facility to  generate their medical personnel requirements. The current requirements  development process can be performed using either a top-down or a  bottom-up approach. The top-down approach begins with Air Force  leadership, usually at the rank of general, determining that a military  treatment facility has a need for new requirements. The bottom-up  approach occurs when officials at a military treatment facility identify a  need for a new requirement and then work through the major commands  to change or alter its current requirements. The major commands then  work with the Air Force Medical Operations Agency to bring a request for  new or changed requirements to the Air Force Surgeon General. The new  or changed requirements undergo a vetting process that ranges from the  military treatment facility to the Chief of Staff before they are approved.  Any changes to requirements are based on identified need as experts in  functional areas obtain new data or refined standards.", "To establish the feasibility of providing a verifiable means of medical  manpower standards development support to the Air Force medical  community, the Air Force Medical Service and the Air Force Manpower  Agency signed a Memorandum of Agreement whereby the Air Force  Manpower Agency will develop new manpower standards for all Air Force  medical specialties, based on data that have been collected for each.  According to officials, this effort began in January 2010, and they hope to  have completed developing all of the manpower standards by 2015.   In order to do so, the Air Force Manpower Agency is planning to hire   15 officials\u201410 civilians and 5 military\u2014to research, develop, and validate  the new manpower standards. This effort will include such tasks as  developing the data collection approach, performing the analysis on all   of the data, developing the manpower models, and identifying process  improvement opportunities.", "Air Force officials recognized that their recent efforts to develop medical  manpower standards stem from the Air Force\u2019s need for a validated and  verifiable manpower requirements determination process. With committed  and sustained leadership emphasis on maintaining validated medical  manpower models, the Air Force is in a similar position as the other  services in that it would be in a better position to know its true medical  needs by medical specialty and to be certain it is determining its medical  personnel requirements in a more effective and efficient manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Services Do Not Centrally Account for Civilian Personnel Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s efforts to determine its medical personnel requirements at military  treatment facilities are further limited by the fact that the services have  not fully incorporated into their requirements processes the use of  civilians who deliver health care at the same stage in the process where  they determine their military medical personnel requirements. A DOD  directive requires that, for areas employing both military and civilian  personnel, manpower requirements shall be determined in total and  designated as either military or civilian, but not both, as an active, reserve,  or civilian determination must be made for each requirement. The  Military Health System Human Capital Strategic Plan also asserts that  more efforts should be made to have the optimal mix of medical  personnel. However, while civilian personnel constitute about 20 percent  of the services\u2019 medical workforce, the services\u2019 current requirements  processes are generic in nature and do not differentiate positions as  military or civilian. We found that all three services first determine their  collective requirements. Then, at the local level, after all of the positions   at a military treatment facility are staffed with the available military  personnel, the commander of the local military treatment facility  determines whether a position will be designated as civilian or contractor.  In making determinations to use civilian personnel, local commanders use  several factors, such as whether the position is military essential\u2014to  support readiness or operational missions\u2014or inherently governmental\u2014 which would require the position be filled with a government employee.  Additionally, commanders consider financial resources and the availability  of civilian or contractor personnel in the local area. In technical comments  provided in response to a draft of this report, DOD officials disagreed with  our statement that the services do not centrally account for civilian  personnel requirements. DOD noted that workload generated by civilians  is captured and depicted in a centralized information management system.  However, based on the explanation of this system given by DOD, we note  that this system captures the number of civilian personnel already on  board and the areas in which they are employed. It does not identify the  number of civilian personnel needed and required by each service to meet  the missions of fixed military treatment facilities, nor does it centrally  account for civilian personnel requirements. In addition, several military  treatment facility personnel told us that more direction or centralized  guidance would aid them, in many cases, in their management of their  civilian personnel. DOD\u2019s 2009 update to its Civilian Human Capital  Strategic Plan lists global civilian end strength numbers for five mission  critical medical occupational series\u2014medical officers, nurses,  pharmacists, clinical psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers.  This update also gives projected accession and recruiting goals needed to  reach those global end strength numbers. However, the update does not  project any civilian end strength numbers at the medical specialty levels  within these occupational series nor does it indicate the military treatment  facilities at which these civilians are needed. If the services do not identify  civilian personnel requirements for military treatment facilities in the  overall requirements planning process, the services may be missing the  opportunity to make a strategic determination of how many medical  professionals\u2014military or civilian\u2014are needed in total to carry out their  expected missions and workloads. The services assume added risk if their  medical requirements are not completely met, and if the requirements are  unknown, the extent of that risk cannot be estimated. If risk is unknown,  the services cannot develop appropriate risk-mitigation strategies for their  unmet medical personnel requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To achieve a military health system that can respond to our country\u2019s  changing national security needs by using both the right numbers and the  right mix of forces, DOD has emphasized the need for collaboration   of efforts in the medical arena, and committed and sustained leadership  emphasis is key to successful collaboration. The efforts taken to date   by OSD and the services to develop and implement specific cross-service  manpower related programs have been a step in the right direction for  building a collaborative approach to determining military medical  personnel requirements. As such, it is important that the services continue  to focus on developing programs, solutions, and measures for managing  medical personnel requirements across the services and focus on the long- term, broader picture. By doing so, OSD and the services will have more  opportunities to create departmentwide benefits and would more fully  support the Military Health System\u2019s strategic planning goal of  collaboration. Also, as the services work toward a joint approach, it is  important for them to have sound medical personnel requirement  determination processes in place, to enable them to identify the personnel  numbers and mix they need to fully perform their medical missions. If the  services are to effectively and efficiently provide daily care to active duty  and retired servicemembers and their dependents in their fixed medical  facilities, it is important that each of their medical personnel requirement  processes reflects currency, validation, and verification. Areas of  improvement exist within the services\u2019 medical requirements processes,  and until these processes are up-to-date, fully validated, and verifiable, it is  not clear whether the services can be certain they are determining their  medical personnel requirements in an effective and efficient manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with DOD emphasis on developing human capital solutions  across the services to enable departmentwide decision making and  analyses within its Military Health System, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs and the Service Secretaries to take the following two actions.", "Identify the common medical capabilities that are shared across the  services in their military treatment facilities that would benefit from the  development of cross-service medical manpower standards; and    Where applicable, develop and implement cross-service medical  manpower standards for those common medical capabilities.", "To improve the Army\u2019s current medical personnel requirements  determination process, we recommend that the Secretary of the Army  direct the Army Surgeon General to take the following three actions.", "Update assumptions and other key data elements contained within  specialty modules of the Automated Staffing Assessment Model;    Develop and implement a definitive revalidation schedule for the specialty  modules of the Automated Staffing Assessment Model; and  Include its reliance on civilian medical personnel in its assumptions as it  updates and validates their medical personnel requirements determination  modules.", "To improve the Navy\u2019s current medical personnel requirements  determination process, we recommend that the Secretary of the Navy  direct the Navy Surgeon General to take the following two actions.", "Develop a validated and verifiable process to determine its medical  manpower requirements; and  Include its reliance on civilian medical personnel in its assumptions as it  develops, and then validates, its medical personnel requirements  determination model.", "To improve the Air Force\u2019s current medical personnel requirements  determination process, we recommend that the Secretary of the Air Force  direct the Air Force Surgeon General to take the following two actions.", "Develop a validated and verifiable process to determine its medical  manpower requirements; and  Include its reliance on civilian medical personnel in its assumptions as it  develops, and then validates, its medical personnel requirements  determination model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments provided in response to a draft of this report,   DOD concurred or partially concurred with all of our recommendations.

Further, DOD noted that the Navy Surgeon General has always  taken and will continue to emphasize a total force approach in future  planning and programming for medical personnel.

We note   the potential of this effort as a strong step toward fulfilling this  recommendation. Further, DOD noted that the new Air Force manpower  standards will include the identification of civilian equivalents for those  positions not deemed military essential, and that civilian requirements are  also reviewed and determined through the Inherently Governmental /  Commercial Activity process. We agree that Air Force\u2019s new medical  requirements determination standards, to include civilians, will have the  potential to address the intent of our recommendation. The Inherently  Governmental / Commercial Activity process, however, does not  completely address the need to delineate military versus civilian personnel  requirements during the requirements determination process as our  recommendation suggests and as called for in DOD Directive 1100.4.", "Additionally, one of DOD\u2019s technical comments concerns our  recommendations regarding the services\u2019 need to include their reliance   on civilian medical personnel in their assumptions when developing and  validating their medical personnel requirements determination models. In  this technical comment, DOD suggested that we delete the section of our  report headed by the statement \u201cThe Services Do Not Centrally Account  for Civilian Personnel Requirements.\u201d DOD noted that all three services  use a reporting system that captures and depicts workload generated by  civilians in a centralized information management system.
