An estimated $1.9 billion of this total was improper payments--including overpayments or underpayments that may be due to errors, such as the submission of duplicate claims for the same service. In January 2011, CMS began a RAC program in Part D that was intended in part to identify and recoup improper payments, as required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The RAC is paid a contingency fee from amounts recovered.", "GAO was asked to review CMS's Part D RAC program implementation, oversight, and results. GAO examined (1) how CMS has implemented the Part D RAC program and any challenges it faced during implementation; (2) the extent to which CMS has overseen the RAC's audit activities; and (3) the results of the RAC's work to date and any challenges CMS and the RAC faced in identifying and collecting improper payments. To do this, GAO analyzed the RAC contract and audit documents, and federal statutes and regulations on Part D and federal contracting. GAO also interviewed CMS and RAC officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implemented the Part D recovery audit contractor (RAC) program in January 2011 by undertaking various activities, including establishing a statement of objectives and conducting a solicitation process to select a RAC to identify improper payments. However, CMS's challenges in setting expectations about the work the Part D RAC would conduct and establishing the length of time required for CMS and the RAC to reach project milestones hampered Part D RAC program implementation. Consistent with federal contracting requirements, agencies should clearly define requirements for services. As a result of CMS's challenges in setting expectations and establishing realistic timelines as it implemented the RAC program, the RAC did not have a clear understanding about the work it should perform, and CMS recovered improper payments for Part D more than a year after it had projected.", "As of May 2015, CMS had not completed any annual evaluations of the Part D RAC, but an initial evaluation of the RAC's contract year 2014 performance was in progress, and the agency had conducted other oversight of the RAC's performance. Federal internal controls and contracting standards and GAO's prior work contain requirements and suggestions for conducting regular performance evaluations and developing performance measures. In March 2015, CMS officials acknowledged that the agency should have completed annual evaluations and noted that CMS has been behind schedule in conducting evaluations of some its contractors, including the RAC. In May 2015, CMS officials finished the initial evaluation of the RAC's 2014 performance and provided the evaluation to the RAC for review and comment. An annual performance evaluation would provide CMS with a clear basis for assessing RAC performance in identifying improper payments and provide the RAC with targets against which the RAC could compare its performance. While CMS has not completed annual evaluations, it has established quality assurance procedures to conduct oversight of the RAC. For example, CMS uses a separate contractor to review and validate 100 percent of the RAC's audit findings, in part because of concerns about the quality of the RAC's work.", "As of May 2015, CMS had collected less than $10 million in improper payments, and had not approved the RAC to perform new audit work since March 2014. Both CMS and the RAC are charged with reducing Medicare Part D improper payments, and federal internal control standards call for agencies to have effective and efficient processes to meet agency goals. However, as a result of CMS's and the RAC's challenges in determining audit work to conduct and the RAC's challenges in developing audit methodologies, CMS has approved 1 of the 15 audit proposals from the RAC since the beginning of the contract in 2011 and has collected a limited amount of improper payments relative to the estimated $1.9 billion in improper payments in Part D in 2014. With a more effective and efficient process for identifying, reviewing, and approving appropriate new audit work, more audit work would likely have been approved each year of the RAC contract, resulting in more improper payments being identified and collected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["As CMS prepares to solicit the next RAC contract(s), CMS should set clear expectations in contract work statements, conduct annual RAC performance evaluations, and review the process for developing new audit issues.

Improper  payments include overpayments or underpayments that may be due to  errors, such as the inadvertent submission of duplicate claims for the  same service. Since billions of dollars are estimated to be paid in error  annually, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that  is responsible for managing and overseeing the Part D program, conducts  a number of activities to address improper payments, including post- payment reviews of claims potentially paid in error. The Tax Relief and  Health Care Act of 2006 required CMS to implement a national Medicare  recovery audit contractor (RAC) program in Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service  programs to increase efforts to identify and recoup improper payments.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) expanded the  RAC program to Part D, and required CMS to enter into a Part D RAC  contract by December 31, 2010, among other things.

Although using the Federal Supply Schedule  limited the number of potential contractors that could respond to CMS\u2019s  solicitation and from which CMS could choose, CMS officials said the  agency chose this solicitation method because it was a streamlined  approach to generate interest from contractors already approved to work  for the federal government. According to CMS officials, CMS received two  proposals from potential contractors, and only one of them was found to  be technically acceptable. CMS officials said that they reviewed the  potential contractors\u2019 performance work statement and assessed their  experience with Medicare Part D and knowledge of Medicare Part D  statutes and regulations, along with other qualifications. CMS selected  the only contractor whose proposal, including its performance work  statement, the agency considered technically acceptable. While this  contractor did not have any previous federal experience, CMS determined  that its recovery audit experience in the private sector was sufficient. In  January 2011, when CMS awarded a contract to the contractor selected  to serve as the Part D RAC, the contractor\u2019s performance work statement  became part of the contract. As such, the performance work statement  established requirements and set expectations for the work the RAC  would perform and how the work would be conducted.", "The RAC\u2019s initial contract period was for 1 base year with four 1-year  options for extension, although CMS extended the base period of the  contract eight times over a 2-year period through contract modifications.

CMS\u2019s expectations for the work the RAC would perform  were unclear because although CMS incorporated the terms of work set  out in the performance work statement into the RAC\u2019s contract without  making any changes to the performance work statement, CMS later  proposed audit work for the RAC to pursue that differed from the work  described in the performance work statement. For example, the initial  RAC audit process outlined in the performance work statement broadly  focused on reviews of all PDE records to eliminate duplicate payments, to  validate the accuracy of information in required PDE data fields and edit  checks, and to validate the information in direct and indirect remuneration  reports and PDE records by comparing it to additional documentation  received from the plan sponsors. However, CMS officials proposed that  the RAC focus its initial audit work only on providers that were excluded  from the Medicare program yet had written or filled prescriptions that were  paid for by CMS, and this became part of a contract modification in  February 2012.

For example, after CMS  selected the initial audit work the RAC would conduct, CMS required the  RAC to obtain CMS approval before it began work on subsequent audits.  CMS also required a data validation contractor to review and validate the  RAC audit findings. However, these steps were not included in the  processes outlined in the performance work statement, and a senior  official with the RAC said the RAC did not learn that CMS had adopted  processes that required these steps until the end of the first contract year.  The senior official with the RAC said the additional steps significantly  lengthened the time it took to select audit topics and conduct audits, and  reduced the number of audits the RAC was able to perform.", "CMS officials said they proposed that the RAC perform work and follow  processes that were not in the performance work statement because they  recognized during the first year of the contract that the RAC had less  expertise in Medicare Part D regulations and the Part D benefit than was  necessary. For example, CMS officials said that the RAC required  significant assistance in developing its audit methodology because it  lacked staff with adequate knowledge of Medicare Part D. According to  these officials, in some cases it was necessary for CMS to develop audit  methodology on the RAC\u2019s behalf, and in other cases, CMS needed to  revise the RAC\u2019s methodology to eliminate numerous false positives\u2014 payments that the RAC incorrectly determined were overpayments\u2014 identified by the data validation contractor.

This statement of work included  the processes that the RAC should follow to obtain CMS approval for new  audit topics and to conduct audits. CMS sent the Part D RAC the initial  draft statement of work in December 2011, but it was not finalized until   2 years later in December 2013. CMS officials said that prior to finalizing  the statement of work, CMS provided guidance to the RAC about its  expectations for the work the RAC was to perform through contract  modifications.

The Part D RAC contract and implementation timeline,  which CMS reviewed, did not adequately reflect the time needed to meet  certain goals. (See fig. 2 for a comparison of the projected and actual  timelines of key implementation activities.) For example, the RAC was  required to ensure its information technology systems comply with the  agency\u2019s information system security guidelines before CMS would grant  it the authority to operate. The implementation timeline projected that the  RAC would receive its authority to operate within 3 months of the contract  award. However, the RAC did not receive its authority to operate until  about 8 months after the contract was awarded. CMS officials told us that  it typically takes up to a year for a new contractor to obtain its authority to  operate.", "Furthermore, CMS did not begin collecting improper payments and the  Part D RAC did not begin receiving contingency fees until more than a  year after projected in the 2011 Part D RAC contract. The Part D RAC  contract projected CMS would collect improper payments and the RAC  receive contingency fees by January 2012, the end of the original base  period of the contract. Instead, CMS began collecting improper payments  more than 1 year later, in February 2013. The RAC did not begin  receiving contingency fees until April 2013, 16 months later than  projected. The RAC was required to cover its operating expenses until  audits could begin, but a RAC official said that the RAC had not expected  the projected implementation deadlines to be incorrect by more than a  year. In response to concerns RAC officials raised about expenses the  RAC incurred during perceived delays in receiving contingency fees,  CMS officials said they made several modifications to the Part D RAC  contract. For example, CMS waived key personnel requirements and  extended the base period of the contract eight times.", "Since CMS faced challenges setting expectations about the work the   Part D RAC would conduct and about the length of time required for CMS  and the RAC to reach implementation milestones for the Part D RAC  program, the RAC did not have a clear understanding about the work it  should perform, and CMS did not recover improper payments for Part D  until a year later than projected.

A data validation contractor reviews the RAC\u2019s findings, and  with the RAC, it resolves any discrepancies that were found between the  review results and the RAC\u2019s initial findings. CMS officials said that the  data validation contractor reviews 100 percent of the RAC\u2019s findings, in  part because of concerns CMS had about the quality of the RAC\u2019s initial  audit work.", "In addition to this ongoing oversight, in June 2014 CMS sent the RAC a  letter titled \u201cAreas of Concern for the RAC Part D Contract\u201d to inform the  RAC of concerns CMS program staff had about the overall performance  of the contract. In the letter, CMS cited the quality assurance procedures  in the statement of work as the source of its performance expectations for  the RAC. CMS identified the following concerns about the RAC\u2019s audit  work:  Incorrect templates and materials being used by the RAC to  communicate with plan sponsors;", "Quality issues with identifying potential improper payments and  preparing documents for data validation during audit work; and", "Formatting errors and erroneous information in letters to be sent to  plan sponsors.", "While the RAC acknowledged that some of the concerns were valid, the  RAC also disagreed with other concerns CMS raised. The RAC  acknowledged that among other things, concerns CMS raised about  some of the formatting errors and erroneous information were valid.  However, the RAC rebutted some of CMS\u2019s concerns. For example, the  RAC noted that there was no measurable target for evaluating the RAC\u2019s  performance for one issue CMS raised. Specifically, CMS stated in the  \u201cAreas of Concern\u201d letter that the agency had identified about 14,000  PDE records that the RAC had incorrectly determined to be potential  improper payments, but did not state what would be an appropriate error  rate. Since CMS did not set a maximum acceptable error rate, the RAC  did not have an established target against which it could measure its  work, and CMS did not have an established target with which to compare  the RAC\u2019s performance. Without performance standards with targets,  CMS is unable to adequately assess the quality of the RAC\u2019s  performance in determining improper payments.", "The RAC also noted in its response to CMS\u2019s Areas of Concern letter that  CMS was assessing the RAC\u2019s performance on some of its audit work\u2014 identifying potential improper payments for excluded providers\u2014using  expectations that were not in place at the time the RAC was conducting  the work. CMS stated in the second letter replying to the RAC\u2019s response  that while it understood that the performance expectations referenced in  the Areas of Concern letter were not directly in effect when the RAC was  conducting the audit work, CMS\u2019s expectation was that all contractors  would implement and maintain a standard of quality control at all times  during their period of performance. When asked about the fact that  performance expectations were established after the RAC\u2019s audit work  was conducted, CMS officials told us that these concerns stemmed from  expectations originally set in contract modifications and later formalized in  the statement of work. However, our analysis of the contract modifications  in place at the time of the RAC\u2019s work under question did not find contract  language indicating how the RAC\u2019s performance would be evaluated, or  measurable targets establishing a standard of quality control."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Collected Less than $10 Million in Improper Payments as of May 2015, in Part Because of Challenges in Determining and Conducting Audit Activities", "paragraphs": ["From January 2011 through May 2015, for five audit issues, CMS both  authorized the RAC to conduct audit activities and pursued improper  payment collections. Audit issues include two elements: (1) areas within  the Part D program that should be considered for audits; and (2) the year  or years for which PDE records are being audited. The five audit issues  CMS approved addressed three types of issues: (1) excluded providers,  (2) unauthorized prescribers, and (3) inappropriate refills of certain  drugs regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration under the  Controlled Substances Act.", "CMS had collected less than $10 million in improper payments as of May  2015 for the five approved audit issues. CMS authorized the RAC to  conduct audit activities that identified about $19.8 million in potential  improper payments, and has collected about $9.7 million as of May 2015.  Of the remaining approximately $10.1 million, $7.3 million in potential improper payments has been determined to  be proper, for example, because the plan sponsor provided additional  information verifying the amount of the Part D claim; $45,000 in potential improper payments has been identified as being  uncollectible for various reasons, such as the plan sponsor\u2019s contract  was terminated before audit activity took place; and $2.8 million in improper payments remain that have not yet been  collected, not yet determined to be proper, or not yet identified as  being uncollectible. (See table 1 for each of the five approved audit  issues for which CMS pursued collections, the amount CMS approved  for the RAC to conduct audit activities, and the status of potential  improper payments identified.)", "From the beginning of the contract in January 2011 until the statement of  work became effective on January 1, 2014, CMS and the RAC faced  challenges in determining audit issues on which to conduct work. As  noted above, CMS did not initially authorize the RAC to begin conducting  the audit work that the RAC had proposed and outlined in the  performance work statement that became part of the contract. Instead,  the first audit issue CMS approved the RAC to conduct was an audit of  excluded providers for plan year 2007, which CMS suggested and which  was included in a contract modification in February 2012. By the time the  statement of work became effective on January 1, 2014, CMS had  suggested that the RAC conduct audit work on three audit issues:  excluded providers for plan year 2007, excluded providers for plan years  2008 through 2011, and unauthorized prescribers for plan years 2009  through 2011. During that same time, CMS denied four of the six audit  issues the RAC proposed. Of the remaining two audit issues, CMS later  denied one issue and approved the other. CMS denied issues for  various reasons; for example, one audit issue was denied because the  improper payments identified were outside the 4-year period prior to a  plan sponsor\u2019s current plan year, which is the time limit for identifying  improper payments.", "After CMS and the RAC agreed to a new process for identifying,  reviewing, and approving audit issues, which became effective on  January 1, 2014, the RAC faced challenges in applying Part D regulations  and CMS rules to develop audit methodologies. The statement of work  CMS and the RAC agreed to included a new process by which the RAC  would submit new audit issues for CMS\u2019s consideration. Figure 3 outlines  the process the RAC and CMS follow to submit, evaluate, and decide on  new audit issues. Under this process, CMS officials said, under some  circumstances the RAC can resubmit an audit issue for a particular plan  year once it has been denied. For example, CMS may deny the  methodology the RAC used and ask the RAC to resubmit the audit issue  using a different audit methodology.", "Since the new process took effect, the RAC has faced challenges in  applying regulations and CMS rules to audit methodologies, resulting in  CMS denials. For example,", "CMS denied the RAC\u2019s proposal to audit hospice care beneficiaries\u2019  PDE records because CMS guidance published in March 2014,   3 days after the RAC made the proposal, prevents CMS from  performing hospice audits associated with Medicare Part D potential  improper payments prior to May 1, 2014. CMS noted in its denial  that a retrospective audit would not be pursued at the time because  previous CMS guidance was ambiguous and there were no objective  criteria for plan sponsors to apply in determining whether the  beneficiaries were eligible for Medicare Part D.", "CMS denied the RAC\u2019s proposal to audit deactivated prescribers in  plan years 2010 through 2012 in part because the RAC\u2019s audit  methodology included using a field in the PDE record that plan  sponsors were not required to submit until January 1, 2013.", "CMS officials said they provide the RAC with assistance in developing  audit issues; nevertheless, CMS has not approved any audit issues  submitted since the new process took effect. CMS officials said they hold  regular phone conversations between the RAC and program officials with  subject matter expertise from several CMS program offices, and provide  feedback to the RAC after an audit issue is submitted. However, since the  new process took effect in January 2014, the RAC has proposed nine  audit issues, and CMS has not approved any of them. (See table 2 for  each of the nine denied audit issues.)", "Challenges faced by CMS and the RAC have resulted in few audit issues  being approved and therefore a small amount of improper payments  being identified and collected relative to CMS\u2019s estimates of improper  payments in Medicare Part D. In more than 4 years, initial CMS and RAC  challenges in determining the audit work to conduct and later RAC  challenges in determining how to apply regulations and rules to audit  issues have resulted in CMS\u2019s approving 1 of the 15 audit issues the RAC  proposed, and no approvals for issues submitted since the new audit  issue process took effect. The RAC can only resubmit an audit issue  under some circumstances, once it has been denied, so a denial not only  results in lost time and effort, but also may result in a lost opportunity to  identify and collect potential improper payments. In addition, the RAC  may only identify potential improper payments on PDE records within   4 years of the plan sponsor\u2019s current plan year. Therefore, as each year  passes, another prior plan year can no longer be audited by the RAC.", "Both CMS and the RAC are charged with reducing Medicare Part D  improper payments. CMS has a goal to reduce improper payments in  Medicare Part D, according to the fiscal year 2016 Annual Performance  Plan and Report. The RAC\u2019s mission is to reduce Medicare improper  payments through the efficient detection and collection of improper  payments, using a methodology that maximizes recoveries as well as  meets all regulatory requirements, according to CMS\u2019s statement of  objectives for the RAC. In addition, federal internal control standards state  that agencies should have effective and efficient processes in place that  enforce management\u2019s directives and that these processes are  monitored. The $9.7 million in improper payments that CMS has collected  since 2011 is a relatively small amount compared to CMS\u2019s estimated  improper payments in Medicare Part D of $1.9 billion in 2014 alone. If the  process for identifying, reviewing, and approving new audit issues was  more efficient in developing appropriate issues, the process would likely  have resulted in more issues being approved each year of the RAC  contract and more improper payments being identified and collected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given Medicare\u2019s vulnerability to improper payments, it is important to  develop a RAC program that effectively identifies and recovers those  improper payments. The effectiveness of the RAC program, which began  in January 2011, has been hindered by various challenges faced by both  CMS and the RAC that resulted in relatively little in improper payment  collections. The first RAC contract is ending on December 31, 2015, and  CMS is contemplating how to solicit contractors for the next RAC  contract. Among CMS\u2019s considerations is obtaining RAC services on the  open market using a full and open competitive solicitation. As CMS  considers its upcoming solicitation for the next contract period, it has an  opportunity to address the challenges it and the RAC faced during the  first contract. Establishing clear work statements, realistic timelines, and  an improved process for identifying, reviewing, and approving audit  issues would provide more assurance that audit work can be conducted  more effectively and efficiently through the next RAC contract.  Additionally, conducting annual performance evaluations against  measurable targets would allow CMS to regularly assess the  effectiveness of a RAC contractor and identify and address any areas for  improvement.
