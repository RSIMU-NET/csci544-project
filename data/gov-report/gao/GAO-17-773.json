Beyond the FYNSP  planning period, the subprogram has an estimated completion date of  fiscal year 2033 for a second component\u2014U.S reactor conversions\u2014 and has developed a schedule for completion of the component. For  the third subprogram component\u2014international reactor conversions\u2014 the subprogram estimates a fiscal year 2035 completion date for its  remaining work scope to convert or verify the shutdown of 44  international reactors, but it had not developed a complete schedule  to meet that date. Specifically, the subprogram\u2019s schedule was not up- to-date for 22 of the 44 international reactors in the subprogram\u2019s  planned work scope to support the estimated fiscal year 2035  completion date for these reactors. Instead, in the subprogram\u2019s  schedule, these reactors had estimated completion dates by fiscal  year 2030. NNSA officials explained that the schedule was not up-to- date for these reactors because the reactors are in countries where  the subprogram cannot currently plan or implement the conversions  due to limitations in cooperation with these countries. For example,  DNN cannot plan the schedule for conversion of reactors in Russia  that are in the subprogram\u2019s scope until the United States and Russia  resume joint nuclear security activities that the United States  discontinued following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

For the third  component\u2014international reactor conversions\u2014the subprogram only  estimated costs for the 5-year FYNSP, not through the estimated  completion date for the component of fiscal year 2035. According to  NNSA officials, developing a cost estimate that includes all remaining  international reactor conversions through 2035 would be challenging  because the costs for these projects are highly uncertain and vary  depending on the willingness of each country to cooperate as well as  the unique technical, regulatory, and other factors that vary for each  reactor in each country.

Specifically, for two of the three subprogram components\u2014 radiological source removal and nonradioisotopic technologies\u2014the  subprogram has not established specific work scope and schedules  beyond fiscal year 2021 because of uncertainty about the future. For  example, according to the subprogram\u2019s director, planning the  adoption of nonradioisotopic technologies is uncertain because the  timing of when such technologies can be adopted depends, in part, on  regulations and international laws, making it challenging for the  subprogram to define the scope of work.

As mentioned  above, without such estimates, the subprograms do not have the baseline  information they need to track their performance. According to leading  practices, developing reliable schedule and cost estimates can be  achieved by following steps that address data limitations and risks and  uncertainties for a program. For example, according to the GAO schedule  guide, a reliable schedule should reflect all of a program\u2019s activities and  recognize that uncertainties and unknown factors in schedule estimates  can stem from, among other things, data limitations. In addition,  according to the GAO cost guide, the cost-estimating process involves  defining and documenting assumptions that are tailored to the specific  program, such as about the program\u2019s life-cycle phases, political issues,  or technology development. Assumptions should be based on historical  data to minimize uncertainty and risk. These same assumptions should  also be used to develop the program schedule. For management to make  good decisions, the program estimate must reflect the degree of  uncertainty so that a level of confidence can be given about the  estimate. Accordingly, because assumptions defined for a particular  program\u2019s schedule and cost estimate can vary, they should always be  inputs to the program\u2019s risk analyses of cost and schedule.", "Programs use different methods to quantify uncertainty and risk in  developing a schedule or cost estimate. DOE\u2019s cost estimating guide  describes approaches for programs to incorporate risk and uncertainty in  cost estimates such as the use of lower- and upper-bound cost ranges  that are developed based on risk analysis. Other NNSA programs use  these approaches in developing schedule and cost estimates for highly  uncertain, long-term program plans. In particular, NNSA\u2019s Office of  Defense Programs develops and reports high- and low-range cost  estimates for elements of NNSA\u2019s nuclear weapons modernization  programs in part to account for the uncertainty in these long-term  program estimates. As mentioned above, such estimates would provide  NNSA managers and other stakeholders information to help evaluate  resources and compare the costs and benefits of different programs and  priorities. Because the selected subprograms do not measure their overall  schedule and cost performance against baselines, NNSA managers,  stakeholders, and Congress have incomplete information about these  subprograms\u2019 actual-versus-planned schedule and cost performance over  their duration and are, therefore, at risk of being unable to assess when a  subprogram is likely to be completed or whether it will cost more or less  than planned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DNN\u2019s Program Management Policy Includes Some Leading Practices, but Does Not Address Life-Cycle Schedule and Cost Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DNN\u2019s Revised Policy Includes Leading Practices on Risk and Quality Management", "paragraphs": ["DNN\u2019s 2017 revised policy includes new sections that address leading  practices on risk and quality management that all DNN programs and  subprograms should follow.

In addition, NNSA officials said that they added the  continual improvement section to the revised policy after reviewing PMI\u2019s  practices on quality assurance, which they believed would clarify  responsibilities regarding management assessments and independent  reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Revised DNN Policy Does Not Include Leading Practices on Life-Cycle Schedule and Cost Management", "paragraphs": ["The revised DNN policy does not address or require leading practices on  life-cycle schedule and cost management for DNN programs or  subprograms. Specifically, the revised policy does not outline  requirements for programs or subprograms to establish life-cycle cost  estimates or measure performance against schedule or cost baselines.  Instead, the revised policy provides requirements on schedule and cost  management limited to the NNSA budgeting process covering the 5-year FYNSP. For example, according to the revised DNN policy, programs and  subprograms must conduct program management activities, such as  budget formulation, in alignment with anticipated resources in the FYNSP.  Additionally, the policy requires programs and subprograms to establish  performance measurement data and track cost or schedule performance,  but only within the FYNSP.", "According to leading practices, life-cycle management is important to  program management and includes schedule and cost management  activities that span the duration of the program. According to PMI, all  programs, regardless of length, have life cycles; furthermore, leading  practices indicate that activities related to managing the schedule, cost,  and scope of a program should be conducted for the life of the program.  For example, leading practices call for calculating cost estimates as close  to the beginning of a work effort as possible that consider the full program  life cycle, and then documenting this baseline to measure performance.", "According to NNSA officials, the revised DNN policy does not include  requirements to practice life-cycle management, including life-cycle  schedule and cost management, because officials determined that life- cycle management did not apply to some DNN programs that NNSA  officials believe are enduring or continuous. For example, as mentioned  above, the director of the International Nuclear Security subprogram said  that the subprogram will phase out of certain areas or reduce  engagement with certain countries in the future but that it is expected to  continue as long as nuclear materials exist and will work to improve  security in countries possessing such materials.", "We disagree that life-cycle program management does not apply to  programs or subprograms that may have an enduring mission. Managers  need to make informed decisions about whether a program is affordable  within the agency\u2019s portfolio. NNSA and DNN should be able to compare  DNN\u2019s various programs\u2019 requirements several years beyond its 5-year  planning period. According to the GAO cost guide, in developing  estimates, programs should define assumptions tailored to the program,  such as assumptions about the program\u2019s life-cycle phases. For example,  the International Nuclear Security subprogram could take steps to define  end-point targets for when it may phase out work in certain areas or  countries in the future. In addition, according to the GAO schedule guide,  a comprehensive schedule should reflect all of a program\u2019s activities and  recognize that uncertainties and unknown factors in schedule estimates  can stem from, among other things, data limitations. Moreover, because  assumptions themselves can vary, they should always be inputs to  program risk analyses of cost and schedule.", "According to NNSA officials, although the revised policy does not include  requirements for life-cycle cost estimating, DNN programs could address  this in their individual program management plans. NNSA officials stated  that these program management plans for programs and subprograms  should be detailed enough to also provide information on how the  program will track progress, including by identifying changes to the  planned schedule.", "However, the revised DNN policy does not clearly require DNN programs  or subprograms to have program management plans, nor does it specify  elements of such plans. Specifically, the revised DNN policy requires  each program to develop \u201cprogram management documentation\u201d that  identifies program scope, schedule, and cost during the fiscal year and  operating procedures for the fiscal year, but it does not outline similar  requirements for the program\u2019s life cycle. In addition, the revised policy  does not specify requirements or guidance, such as on cost estimation,  for what programs or subprograms are to include in the program  management documentation. In contrast, PMI indicates that programs  should develop a program management plan that includes plans for  program financial management, schedule management, and scope  management for all phases of the program\u2019s life cycle. According to  NNSA officials, the revised DNN policy is the only directive or  documentation that spells out what is needed or required to be included in  a program management plan.", "Although the revised DNN policy does not clearly require DNN programs  or subprograms to have program management plans, some DNN  programs have developed or are developing such plans. For example, the  Global Material Security program, which oversees the Radiological Security and International Nuclear Security subprograms, issued a new  program management plan in April 2017. The Global Material Security  program management plan requires that each subprogram maintain a 5- year budget for the FYNSP with cost estimates, but it does not require or  provide guidance on developing life-cycle schedule or cost estimates.  NNSA officials said that DNN underwent a major reorganization of its  programs in January 2015, and some of the new program offices are still  preparing their program management plans. For example, the Material  Management and Minimization program that oversees the Nuclear  Material Removal and HEU Reactor Conversion subprograms is still  developing its program management plan, according to NNSA officials.", "In addition, the four selected subprograms had various documented  plans, but none fully addressed life-cycle schedule and cost  management.", "Nuclear Material Removal. The subprogram did not have a current  program management plan that had been updated since the 2015  reorganization of DNN but instead relied on an older plan that covered  a different scope than the scope of the current subprogram.", "HEU Reactor Conversion. The subprogram did not have a program  management plan for the overall subprogram. Instead, the  subprogram had project execution plans for its U.S. reactor  conversion projects and its Mo99 projects and relied on an outdated  document for its international reactor conversion projects.", "Radiological Security. The subprogram had a program management  plan that included requirements for the use of project life-cycle  baselines and for conducting cost estimation for the 5-year FYNSP.  However, the plan had no requirement for developing a cost estimate  for the life cycle of the subprogram and for using such an estimate to  measure performance of the overall subprogram.", "International Nuclear Security. The subprogram had a program  management plan that required cost estimating for 1 fiscal year.  However, the plan did not include requirements for life-cycle estimates  and for using initial or updated baselines to measure performance.", "NNSA subprogram officials said that they do not have readily available  life-cycle cost estimates and baseline measurement data in part because  they are not asked to provide it. For example, NNSA officials from the  HEU Reactor Conversion subprogram said that they did not have  sufficient staff to track performance against initial baselines because it  was not a priority for management, although it would be possible to do so  if required. One of the stated goals of the revised DNN policy is to  facilitate DNN-wide implementation of methods for programs and  subprograms to monitor, measure, and improve management processes.  However, because the policy does not require more complete information  from DNN programs and subprograms on their cost, schedule, and  performance against baselines\u2014consistent with leading practices\u2014it is  not clear that this policy goal can be achieved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When organizations apply leading program management practices\u2014such  as establishing schedules and cost estimates covering their planned life  cycles and measuring performance against such baselines\u2014they may be  able to enhance their chances of achieving success across a range of  programs. However, the four selected DNN subprograms are generally  not applying these selected leading practices for life-cycle program  schedule and cost management, due in part to the uncertainty and risks  in working with international partners. However, methods and approaches  exist that allow programs to account for uncertainty and risk in developing  schedule and cost estimates for their planned scope of work.  Furthermore, while the revised DNN program management policy has  incorporated some leading practices, it does not include requirements  and guidance for DNN programs and subprograms to practice life-cycle  schedule and cost estimating and does not require program management  plans that could be the vehicle for DNN programs and subprograms to  specify the use of such estimates. Updating the DNN program  management policy to include requirements for DNN programs and  subprograms to follow leading practices for life-cycle program  management would help NNSA ensure that managers, stakeholders, and  Congress have better information on how much DNN programs and  subprograms may cost to achieve their goals, the amount of time they  may need to achieve these goals, and how efficiently and effectively they  are actually being executed compared to plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The NNSA Deputy Administrator for DNN should revise the DNN program  management policy to require DNN programs and subprograms to follow  life-cycle program management.

In written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in  appendix IV, NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation to revise the DNN program management policy to  require DNN programs and subprograms to follow life-cycle program  management. However, NNSA stated that it plans to take action in  response to the recommendation.", "In general, NNSA stated that DNN will update its program management  policy to formally document current practice and clarify expectations for  addressing uncertainty. Specifically, NNSA said it will update the policy  to: (1) reflect that life-cycle cost and schedule management should be  applied at the project or subprogram level where appropriate, considering  the extent of uncertainty impacting scope, potential timelines, and  executability; (2) define the methodologies to (a) account for uncertainties  where applying these techniques would result in a reasonable range of  estimates that would be useful for planning and scheduling purposes or  (b) document risk and track actions to reduce uncertainty where  applicable; (3) address expectations for assessing cost and schedule  performance, commensurate with the level of certainty present at  baselining; and (4) address requirements for documenting program  management plans.", "Although we acknowledge NNSA\u2019s plan to update its policy, we have  concerns regarding whether its proposed actions will ensure that DNN  programs and subprograms effectively follow leading practices for life- cycle schedule and cost management in the future. First, we do not  believe that updating the DNN program management policy to formally  document current program management practice addresses our  recommendation. NNSA\u2019s response suggests that its update to the policy  is intended to reflect current DNN program management practices rather  than signal a need for corrective action to address the DNN program  management limitations we identified. Specifically, as we stated in our  report, none of the four subprograms we reviewed had schedule and cost  estimates that encompassed the entire life cycle, although one  subprogram planned to develop such estimates for its recently-extended  life cycle. In addition, NNSA\u2019s proposed update to the DNN program  management policy to reflect life-cycle schedule and cost management  \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d is vague, and may give programs and subprograms  too much discretion to avoid the requirement. To have an effective  requirement on life-cycle program management and to be responsive to  our recommendation, NNSA will need to clearly define the criteria for  when a program should be exempt from a requirement to follow life-cycle  program management.", "Finally, the meaning of NNSA\u2019s proposed update to the policy to address  expectations for assessing cost and schedule performance,  commensurate with the level of certainty present at baselining is unclear.  Specifically, it is unclear whether NNSA plans to require that DNN  subprograms use cost and schedule baselines to measure performance,  or whether it plans to exempt programs or subprograms from such  practices based on unstated expectations. As we stated in our report,  none of the subprograms we reviewed measured their overall schedule  and cost performance against baseline estimates. To ensure that DNN  subprograms take steps to measure schedule and cost performance  against baselines and to be responsive to our recommendation, NNSA  will need to define clear expectations for DNN programs and  subprograms to follow.", "NNSA also provided general comments in its written comments regarding  DNN program management.", "First, NNSA commented that DNN currently implements elements of life- cycle program management where appropriate and reasonable. However,  according to NNSA, the majority of its international activities operate with  an unusually high level of uncertainty regarding potential international  cooperation and with limited information on international operations to  understand the scope of work required to support useful planning and  estimating. In NNSA\u2019s view, the high uncertainty would result in range  estimates so broad as to serve no useful purpose, and there is no  appreciable cost-benefit to expending resources on such calculations.", "We recognize that organizations need flexibility to determine when it is  appropriate and useful to apply leading practices on life-cycle program  management. However, as noted in our report, managers need to make  informed decisions about whether a program is affordable within the  agency\u2019s portfolio. Without more complete schedule and cost information  on DNN subprograms, NNSA managers and other stakeholders have  degraded information on the elements of DNN\u2019s portfolio, which may limit  their ability to assess and justify the affordability of long-term plans. If  NNSA believes that some of DNN\u2019s planned international work scope is  too uncertain for subprograms to develop estimates of schedule and cost  that cover their life cycles, then NNSA should evaluate whether it is  appropriate to identify such work scope in DNN\u2019s long-term plans at all.", "Second, NNSA commented that no specific requirement exists for DNN  programs and subprograms to implement life-cycle cost estimates, and  that DNN complies with current requirements. NNSA also commented  that the proper application of leading practices recognizes that cost- benefits, as well as the potential usefulness and reliability of estimates,  are important considerations. In instances in which uncertainty is  extremely high, NNSA stated that focus shifts to disclosure of risks, and  the establishment and tracking of actions to reduce the level of  uncertainty. According to NNSA\u2019s comments, DNN discloses risks and  tracks actions to reduce the level of uncertainty extensively, and this was  reflected in the most recent update to the DNN program management  policy with the addition of a new section on risk management. NNSA also  stated that as uncertainty is reduced, then other principles can be applied  where appropriate.", "We stated in our report that no specific requirement exists for DNN  programs and subprograms to implement life-cycle cost estimates.  Specifically, we noted that the DNN policy required that program  management functions be conducted over the 5-year FYNSP. Therefore,  we agree that the DNN subprograms we chose to review complied with  current requirements. However, our review was not focused on  compliance with requirements but rather on the use of leading or good  program management practices. We also noted that NNSA\u2019s stated  objectives for the DNN policy include establishing a DNN-wide policy that  incorporates leading practices for program management and that  facilitates the implementation of methods for programs and subprograms  to monitor, measure, analyze, and improve management processes.  Leading practices on life-cycle program management are important for an  organization to successfully plan the resources it needs to achieve its  goals and assess its performance in doing so. DNN\u2019s revised policy did  not acknowledge management of the program life-cycle as an essential  program management function and did not include any requirements on  leading practices on life-cycle schedule and cost management.", "We agree that risk management processes should be used to monitor  risks and track actions to reduce uncertainty. As we stated in our report,  the revised DNN policy included a new section on risk management  under which all DNN programs and subprograms will be required to  prepare risk management plans to help identify, analyze, handle, and  monitor risk. However, the new section did not include criteria for DNN  subprograms to follow when uncertainty related to risks being monitored  is low enough to allow a subprogram to develop life-cycle schedule and  cost estimates.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the NNSA Administrator, the NNSA Deputy Administrator for  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and other interested parties.

DNN  has 4 major programs that manage a total of 13 subprograms (a  subprogram is a program managed as part of another program).  Specifically, we selected the Nuclear Material Removal and Highly  Enriched Uranium (HEU) Reactor Conversion subprograms, which DNN  manages under its Material Management and Minimization program. In  addition, we selected the Radiological Security and International Nuclear  Security subprograms, which DNN manages under its Global Material  Security program. We selected these subprograms for review because  they had defined start dates, end dates, and/or work scope indicating that  they had project-like aspects. These subprograms organize their work in  programmatic areas which we refer to as components and under each  component the subprograms manage various types of projects, such as  projects to remove nuclear material from civilian sites worldwide. We also  selected the 4 subprograms because they were not the subject of other  ongoing or recently completed GAO reviews.

The selected leading practices we  identified were the use of a master schedule necessary to achieve a  program\u2019s goals, cost estimates that cover the full life-cycle of a program,  and schedule and cost baselines to measure performance. We collected  and reviewed subprogram planning documents, monthly performance  reports, and spreadsheet data on work scope, historical costs, schedules  and cost estimates established by the subprograms, and their use of  project baselines to measure performance. We also reviewed information  the subprograms reported in NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 and 2018  congressional budget justifications. We also interviewed NNSA officials  and their contractors who manage the program management information  system used by 3 of the 4 subprograms to manage schedule and cost  information to understand its capabilities. We interviewed NNSA officials  who manage the selected DNN subprograms about the use of these  practices and their views on challenges or limitations in using them. We  also interviewed representatives at Argonne National Laboratory and  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which operate projects for the  subprograms, to identify how projects develop schedule and cost  estimates and pass information on to the subprograms.", "To assess the reliability of the schedule and cost estimates on the  selected subprograms, we interviewed NNSA officials and national  laboratory contractors who were knowledgeable about the process  followed to develop and update the estimates and the program  management information systems used to manage the schedule and cost  information and generate reports. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which were to report the  subprograms\u2019 estimated schedule completion dates and cost estimates,  as well as report the fiscal years and subprogram components and  projects covered by the subprogram schedule and cost estimates.", "To examine the extent to which DNN has incorporated leading practices  into its revised program management policy, we reviewed DNN\u2019s revised  program management policy approved in February 2017. We compared  the revised policy to the 2005 version to identify the changes included in  the revised policy. We reviewed program management leading practices  by PMI in The Standard for Program Management and by GAO in its  schedule and cost guides and federal internal control standards.

We compared these practices to DNN\u2019s  requirements and guidance contained in the revised DNN policy. We  interviewed NNSA officials about the development of the new policy and  their views on the reasons specific leading practices were included in the  revised policy and others were not, as well as challenges DNN\u2019s  programs and subprograms face in managing program schedule and  cost.
