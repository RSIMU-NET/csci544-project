The remaining 21\u0097which total about $1 billion in spending\u0097had one or more subsidiary projects that were not meeting cost and/or schedule commitments (i.e., they exceeded their goals by at least 10 percent, which is the level at which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) considers projects to be at increased risk of not being able to deliver planned capabilities on time and within budget.)", "The primary causes for the cost and schedule shortfalls were (in descending order of frequency):", "inaccurate preliminary cost and schedule estimates,", "technology issues in the development phase,", "changes in agency priorities,", "lack of understanding of user requirements, and", "dependencies on other investments that had schedule shortfalls.", "Eight investments had inaccurate cost and schedule estimates. For example, DHS\u0092s Critical Infrastructure Technology investment had a project where actual costs were about 16 percent over the estimated cost, due in part to project staff not fully validating cost estimates before proceeding with the project. In addition, six investments had technical issues in the development phase that caused cost or schedule slippages. For example, DHS\u0092s Land Border Integration investment had problems with wireless interference at certain sites during deployment of handheld devices used for scanning license plates, which caused a project to be about 2.5 months late. In past work on DHS investments, GAO has identified some of the causes of DHS\u0092s shortfalls and made recommendations to strengthen management in these areas (e.g., cost estimating, requirements), and DHS has initiated efforts to implement the recommendations.", "DHS often did not adequately address shortfalls and their causes. GAO\u0092s investment management framework calls for agencies to develop and document corrective efforts to address underperforming investments. DHS policy requires documented corrective efforts when investments experience cost or schedule variances. Although 12 of the 21 investments with shortfalls had defined and documented corrective efforts, the remaining 9 did not. Officials responsible for 3 of the 9 investments said they took corrective efforts but were unable to provide plans or any other related documentation showing such action had been taken. Officials for the other 6 investments cited criteria in DHS\u0092s policy that excluded their investments from the requirement to document corrective efforts. This practice is inconsistent with the direction of OMB guidance and related best practices that stress developing and documenting corrective efforts to address problems in such circumstances. Until DHS addresses its guidance shortcomings and ensures each of these underperforming investments has defined and documented corrective efforts, these investments are at risk of continued cost and schedule shortfalls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the appropriate officials to address the guidance shortcomings and develop corrective actions for all major IT investment projects having cost and schedule shortfalls.

The guidance  also calls for such corrective efforts to be defined and documented.   OMB plays a key role in helping federal agencies manage their  investments by working with them to better plan, justify, and determine  how much they need to spend on projects and how to manage their  approved projects. In December 2010, OMB issued its 25 Point  Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology  Management, a plan to change IT management throughout the federal  government by strengthening the role of investment review boards to  enable them to more adequately manage agency IT portfolios, redefining  the role of agency CIOs and the Federal CIO Council to focus on  portfolio management, and implementing face-to-face reviews to identify  IT investments that are experiencing performance problems and to select  them for a TechStat session\u2014a review of selected IT investments  between OMB and agency leadership that is led by the Federal CIO.   In addition, OMB provides agencies with tools to measure how effectively  investments are meeting established cost and schedule parameters.  Specifically, OMB requires federal agencies to provide information on  their IT investments as a part of their yearly budget submissions, and to  do so using an exhibit 53, in which they list all of their IT investments and  their associated costs, and an exhibit 300, also called the Capital Asset  Plan and Business Case, which includes an investment\u2019s cost and  schedule commitments.", "Further, in June 2009, OMB deployed the IT Dashboard, a website that  displays near real-time information on, among other things, the cost and  schedule performance of all of an agency\u2019s major IT investments.

Specifically, the officials said that although DHS\u2019s guidance calls for  corrective actions to be developed and documented when an investment  or its projects experiences a life cycle cost or schedule variance of 8  percent or greater, the variances on their project activities thus far were  not large enough to constitute such a life cycle variance.", "The impact of this is that multiple projects can continue to experience  shortfalls\u2014which increases the risk that investments will experience  serious lifecycle cost and schedule variances\u2014without having to develop  and document corrective actions and thus alert top management about  potential problems and associated risks. This is inconsistent with the  direction of OMB, which requires agencies to report (via the IT  Dashboard) on the cost and schedule performance of their projects and  considers those projects with a 10 percent or greater variance to be at an  increased level of risk of not being able to deliver promised capabilities on  time and within budget, and thus they require special attention from  management. It is also inconsistent with our best practices research and  experience at federal agencies, which stresses that agencies report to  management when projects are not meeting expectations or when  problems arise and quickly develop and document corrective efforts to  address the problems. Further, our research and work at agencies has  shown that waiting to act until significant life cycle variances occur can  sometimes be risky and costly, as life cycle schedules are typically for  multiyear periods, allowing the potential for underperforming projects to  continue to vary from their cost and schedule goals for an extended  amount of time without any requirement for corrective efforts.  Consequently, until these guidance shortcomings are addressed and  each underperforming project has defined and documented corrective  actions, the department\u2019s major investments these projects support will  be at an increased risk of cost and schedule shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Most of the projects comprising DHS\u2019s 68 major IT investments are  meeting their cost and schedule commitments, but 21 major  investments\u2014integral to DHS\u2019s mission and costing approximately $1  billion\u2014have projects that are experiencing significant cost and schedule  shortfalls. These shortfalls place these investments at increased risk of  not delivering promised capabilities on time and within budget, which, in  turn, pose a risk to DHS\u2019s ability to fully meet its mission of securing the  homeland. DHS guidance does not require projects experiencing  significant cost and schedule shortfalls to develop and document  corrective efforts until they cause a life cycle cost and schedule variance.  This increases risk and is contrary to effective IT investment practices.

More specifically, we analyzed the extent to which each of  these investments had met or exceeded, as of March 2012, cost and  schedule commitments established when the investment was initiated. In  doing this, we identified investments that had a project exceeding 10  percent of its cost and schedule commitments. We focused on these  investments and their subsidiary projects because OMB considers them  to be at an increased level of risk of not being able to deliver promised  capabilities on time and within budget, and thus requiring special attention  from management.", "To assess the reliability of the IT Dashboard data we analyzed, we  corroborated the data by interviewing investment and other DHS officials  to determine whether the information on the dashboard was consistent  with that reported by DHS.
