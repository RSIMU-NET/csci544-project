The model DOD used to estimate costs in the first phase of the process generated unreliable estimates due to two main reasons. First, the model can overstate aircraft and ship reconstitution costs because these costs are covered in two different sections of the model. As a result, the model's estimate for Air Force aircraft reconstitution was overstated by over $1 billion. Second, there is uncertainty over what maintenance requirements the model covered. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the services developed their requirements with the understanding that the model did not calculate all maintenance requirements. GAO learned that the model may duplicate some requirements that the services manually calculated and included in their cost estimates. Consequently, DOD cannot have confidence that its equipment reconstitution budget estimate is reliable. There are also reconstitution estimating and guidance problems associated with the second phase of the process, where the services may develop alternative estimates outside of the model. For instance, the Army failed to consider funding in its baseline budget that would be available for equipment reconstitution. In another instance, the services included requirements in their reconstitution estimates that appear to go beyond equipment reconstitution as established by OSD's guidance. Nonetheless, GAO found an accumulation of unfulfilled equipment reconstitution requirements, because OSD guidance excluded the services from requesting funds for projected battle and other expected losses. The effect of losses not recognized in OSD's supplemental budget requirements have not yet been quantified and may be significant. GAO believes these problems are creating a backlog of equipment reconstitution requirements that will eventually need to be addressed in future budgets. DOD has not accurately tracked and reported its equipment reconstitution cost because the services are unable to segregate equipment reconstitution from other maintenance requirements as required. As a result, DOD cannot accurately report the cost of equipment reconstitution and, consequently, the total cost of the global war on terror. The Air Force does not break out its equipment reconstitution obligations from other global war-on-terrorism obligations in a DOD monthly cost report because it does not have a mechanism that can track the amounts obligated on equipment reconstitution and delineate such obligations from routine maintenance. Further, Army- and Navy-reported equipment reconstitution obligations are likely overstated in the monthly report because they include other maintenance costs--such as those related to equipment used in training exercises--that do not fall within DOD's description of equipment reconstitution."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The high pace of military operations in Iraq and elsewhere has generated a  multibillion dollar equipment maintenance requirement that must be  addressed after units return home.

While the Department of Defense (DOD) has not formally  defined equipment reconstitution, its financial regulation describes  reconstitution costs as including costs to clean, inspect, maintain, replace,  and restore equipment to the required condition at the conclusion of the  contingency operation or unit deployment. Furthermore, the department  has issued additional specific guidance as to what costs should be included  as reconstitution.  Reconstitution is performed at each level of  maintenance\u2014organizational, intermediate, and depot\u2014depending on the  condition of returning equipment and the capacity available at each  maintenance level.  The department\u2019s equipment reconstitution  maintenance requirement is based on the amount of repairs that need to be  performed at all maintenance levels.

During the  first phase, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) comptroller and  the services use an OSD model, developed by the Institute for Defense  Analyses (IDA), called the contingency operations support tool (COST),which covers much of what is needed to conduct contingency operations,  as well as some aspects of equipment reconstitution. Each service and OSD  input information into the model regarding the period of deployment for  units and equipment that will need reconstitution. The model generates an  estimated funding requirement. During the second phase, the services may  accept or reject the COST model\u2019s estimates and provide alternative  estimates they developed outside the model. When the services propose an  estimate other than that derived from the COST model, they meet with the  OSD comptroller and provide support for their estimate and, in conjunction  with the comptroller, determine the requirement to be submitted.  The  services also provide estimates for some requirements that are not covered  by the model\u2014such as depot-level maintenance and procurement for  replacement equipment. OSD then reviews these estimates and, in  conjunction with the services, determines a final estimate for inclusion in  OSD\u2019s supplemental budget submission.

The Army\u2019s  Third Infantry Division (mechanized) and its supporting reserve  component units were primarily equipped with Army-prepositioned  assets\u2014consisting of over 17,000 pieces of rolling stock and almost 6,000  standard 20-foot shipping containers of supplies\u2014drawn from  prepositioned equipment sites located in southwest Asia and offloaded  from Army prepositioned ships. The 1st Marine Expeditionary Force was  also primarily equipped with prepositioned assets offloaded from Marine  Corps prepositioned ships.  By the height of the combat portion of OIF, the  United States had deployed a significant portion of its combat power to  southwest Asia.  For example, during fiscal year 2003, the Army deployed  four divisions and numerous supporting active, reserve, and national guard  units which participated in the combat phase of OIF.  As a result, the Army  estimated that these units, with assistance from other Army maintenance  activities, would have to reconstitute over 53,000 pieces of rolling stock  when the units redeployed to their home stations.", "In Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military\u2014especially the Army and Marine  Corps\u2014are operating at a pace well in excess of their normal peacetime  level, which is driven by units\u2019 training requirements.  This not only greatly  increases the day-to-day operational maintenance requirements, including  spare parts demands, of deployed Army and Marine Corps units, but also  generates a large post-operational maintenance requirement that must be  addressed when the units redeploy to their home station.  Upon  redeployment, the units need to bring their equipment at least back up to  fully mission-capable status in order for the units to be able to train on  their equipment and achieve their readiness levels and be prepared for  future deployments.  In addition, before leaving Iraq, redeploying units  turned in a large amount of prepositioned equipment that must undergo  maintenance and repair before the equipment can be reissued to units  deploying to or already in southwest Asia in support of OIF, or returned to  prepositioned equipment stock for future use. Figure 1 shows some  prepositioned equipment stored in Kuwait awaiting repair.", "Army and Marine Corps units returning from deployments related to the  global war on terrorism have equipment that has been heavily used and is  in various degrees of disrepair.  Upon returning to home station, the units\u2019  equipment is inspected to determine what maintenance is needed to bring  the equipment back to the condition needed to allow the unit to conduct  mission-essential training and be prepared for future deployments.  The  services use myriad repair and maintenance sources to assist units in  reconstituting their equipment.  At military installations, various  maintenance personnel\u2014including military personnel within units,  installation personnel (including contractors) who support day-to-day  maintenance operations, contractors who have been hired to augment the  units\u2019 and installations\u2019 day-to-day workforces, and contractors who have  been hired to increase an installation\u2019s maintenance capacity\u2014are all  working in concert to reconstitute the units\u2019 equipment in a timely manner  so that the units will be ready to again deploy.

As a result, all  organizational- and intermediate-level maintenance and repair  requirements are met through the flying-hour program.  Since the  operations section of the COST model already includes flying-hour  program funding, the inclusion of an equation for aircraft reconstitution in  the equipment reconstitution section of the model is redundant.  Air Force  officials told us that due to their flying-hour program, additional funding  specifically addressing organizational- and intermediate-level  reconstitution of aircraft was not needed.  However, the Air Force\u2019s fiscal  year 2004 supplemental budget request included about $1.2 billion in the  equipment reconstitution section for aircraft maintenance that was also  covered by the operations section of the COST model.

In part to  provide Congress with information on global war-on-terrorism costs and  provide the OSD comptroller with a means to assess variance between  obligations and the budget, DFAS compiles a monthly report to track these  obligations.  The DFAS report on funds obligated in support of the war  includes a category for tracking equipment reconstitution obligations and  the guidance associated with this report describes what reconstitution  costs can include.  Our analysis of the DFAS report showed that 1) the Air  Force is not separately reporting equipment reconstitution obligations  because it does not have a mechanism within its current accounting system  to track them, 2) the Army is including unit reconstitution obligations that  are above and beyond equipment reconstitution and other maintenance  costs, and 3) the Navy is unable to segregate regular maintenance from  reconstitution maintenance for ship overhauls.  As a result, the equipment  reconstitution obligations are being inconsistently reported by the services  and the report data are not reliable for accurately determining how much  the services are actually obligating for the reconstitution of equipment  returning from deployments in support of the global war on terrorism.  Table 3 lists the fiscal year 2004 obligations reported by the services in  DFAS\u2019s report as of the end of September 2004 for reconstitution.", "DOD reports the costs of the global war on terrorism largely in accordance  with the cost breakdown structure found in its financial management  regulation.  This internal DOD guidance describes equipment  reconstitution costs as including the cost to clean, inspect, maintain,  replace, and restore equipment to the required condition at the conclusion  of the contingency operation or unit deployment.  This guidance, which  includes a specific cost category for equipment reconstitution along with  specific budget guidance issued by the OSD comptroller\u2019s office that  addresses incremental costs of the global war on terrorism, calls for the  services to report equipment reconstitution costs separately from other  incremental costs.  Despite this guidance, the Air Force is not separately  reporting equipment reconstitution obligations to DFAS for inclusion in its  monthly terrorism cost report owing to the way the Air Force accounting  system was designed.  Air Force officials told us that the Air Force\u2019s  accounting system currently has no way to delineate equipment  reconstitution obligations from other global war-on-terrorism obligations  for DFAS reporting purposes.  Specifically, the Air Force does not have a  mechanism nor has it established codes that can track the dollar amounts  obligated on equipment reconstitution in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, which  the guidance does not require.  The Air Force\u2019s accounting system has two  types of codes for classifying expenses: (1) element of expense investment  codes, which are used for tracking obligations by commodities (such as  supplies, travel, and civilian pay); and (2) emergency and special program  codes, which are used to collect costs incurred during an emergency or a  special program (such as the global war on terrorism).  Neither of these  codes, individually or in combination, equates to equipment reconstitution.   Instead, equipment reconstitution obligations are spread throughout other  categories in the DFAS terrorist cost report, as appropriate, for the type of  obligations incurred.  Thus equipment reconstitution obligations are  reported in the operations category of DFAS\u2019s report, not the reconstitution  category of the DFAS report, and are mixed with other global war-on- terrorism obligations that are tracked by other cost categories in the DFAS  report.  According to OSD comptroller officials, having the ability to track  actual global war-on-terrorism obligations is important in that it allows  them insight into the accuracy of the supplemental budget that was  generated, in part, from the COST model.", "Army and Navy equipment reconstitution obligations may also be  inaccurate in the DFAS report.  The Army and Navy track their equipment  reconstitution obligations through the use of certain codes available in  their account encoding structure and may overstate reported equipment  reconstitution obligations, because these codes are accumulating global  war-on-terrorism and other obligations that were not exclusively for  equipment reconstitution.", "During our review, we found that the Army is including obligations not  directly related to equipment reconstitution requirements arising from  global war-on-terrorism deployments.  For example, units reconstituting  after returning from Iraq may be including maintenance obligations  generated during training exercises.  Army officials stated that these units  are being ordered to rapidly prepare for subsequent deployments, which  includes reconstituting equipment and engaging in training exercises  among various other tasks.  According to Army officials, training exercises  can require the use of equipment that has not yet been fully reconstituted  and the exercises generate additional maintenance requirements not  related to global war-on-terrorism equipment reconstitution.  However,  these training-related maintenance requirements are not readily separable  from the equipment reconstitution requirements, and are therefore being  included as part of the Army\u2019s reported reconstitution obligations.  In  addition, some reconstitution obligations do not readily align with the cost  categories in the DFAS report and are thus included in existing categories,  such as equipment reconstitution. For example, Army budget officials told  us that when units return home from a deployment they incur  reconstitution expenses unrelated to their equipment.  These expenses  include training needed to reestablish a unit\u2019s ability to perform its mission  and personnel expenses related to the movement of soldiers in and out of  the unit that occur after an extensive deployment.  The officials told us that  these obligations are being included in the equipment reconstitution  section because this was the best place to account for them.  As a result,  the Army\u2019s equipment reconstitution amounts are likely overstated.", "The Navy\u2019s reported reconstitution obligations include some maintenance  costs that did not appear to completely result directly from global war-on- terrorism deployments.  Portions of the Navy\u2019s reported obligations for  equipment reconstitution include major ship repairs and overhauls, called  \u201cavailabilities\u201d, which are accomplished at specified time intervals  independent of the ship\u2019s use during the global war on terrorism.  The  specific maintenance tasks performed during an availability depend on the  type of ship, the type of repair or overhaul being conducted, and the ship\u2019s  condition.  According to Navy officials, they report all of the obligations  incurred in conjunction with an availability funded by the fiscal year 2004  supplemental budget as equipment reconstitution regardless of whether  the obligations are due to conditions that existed prior to a global war-on- terrorism deployment or to peacetime maintenance conducted during all  availabilities.  The Navy reports all of these obligations as equipment  reconstitution, because it does not have a process to capture what  obligations for an availability are driven by the higher level of operations  generated by global war-on-terrorism deployments versus baseline  requirements generated by a ship during deployments not related to the  global war on terrorism.  While all of the maintenance tasks associated  with availabilities that are funded by supplemental money are needed to  effectively maintain the condition of Navy ships, not all of the maintenance  performed during the availabilities resulted from the ships being deployed  in support of the global war on terrorism. Thus, some of the Navy\u2019s  reported obligations do not appear to fit DOD\u2019s criteria for equipment  reconstitution costs that should be reported as an incremental cost of the  global war on terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the services, especially the Army and Marine Corps, continue to conduct  operations related to the global war on terrorism at the current high pace,  they will continue to generate equipment reconstitution requirements.

However, DOD and  the services cannot be assured that its global war-on-terrorism  supplemental budget requirements are as reliable and complete as possible  until the OSD comptroller:  revises its contingency model to ensure that costs covered by the  model\u2019s operating tempo cost elements are not duplicated by costs in  the model\u2019s reconstitution cost elements;   clearly establishes what equipment reconstitution maintenance  requirements should be covered by the COST model and communicates  this information to IDA to ensure that the model calculations reflect  only these maintenance costs;   clarifies its guidance to the services on what types of maintenance  requirements should and should not be included as equipment  reconstitution when developing the supplemental budget; and  ensures that all anticipated equipment reconstitution requirements,  such as operational losses and maintenance washouts, are considered  when developing supplemental budget requests.", "Overestimating these requirements could result in a misapplication of  funds, while underestimating them could require the services to draw funds  from baseline programs or result in the inability of the services to fully  reconstitute their equipment. Improving DOD\u2019s process for estimating  equipment reconstitution maintenance and equipment replacement  requirements will aid the services in reducing the risks they face in  executing the equipment reconstitution program and help maintain a  military that is able to meet the nation\u2019s needs.", "With global war-on-terrorism operations continuing at a high pace, the  Army will be generating additional equipment reconstitution requirements  that will be funded through future supplemental budgets.  Although OSD  did not use the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2004 equipment reconstitution estimate  for the fiscal year 2004 supplemental request, that does not preclude OSD  from using future Army estimates.  Consequently, it is important that the  Army appropriately offset its equipment reconstitution estimate with  baseline peacetime funding, which it did not do for its fiscal year 2004  estimate.  Until the Army establishes a step in its supplemental estimating  process to offset the estimate with the baseline budget, its calculation of  equipment reconstitution requirements for future supplemental budgets  will continue to be overstated. Further, if OSD uses the Army-calculated  equipment reconstitution estimate and does not adjust the estimate for  baseline funding, the Army\u2019s equipment reconstitution requirements could  be overfunded, which could limit the funding available for other  requirements, thus potentially increasing risks in other areas.", "Inconsistencies between how the services are reporting equipment  reconstitution obligations in the DFAS global war-on-terrorism cost report  mean that equipment reconstitution and other related cost categories are  being inaccurately reported. Until DOD develops comprehensive and  consistent methods for tracking and reporting equipment reconstitution  obligations\u2014including (1) developing a mechanism within the Air Force  for identifying, accumulating, and reporting its equipment reconstitution  obligations; and (2) refining the Navy and Army processes for identifying  obligations that are incurred exclusively for equipment reconstitution\u2014the  usefulness of the DFAS report will remain limited.

We  confirmed that the guidance provided to the services for the fiscal year  2005 supplemental budget was much more detailed and comprehensive  than the guidance provided for developing  the fiscal years 2003 and 2004  supplemental budgets.", "In concurring with our recommendation that the services, in conjunction  with DFAS, develop comprehensive and consistent methods for tracking  and reporting equipment reconstitution obligations, the OSD director  stated that they have already revised their financial management regulation  to improve reporting of equipment reconstitution.  However, until  additional actions are taken, such as improving the services\u2019 financial  systems\u2019 ability to track obligations, our recommendation will not be fully  implemented.", "In partially concurring with our recommendation regarding the duplication  of maintenance costs in the COST model, the OSD director stated that they  have made revisions to DOD\u2019s financial management regulations to ensure  that the cost of equipment maintenance is not being duplicated in different  COST model sections.  However, as currently written, the revised section  does not have any instructions on avoiding duplicating maintenance  requirements calculated by the model\u2019s operations section; instead it  simply divides reconstitution into four subcategories of maintenance.  Until  further changes are made, the intent of our recommendation will not have  been met.", "In partially concurring with our recommendation that the OSD comptroller  clearly establish what equipment reconstitution maintenance requirements  should be covered by the COST model, the OSD director stated that IDA,  the model\u2019s operator, periodically receives specific guidance from the  comptroller\u2019s office on the criteria and elements of costs to be included in  the model\u2019s calculations.  However, as we reported, neither OSD  comptroller nor IDA officials were able to provide us with examples of this  guidance when requested.  The OSD director also told us that they have  taken action to ensure that the model calculates costs in accordance with  the DOD Financial Management Regulation and that they issue guidance to  the services on what costs will be covered by the model.  Although Volume  12, Chapter 23, Section 3.5 of the financial management regulation has been  revised to delineate equipment reconstitution into four categories\u2014 organizational-, intermediate-, and depot-level maintenance; and contractor  logistics support\u2014the section does not state which of these categories are  covered by the COST model.  In addition, while OSD guidance to the  services for developing the fiscal year 2005 supplemental budget stated that  intermediate- and depot-level maintenance would be calculated outside the  model, the guidance provided for developing the fiscal years 2003 and 2004  supplemental budgets only specified that depot-level maintenance would  be calculated outside the model.  Until changes are made establishing what  maintenance requirements are in the COST model and clearly  communicating this to IDA, the intent of our recommendation will not have  been met.", "The OSD director did not concur with our recommendation that the  Secretary of the Army be directed to establish a step in its supplemental  budget process for estimating equipment reconstitution requirements to  offset the estimate with baseline funding.  The OSD director said that the  process for developing the supplemental budget already includes a process  for excluding costs for equipment maintenance funded in the baseline  budget. As stated in this report, we acknowledge that OSD\u2019s COST model  equations for equipment reconstitution contain a factor for reducing the  reconstitution requirements by taking baseline funding into account.  We  also acknowledge that OSD\u2019s process for building the supplemental budget  has controls in place to help ensure that only incremental costs are  included in the supplemental budget.  However, we believe that the  services\u2019 supplemental budget estimating processes also need to have such  assurances built in.  We made our recommendation to address the fiscal  year 2004 equipment reconstitution requirement that the Army developed  separate from the COST model during what we have described in this  report as the second phase of DOD\u2019s process for building the supplemental  budget. When developing this requirement, the Army did not take into  account available baseline funding, because it did not have a step in its  supplemental budget estimating process to offset the estimate with  baseline funding.  If the OSD comptroller had used this Army-generated  requirement in its fiscal year 2004 supplemental budget, the potential exists  that OSD comptroller officials might miss the Army\u2019s failure to adjust this  requirement for baseline funding.  Importantly, the very safeguards that the  OSD comptroller stated it has in place failed to offset the $1.2 billion  duplication of aircraft maintenance requirements that the Air Force  included in its fiscal year 2004 supplemental budget requirement.  Taking  action on our recommendation would provide the Army with the necessary  safeguards to submit accurate budget estimates and avoid the potential  that future supplemental budgets could provide more than incremental  funding to the Army. Therefore, we continue to believe our  recommendation has merit.", "In partially concurring with our recommendation that the services be  allowed to include equipment losses in their supplemental budget  requirements, the OSD director stated that they typically address these  potential future costs through subsequent budget requests or through  reprogramming efforts.  The OSD director also told us that it is conceivable  that some factor reflecting maintenance washout trends could be  considered in future supplemental budget requests. If this action is taken, it  should satisfy the intent of our recommendation.  As we stated in our  report, until OSD allows the services to consider anticipated operational  equipment losses and maintenance washouts in their supplemental  budgeting process, equipment reconstitution requirements generated  during the current fiscal year will inevitably be pushed out for funding in  upcoming years. Not doing so could also have an impact on the ability of  the services to quickly reconstitute equipment in the current fiscal year.", "We are sending copies of this report to other appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the  Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Commandant of  the Marine Corps, and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

We also collected and reviewed OSD and service equipment  reconstitution guidance to develop an understanding of the processes the  department used to develop its fiscal year 2004 equipment reconstitution  requirements.  As part of this effort we also met with officials from OSD  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Headquarters U.S. Army Deputy  Chief of Staff G-4; Headquarters U.S. Navy Deputy Chief of Naval  Operations (Logistics); Headquarters U.S. Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff  Installation and Logistics; and Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps Programs  and Resources Department to identify the methodologies used by OSD and  each of the services for determining equipment reconstitution  requirements and collected related documentation.  To gain further insight  into the accuracy of the process the Army used to develop its equipment  reconstitution requirement, we met with officials at and collected data  from the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity; Forts Bragg, Campbell,  Dix, Hood, Riley, and Stewart; and Camps Arifjan and Doha, Kuwait. We  collected actual equipment reconstitution cost data from these activities  and compared them to the data the Army used in developing its equipment  reconstitution requirement. To determine the reliability of the actual  reconstitution costs for Army equipment, we discussed and observed the  equipment reconstitution data collection process at four of the Army bases  we visited where we observed a consistent process for collecting and  entering equipment reconstitution data into the Army\u2019s database.  We also  visited the AMSAA team that was managing and summarizing the Army\u2019s  equipment reconstitution data collection effort to determine that the  personnel collecting the data and managing the data collection effort were  performing quality reviews to ensure completeness and accuracy.  Additionally, the AMSAA management team had the Army commands  review the data collected at their installations prior to passing the data to  higher commands. Based on this assessment, we concluded that the data  collection effort was sufficiently comprehensive and reliable to provide  data for this engagement. We also collected and analyzed data the services  use in developing their reconstitution requirements, which were submitted  to OSD.  Further, we collected and analyzed data OSD used to develop the  department\u2019s overall equipment reconstitution requirement that was  included in the fiscal year 2004 global war-on-terrorism supplemental  budget request. To gain further insight into how OSD developed the  equipment reconstitution requirement, we met with IDA officials to  develop an understanding of how OSD\u2019s COST model calculates this  requirement. We limited our examination of the COST model to the section  that calculates equipment reconstitution requirements, which consists of  only 4 of the 188 equations that comprise the COST model. To understand  the extent to which equipment reconstitution requirements generated  during fiscal year 2004 will have to be funded in upcoming budgets we met  with and obtained guidance issued by the OSD Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) regarding how the services\u2019 equipment reconstitution  requirements were restricted. To quantify the effect of these limitations we  collected Army data on potential equipment losses and estimated their  possible impact on future budgets. To assess the equipment reconstitution  requirement inputs provided to the services by their component commands  and units we met with officials of and collected data at Army Forces  Command, Naval Air Systems Command, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Air Combat  Command, and U.S. Marine Corps Logistics Command.
