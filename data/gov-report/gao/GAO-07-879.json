GAO was asked to review (1) selected characteristics of manufactured housing and the demographics of the owners; (2) federal and state consumer protections for owners of manufactured homes; and (3) the potential benefits and costs of the proposed changes for borrowers and the federal government. In addressing these objectives, GAO analyzed select Census data; researched federal laws and laws in eight states; interviewed local, state, and federal officials; and analyzed various scenarios that might affect Title I program costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to 2005 American Housing Survey data, most manufactured homes (factory-built housing designed to meet the national building code) were located in rural areas in southern states, and most were occupied by lower-income owners rather than renters. Although the market for new manufactured homes declined substantially from 1996 to 2005, buyers increasingly bought larger homes and placed them on private property rather than in manufactured home parks. In addition, some states are experiencing park closures, with the properties being converted to other uses. Overall, manufactured homes can be an affordable housing option, with monthly housing costs lower than for other housing types. Owners of manufactured homes generally have more consumer protections if their homes are considered real rather than personal property, but protections provided by laws in the states GAO examined vary. Consumer protections extending to lending and settlement processes for personal property loans are not as broad as those for real property loans (mortgages). Also, delinquent Title I borrowers can be subject to repossession or foreclosure, but the consumer protections for repossession are often less extensive than those for foreclosure. State laws give owners of manufactured homes on leased land varying levels of notice, protection, and compensation related to length of leases, rent increases, evictions, and park closures. According to some FHA and lending officials, potential benefits of the proposed changes for borrowers include loans big enough to buy larger homes and more financing as more lenders participate in the program. The program insured about 24,000 loans in 1990 but only about 1,400 loans representing $54 million in mortgage insurance in 2006. While the changes could benefit borrowers, according to FHA and the Congressional Budget Office, the potential costs could expand the government's liability. To gain an understanding of the effects of the proposed changes, GAO presented various scenarios. Although risk factors unique to manufactured home lending (such as placement on leased land) as well as commonly used predictors of loan performance (such as credit scores) are associated with default risk, these data were not available. Instead, GAO modeled different variations of borrower default risk and other factors (such as premiums and lender recovery) that were based on the experience of FHA loans to illustrate how variations in these key factors could affect potential gains and losses to FHA's General Insurance Fund. The analysis suggests that in all instances where borrowers had medium or high default risk, the fund would experience a loss. However FHA has not articulated which borrowers would be served, how the loans would be underwritten and priced under a risk-based structure, or collected data on credit scores and land ownership type. FHA explained that among other reasons, it had not done so because the Title I program was currently a low-volume program. As a result, the effects of the proposed changes are unclear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Manufactured housing (factory-built housing designed to meet the  Manufactured housing (factory-built housing designed to meet the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) national building  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) national building  code) provides affordable housing for approximately 17 million  code) provides affordable housing for approximately 17 million  Americans.

In addition, the lending market associated with  higher interest rates. In addition, the lending market associated with  manufactured homes has undergone significant changes over the last 15  years. Market growth in the 1990s was followed by a large number of  repossessions from 2000 to 2002. Because of the amount of origination  fees manufactured home lenders received, some lenders focused on  increasing sales volume to the detriment of assessing borrowers\u2019  creditworthiness. As a result, officials and literature suggest that the  quality of the manufactured home loan pool began to deteriorate and less  creditworthy borrowers began to default on their loans, causing a high  number of repossessions (personal property is repossessed rather than  foreclosed). Subsequently, many lenders exited this market, resulting in a  decrease in the availability of private financing for manufactured homes.  Furthermore, loan volume generated through Title I declined by 94 percent  from 1990 to 2006, with 1,438 loans insured in 2006 representing $54  million in mortgage insurance.", "In addition to the relative scarcity of financing for manufactured homes,  the owners of manufactured homes are in a unique position relative to  other homeowners in terms of the federal and state consumer protections  applicable when they buy, finance, and occupy the housing. That is,  whether the manufactured home is considered real or personal property  affects what consumer protections apply and what recourse is available.  For example, consumer and tenant protections, particularly at the state  level, are especially pertinent for owners of manufactured homes who lose  leases to their underlying ground because they lived on land sold for  commercial or other residential development. Some owners of  manufactured homes found that their homes lost most or all of their value  in such situations. And, according to state and local officials, the loss of  manufactured housing parks, particularly in growing metropolitan areas,  has exacerbated the shortage of affordable housing.", "Legislation has been introduced to make changes to the Title I program  that may increase the demand for and availability of loans for  manufactured homes.

Specifically, this report (1)  describes selected characteristics of manufactured housing and the  demographics of the owners, (2) compares federal and state consumer and  tenant protections for owners of manufactured homes, and (3) describes  the proposed changes to FHA\u2019s Title I Manufactured Home Loan program  and assesses potential benefits and costs to borrowers and the federal  government.", "To determine selected characteristics of manufactured housing and the  demographics of the owners, we analyzed Census data from the  Manufactured Housing and American Housing Surveys. Specifically, we  used Manufactured Housing Survey data from 1996 through 2005 to  examine changes in the manufactured housing industry, such as the  number of homes placed and the size of these homes. We relied on 2005  American Housing Survey data to provide information on the  demographics of the manufactured homeowner. We did not use earlier  years of American Housing Survey data because the sample of  manufactured homes in the survey changed in 2005. However, in both the  Manufactured Housing and American Housing Surveys, data about the  ownership of the land (that is, owned or leased) on which the home is  placed are limited. We assessed the reliability of the Manufactured  Housing and American Housing Surveys by reviewing information about  the data, performing electronic data testing to detect errors in  completeness and reasonableness, and interviewing knowledgeable  officials regarding the quality of the data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To compare  federal and state consumer and tenant protections available for owners of  manufactured homes, we researched relevant federal laws and laws in the  eight states (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North  Carolina, Oregon, and Texas) that we selected for our review. The eight  states were selected based on a combination of factors including the  volume of FHA Title I loans in the state from 1990 through the first quarter  of 2007; the concentration of manufactured housing as a percentage of  housing units in the state; information from our interviews of industry and  consumer officials; and previous studies conducted on manufactured  housing. In each state, we conducted semistructured phone interviews  with the state regulator, representatives of the manufactured housing  industry, and a consumer group, such as the state manufactured  homeowners association. To assess the potential costs and benefits of the  proposed changes to the Title I program, we conducted a literature review;  interviewed FHA officials, FHA lenders, Ginnie Mae officials, and officials  from federal and other lending programs, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie  Mac, U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service, and the  Department of Veterans Affairs; and reviewed policies and procedures  from programs that provide financing for manufactured homes to  determine what additional factors, such as default risk and the location of  the manufactured home, could be considered to mitigate risk for lending  for manufactured housing. To illustrate potential costs and other effects of  the proposed legislation, we conducted an analysis of different scenarios  of potential loan performance that incorporated these additional factors.  We used this approach because we did not have sufficient data on the  credit scores of FHA borrowers or the location of the homes to perform a  more in-depth analysis.

For the purposes of this report, we define manufactured  homes as factory-built housing units designed to meet the HUD Code.  Manufactured homes can be single-wide, double-wide, or multi-wide (see  fig. 1). The federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and  construction, strength and durability, transportability, fire safety, and  energy efficiency. Units constructed and completed prior to June 15, 1976,  are not considered HUD-approved and generally are considered mobile  homes.", "Every home built to the HUD Code is identified with a red metal tag,  known as the HUD certification label. This distinguishes manufactured  homes from modular homes. Both types of homes are factory-built, but  modular home \u201cmodules\u201d are then assembled on a site. And, unlike  manufactured homes that are federally regulated under a national building  code, modular homes must meet the state, local, or regional building  codes where the home is to be sited. Finally, site-built housing is  constructed on a lot and must meet local building codes (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manufactured Homes Can Be Considered Personal or Real Property, with Corresponding Differences in Financing and Appraisals", "paragraphs": ["Unlike site-built homes, which are titled as real property and usually  financed through a mortgage, a manufactured home may be financed as  personal property or as real property. When a homebuyer purchases a  manufactured home without tying the purchase to land and does not title  the home as real property, the home is generally considered personal  property, or chattel, which denotes property that is movable and personal,  such as an automobile or furniture. Private sources\u2014such as national  consumer-finance companies and manufactured home lending specialists  who work directly with manufactured home dealers and also through FHA  Title I approved lenders\u2014provide home-only or personal property  financing, which is more akin to a consumer loan such as an automobile  loan than a mortgage. Typically, these loans have higher interest rates than  mortgages due to factors such as quick credit approval and their  availability to those with marginal credit histories. To begin the process, a  customer submits a credit application to the manufactured home lending  specialist, who may or may not be affiliated with the dealership. The credit  application also may be sent to a local bank. The lender reviews the  applicant\u2019s credit and makes a decision on whether to approve a loan.  Manufactured homes not considered real property do not undergo market- based appraisals. Instead, they undergo a loan-to-invoice appraisal, where  the manufacturer\u2019s certified invoice, in effect, substitutes for an appraisal.", "In contrast, when a manufactured home is attached to the underlying land  by a permanent foundation and the home and the land are treated as a  single real estate package under state law, the home is generally  considered real property and borrowers can obtain conventional real  estate mortgages, which include conventional and government-assisted  mortgage financing obtained through traditional mortgage lenders. Home  and land financing for manufactured homes is similar to conventional  mortgage lending for site-built housing. Manufactured homes that are  financed using a conventional real estate mortgage undergo an appraisal  that factors the location into the appraised value and also includes  comparable prices of manufactured homes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ownership Types of Manufactured Home Parks", "paragraphs": ["Manufactured homes can be placed on either private property where the  homeowner typically owns the land or in a manufactured home park. In a  manufactured home park, also known as a mobile home park or a land- lease community, owners of manufactured homes pay rent for the land  underneath the homes in addition to the loan payments they make for the  units (the homes). The park owner typically provides sewer, water,  electrical systems, landscaping, and maintains the roads and other  common areas.", "Manufactured home parks have a variety of ownership models. Investors,  ranging in size from small family operations to large conglomerates that  own several properties across the country, own most of the manufactured  home parks. Tenants of these parks may or may not have a lease and have  no control over rent increases. According to officials we interviewed, in  states such as Florida, California, and New Hampshire, resident-owned  communities are more prevalent; that is, park tenants collectively  purchased their community by forming either a for-profit or nonprofit  cooperative corporation. Cooperative ownership allows residents to  control the land by buying memberships or shares in the corporation and  have more control over membership dues increases. Another ownership  model involves a land trust, typically run through a nonprofit organization,  in which the nonprofit owns the land and ensures against the possibility of  sale or foreclosure of the land."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program", "paragraphs": ["FHA first insured loans for manufactured housing in 1969, under a  program that came to be known as the Title I Manufactured Home Loan  Program.

Under Title I, FHA can guarantee loans for manufactured homes, for  manufactured homes and the property on which they are located, or for  the purchase of a manufactured home lot.

According to officials that we interviewed, several factors  may have contributed to the decrease in manufactured home sales, such as  lower interest rates available for site-built homes, the decrease in available  financing for manufactured homes due to consolidation experienced in the  industry, and a large number of repossessions that flooded the market  with units and increased the supply of manufactured homes. For example,  as a result of the decrease in financing options for manufactured homes,  industry officials explained that manufacturers lowered production of  manufactured homes and instead built more modular homes, because  more financing options were available. Modular homes can often be built  in the same factory as manufactured housing but are not required to meet  the HUD Code.", "Although consumers purchased fewer new manufactured homes in 2005  than in 1996, according to the Census data from the Manufactured Housing  Survey, they bought more double-wide or multisection homes.

The officials cited a variety of reasons why new  manufactured homes were more likely to be placed on private property.  First, the lack of financing available for manufactured homes to be placed  on leased land decreased the likelihood of units being placed in a  manufactured home park. For example, one official stated that the lack of  manufactured home financing resulted in more manufactured homes being  placed on private land because of the increased availability of financing  for homes that are considered real property. Second, the increase in the  size of manufactured homes to double-wides or multisection could prevent  the homes from fitting into park spaces designed for smaller units. Third,  both industry and consumer officials suggested that the quality and style  of new manufactured homes had improved, allowing them to blend in with  other site-built homes on private property. Developers have created  affordable housing opportunities by using manufactured homes in infill  lots located in urban areas or subdivisions. For example, in Seattle, a  community development corporation used manufactured homes to create  affordable single-family and town homes in a development called Noji  Gardens.

The  level of protections to the homeowner in case of a foreclosure varies by  state.", "All states let the homeowner redeem the mortgage by paying off the total  outstanding debt before the sale. However, only some states let a  homeowner cure a default by paying the installments due and the costs to  reinstate the loan prior to the resale of the home. Some states may allow  the homeowner time to redeem the property from the purchaser, which  often is the lender, after the foreclosure sale by paying the purchase price  for the home, plus related costs and interest. For example, in North  Carolina, a homeowner has 10 days to redeem the property after the  foreclosure sale.", "Personal property loans typically are subject to repossession rather than  foreclosure. As with real property, the procedures can be judicial or  nonjudicial. Generally, creditors use judicial action procedures to  repossess manufactured homes. The Uniform Commercial Code, a model  code adopted by states in various forms, also authorizes a secured party,  upon default, to take possession of the collateral without judicial  process\u2014self-help repossession\u2014if that can be done without breach of  the peace. Because it may be difficult to avoid breaching the peace when  repossessing manufactured homes, this process is not likely to be used  often with manufactured homes. Time frame and notice requirements for  repossession can be less stringent than the corresponding requirements  for foreclosures. For example, the Uniform Commercial Code does not  prevent a creditor from immediately accelerating the note and  repossessing the collateral; however, some states do impose restrictions  on acceleration of repossession. Of the eight states we reviewed, five have  provisions in place that permit acceleration of repossession in certain  transactions only when the borrower is in default or in breach of the  agreement or when contract terms permit it under certain conditions. In  addition, some state statutes provide a right to cure a default prior to the  acceleration or repossession of a manufactured home and for other  consumer transactions in certain cases.", "However, Title I Manufactured Home Loan borrowers are entitled to  additional protections under FHA regulations. For instance, lenders may  not begin the process of repossession or foreclose on a property securing  a Title I loan in default unless the property has been serviced in a timely  manner and with diligence and reasonable and prudent measures have  been taken to get the borrower to bring the loan account current. Title I  borrowers, like borrowers in certain other federally-insured loan  programs, are entitled to receive written notice of their default. For Title I  borrowers, this notice includes a description of the lender\u2019s security  interest, a statement of the nature of the default and the amount due, a  demand upon the borrower to either cure the default or agree to a  modification agreement or a repayment plan, and a statement that if the  borrower fails to either cure the default or agree to a modification or a  repayment plan within 30 days of the notice, the maturity of the loan is  accelerated and full payment is required.

The terms range  from any amount of time agreed upon by the landlord and tenant to a  minimum of 2 years. However, officials in some states with whom we  spoke suggested that enforcing this requirement was difficult. Notice of  rent increases range from 60 to 90 days; however, some states do not have  notice requirements on rent increases, such as Georgia, Missouri, North  Carolina, and Texas. States also qualify the rent increase provisions in  varied ways. Arizona provides that rents generally can only increase upon  renewal or expiration of the lease and the owner has to give 90 days  notice. New Hampshire requires 60 days notice to raise rents but is silent  on the number of times the rent can increase in a given year. Industry and  consumer officials suggested the lack of ability to control monthly  payments created additional risk for both lenders and borrowers.", "Unlike owners of site-built homes, owners of manufactured homes living  on leased land can be subject to eviction for nonpayment of rent or  noncompliance with terms in lease agreements. Additionally, nonpayment  of rent can be a signal that the homeowner is behind on loan payments as  well. All states that we reviewed require good cause for eviction; however,  the amount of time that the affected party has to cure the cause for the  eviction (that is, to bring the late rent payments current) ranges from 7 to  30 days from receipt of notice. Failure to cure an eviction for an owner of  manufactured home on leased land could require the homeowner to move  from the manufactured home park. However, as mentioned earlier, such a  move may be cost-prohibitive.", "Homeowners also can be forced to move because parks close. Notice  requirements for those residents that had to move for this reason vary  from 120 to 545 days in the states we reviewed (see fig. 14). But the states  we reviewed also have a range of tools to aid the displaced owner of a  manufactured home, such as offering the park residents the right of first  refusal (the first opportunity to bid on the purchase of the park) and also  offering relocation funds or tax credits for displaced residents. For  example, one of the eight states we reviewed offers residents the right of  first refusal. However, although Arizona, New Hampshire, and Oregon do  not have a right of first refusal law, the states do have laws that provide  notice of the park sale and time in which to prepare a bid. In New  Hampshire, state law requires both the park tenants and state financing  agency receive notice when a manufactured home park is sold. The New  Hampshire Community Loan Fund then works with the park tenants to  form a nonprofit cooperative in which the tenants would own both the  land and their homes. Three states we reviewed have a relocation fund or  tax credit for displaced residents (Arizona, Florida, and Oregon). Some  interviewees suggested that in some park closures, especially those with a  lot of publicity, the developer or buyer of the land would partially  compensate the displaced residents.", "Although a few states offer relocation funds for displaced manufactured  home residents, officials from all states we reviewed cited potential  barriers in finding a place to relocate the homes, such as a lack of  vacancies in nearby parks, age requirements that park owners or  municipalities place on units, and costs associated with moving and  relocating homes. For instance, many parks will not allow homes built  before 1976, and localities in some states may have laws prohibiting  placement of homes that are more than 5 or 10 years old. Further, in states  such as Florida, wind zone requirements for certain areas may prevent the  relocation of a home not rated (certified) to withstand winds of certain  speeds.

According to some FHA and industry officials,  the potential benefits for borrowers include larger loans with lower  interest rates to buy larger homes. Also, increased access to financing for  borrowers could occur since more lenders would be more likely to  participate in the program because individual loans could be insured.  Industry officials also identified several factors unique to manufactured  home lending, such as the decreased ability of borrowers to build equity,  the location of the home (owned or leased land), and the cost of recovery  to the lender after defaults that can increase the risks of manufactured  home lending. To illustrate the effects of the proposed changes, we  developed an approach that used variations of unique risk factors  associated with manufactured home lending, as well as commonly used  predictors of loan performance, such as credit scores, to illustrate default  scenarios. Our analysis suggests that loans for homes on leased land and  to borrowers with poor credit have greater risk of default. And, in all  instances where borrowers had medium or high default risk, we show the  fund experiencing a loss. However, FHA has not yet assessed risks  associated with the proposals or detailed changes to its underwriting  requirements. The agency also has not yet collected data needed to help  assess risks such as credit scores and land type. FHA officials explained  that it had not done so because the Title I program was low-volume and  because they were unsure if the legislation would pass.

For the land-only loan, the loan  limit would increase from $16,200 to $23,226 and for combined home and  land loans, the loan limit would increase from $64,800 to $92,904.", "All but one of the bills would require a change to the mechanism that FHA  uses to insure against its insurance risk. Currently, FHA accounts for its  insurance risk by insuring only a portion (10 percent) of a lender\u2019s Title I  Manufactured Loan portfolio. For example, if a lender\u2019s portfolio in a given  year totaled $1,000,000, FHA\u2019s guarantee to the lender would not exceed  $100,000. The proposed legislation removes the portfolio cap and insures  each loan on an individual basis. However, the current risk-sharing  mechanism on individual loans between FHA and lenders (where FHA  covers 90 percent of the loss if there is a claim on a defaulted loan and the  lender absorbs the remaining 10 percent) would not change.", "Moreover, FHA would be required to establish specific underwriting  criteria to ensure the financial soundness of the program within 6 months  of the passage of the legislation. Currently, Title I regulations require a  lender to exercise prudence and diligence in underwriting a loan to  determine whether the borrower is an acceptable credit risk, such as  requiring lenders to conduct a credit investigation and obtain a credit  report. But the Title I regulations do not contain provisions that would  address other factors specific to manufactured homes, such as whether  the home is placed on owned or leased land. For Title I, FHA reviews the  lender\u2019s underwriting only when a default occurs within the first 2 years of  the loan and a lender submits a claim for insurance. FHA then has 2 years  to deny a claim for insurance even after FHA has certified the claim for  payment. The proposed legislation also would require FHA to provide  incontestable insurance endorsements, meaning that no claim could be  denied because of underwriting issues\u2014absent fraud or  misrepresentation.", "All but one of the bills would establish up-front mortgage insurance  premiums, not to exceed 2.25 percent of the loan amount and adjust the  annual insurance premiums up to 1 percent of the remaining unpaid  principal balance, rather than the original loan amount as stipulated in  current law. The remaining bill would give the agency flexibility to  establish premiums through risk-based pricing. If such a provision were  made law, FHA officials told us that they would provide a range of  premiums based on historical analysis of FHA loan data.", "Furthermore, all but one of the bills would require operations at negative  subsidies\u2014that is, without cost to the government. Currently, the Title I  program is operated at a positive subsidy, meaning that the present value  of estimated cash outflows (such as claims) to FHA\u2019s General Insurance  Fund exceed the present value of the estimated cash inflows (such as  borrower premiums). According to the Federal Credit Supplement, FHA\u2019s  Title I Manufactured Home Loan program is expected to require a $487,000  subsidy in fiscal year 2007 and a $76,000 subsidy in 2008. FHA officials  state it is unlikely the program could generate negative subsidies because  of the proposed premium structure and potential for depreciation of the  assets underlying the loans (the manufactured homes).", "Some of the bills also would require that the claim and disposition of  property for the Title I program be similar to the Title II program, where  FHA disposes of the used homes once the lender receives insurance  benefits. FHA opposes this change to the bill and proposes to continue  having the lenders dispose of the property.

These officials suggested that  increasing the loan limits would allow more borrowers to buy  manufactured homes at lower interest rates and also larger homes. As  noted earlier, in recent years buyers have expressed a heavy preference  for purchasing double-wide or multisection units.", "FHA, Ginnie Mae, and lending industry officials also suggested that  increasing the limits and eliminating the portfolio cap would increase  lender participation and demand for Title I loans, which in turn could  increase competition and decrease borrower interest rates. In particular,  Ginnie Mae officials stressed that eliminating the portfolio cap would be  central to their decision to expand their participation in the secondary  market for manufactured home loans. This, in turn, could provide more  liquidity to lenders and greater access to credit for borrowers. Ginnie Mae  was the main guarantor of securities backed by FHA Title I loans on the  secondary market up until 1989 when Ginnie Mae placed a moratorium on  new manufactured housing issuers because of the high risks associated  with the product. Currently, Ginnie Mae has four lenders in its  manufactured home program with just one active. According to Ginnie  Mae officials, it imposed the moratorium because structural features of the  Title I program, such as the portfolio cap and the nonspecific underwriting  requirements, exposed Ginnie Mae to greater risk and losses. According to  Ginnie Mae, once claim amounts were reached on troubled portfolios,  lenders had little incentive to continue servicing the portfolios and make  payments to security holders. Ginnie Mae then sustained substantial losses  when it assumed the portfolios of lenders that reached FHA coverage  limits. In addition, one lending official suggested more stringent  underwriting requirements would be beneficial to the industry, which still  is recovering from the defaults and repossessions of the early 2000s.  Industry officials suggested that federal agencies, such as FHA, and the  government-sponsored enterprises could help facilitate changes in the  industry, such as improving underwriting requirements.", "However, according to FHA and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO),  the elimination of the portfolio cap could increase significantly the amount  of claims paid and expand the government\u2019s liability under the program  since each loan would be insured on an individual basis. FHA officials also  said that they believed risk-based pricing would help compensate FHA\u2019s  insurance risk.

Based on our review of literature and interviews with lending industry  officials, owners of manufactured homes generally have less ability to  build equity than the owners of site-built homes. As assets, manufactured  home can depreciate in value after purchase, similar to automobiles. For  example, officials explained that manufactured homes bought with  personal property loans generally depreciated in value if not attached to  land. The officials emphasized that, even after years of making payments, a  borrower could choose to default on a loan if the home was worth less  than the loan balance.", "In general, manufactured homes are appraised differently when  considered real property compared to personal property. When a home is  placed on real property, the value of the home is determined based on  comparable homes in the vicinity. When a home is considered personal  property, the value is based on the price that the manufactured home  dealer had determined for the unit. However, lending officials with whom  we spoke suggested prices varied by dealers and that pricing of  manufactured homes was not transparent because dealers are not  mandated to display a manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. In addition,  states conduct little or no recording of sales data. Further, the officials  suggested that the lack of transparency resulted in some consumers  overpaying for the manufactured home, particularly in instances where the  dealer would present the price in monthly payment terms. One lender  identified California as a model state, because it requires all manufactured  home purchases to go through escrow, whether real or personal property,  which helps to monitor sales prices. This lender\u2019s loans performed  significantly better in California than in other states, and the lender  suggested that California\u2019s transparent pricing was one of the main  reasons.", "Furthermore, industry officials suggested that the location of the home on  owned or leased land is a predictor of loan performance. According to our  review of literature and interviews with industry officials, loans for  manufactured homes placed on owned land (titled as real property) tend  to perform better than loans for homes on leased land (titled as personal  property), as they tend to appreciate more. Some officials suggested  appreciation could occur on leased land, but that appreciation would be  dependant on location and amenities available (such as pools, club  houses, or golf courses).", "In contrast to other housing types, many lending industry officials  suggested that the cost of recovery for lenders when a loan defaulted was  greater with manufactured homes. For instance, for manufactured homes  the costs to the lender in a foreclosure or repossession (which may  involve the movement of the home) would be proportionately higher  relative to the loan amount than for more expensive site-built housing.  Some states have lien holder statutes in place that may help the lender  protect its collateral in cases of borrower default by requiring notification  of lenders in case of abandonment or eviction. Of the states we reviewed,  Arizona, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Texas have such a statute. Some  lending industry officials suggested that losses and high recovery costs  could be mitigated by selling the home in place. They suggested that lease  agreements between lenders and community owners should ensure that  manufactured homes located on leased land could be sold in place if  borrowers defaulted.", "According to some of lending officials we interviewed, the size of the  home also was a predictor of performance. Loans for larger manufactured  homes (double-wides or multisection units) tend to perform better than  loans for single-wides. The officials with whom we spoke suggested that  these loans performed better because the income level of those borrowers  tended to be higher. However, the majority of Title I loans have been for  single-wides, which according to FHA and industry officials was because  of the current loan limits.", "In addition, many industry officials suggested the type and quality of  installation of the home affects the value of the home and that, in theory,  states with stronger inspection programs help maintain the value of the  home for the consumer. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of  2000 set standards for installation inspections across the country, but  states continue to differ in how they monitor installation of homes. Until  recently, many states did not have a program to inspect the installation of  manufactured homes. In our review of eight state installation programs,  we found the level of inspections varied by state (see fig. 15). For example,  five of eight states require 100 percent inspection (Arizona, Florida, New  Hampshire, North Carolina, and Oregon). All of those that require 100  percent inspection had installation programs in place prior to the  implementation of the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act, except  for New Hampshire, whose requirement went into effect in July 2006. The  remaining states relied on state officials inspecting from at least one  manufactured home installer in Georgia or from 10 to 35 percent of  manufactured homes in Missouri and Texas, but Georgia and Missouri  made changes to their installation programs after the passage of the act.  Prior to these changes, the two states inspected installations on a  consumer complaint basis. Further, state programs differ in how they  conduct installation inspections. For instance, Florida, New Hampshire,  and North Carolina rely on local jurisdictions to conduct the inspections;  Arizona and Oregon use a combination of both state and local officials;  while Georgia, Missouri, and Texas use only state officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Suggests That Poor Credit and Homes Placed on Leased Land Are Key Factors Associated with Greater Risk of Defaults of Loans for Manufactured Homes", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of available data on the credit of FHA borrowers and the  location of the homes (owned or leased land), we developed scenarios  using assumptions based on various risk factors, such as the default risk of  borrowers and the ability of lenders to recover losses.

For example, from  1990 to 2002, FHA\u2019s cumulative defaults expressed as a percentage of  originated loans, did not drop below 10 percent and have exceeded 25  percent in 8 of the 13 years (see fig. 16). However, loans from 2003 to 2006  may not be reflective of the default experience because they are recent  loans and lending industry officials explained that the peak default period  for these types of loans generally occurs from the third to the fifth year.  Non-FHA manufactured housing loans also had high cumulative losses,  typically above 15 percent for loans originated between 1997 and 2001, but  lower than FHA\u2019s cumulative losses.", "Our scenarios incorporate assumptions based on factors such as annual  default rates for different yearly intervals, loan interest rates, and loan  terms. Once we established these parameters, we included additional  factors, such as variations on the lenders\u2019 ability to recover their losses in  cases of default and the borrowers\u2019 insurance premium schedule (based  on the premiums suggested in the proposed legislation). Our assumptions  about default rates reflect an important characteristic of home-only  manufactured housing loans. Even after years of loan payments, a  borrower may not have enough equity in the home to avoid a default in the  face of adverse financial conditions or may choose not to pay off a loan if  the home is worth less than the loan balance.", "Based on discussions with lending industry officials and our review of  available manufactured home lending data, we assumed three variations of  default: a low default experience, a moderate default experience, and a  high default experience. In general, the low default experience would  reflect conditions in which borrowers possessed good credit quality  (credit score), lenders used high-quality underwriting requirements, and  lenders\u2019 security interests in the collateral were well protected in terms of  those factors that are associated with the preservation of value, such as  placement of the home (owned versus leased land) and installation. The  high default experience would reflect conditions in which borrowers had  poorer credit quality, and collateral values and lenders\u2019 security interests  also were lower.", "The following assumptions in our analysis were based on discussions with  lending industry officials on possible recovery outcomes and possible  legislative changes regarding FHA\u2019s upfront and annual premiums:  If lenders had a strong recovery program (which may include a good  network of dealers who resell manufactured homes) they would  achieve a net recovery of 50 percent per claim. Alternatively, we  assumed a moderate recovery rate would be 33 percent of the claim,  and a low recovery rate would be 25 percent.", "Two different potential up-front premium amounts\u2014a high up-front  premium of 2.25 percent of the original loan amount and a low up-front  premium of 1 percent of the original loan amount.", "Two different annual premiums\u2014a high annual premium of 1 percent  of the declining loan balance and a low annual premium of 0.5 percent  of the declining loan balance.", "To determine the potential impact on FHA\u2019s General Insurance Fund, we  used the above assumptions to calculate the relationship between the  amount and timing of both expected claims and premiums to FHA. Similar  to a subsidy calculation, we estimated the present value of estimated cash  outflows (such as claims) net of the present value of the estimated cash  inflows (such as premiums) to FHA\u2019s General Insurance Fund.", "The results of our analysis show that in all instances where borrowers had  moderate or high default risk, the fund experienced a loss\u2014that is, the  present value of estimated cash outflows exceeded the present value of  cash inflows (see fig. 17). The range of the loss was determined by the  lender\u2019s ability to recover its losses and the premiums the borrower paid.  For instance, in cases where the borrower paid high up-front and annual  premiums (2.25 percent and 1 percent, respectively) and was a moderate  default risk, and the lender had a high net recovery rate (50 percent), the  loss to the fund was less than 1 percent. However, if we varied the  scenario to lower the recovery rate for lenders (25 percent), the potential  loss to the fund was 4.4 percent. Similarly, when the borrower paid low  up-front and annual premiums (1 percent and 0.5 percent) and had  moderate default risk, the losses ranged from 4.4 percent if the lender had  a high net recovery rate to 8.5 percent if the lender had a low recovery  rate. The fund had the potential to experience gains in instances where the  borrower had low default risk, premiums were higher, and lenders had a  higher probability of high recovery of losses.", "Our analysis also showed that there is potential for FHA\u2019s General  Insurance Fund to experience a wide variation in the level of losses but  little potential for gains. The results suggested that there is greater risk of  loss from borrowers who have either moderate or high default risk.  Typically, these are loans where the borrower may not have a high credit  score, and the property is located on leased land\u2014in which case the  lender\u2019s security interest may be uncertain because of the variability  associated with rent increases, lease terms, and the potential for the  manufactured home park to be sold. In addition, the amount of the loss  was influenced by the amount of premiums paid. For instance, where  borrowers paid the highest up-front and annual premium, the loss was 11  percent in cases where the borrower also had high default risk and the  lender had low recovery, compared with a 15 percent loss in instances  where the borrower paid a low up-front and annual premium. However,  since FHA does not currently collect data on credit score or where the  property is located\u2014owned or leased land\u2014it is unclear how these  scenarios may actually affect the General Insurance Fund.

Our  internal control standards for federal agencies state that effective  management involves comprehensively identifying risk as part of short-  and long-term planning.

FHA officials told us that they have begun to analyze a range of  up-front premiums and a maximum premium amount based on a historical  analysis of receipts and claims, but that they had not yet reached any  conclusions. In addition, FHA has not conducted an analysis to determine  under what conditions the program could operate at a negative subsidy if  the proposed changes were enacted.

CBO estimated that, if the legislation were enacted, FHA  could achieve a near zero subsidy for the Title I program assuming default  rates would be at 9.5 percent or lower. CBO also acknowledged that  because of the uniqueness of FHA\u2019s program and lack of comparative  programs in the private market, the potential costs of the program are  uncertain. The results of our analysis suggest that, in almost all situations,  there is potential for loss except when borrowers have lower default risk  (based on credit scores and other information).

FHA officials did explain they would like to  establish review procedures when a loan is submitted for insurance,  similar to the procedures in FHA\u2019s Title II loan program. In Title II, FHA  conducts post-endorsement reviews of 10 percent of its loans, with FHA  staff going over the lender\u2019s underwriting decisions and calculations.", "In explaining the agency\u2019s limited assessments, FHA officials noted that  the agency is focusing its resources on assessing the impact of proposed  changes to the much larger Title II Mortgage Insurance program. As of  May 2007, FHA\u2019s risk-based pricing proposal for the Title II program  established six different risk categories, each with a different premium  rate, for purchase and refinance loans. FHA used data from its most recent  actuarial review to establish six risk categories and corresponding  premiums based on the relative performance of loans with various  combinations of loan-to-value ratio (the ratio of the amount of the  mortgage loan to the value of the home) and credit score. Further, since  the current volume of the Title I program is low, FHA officials did not  anticipate large losses for the fund. However, the programmatic changes in  the proposed legislation are designed to increase the demand for Title I  manufactured home loans. FHA officials told us that once the legislation is  passed, it would take up to a year to implement changes to the program  and to work on developing the risk-based pricing strategy; however, they  were unsure if they would implement the program in stages or all at once.", "As a result of FHA not conducting risk assessments or determining  underwriting requirements, potential effects of changes to the Title I  program remain unclear.

In 2004, FHA started to collect  information on borrower demographics, such as gender, address, birth  date, and monthly income.

These differences create additional risks for both  the borrowers and lenders of manufactured homes. For example, the  ability for the homeowner to build equity is constrained if the property is  located on leased land and the land ownership also affects the ability of  the lender to recover its losses relative to other types of lending. These  risks are reflected in the performance of the Title I program, which has a  history of high default rates, as does the manufactured home lending  industry. However, the Title I program also provides a unique product as  the only active federal program offering insurance for home-only (personal  property) loans. According to recent FHA data, the majority of its  borrowers are younger and lower-income, suggesting that Title I helps  them achieve homeownership.", "But changing and expanding a lending program can introduce new risks  and increase existing risks. FHA only insured slightly more than 1,400  loans in 2006. Changes to the Title I program are expected to increase loan  volume, which could generate the desirable outcome of providing more  lower-priced loans to lower-income individuals desiring to purchase a  home. Yet, both FHA and CBO suggest proposed changes can increase  FHA\u2019s insurance risk and expand the government\u2019s liability. The extent of  gains or losses to FHA\u2019s General Insurance Fund will depend on a variety  of factors, such as the borrower\u2019s default risk, the lender\u2019s ability to  recover losses, and the amount of premiums paid. However, FHA has not  articulated which borrowers would be served, how the loans would be  priced under a risk-based structure and the expected increase in risk to  the General Insurance Fund, how the loans would be underwritten, and  the additional data it plans to collect to manage the program. Thus, the  agency lacks vital information for implementing any changes to the  program. If FHA were to conduct such risk identification, it could plan to  anticipate changes to the program, target new borrower populations, and  more effectively manage existing loan portfolios. In particular, with  indications of whether the program could generate positive or negative  subsidies, the agency could make appropriate and well-informed decisions  about pricing premiums. For example, an analysis similar to the one we  performed would provide at least an indication of what scenarios would  produce the highest risks for losses to the fund.

The sample of  manufactured home dealers surveyed fluctuates based on the total number  of manufactured homes shipped. Specifically, we used Manufactured  Housing Survey data from 1996 through 2005 to examine trends in the  manufactured housing industry, such as the number of homes sold,  average sales price, where the homes were placed (owned or leased land),  and the size of these homes (single-wide versus double-wide units). To  determine demographic characteristics of manufactured home owners, we  relied on the 2005 American Housing Survey. Census conducts the  American Housing Survey every 2 years, sampling approximately 55,000  housing units to gather data on apartments; single-family homes;  manufactured or mobile homes; vacant housing units; age, sex, race and  income of householders; housing and neighborhood quality; housing costs;  equipment and fuels; and the size of the housing units. We choose to use  2005 American Housing Survey data since they were the latest available.  We did not provide information on trends in earlier years because the  sample of manufactured housing used in previous surveys (through 2003)  changed, making it difficult to compare 2005 data with previous data. Data  on land ownership for manufactured homes (that is, owned or leased land)  was limited in the Manufactured Housing and American Housing Surveys;  as a result, we could not report differences in the data for where the  manufactured home was placed.

Since each  sample could have produced different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a  confidence interval. For example, the estimated percentage of occupied  manufactured homes located in the South was 56.7 percent, and the  confidence interval for this estimate ranges from 56.6 percent to 56.8  percent, with a percentage point error of 0.1 percent. This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples that could have been drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent (or  more) confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will  include the true values in the study population.

We also conducted a review of newspaper articles  from May 2005 to May 2007 to identify where manufactured home park  closures occurred in the United States. Because states collect different  types of information on manufactured home parks and even define them  differently, the consequent variability of the state data makes determining  the number of manufactured home parks extremely difficult. Thus, we  relied on a database search of national and local newspapers to provide  anecdotal information on park closures.

For instance, the ability of the owner  of a manufactured home to build equity may be limited when the land is  leased, which also often increases the risks associated with the loan. If a  borrower with a home on leased land were to default, lenders could face  higher costs and lower recoveries (relative to site-built homes) in trying to  repossess, move, and resell the personal property.", "We developed a model to illustrate some of the ways in which these key  factors may affect the performance of home-only manufactured housing  loans, and, thus, how variation in these key factors may affect potential  gains and losses to the FHA\u2019s General Insurance Fund, which is supported  by insurance premiums and used for several FHA insurance programs,  including the Title I program.

Further, because  FHA has not yet developed its risk-based pricing criteria for the proposed  legislative changes, we made different assumptions about the level of up- front mortgage insurance premiums and periodic insurance premium  payments based on the amounts discussed in the proposed legislation. By  varying the default rate, loss recovery, and premium rate assumptions, we  were able to generate a variety of loan performance and recovery  scenarios, and illustrate in a very general way the potential for gains and  losses to FHA General Insurance Fund that characterize each scenario.", "In the absence of available data on the credit of FHA borrowers and the  location of the homes (owned or leased land), we attempted to benchmark  these scenarios based on the experience of FHA\u2019s Title I program since  1990 and of non-FHA personal property manufactured housing loans. In  terms of FHA Title I experience since 1990, while the number of loans  originated dropped significantly from the early to mid-1990s, cumulative  defaults expressed as a percentage of originated loans did not fall below  10 percent from 1990 to 2002 and have exceeded 25 percent in 8 of the 13  years (see fig. 18). However, loans from 2003 to 2006 may not be reflective  of the default experience because they are recent loans and lending  industry officials explained that the peak default period for these types of  loans generally occurs from the third to the fifth year. In terms of non-FHA  loan performance, cumulative losses typically have been above 15 percent  for loans originated between 1997 and 2001.", "The scenarios incorporate assumptions based on factors such as annual  default rates for different yearly intervals, loan interest rates, and loan  terms. Once we established these parameters, we factored in additional  assumptions and variations for the net recovery rate of the lender and an  insurance premium schedule for the borrower based on discussions with  lending industry officials on possible default scenarios, recovery  outcomes, and possible legislative changes regarding FHA\u2019s upfront and  annual premiums. The discussion below provides more detailed  information on our assumptions.", "Assumptions on Annual Default Rates. We characterized the peak  period of default as years 3 through 5, and we described the default  experience in years after this peak period in terms of a percentage of  the default rate assumed to hold during the peak period. In general, and  based on our discussions with lenders and others, we assumed that  default rates in years after the peak period would be 75 percent of what  they were during the peak period. In the high loss scenario, we  assumed that the peak period default rate also held in years 6 through 9  before dropping to 75 percent of the peak value. Our assumptions  about default rates reflect an important characteristic of home-only  manufactured housing loans: Even after years of loan amortization, a  borrower may not have enough equity in the home to avoid a default in  the face of adverse financial conditions.", "We present three variations of default: a low default experience, a  moderate default experience, and a high default experience. In general, the  low default experience would reflect conditions in which borrowers  possessed good credit quality, lenders used high quality underwriting  requirements, and lenders\u2019 security interests were well protected in terms  of those factors that are associated with the preservation of value, such  the placement of the home (owned land versus leased land) and  installation. The high default experience would reflect conditions in which  borrowers are of poorer credit quality, and collateral values and lenders\u2019  security interests are also poorer (see fig. 19).", "Assumptions Based on Annual Prepayment Rates. We assumed that  prepayments were constant at 4 percent per year. Modest changes in  this level did not lead to much difference in our results. Based on our  discussions with lenders and others, we believe manufactured home- only loan borrowers were not as likely as other homeowners to prepay  in the face of favorable refinancing opportunities. As a result, some of  these loans default in later years, but they also continue to generate  annual insurance premiums.", "Additional Scenario Assumptions. Using the prepayment rates and  default rates that we selected, we calculated the value of claims in a  given year as the (unpaid) principal balance due in that year based on  an amortization schedule relating the selected interest rate and loan  term. Based on assumed prepayment and default patterns, we  calculated cumulative defaults and losses, expressed as a percentage of  the original loan balance, losses, and insurance premiums paid by year.", "We also calculate the present value of FHA\u2019s share of losses and the  present value of annual insurance premiums.", "Assumptions on the Net Recovery Rate of Lenders. To provide  variations in our analysis, we make different assumptions on the  lenders\u2019 ability to recover losses when a loan defaults. Based on  discussions with industry officials, we assume lenders that have a  strong recovery program (which may include a good network of  dealers who resell manufactured homes) may have a net recovery of 50  percent per claim. Those lenders who have moderate net recovery are  assumed to receive 33 percent of the claim, and those lenders with a  low net recovery may receive 25 percent of the claim.", "Assumptions on the Insurance Premiums. Insurance premiums may  include an up-front payment and annual payment. FHA has not yet  developed its proposed risk-based pricing for potential FHA Title I  Manufactured Home Loan borrowers. However, several bills  introduced in Congress suggests the up-front annual insurance  premiums would not exceed 2.25 percent and the annual insurance  premium would be 1 percent of the annual unpaid principal balance of  the loan. For our analysis, we assumed two different potential up-front  premium amounts: the highest up-front premium was 2.25 percent of  the original loan amount and the lowest up-front premium was 1  percent of the original loan amount. We also assume two different  annual premiums; the highest annual premium was defined as 1  percent of the declining loan balance and lowest annual premium was  defined as 0.5 percent of the declining loan balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Andy Finkel (Assistant Director),  Steve Brown, Tania Calhoun, Nadine Garrick, Phil Herr, Alison Martin,  John Mingus Jr., Marc Molino, Tina Paek, and Barbara Roesmann made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
