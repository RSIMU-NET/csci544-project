ECA officials attributed these deficits to various factors, including the economic upheaval in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.", "The costs of these programs are difficult to compare because countries use different budgeting techniques to record their costs. Except for the Eximbank\u2019s costs for 1992 and 1993, the level of support shown in table 3 represents the net cash flows associated with the five EU member state programs rather than the estimated long-term program costs.

Under this approach, the government reimburses the ECA for the total cash losses sustained on government-supported operation during the year. However, total cash losses for any 1 year are not indicative of current-year performance because losses on prior-year loans are included in this total. Although not subject to the same budgeting requirements as the Eximbank, the U.K.\u2019s ECA is subject to relatively stringent financial discipline.

In addition, the Eximbank\u2019s loan guarantees, which constituted virtually all (92 percent) of its 1994 medium-and long-term cover business, provide exporters with unconditional repayment protection. These features increase the attractiveness of the Eximbank\u2019s programs to exporters. In contrast, four of the EU ECAs require exporters and banks to share some\u2014usually at least 5 percent to as much as 15 percent\u2014of an export transaction\u2019s risk. In addition, the coverage the four EU ECAs offer is more conditional in that an ECA is to reimburse claims only if specified conditions have been met. The U.K.\u2019s ECA is the only EU ECA that offers unconditional 100-percent risk coverage. The maximum risk levels that these six ECAs can cover are summarized in table 5.", "Exporters, banks, and governments face a number of trade-offs due to the differences in the Eximbank\u2019s and EU ECAs\u2019 programs.", "First, the time needed to approve applications and pay claims differs between the Eximbank and other EU ECAs. For those transactions in which the Eximbank provides 100-percent unconditional risk protection, it assumes all of the risks of the export transactions it covers. Hence, the Eximbank must thoroughly assess the suitability of such transactions before giving approval for cover. These comprehensive reviews tend to lengthen the application process and decrease the attractiveness of the Eximbank\u2019s programs to exporters, according to Eximbank and EU ECA officials.", "The Eximbank\u2019s requirements for careful up-front reviews have led to persistent complaints from U.S. exporters. According to the Eximbank\u2019s annual assessment of its competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis its major competitors,U.S. exporters and commercial bankers that the Eximbank surveyed praised the attractiveness of specific Eximbank programs and products but complained in 1992 and 1993 about the Eximbank\u2019s slow processing times and excessive paperwork requirements. However, because the Eximbank reviews applications in detail before giving its approval, it can reimburse relatively quickly customers who later make claims for export losses (within about 1 week for the Eximbank\u2019s loan guarantees). This increases the attractiveness of the Eximbank\u2019s programs to exporters and participating banks.", "In contrast, because ECAs in four of the five EU countries offer more conditional cover, they can quickly approve applications\u2014in some cases, within 1 to 2 days\u2014after receiving the initial application. However, the trade-off is that these EU ECAs require exporters to prove the validity of any later claims made after they issue cover policies. Thus, exporters can wait months to receive reimbursement for export losses. Dutch banking officials noted that the waiting period for claims reimbursements is typically 3 to 6 months from when losses occur. A French ECA official noted that small claims ($3,000 or less) are paid within 2 months and all other claims within 5 months of when they are submitted. Recognizing these trade-offs and concerns about up-front processing times, the Eximbank introduced a more conditional medium-term insurance policy for exporters and banks in 1994. The Eximbank expects the conditionality of the policy to result in faster application processing times.", "Second, the level of risk-sharing between ECAs and participating banks may influence bank behavior. The Eximbank assumes 100 percent of the risks on most of the medium- and long-term cover that it issues. This feature increases the attractiveness of the program to exporters, according to Eximbank and EU ECA officials, but reduces some of the incentive for cautious lending behavior among the banks that obtain these guarantees. The Eximbank thus assumes more of the responsibility and the associated administrative costs of reviewing applications for export-financing assistance since it does not require banks to share the risks of these transactions.", "In contrast, most EU ECAs share some of the risks of covered transactions with exporters and banks. Thus, exporters and participating banks review the financial soundness of proposed export transactions more carefully, according to EU ECA officials. According to EU government and banking industry officials, such risk sharing helps shift some of the responsibility and associated administrative costs of reviewing cover applications from ECAs to exporters and financing institutions. Some risk sharing may soon be an EU-wide requirement. The EU has issued proposed rules that would require some minimum level of private-sector risk sharing in most EU ECA covered transactions. EU officials believe that exporters will make more responsible judgments if they stand to lose money in a bad deal.", "Finally, trade-offs exist between fiscal discipline and premium levels charged to exporters and banks. To reduce the government costs of its program, the U.K. has required its ECA to be self-funding on any new cover business undertaken after 1991. Since this requirement went into effect, the U.K. ECA has charged relatively high prices for its products, particularly in high-risk markets. According to U.K. exporters, this puts them at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the other nations\u2019 exporters. In contrast, none of the other EU ECAs or the Eximbank are required to be self-funded. Despite offering a higher quality product (unconditional and greater risk coverage), the Eximbank generally charges lower premiums than those charged by other ECAs (the exception being premiums charged for medium-term financing to low-risk countries).

The OECD Consensus does not currently apply either to the premiums charged for export cover or to agricultural products.", "The EU has renewed previous efforts to harmonize export credit insurance and loan guarantee programs among its member states. After relatively unsuccessful attempts to achieve such harmonization in the 1970s, the EU proposed legislation in July 1994 that would harmonize officially supported medium- and long-term export credit insurance systems among its member states. The proposed legislation is still under review within the EU and among the member states. The EU is also considering a proposal that would prevent member states from subsidizing export credit insurance or loan guarantees for certain short-term risks that the private sector can cover.", "Finally, the Berne Union serves as an international forum for export insurers from 34 countries to exchange views and information on their export credit programs. Members of the Berne Union, which include the Eximbank and the ECAs of the five EU countries, have also agreed to a \u201cGeneral Understanding\u201d and other agreements. The General Understanding governs terms on downpayments, starting points for credit terms, and repayment schedules on certain export transactions.
