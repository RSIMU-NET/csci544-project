Specifically, over this 5-year period, 64 percent was allocated through initiatives that directly benefit state and local efforts to reduce DNA backlogs and build DNA analysis capacity. The largest initiative was NIJ's DNA Backlog Reduction Program, and other DNA backlog initiatives included DNA analysis of cold cases, among others. A smaller portion (31 percent) went to other forensic sciences initiatives, such as research and development and training, although NIJ officials stated that funding these initiatives may have long-term benefits for reducing the DNA backlog. The remainder of the funding went toward other activities, such as management and administration.", "NIJ has a process in place to determine DNA and forensic program funding priorities, but its decisions regarding these priorities are not clearly documented. According to NIJ officials, the rationale for funding the DNA Backlog Reduction Program versus other initiatives is documented in briefing slides, but these documents do not show NIJ's rationale for how funding priorities are determined. For example, while the budget documents for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 show the final amounts NIJ decided to allocate to various initiatives, these documents do not provide details on the justifications for how funding levels were determined for each initiative. Without a clearly documented process that demonstrates the rationale for NIJ's annual funding priorities, there is limited transparency regarding how and why the agency is allocating its funding.", "NIJ could verify data and revise its performance measure to better assess the DNA Backlog Reduction Program. NIJ assesses performance of this program by requiring grantees to submit reports every 6 months that, in part, outline their progress in meeting program goals and objectives. However, NIJ does not have an approach to verify the reliability of the data--testing data to ensure data quality--and as a result, faces continuing data errors. Verifying these data would help ensure that the data are reliable enough to show that the program is successfully meeting its goals. In addition, NIJ has a performance measure to assess the results of this program--percent of reduction in DNA backlog casework--but it is a projection of DNA casework that grantees expect to complete as opposed to an actual tabulation of completed cases.

As a result, NIJ allocated funds for both its DNA backlog  initiatives and other forensic science initiatives based on NIJ\u2019s mission  and annual budgeting priorities. For instance, over the 5-year period, NIJ  provided funding through the DNA Backlog Reduction Program, other  discretionary DNA backlog initiatives such as analyzing DNA samples  from cold cases, and other forensic science initiatives awarded through  grants and nongrants including research, development, and evaluation;  forensic science training; and support for the development of best  practices.", "NIJ allocated the majority\u2014about 64 percent, or $442 million of the  available $691 million in the DNA and forensic program appropriations\u2014 to DNA backlog initiatives.

According to NIJ  officials, these awards directly affected the DNA backlog by providing  funds to state and local entities for either analyzing DNA samples or  increasing the capacity of state and local laboratories to conduct DNA  sample analyses. Additionally, NIJ awarded approximately 31 percent,  or $212 million of the available $691 million, to other DNA and forensic  science purposes that do not directly reduce the DNA backlog. NIJ  officials stated that funding from some of these initiatives may have  indirect or long-term benefits for reducing the DNA backlog.

For instance, in fiscal year 2008, NIJ awarded  about 36 percent of the total amount available to NIJ to obligate for the  DNA Backlog Reduction Program. By 2012, NIJ had increased the  amount to about 63 percent of the total available for obligation. At the  same time, funds awarded through its other DNA backlog initiatives  generally decreased. See figure 2 for the proportion of funds provided for  the DNA Backlog Reduction Program and other backlog initiatives by  fiscal year.", "NIJ officials stated that the increased funding for the DNA Backlog  Reduction Program was primarily because the agency decided to  prioritize the program more than its other initiatives. In addition, NIJ  officials stated that funding also increased when the agency subsumed  the Convicted Offender and/or Arrestee DNA Backlog Reduction Program  into the larger DNA Backlog Reduction Program starting in 2011. As a  result, the new program had a larger scope and provided more money to  grantees through NIJ\u2019s continued emphasis on this program.", "We also analyzed the breakdown of the grants and nongrant awards for  other forensic science initiatives that do not directly contribute to reducing  the DNA backlog.

NIJ officials stated that the  agency funded these projects because they provide valuable services  and resources to practitioners solving crimes with DNA. For instance,  DNA-related research can lead to faster and better methods for  recovering and analyzing DNA. Also, NIJ officials stated that the agency\u2019s  mission includes facilitating faster and better DNA-related knowledge  transfer across the country.

According to NIJ officials, NIJ  staff use the prior fiscal years\u2019 funding as a starting point to make a  proposed initial estimate of the amount to be allocated to the DNA  Backlog Reduction Program. Specifically, NIJ staff examine the amount of  funds remaining on active formula grant awards from prior fiscal years,  and then use historical funding data to determine what is needed to fund  eligible applicants for the next fiscal year. After the proposed initial  allocation for the DNA Backlog Reduction Program has been determined,  NIJ staff then develop an initial recommendation for how the estimated  remaining funding will be allocated to other DNA and forensic initiatives.  In addition, NIJ uses the professional expertise of its forensic staff, as well  as input from NIJ-sponsored Technology Working Groups (TWG). These  groups are committees of 25 to 30 experienced practitioners from local,  state, tribal and federal agencies and laboratories associated with a  particular NIJ technology investment portfolio, such as DNA Forensics or  General Forensics, that help NIJ determine the criminal justice technology  needs of the field. After NIJ staff arrive at proposed allocations among  the initiatives, staff brief the Director of NIJ with documents\u2014such as  budget briefing slides or funding memos\u2014that outline their priority areas.

NIJ then posts each solicitation to  the NIJ web site and either a federal government grant website or an OJP  web-based system in order to accept proposals from qualified applicants  applying for funding. Qualified proposals submitted in response to a  competitive solicitation are subjected to a peer review process and  evaluated for their scientific merit. Funding recommendations for  individual proposals are, in part, informed by peer review and, in the case  of forensics-related research proposals, the needs and priorities identified  by the TWGs.", "According to NIJ officials, the rationale for funding allocation decisions,  such as the amount to be used for the DNA Backlog Reduction Program,  is documented in the briefing slides and funding memos that are  presented to the NIJ Director. However, according to our review, these  documents do not consistently or adequately demonstrate NIJ\u2019s rationale  for how funding priorities are determined. Specifically, from fiscal years  2008 through 2011, NIJ used budget briefing slides to present funding  priorities to the NIJ Director. These briefing slides showed the various  initiatives and the amount of funding NIJ proposed to allocate to each  initiative, but they did not consistently provide justifications for how or why  NIJ determined these amounts. For fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the  briefing slides included rationale sections that were descriptions of the  funding being allocated rather than justifications for why NIJ chose to  allocate specific funding amounts to each initiative. For example, for fiscal  year 2008, for the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence initiative,  NIJ provided an itemized list of the funding request and projects in the  rationale section. For fiscal year 2010, the budget briefing document  outlined recommended changes to the DNA Backlog Reduction Program,  such as adjusting minimum funding levels available to states and units of  local government. However, the document did not include any rationale  for this decision. For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, NIJ changed its process  from using briefing slides to using funding memos to present funding  prioritization decisions to the NIJ Director. While these memos show the  final amounts NIJ decided to allocate to various initiatives, they do not  provide details on the justifications for how funding levels were  determined for each initiative. Further, although NIJ had a category for  rationale in the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 briefing slides, this practice  ended beginning with fiscal year 2010. According to NIJ officials, there  was no longer a need to include a rationale in the briefing slides because  the briefings to the NIJ Director began occurring later in the prioritization  process and the Director\u2019s signature, indicating approval of funding  prioritization decisions, had already been obtained.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  internal control and all transactions and other significant events need to  be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily  available for examination. The documentation should appear in  management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals,  and all documentation and records should be properly managed and  maintained. The standards also state that transactions and significant  events are to be clearly documented to help management with decision  making and to help ensure operations are carried out as intended.", "According to NIJ officials, the budget briefing slides for fiscal years 2008  through 2011 and the funding memos for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 are  the only documents the agency uses to show its rationale for prioritization  of the DNA and forensic program appropriation. Additionally, in light of  budget uncertainty from year to year, NIJ officials believe their current  process is the most useful because it allows the agency flexibility for  making decisions. However, without a clearly documented process that  demonstrates the rationale for how NIJ is prioritizing its DNA and forensic  program appropriation, there is limited transparency regarding how and  why the agency is allocating its funding. In addition, documenting the  agency\u2019s rationale for prioritizing funding\u2014regardless of the timing of the  briefing to the NIJ Director\u2014would be worthwhile so that there is a record  of the agency\u2019s decision.

Furthermore, NIJ reports performance data in OJP\u2019s annual Performance  Budget to show progress in reducing the DNA backlog. Without an  approach to verify grantee-reported data, NIJ cannot provide assurance  that grantees have valid and auditable source documentation for the data  they report, as required by OJP. In addition, NIJ officials are not required  to verify performance data when reviewing progress reports. NIJ  estimated that 30 percent of progress reports were sent back to grantees  for correction because they contained errors. However, because program  managers are not required to verify performance data, NIJ cannot be  certain that the remaining 70 percent of progress reports were free of  data errors. As a result, NIJ cannot provide a sufficient level of confidence  to Congress and the public that performance data associated with the  DNA Backlog Reduction Program are reliable enough to show that the  program is successfully meeting its goals or reducing the DNA backlog.  As part of its site visit monitoring efforts, during which time NIJ officials  have access to grantees\u2019 original source data, NIJ could, for example,  assess whether additional edit checks are needed to better ensure data  are reliable. Although there could be a cost associated with such efforts,  defining a cost-effective approach to verify its performance measurement  data would better position NIJ to help ensure that it is providing quality  information to the public, internal agency officials, and congressional  decision makers who play a role in determining where to allocate NIJ  funding resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIJ\u2019s Performance Measure Includes Estimated, but Not Actual Outcomes of the DNA Backlog Reduction Program", "paragraphs": ["We also found that the performance measure NIJ uses to measure  results of the DNA Backlog Reduction Program may yield an incomplete  picture. The performance measure, reported as \u201cpercent of reduction in  DNA backlog casework,\u201d is a projection of DNA casework that grantees  expect to complete as opposed to an actual tabulation of completed  cases. Using data submitted by grantees, NIJ calculates the number of  cases grantees expect to test with future funding, divided by the DNA  casework backlog reported by grantees at the end of the calendar year. In  fiscal year 2011, for example, the reported percent reduction was 32.9  percent and was based on a calculation of the estimated number of cases  grantees expected to be completed, divided by the total DNA casework  backlog. Grantees submit their estimated number of cases to NIJ in their  funding applications before they are awarded the grants and begin work.  Further, these grantees have up to 3 years to complete their work.", "NIJ officials explained that reducing the DNA backlog is a DOJ goal in  support of GPRA and the agency reports this measure in OJP\u2019s annual  Performance Budget. According to officials, the DNA Backlog Reduction  Program is NIJ\u2019s program with the most immediate impact in reducing the  DNA backlog. However, NIJ\u2019s performance measure does not  demonstrate actual results, as required by GPRA, as amended.", "In addition, NIJ has established a target of 25 percent reduction in DNA  backlog casework, which NIJ officials stated that they establish based on  historical knowledge. However, NIJ\u2019s target is also a projection of the  DNA casework that grantees expect to achieve based on estimates  submitted in grantee applications.", "Our prior work on GPRA states that agencies that were successful in  measuring performance strived to establish performance measures that,  among other things, enable an organization to assess accomplishments,  make decisions, realign processes, assign accountability, and  demonstrate results so as to tell each organizational level how well it is  achieving its goals. In addition, in our work assessing performance  measures, we identified that performance measures should provide  useful information for decision making by providing managers and other  stakeholders timely, action-oriented information in a format that helps  them make decisions that improve program performance. Measures that  do not provide managers with useful information will not alert managers  and other stakeholders to the existence of problems or help them respond  when problems arise.", "According to NIJ officials, the agency is unable to develop a performance  measure that reports actual cases completed (on the fiscal year basis  called for in OJP\u2019s annual budget submission) under the DNA Backlog  Reduction Program because grantees have up to 3 years to complete  their work and the completed number of cases for the entire grant period  is not known until the grant period closes. In addition, NIJ officials  explained that they would prefer a more meaningful measure, but the  current measure captures NIJ\u2019s best guess of the percentage reduction in  DNA backlog casework.", "While measuring annual performance for multi-year grants can be  challenging, NIJ could take steps to better assess the results of DNA  backlog efforts by analyzing performance data on actual cases  completed, which the agency already collects from grantees every 6  months as part of the grantees\u2019 progress reports. In fact, for grants that  have not yet closed, NIJ has already started analyzing actual  performance data to identify grantees\u2019 annual progress in meeting goals.", "Such data, once sufficiently reliable, could help NIJ to better assess  actual results and develop a more accurate performance measure.  Officials from OJP\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer\u2014the office  responsible for reporting performance measure information\u2014stated that  in order to modify a measure, NIJ would need to propose the change and  OJP would submit the proposed revised measure, with approval of other  components of DOJ, to OMB in the OJP annual budget submission.", "By revising its performance measure to include casework actually  completed, NIJ will be better situated to provide decision makers with  timely, action-oriented information that helps them make decisions that  improve program performance or that alerts them to the existence of  problems so they can respond to them when they arise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As reported by DOJ, federal funds to address the persisting backlogs of  untested DNA samples, among other things, have provided needed  support to state and local laboratories to help resolve criminal cases.
