VA provided health care to over 281,000 women veterans in 2008--an increase of about 12 percent since 2006--and the number of women veterans in the United States is projected to increase by 17 percent between 2008 and 2033. Women veterans seeking care at VA medical facilities need access to a full range of health care services, including basic gender-specific services--such as cervical cancer screening--and specialized gender-specific services--such as treatment of reproductive cancers. This testimony, based on ongoing work, discusses GAO's preliminary findings on (1) the on-site availability of health care services for women veterans at VA facilities, (2) the extent to which VA facilities are following VA policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans, and (3) some key challenges that VA facilities are experiencing in providing health care services for women veterans. GAO reviewed applicable VA policies, interviewed officials, and visited 19 medical facilities--9 VA medical centers (VAMC) and 10 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC)--and 10 Vet Centers. These facilities were chosen based in part on the number of women using services and whether facilities offered specific programs for women. The results from these site visits cannot be generalized to all VA facilities. GAO shared this statement with VA officials, and they generally agreed with the information presented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The VA facilities GAO visited provided basic gender-specific and outpatient mental health services to women veterans on-site, and some facilities also provided specialized gender-specific or mental health services specifically designed for women on-site. Basic gender-specific services, including pelvic examinations, were available on-site at all nine VAMCs and 8 of the 10 CBOCs GAO visited. Almost all of the medical facilities GAO visited offered women veterans access to one or more female providers for their gender-specific care. The availability of specialized gender-specific services for women, including treatments after abnormal cervical cancer screenings and breast cancer, varied by service and facility. All VA medical facilities refer female patients to non-VA providers for obstetric care. Some of the VAMCs GAO visited offered a broad array of other specialized gender-specific services on site, but all contracted or fee-based at least some services. Among CBOCs, the two largest facilities GAO visited offered an array of specialized gender-specific care on-site; the other eight referred women to other VA or non-VA facilities for most of these services. Outpatient mental health services for women were widely available at the VAMCs and most Vet Centers GAO visited, but were more limited at some CBOCs. While the two larger CBOCs offered group counseling for women and services specifically for women who have experienced sexual trauma in the military, the smaller CBOCs tended to rely on VAMC staff,often through videoconferencing, to provide mental health services. The extent to which the VA medical facilities GAO visited were following VA policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans varied, but none of the facilities had fully implemented these policies. None of the VAMCs and CBOCs GAO visited were fully compliant with VA policy requirements related to privacy for women veterans in all clinical settings where those requirements applied. For example, many of the medical facilities GAO visited did not have adequate visual and auditory privacy in their check-in areas. Further, the facilities GAO visited were in various stages of implementing VA's new initiative to provide comprehensive primary care for women veterans, but officials at some VAMCs and CBOCs reported that they were unclear about the specific steps they would need to take to meet the goals of the new policy. Officials at facilities that GAO visited identified a number of challenges they face in providing health care services to the increasing numbers of women veterans seeking VA health care. One challenge was that space constraints have raised issues affecting the provision of health care services. For example, the number, size, or configuration of exam rooms or bathrooms sometimes made it difficult for facilities to comply with VA requirements related to privacy for women veterans. Officials also reported challenges hiring providers with specific training and experience in women's health care and in mental health care, such as treatment for women veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or who had experienced military sexual trauma."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as the subcommittees consider issues  related to the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) delivery of health care  services to women veterans. Historically, the vast majority of VA patients  have been men, but that is changing. As of October 2008, there were more  than 1.8 million women veterans in the United States (representing  approximately 7.7 percent of the total veteran population), and more than  102,000 of these women were veterans of the military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq, known as Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and  Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). According to VA data, in fiscal year 2008,  over 281,000 women veterans received health care services from VA\u2014an  increase of about 12 percent since 2006. Looking ahead, VA estimates that  while the total number of veterans will decline by 37 percent between 2008  and 2033, the number of women veterans will increase by more than   17 percent over the same period.", "The health care services needed by women veterans are significantly  different from those required by their male counterparts. Women veterans  are younger, in the aggregate, than their male counterparts. Based on an  analysis conducted by the VA in 2007, the estimated median age of women  veterans was 47, whereas the estimated median age of male veterans was  61. Women veterans seeking care at VA medical facilities need access to a  full range of physical health care services, including basic gender-specific  services\u2014such as breast examinations, cervical cancer screening, and  menopause management\u2014and specialized gender-specific services such  as obstetric care (which includes prenatal, labor and delivery, and  postpartum care) and treatment of reproductive cancers. Women veterans  also need access to a range of mental health care services, such as care for  depression.", "In addition, women veterans of OEF/OIF present new challenges for VA\u2019s  health care system. Almost all of these women are under the age of 40\u2014  58 percent are between the ages of 20 and 29. VA data show that almost   20 percent of women veterans of OEF/OIF have been diagnosed with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, an alarming number of  them have experienced sexual trauma while in the military. As a result,  many women veterans of OEF/OIF have complex physical and mental  health care needs.", "Congress and others have raised concerns about how well VA is prepared  to meet the physical and mental health care needs of the growing number  of women veterans, particularly veterans of OEF/OIF. Traditionally,  women veterans have utilized VA\u2019s health care services less frequently  than their male counterparts. In fiscal year 2007, 15 percent of women  veterans used VA\u2019s health care services, compared to 22 percent of male  veterans. VA believes that part of this difference may be attributable to  barriers that the current care models at many VA medical facilities present  to women veterans. For example, women veterans have often been  required to make multiple visits to a VA facility in order to receive the full  spectrum of primary care services, which includes such basic gender- specific care as cervical cancer screenings and breast examinations.  Because many of these women work or have child care responsibilities,  multiple visits can be problematic, especially when services are not  available in the evenings or on weekends.", "VA has taken some steps to improve the availability of services for women  veterans, including requiring that all VA medical facilities make the  Women Veterans Program Manager (WVPM)\u2014an advocate for the needs  of women veterans\u2014a full-time position and providing funding for  equipment to help VA medical facilities improve health care services for  women veterans. Additionally, in November 2008, VA began a systemwide  initiative to make comprehensive primary care for women veterans  available at every VA medical facility\u2014VA medical centers (VAMC) and  community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC). In announcing this initiative,  VA established a policy defining comprehensive primary care for women  veterans as the availability of complete primary care\u2014including routine  detection and management of acute and chronic illness, preventive care,  gender-specific care, and mental health care\u2014from one primary care  provider at one site.", "You asked us to examine VA\u2019s health care services for women veterans. In  my testimony today, I will discuss our preliminary findings, based on visits  to selected VA facilities, regarding (1) the on-site availability of health care  services at VA facilities for women veterans, (2) the extent to which VA  facilities are following VA policies that apply to the delivery of health care  services for women veterans, and (3) some key challenges that VA  facilities are experiencing in providing health care services for women  veterans.", "To examine the availability of health care services at VA facilities for  women veterans and to determine the extent to which VA facilities are  following VA policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for  women veterans, we reviewed applicable VA policies and available VA  data, and interviewed officials from VA headquarters, Veterans Integrated  Service Networks (VISN), and VA facilities. In addition, we conducted site  visits to a judgmental sample of nine VAMCs located in Atlanta and Dublin,  Georgia; San Diego and Long Beach, California; Minneapolis and St. Cloud,  Minnesota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Temple and Waco, Texas. We  also visited 10 VA CBOCs affiliated with these nine VAMCs, and eight Vet  Centers, which are counseling centers that help combat veterans readjust  from wartime military service to civilian life. We used VA data to select  these sites based on several factors, including the number of women  veterans using health care services at each VAMC and whether facilities  offered specific programs for women veterans, such as outpatient or  residential treatment programs for women who have PTSD or have  experienced military sexual trauma (MST). See appendix I for additional  details on the selection criteria we used and information on the number of  women veterans using health care services at each VAMC and CBOC we  visited. To further examine the availability of services for women veterans,  we obtained information from each VAMC and CBOC regarding the  organization and availability of primary care services, basic gender- specific services, specialized gender-specific services, and mental health  services in outpatient, residential, and inpatient settings; and the  availability of specific clinical services such as prenatal care, osteoporosis  treatment, mammography, and counseling for MST. When services were  not available on site, we determined whether they were available through  fee-for-service arrangements (fee basis), contracts, or sharing agreements  with non-VA facilities. During our site visits we also toured each facility  and documented observations of the physical space in each care setting.  We examined how facilities were implementing VA policies pertaining to  ensuring the privacy of women veterans in outpatient, residential, and  inpatient care settings; and VA\u2019s model of comprehensive primary care for  women veterans. Finally, to identify key challenges that VA facilities are  experiencing in providing health care services for women veterans, we  reviewed relevant literature; interviewed VA officials in headquarters,  medical facilities, and Vet Centers; interviewed VA experts in the area of  women veterans\u2019 health; and documented challenges observed during our  site visits. The findings of our site visits to VA facilities cannot be  generalized to other VA facilities.

VA\u2019s health care system is organized into   21 VISNs that include VAMCs and CBOCs. VAMCs offer outpatient,  residential, and inpatient services. These services range from primary care  to complex specialty care, such as cardiac and spinal cord injury care.  VAMCs also offer a range of mental health services, including outpatient  counseling services, residential programs\u2014which provide intensive  treatment and rehabilitation services, with supported housing, for  treatment, for example, of PTSD, MST, or substance use disorders\u2014and  inpatient psychiatric treatment. CBOCs are an extension of VAMCs and  provide outpatient primary care and general mental health services on site.

VA provides health  care services to veterans through its medical benefits package\u2014health  care services required to be provided are broadly stated in a regulation  and further specified in VA policies. Through policies, VA requires its  health care facilities to make certain services, including gender-specific  services and primary care services, available to eligible women veterans.  Gender-specific services that are included in the VA medical benefits  package include, for example, cervical cancer screening, breast  examination, management of menopause, mammography, obstetric care,  and infertility evaluation.

Begun as a part- time collateral position, the WVPM is now a full-time position at all  VAMCs. In July 2008, VA required VAMCs to establish the WVPM as a full- time position (no longer a collateral duty) no later than December 1, 2008.

However, in one location, we found that the  only provider who was available to deliver comprehensive primary care  may not have had the proficiency to deliver the broad array of services  that are included in VA\u2019s definition, because the facility serves a very low  volume of women veterans and opportunities to practice delivering some  basic gender-specific services are limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Officials Identified Key Challenges Related to Space, Hiring Staff with Specific Experience and Training, and Establishing the WVPM as a Full-time Position", "paragraphs": ["VA officials at medical facilities we visited identified a number of key  challenges in providing health care services to women veterans. These  challenges include physical space constraints that affect the provision of  care, including problems complying with patient privacy requirements,  and difficulties hiring providers that have specific experience and training  in women\u2019s health, as well as hiring mental health providers with expertise  in treating veterans with PTSD and who have experienced MST. Officials  at some VA medical facilities also reported implementation issues in  establishing the WVPM as a full-time position."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Facility Officials Identified Space Constraints as a Challenge Affecting the Provision of Health Care Services to Women Veterans", "paragraphs": ["Officials at VA medical facilities we visited reported that space constraints  have raised issues affecting the provision of health care services to women  veterans. In particular, officials at 7 of 9 VAMCs and 5 of 10 CBOCs we  visited said that space issues, such as the number, size, or configuration of  exam rooms or bathrooms at their facilities sometimes made it difficult for  them to comply with some VA requirements related to privacy for women  veterans. At some of the medical facilities we visited, officials raised  concerns about busy waiting rooms and the limited space available to  provide separate waiting rooms for patients who may not feel comfortable  in a mixed-gender waiting room, particularly women veterans who have  experienced MST. Officials at one CBOC said they received complaints  from women veterans who preferred a separate waiting room. At this  facility, space challenges that affected privacy were among the factors that  led to the relocation of mental health services to a separate off-site clinic.  VA facility officials told us that some of the patient bedrooms at two  VAMC mixed-gender inpatient psychiatric units that were usually  designated for female patients were located in space that could not be  adequately monitored from the nursing station. VA policy requires that all  inpatient care facilities provide separate and secured sleeping  accommodations for women and that mixed-gender units must ensure safe  and secure sleeping arrangements, including, but not limited to, the ability  to monitor the patient bedrooms from the nursing station.", "VA facility officials also told us they have struggled with space constraints  as they work to comply with VA\u2019s new policy on comprehensive primary  care for women and the requirements in the September 2008 Uniform  Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics, as well as the  increasing numbers of women veterans requesting these services. For  example, officials at a VAMC said that limitations in the number of primary  care exam rooms at their facilities made it difficult for providers to deliver  comprehensive primary care services in an efficient and timely manner.  Providers explained that having only one exam room per primary care  provider prevents them from \u201cmultitasking,\u201d or moving back and forth  between exam rooms while patients are changing or completing intake  interviews with nursing staff. Similarly, mental health providers at a  medical facility said that they often shared offices, which limits the  number of counseling appointments they could schedule, and primary care  providers sometimes have two patients in a room at the same time  separated by a curtain during the intake or screening process. In addition,  at one VAMC, officials reported that the facility needed to be two to three  times its current size to accommodate increasing patient demand.", "VA officials are aware of these challenges and VA is taking steps to  address them, such as funding construction projects, moving to larger  buildings, and opening additional CBOCs. However, some of these  projects will not be finished for a few years. In the interim, officials said,  some facilities are leasing additional space or contracting some services to  community providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Facility Officials Identified Difficulties Hiring Primary Care Providers with the Specific Training and Experience Needed to Provide Services to Women Veterans", "paragraphs": ["VA facility officials reported difficulties hiring primary care providers with  specific training and experience in women\u2019s health. VA\u2019s comprehensive  primary care initiative requires that women veterans have access to a  designated women\u2019s health primary care provider that is \u201cproficient,  interested, and engaged\u201d in delivering services to women veterans. The  new policy requires that this primary care provider fulfill a broad array of  health care services including, but not limited to    detection and management of acute and chronic illness, such as  osteoporosis, thyroid disease, and cancer of the breast, cervix, and lung;    gender-specific primary care such as sexuality, pharmacologic issues  related to pregnancy and lactation, and vaginal infections;    preventive care, such as cancer screening and weight management;   mental health services such as screening and referrals for MST, as well as  evaluation and treatment of uncomplicated mental health disorders and  substance use disorders; and    coordination of specialty care.", "Officials at some facilities we visited told us that they would like to hire  more providers with the required knowledge and experience in women\u2019s  health, but struggle to do so. For example, at one VAMC, officials reported  that they had difficulty filling three vacancies for primary care providers,  which they needed to meet the increasing demand for services and to  replace staff who had retired. They said it took them a long time to find  providers with the skills required to serve the needs of women veterans.  Similarly, at one CBOC, officials reported that it takes them about 8 to 9  months to hire interested primary care physicians. Further, officials at  some facilities we visited said that they rely on just one or two providers  to deliver comprehensive primary care to women veterans. This is a  concern to the officials because, should the provider retire or leave VA,  the facility might not be able to replace them relatively quickly in order to  continue to provide comprehensive primary care services to women  veterans on site.", "VA officials have acknowledged some of the challenges involved in  training additional primary care providers to meet their vision of  delivering comprehensive primary care to women veterans. A November  2008 report on the provision of primary care to women veterans cites  insufficient numbers of clinicians with specific training and experience in  women\u2019s health issues among the challenges VA faces in implementing  comprehensive primary care. To help address the knowledge gap, VA is  using \u201cmini-residency\u201d training sessions on women\u2019s health. These training  sessions\u2014which VA designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of  primary care providers\u2014consist of two and one-half days of case-based  learning and hands-on training in gender-specific health care for women.  During the mini-residency, providers receive specific training in  performing pelvic examinations, cervical cancer screenings, clinical breast  examinations, and other relevant skills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Medical Facility and Vet Center Officials Identified Challenges Hiring Mental Health Providers with Training and Experience in Treating PTSD and MST", "paragraphs": ["VA medical facility and Vet Center officials reported challenges hiring  psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health staff with specialized  training or experience in treating PTSD and MST. Medical facility officials  often noted that there is a limited pool of qualified psychiatrists and  psychologists, and a high demand for these professionals both in the  private sector and within VA. In addition, two officials reported that  because it is difficult to attract and hire mental health professionals with  experience in treating the veteran population, some medical facilities have  hired younger, less experienced providers. These officials noted that while  younger providers may have the appropriate education and training in  some evidence-based psychotherapy treatment methods that are  recommended for treating PTSD and MST, they often lack practical  experience treating a challenging patient population.", "Some officials reported that staffing and training challenges limit the types  of group or individual mental health treatment services that VA medical  facilities and Vet Centers can offer. For example, officials at one VAMC  said that they had problems attracting qualified mental health providers to  work at its affiliated CBOCs. The facility posted announcements for  psychiatrist and psychologist positions, but sometimes received no  applications. Because the facility has not been able to recruit mental  health providers, it relies on contract providers and fee-basing to deliver  mental health services to veterans in its service area. At one Vet Center,  officials told us that because none of their counselors have been trained to  counsel veterans who have experienced MST, patients seeking counseling  for MST are usually referred to the nearby CBOC or VAMC. At one CBOC,  a licensed social worker reported that he provides individual counseling  for about seven women who have experienced MST, even though he has  limited training in this area. He said that this situation was not ideal, but  said that he consults with mental health providers at the associated VAMC  on some of these cases, and that without his services some of these  women might not receive any counseling.", "VA officials told us that they are aware of the challenges involved in  finding clinical staff with specialized training and experience in working  with veterans who have PTSD or have experienced MST. A VA official told  us that as part of a national effort to enhance mental health providers\u2019  knowledge of clinically effective treatment methods and make these  methods available to veterans, VA has developed evidenced-based  psychotherapy training for VA mental health staff. In particular, CPT, PE,  and ACT are evidence-based treatment therapies for PTSD and also  commonly used by providers who work with patients who have  experienced MST. A VA headquarters official who is responsible for  these training programs told us that as of May 4, 2009, 1,670 VA clinicians  had completed VA-provided training in evidence-based therapies. Although  VA is providing training in these evidence-based therapies, VA officials  stated that this training is not mandatory for VA mental health providers  who work with patients who have PTSD or have experienced M ST."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some VAMC Officials Reported That Establishing the WVPM as a Full-time Position Has Raised Implementation Issues", "paragraphs": ["Some VA officials expressed concerns that certain aspects of the new  policy making the WVPM a full-time position may have the unintended  consequence of discouraging clinicians from applying for or staying in the  position, potentially leading to the loss of experienced WVPMs. One  concern that some WVPMs raised during our interviews was that they  were interested in performing clinical duties beyond the minimum  required to maintain their professional certification, but would not be able  to do so under the new policy. The new policy limits a WVPM\u2019s clinical  duties to the minimum required to maintain professional certification,  licensure, or privileges, typically no more than 5 hours per week. Another  concern was that the change to full-time status could result in a reduction  in salary for some clinicians because the position could be classified as an  administrative position, depending on how the policy is implemented at  the VAMC. At two VAMCs we visited, such concerns had discouraged the  incumbent WVPM from accepting the full-time position.", "VA headquarters officials told us that they are aware of and have  expressed their concerns to VA senior headquarters officials about  unintended consequences of the new policy. VA headquarters officials  provided VISN and VAMC leadership with some options that they could  use to help avoid or minimize the potential loss of experienced WVPMs.  For example, one option that could be approved on a case-by-case basis is  to use a job-sharing arrangement that would allow the incumbent WVPM  and another person to each dedicate 50 percent of their time to the WVPM  position, performing clinical duties the other 50 percent, in order to  transition staff into the full-time position or as a succession planning  effort. VA headquarters officials said that action on this issue was  important because VA does not have the time or resources to train new  staff to replace experienced WVPMs who may leave their positions.", "Mr. Chairmen, this completes my prepared remarks.
