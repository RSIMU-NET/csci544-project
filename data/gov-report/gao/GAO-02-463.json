The act requires agencies to refer eligible debts delinquent more than 180 days to the Department of the Treasury for payment offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for cross-servicing. The Treasury Offset Program includes the offset of benefit payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds. Cross-servicing involves locating debtors, issuing demand letters, and referring debts to private collection agencies. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has initiatives to ensure the timely referral of all delinquent debt. However, the agency's failure to make the act a priority has left key provisions of the legislation unimplemented and has severely reduced opportunities for collection. FSA lacks effective procedures and controls to identify and promptly refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury for collection action. GAO identified several obstacles to FSA's establishment and implementation of an effective and complete debt-referral process. In the four states with the highest dollar amounts of federal debt excluded from the Treasury Offset Program, GAO reviewed FSA's use of exclusions from referral requirements because of bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure and Department of Justice litigation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that about half of the exclusions in these states were inconsistent with established criteria."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 10, 2001, we testified before your subcommittee on selected  federal agencies\u2019 implementation of certain key provisions of the Debt  Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996.  That testimony addressed  requirements to refer older delinquent debts to the Department of the  Treasury for offset against amounts the government might owe the debtors  and for additional collection action at Treasury\u2019s central debt collection  facility, operated by the Financial Management Service (FMS).  Our more  recent testimony, on December 5, 2001, focused on progress in this area by  two Department of Agriculture agencies\u2014the Rural Housing Service and  the Farm Service Agency (FSA).", "One of the major purposes of DCIA is to maximize collection of billions of  dollars of nontax delinquent debt owed to the federal government.  Toward  this end, DCIA requires that agencies refer eligible debts delinquent more  than 180 days that they have been unable to collect to Treasury for payment  offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for  cross-servicing.  Treasury performs payment offset through its Treasury  Offset Program (TOP), which includes the offset of certain benefit  payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds.  Cross-servicing involves  such actions as locating debtors, issuing demand letters, and referring  debts to private collection agencies.", "The purpose of this report is to expand on the information provided in our  December 2001 testimony regarding FSA\u2019s progress and to offer our  recommendations for improving the agency\u2019s implementation of the debt- referral provisions of DCIA.

Our testimonies referred to above offered an overview of agencies\u2019  progress during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to the extent that data were  available and addressed your request for information.  For this report, we  looked at whether (1) FSA was promptly referring eligible farm loan  program loans to Treasury\u2019s FMS for collection action, (2) any obstacles  were hampering FSA from referring eligible farm loan program loans to  FMS, and (3) FSA was appropriately using exclusions from referral  requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FSA was established in 1994 during the reorganization of the Department of  Agriculture and operates through a network of field offices located across  the United States.

Direct  ownership loans are for buying farm real estate and making capital  improvements.  Direct operating loans, which are made to beginning  farmers and ranchers who are unable to qualify for guaranteed operating  loans, are for the purchase of items to help daily farm operations.

We reviewed FSA\u2019s policies and  procedures on debt referrals and examined the agency\u2019s current and  planned efforts to refer eligible delinquent debts.  We obtained and  analyzed the TROR for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000, which was the  most recent year-end report available at the completion of our fieldwork,  and other financial reports prepared by FSA, and held discussions with  FSA officials to determine whether the agency was appropriately using  exclusions from referral requirements.  In addition, we reviewed responses  to questions about FSA\u2019s debt collection practices that you submitted to the  deputy secretary of agriculture in October 2001 and used information from  the responses to clarify or augment our report, where appropriate.", "To determine whether FSA\u2019s use of exclusions from referral requirements  was appropriate, we used statistical sampling techniques to select 15 FSA  field offices from the four states with the highest dollar amounts of  reported debt excluded from TOP as of September 30, 2000.  Using  electronic and hard-copy files obtained from Agriculture, we reviewed all  263 loans from the 15 selected offices that were more than 180 days  delinquent and had been reported as excluded from referral to FMS as of  September 30, 2000, for bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure, and  DOJ litigation.  (Appendix I contains additional information on the  sampling method and the results.)  Based on the results of our review, we  estimated the percentage of loans inappropriately excluded as of  September 30, 2000, in the four states from which the sample offices were  drawn.

Loan system limitations  have resulted in the automatic exclusion of certain types of debts without  any review for eligibility and the inability to pursue collection from  codebtors through TOP.  FSA\u2019s failure to ensure that field offices routinely  updated the status of delinquent loans has led to inappropriate exclusions  from referral and inaccurate reporting of delinquent and eligible debt  amounts to Treasury.  A change in referral policy led to a suspension of all  delinquent loan referrals to FMS for cross-servicing.  FSA\u2019s policy of  referring delinquent debt to FMS only once a year resulted in delayed  referrals and may have reduced collections.  Finally, FSA did not take  action until recently to recognize losses on guaranteed farm loan program  loans as nontax federal debt.

According to FSA officials, deficiency judgments\u2014unlike  some other types of judgment debts\u2014are eligible for TOP and should be  referred to FMS.  However, FSA\u2019s Finance Office in St. Louis automatically  excluded all judgment debts for direct farm loan program loans from  referral to FMS because of automated system limitations.  Although the  system does contain information indicating which debts are judgment  debts, it cannot currently accommodate information on subcategories of  judgment debts.  Therefore, FSA staff cannot use the agency\u2019s automated  system to identify deficiency judgments for referral.  On account of our  inquiries, FSA officials initiated a special project in May 2001 to manually  identify all deficiency judgment debts for direct farm loan program loans so  that such debts could be referred to FMS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSA Cannot Report Codebtor Information to FMS Because of System Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Even though FSA reported having referred $934 million of direct farm loan  program loans to FMS for TOP as of September 30, 2000, the agency has  lost and continues to lose opportunities to maximize collections on these  loans because it does not report information on codebtors to FMS.   According to FSA officials, the vast majority of direct farm loan program  loans have codebtors, who are also liable for loan repayment, but FSA\u2019s  automated loan system cannot record more than one taxpayer  identification number for each loan.  Because taxpayer identification  numbers are required for referrals to FMS for TOP, FSA cannot refer  codebtors on farm loan program loans to FMS.  An FSA official said that  the agency first recognized the need to have codebtor information in the  system in 1986 to facilitate debt collection but that higher-priority systems  projects have precluded FSA from completing the necessary enhancements  to allow the system to accept more than one taxpayer identification  number per debt.

Our review of selected excluded loans indicated  that personnel in the FSA field offices we visited did not routinely update  the eligibility status of farm loan program loans in FSA\u2019s Program Loan  Accounting System.  Without up-to-date information on loan status, the  system cannot accurately identify which loans are eligible for referral.", "One of the most frequently identified inappropriate exclusions pertained to  amounts that had been discharged in bankruptcy, which should not have  been included in delinquent debt.  Farm loan managers in some of the FSA  field offices we visited said they had not closed out many direct farm loan  program loans discharged in bankruptcy because making new loans has  been a higher-priority use of their resources.  In addition, FSA did not  provide sufficient oversight to help ensure that field office personnel  adequately tracked the status of discharged bankruptcies and updated the  loan files and debt records in the Program Loan Accounting System.", "Delays in promptly closing out discharged bankruptcy debts not only  distort the TROR for debt management and credit policy purposes, but also  distort key financial indicators such as receivables, total delinquencies, and  loan loss data.  The information is therefore misleading for budget and  management decisions and oversight.

Consequently, a large portion of the $400 million of debt  likely was not promptly referred when it became eligible.  As we have  previously testified, industry statistics have shown that the likelihood of  recovering amounts owed on delinquent debt decreases dramatically as the  age of the debt increases.  Thus, the old adage that \u201ctime is money\u201d is very  relevant for referrals of debts to FMS for collection action.

We  also noted that we found exclusion errors caused by FSA\u2019s failure to ensure  that loan status was routinely updated.

For example, one loan with a  balance due of about $325,000 was reported as more than 180 days  delinquent and had been excluded from referral because of bankruptcy.   Our review of the loan file at the FSA field office showed that a bankruptcy  court had discharged the debt in 1986.

Automated system limitations,  which have existed for years and have delayed FSA\u2019s compliance with the  act, have still not been corrected, even though they have prevented referral  and potential collection of substantial amounts of eligible delinquent debt.   The failure of FSA field offices to routinely update delinquent loan  information has led to erroneous exclusions from referral and inaccurate  reporting of debt to Treasury.  FSA\u2019s policy of referring debts to TOP only  once a year has allowed debts to age unnecessarily and has likely reduced  their collectibility.  FSA has only recently taken action to establish  procedures to refer losses on guaranteed loans to FMS; therefore,  opportunities to collect on losses of about $300 million since DCIA was  enacted may have already been lost.

In addition, since many of the loans in our sample had been  inappropriately excluded for years, corrections made subsequent to our  testing but prior to FSA\u2019s review would likely have resulted in a lower error  rate at the time of FSA\u2019s work.  In any case, it is important to note that the  35.7 percent error rate cited by FSA from its internal assessment is still  unacceptable, and we remain firm in our recommendation that FSA  develop and implement oversight procedures to ensure that FSA field  offices timely and routinely update the Program Loan Accounting System  to accurately reflect the status of delinquent debts.", "FSA also took issue with our report\u2019s reference to possible missed  collection opportunities.
