OMB launched the Section 5 Pilot in May 2015 and expects to continue pilot-related activities until at least May 2017.", "If implemented according to HHS's proposed plan, the grants portion of the pilot will likely meet the requirements established under the act. In contrast, GAO has concerns with how the procurement portion of the pilot will contribute to the Section 5 Pilot's design requirements. For example, OMB has not fully described how it will select pilot participants that will result in a diverse group of contractors as required by the act. OMB staff stated that they intend to select participants for testing the procurement pilot by using a nongeneralizable sample of contractor data, but they have not provided a detailed, documented sampling plan.", "The design of the grants portion of the pilot partially adhered to leading practices. Although five out of the six grants test models had clear and measurable objectives, only one had specific details about how potential findings could be scalable to be generalizable beyond the context of the pilot. HHS officials said they have updated their plan to address these concerns but that plan was not provided in time to allow GAO to analyze it for this review.", "The design of the procurement portion of the pilot did not reflect leading practices. For example, the plan did not include specific information on the methodology, strategy, or types of data to be collected. Further, the plan we reviewed did not address the extent to which the proposed pilot approach would be scalable to produce recommendations that could be applied government-wide. The design also did not indicate how data will be evaluated to draw conclusions.

Such a process enhances the quality,  credibility, and usefulness of evaluations in addition to helping to ensure  that time and resources are used effectively. We have identified five  leading practices that, taken together, form a framework for effective pilot  design. To identify these practices, we reviewed our prior work as well as  academic literature related to the design of pilot and evaluation  programs. By following these leading practices, agencies can promote a  consistent and effective pilot design process. We shared these practices  with OMB, HHS, and GSA staff, who found them to be reasonable and  appropriate, and applicable to the Section 5 Pilot.  1.  Establish well-defined, appropriate, clear, and measurable objectives.", "Such objectives should have specific statements of the  accomplishments necessary to meet the objectives. Clear and  measurable objectives can help ensure that appropriate evaluation  data are collected from the outset of pilot implementation so that data  will subsequently be available to measure performance against the  objectives. Broad study objectives should be translated into specific,  researchable questions that articulate what will be assessed.  2.  Clearly articulate assessment methodology and data gathering  strategy that addresses all components of the pilot program and  includes key features of a sound plan.", "Key features of a clearly articulated methodology include a strategy  for comparing the pilot implementation and results with other efforts, a  clear plan that details the type and source of the data necessary to  evaluate the pilot, and methods for data collection including the timing  and frequency.  3.  Identify criteria or standards for identifying lessons about the pilot to  inform decisions about scalability and whether, how, and when to  integrate pilot activities into overall efforts.", "The purpose of a pilot is generally to inform a decision on whether  and how to implement a new approach in a broader context.  Therefore, it is critically important to consider how well the lessons  learned from the pilot can be applied in other, broader settings. To  assess scalability, criteria should relate to the similarity or  comparability of the pilot to the range of circumstances and population  expected in full implementation. The criteria or standards can be  based on lessons from past experiences or other related efforts  known to influence implementation and performance as well as on  literature reviews and stakeholder input, among other sources. The  criteria and standards should be observable and measureable events,  actions, or characteristics that provide evidence that the pilot  objectives have been met. Choosing well-regarded criteria against  which to make comparisons can lead to strong, defensible  conclusions.  4.  Develop a detailed data-analysis plan to track the pilot program\u2019s  implementation and performance and evaluate the final results of the  project and draw conclusions on whether, how, and when to integrate  pilot activities into overall efforts.", "A detailed data-analysis plan identifies who will do the analysis as well  as when and how data will be analyzed to measure the pilot  program\u2019s implementation and performance. The results will show the  successes and challenges of the pilot, and in turn, how the pilot can  be incorporated into broader efforts. Some elements of a detailed  data-analysis plan include talking to users, managers, and  developers; evaluating the lessons learned to improve procedures  moving forward; and other appropriate measures.  5.  Ensure appropriate two-way stakeholder communication and input at  all stages of the pilot project, including design, implementation, data  gathering, and assessment  Appropriate two-way stakeholder communication and input should  occur at all stages of the pilot, including design, implementation, data  gathering, and assessment. Failure to effectively engage with  stakeholders, and understand and address their views can undermine  or derail an initiative.

The CDER Library  test model also identifies specific metrics that would allow them to  measure whether they are able to achieve its stated objectives.", "In our initial review of these test models, we provided feedback to HHS  that the other CDER Library test did not have a clear, fully established  objective. In response, HHS officials explained that the objective of that  test model is to compare data elements and forms used across the  federal government with the goal of consolidating these forms and  ultimately passing on reporting efficiencies to grant recipients.", "Leading Practice 2: Clearly Articulate an Assessment Methodology. Five  of the six test models did not clearly articulate an assessment  methodology. In contrast, for the Learn Grants test model, HHS described  how it planned to use webinars, conference presentations, and other  events to increase awareness inside and outside of government about the  grants-related resources available on Grants.gov. The plan also includes  a detailed timeline for executing the test model, as well as HHS\u2019s  methodology for conducting pre- and post-tests of pilot participants. HHS  officials told us that they worked with a federal SME with previous  experience working on Grants.gov to help develop and refine the  assessment methodology.", "The remaining five test models have less clearly articulated assessment  methodologies. For example, for the consolidated FFR test model, HHS  said it will survey grant recipients on their experiences when submitting  their reports into one system rather than multiple entry points; but we  found that the plans lacked detail about how surveys will be designed and  administered. In addition, the plan did not provide specific information  about the participants HHS intends to survey, nor did it provide details  regarding how HHS will compare survey results for recipients in the pilot  versus those not participating in the pilot.", "In meetings with senior HHS officials, we raised these and similar  concerns about the Notice of Award test model and one of the CDER  Library models. For the other CDER Library test model, we found that  HHS\u2019s plans did not identify the data sources or metrics that would be  used in the assessment methodology. In those feedback meetings, HHS  officials said many of the concerns have been addressed in the revised  plan.", "Leading Practice 3: Ensure Scalability of Pilot Design. HHS documented  an overall structure for how each test model is integrated into the overall  grants portion of the pilot. However, the documented design lacks specific  details about how HHS intends to evaluate the performance of each test  model to inform decisions about scalability. Specifically, five of the six test  models include either no or few specifics about how any observed  reduction in burden could be generalizable beyond the context of the  pilot. For example, HHS\u2019s plan for the consolidated FFR test model  indicates that it will be tested using grantees who receive awards from the  Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a subunit of HHS.", "However, the plan does not specify how ACF will select participants or  how results from ACF grant recipients can be applied government-wide.  HHS officials told us that ACF has a list of potential participants. Given  the size and complexity of ACF\u2019s grant recipients, the officials believed  that these participants would provide a good basis for scalability should  the FFR test model prove to be successful. According to HHS officials,  they have developed a comprehensive sampling plan for selecting  participants for each of the six test models. They will reach out to selected  participants to begin data collection in May 2016. We have recently been  provided with the draft sampling plan and will provide our assessment of it  in our forthcoming review on the implementation of the Section 5 Pilot.", "Leading Practice 4: Develop a Plan to Evaluate Pilot Results. The design  for five of HHS\u2019s six test models provides some level of detail on how it  plans to evaluate pilot results. For instance, HHS\u2019s Learn Grants test  model provides a description of a methodology to measure knowledge  about the grants lifecycle. It will compare a group of recipients that has  access to certain grant resources contained in a public on-line portal to  another group of recipients that does not. HHS\u2019s plans indicate that the  results from both tests will be analyzed to evaluate knowledge gained by  participants to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the Learn  Grants tab on the Grants.gov website.", "However, the documented pilot design lacks specific detail on how HHS  plans to analyze the data it gathered and how it will draw conclusions  about integrating the pilot activities into overall grant reporting efforts. For  example, both CDER Library test models reference an analysis plan for  evaluating to see if burden has been reduced. The plans do not indicate  how HHS would determine if a particular time threshold represents a true  reduction in burden and whether that burden is measured in minutes,  hours, or some other unit of analysis.", "Similarly, the Single Audit and Notice of Award test models indicate that  HHS will use results from surveys and focus groups, including  documenting benefits and challenges raised by participants; yet HHS\u2019s  plans for these two test models do not specify how HHS will compile  these results and distill them into actionable recommendations. HHS  officials told us that their revised planning documents are to include this  additional level of detail to address our concerns.", "Leading Practice 5: Ensure Appropriate Two-Way Stakeholder  Communication. HHS has engaged in two-way stakeholder  communications for all six of its test models. It also has taken a number of  actions to obtain input from grant recipients including posting questions  on the National Dialogue to solicit feedback on how to ease grantee  reporting burden. Further, HHS has been involved in a number of  outreach activities including presentations at conferences, town hall  events, and webinars to identify areas of reporting burden and  duplication, and to collect ideas to streamline reporting. HHS also used  these forums to provide updates on the progress of the design and  specific information on the six test models. HHS supplemented input  received through the National Dialogue with feedback from SME to help  design the test models. An HHS official told us they identified SMEs  based on their experience working with federal grants, grant recipients,  and systems being tested.", "HHS officials provided several examples of how they engaged in two-way  communication with stakeholders when developing their test models. For  example, HHS consulted with a federal official who used to work for  Grants.gov to help develop the Learn Grants test model and the pre- and  post-test evaluations associated with it. For the FFR test model, HHS  consulted with officials who work in ACF and the Payment Management  System. HHS also worked with other SMEs from across the federal  government to develop other test models. According to a HHS official,  SMEs were asked to critically assess the methodology for each of the  models with the intent of making each model more effective.", "More recently, in January 2016, HHS pre-tested proposed Section 5 Pilot  test models and obtained feedback on ways to improve them with  advocacy groups representing those in the grants recipient communities  including state and local governments as well as research universities.  Also included were representatives from the auditing and software  development industries. HHS officials told us that they have made  significant revisions in response to the pre-tests and feedback to their  documented design.", "However, HHS has additional opportunities to foster two-way dialogue  with recipients of federal funds. Officials from advocacy groups  representing federal funding recipients told us that they are still waiting for  information about how their membership can be more engaged in the pilot  process. For example, an official from the National Association of State  Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers told us that following a webinar for  their membership hosted by the Association of Government Accountants  in November 2015 on the Section 5 Pilot, they collected the names of  more than 20 state and local government representatives who were  interested in participating in the grants portion of the pilot. This official  said the names were given to HHS, but the association has not received  any information on how these volunteers can participate in the pilot. HHS  officials said that once they receive OMB approval on their sampling  methodology for selecting participants, they will be able to reach out to  those who expressed interest in being a part of the pilot.", "We provided our assessment of the design of the grants portion of the  pilot to HHS officials, who told us that they generally concurred with our  analysis and had updated their plan to address many of these concerns.  As noted above, we did not have time to review this update in this report  because we did not receive the plan in time. For details of our  assessment of the design of the six grants test models, see appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design of the Procurement Portion of the Pilot Is Generally Not Meeting Leading Practices", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of the working draft plan for the procurement portion  of the pilot dated November 2015, related documents, and interviews with  cognizant staff, we found that the design did not reflect leading practices  for pilot design. Further, while the plan included some information  regarding responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the procurement  portion of the pilot, specific roles and deliverables were not clearly  described for all phases of the pilot. For example, the written draft plan  listed broad areas of responsibilities\u2014such as \u201cmanage funding\u201d or  \u201cFederal Register Notice\u201d\u2014but did not detail what stakeholders would be  working on related to those activities.", "OFPP staff described additional actions to supplement the information  contained in the draft plan. This information included their decision to  initially focus the design of the procurement pilot on testing the feasibility  of centralizing certified payroll reporting by contractors subject to the  Davis-Bacon and related acts because of public feedback on the need to  reduce duplicate reporting. However, even after taking this additional  information into account, we found that the design was neither well- developed nor documented in accordance with leading practices to allow  for the development of effective recommendations to simplify reporting for  contractors, as described below.", "Leading Practice 1: Establish Well-Defined, Appropriate, Clear, and  Measurable Objectives. The working draft plan provided by OFPP does  not include specifics pertaining to the proposed focus of certified payroll  reporting. OFPP staff told us that they believe submitting certified payroll  information through a centralized portal would reduce contractor reporting  burden. They explained that this topic was selected because they learned  that it was a particular pain point for contractors as a result of various  outreach efforts including 18F\u2019s discovery process. The draft plan also  does not provide specifics regarding the particular objectives and  hypothesis that will be tested by the pilot. OFPP staff stated that,  consistent with their view of agile practices, they intend to further refine  their approach as 18F develops its prototype and additional work  proceeds with the pilot.", "Leading Practice 2: Clearly Articulate an Assessment Methodology. The  draft plan we reviewed did not include detailed information on the  methodology, strategy, or types of data planned to be collected. The draft  plan referenced an information-gathering effort conducted by GSA\u2019s 18F  to discover challenges and develop recommendations for burden  reduction. However, OFPP staff could not provide any evidence that this  effort resulted in specific methodologies or data-collection strategies  related to centralizing certified payroll reporting.", "According to 18F staff, a second phase of the procurement portion of the  pilot will begin in March 2016. OFPP staff said that during this phase, 18F  will research, design, and test a prototype that will become a basis for the  centralized portal that will be tested under the pilot. This prototype will be  vetted in workshops with stakeholders who will test, among other things,  the metrics, functionality, and accessibility of the prototype and any  needed changes. 18F expects the second phase to be completed by May  2016, after which OFPP will begin the third phase of the pilot later this  summer. In that phase, a contractor will develop a centralized portal  based on 18F\u2019s design that could be used to test the submission and  review of certified payroll data.", "Additionally, OFPP staff told us that they intended to collect data in  accordance with FAR requirements and would compare the information  collected in the portal with that being submitted through other methods.  However, OFPP was not able to provide specific details on its pilot  methodology, such as how it intends to compare results of contractors  that use the prototype and those that do not, identify the type and source  of data necessary to evaluate the pilot, and establish the timing and  frequency of the data to be collected. Without these details, the  procurement methodology design does not address all components of a  pilot program nor does it include key design features that would meet  leading practices.", "Leading Practice 3: Ensure Scalability of Pilot Design. The draft design of  the procurement portion of the pilot that we reviewed did not address the  issue of scalability or efforts to ensure that conclusions and  recommendations resulting from the pilot could be applied government- wide. However, OFPP staff indicated that they plan to develop a sampling  approach that will allow them to collect data from a population that is  representative of federal contractors. Specifically, they said that they will  select a diverse group of participants by potentially pulling data from the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. Using that  database, they expect to be able to select a range of small and large  contractors that are required to report certified payroll under Davis-Bacon  and related acts. However, without documentation providing details of a  sampling methodology, measures, and a data analysis plan, the design  cannot ensure the scalability of the results or findings from the pilot.", "Leading Practice 4: Develop Plan to Evaluate Pilot Results. The draft  procurement plan does not indicate how data will be evaluated to track  program performance, how final results will be evaluated, or conclusions  drawn. OFPP staff told us that although they believe it is early in the  process to have finalized evaluation plans, they are considering a number  of options for evaluating whether a centralized certified payroll portal  would cost more or less than current reporting approaches. Specifically,  they said that they expect to have some quantifiable data to allow for  straightforward analysis and will evaluate the qualitative data from the  certified payroll portal as well as the National Dialogue. However, the  absence of a detailed data analysis plan suggests that OFPP lacks a  sound approach to evaluate pilot results.", "Leading Practice 5: Ensure Appropriate Two-Way Stakeholder  Communication. OFPP\u2019s plans for obtaining stakeholder input and  fostering two-way dialogue have not yet been developed to engage public  participation and feedback on its approach for designing and  implementing the procurement portion of the pilot. Similar to the approach  taken by HHS, OFPP staff told us that they used comments posted on the  National Dialogue to inform the design of the procurement portion.  However, as previously mentioned, we have concerns about the  usefulness of that approach because none of the three comments they  received on the dialogue were related to certified payroll. OFPP staff said  they also used comments posted on the 2014 open dialogue on  improving procurement processes to inform their pilot design.", "From commentary posted on both sites, OFPP identified certified payroll  reporting as a pain point that could be further explored through the pilot  project. OFPP staff told us that they engaged GSA\u2019s 18F to conduct the  discovery phase of the pilot design to better understand areas of  significant reporting burden related to certified payroll with a select group  of stakeholders that included contractors, federal agency officials, and  contracting officers. A Federal Register notice was also issued on  November 24, 2015 to solicit public comments on the reporting burden of  the procurement portion of the pilot under the Paperwork Reduction Act.", "Although OFPP obtained stakeholder input to identify areas of focus for  the design of the procurement portion of the pilot, it has not engaged  them to solicit input on other stages of the pilot, including design,  implementation, data gathering, and assessment. Further, OFPP has not  released specific information about the design of the pilot, nor has it made  information about pilot participation available to stakeholders despite  repeated requests for information from those participating in monthly calls  hosted by the Association for Government Accountants and Treasury.", "In addition to being a leading practice for pilot design, our previous work  examining grants management streamlining initiatives found that  stakeholder communication is not just \u201cpushing the message out,\u201d but  should also facilitate a two-way, honest exchange and allow for feedback  from relevant stakeholders. We found that a lack of opportunities to  provide timely feedback resulted in poor implementation and prioritization  of streamlining initiatives and limited recipients\u2019 use and understanding of  new systems. As such, it will be important for OFPP to engage with the  procurement community on its pilot design so that it can be improved  based on public input.

However, we found uneven progress in the  grants and procurement portions of the pilot. OMB and HHS have made  considerable progress designing an overall approach that will examine a  variety of potential ways to simplify reporting for grant recipients. In  addition to generally being on track to meet the specific requirements set  out in the act, we found that the proposed design of the grants portion of  the pilot partially adheres to leading practices.", "In contrast, our review of the design of the procurement portion of the  pilot raises several concerns. In the absence of a detailed design and risk  management plans for executing the pilot moving forward, it is unclear  how the design of the procurement portion will reflect the requirements  set forth by section 5 of the act. Because of project delays to date, it will  be especially important for OMB to communicate to Congress and  interested stakeholders how it plans to address key aspects of these  requirements, such as the collection of meaningful and useful data over a  12-month reporting cycle and including a diverse group of participants  with federal contracts totaling from $1 billion to $2 billion.", "Moreover, the design we reviewed for the procurement portion of the pilot  did not reflect leading practices to allow for the development of effective  recommendations to simplify reporting for contractors. Moving forward,  given the tight timelines set out in the act, it will be important for OMB to  redouble its focus on the design and implementation of the procurement  portion.
