The first is to remove the waste stored at LANL and ship it to WIPP for permanent disposal. The second is to construct a facility\u2014the TWF\u2014to provide new capabilities for managing newly generated TRU waste at LANL.

This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA's TRU waste removal project at LANL has met its cost estimates and (2) the extent to which NNSA's cost estimate for the TWF met best practices for a reliable estimate. GAO reviewed spending data for the TRU waste removal project for fiscal years 2006 through 2014 and the cost estimates for both projects, compared the cost estimate for the TWF with best practices, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) project to remove transuranic (TRU) waste\u2014primarily discarded equipment and soils contaminated with certain radioactive material\u2014at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) did not meet its cost estimates. At the end of fiscal year 2014, NNSA had spent about $931 million on the project, exceeding its 2006 estimate of $729 million by $202 million. Under current plans, the project is also expected to exceed its 2009 estimate. NNSA did not meet its cost estimates, in part, because they were based on aggressive funding assumptions designed to meet the completion dates agreed to in a 2005 cleanup agreement, which the Department of Energy (DOE) did not fully fund. At the time of GAO's review, NNSA was developing a new project completion cost estimate of about $1.6 billion, with completion projected for October 2022. NNSA had not revised the project's cost estimate since 2009 because the agency was reluctant to approve an estimate with a completion date that conflicted with the 2005 cleanup agreement. However, according to an NNSA official, NNSA's new estimate may not reflect current conditions\u2014partly because of uncertainty created by funding and the indefinite suspension of shipments of TRU waste to the permanent repository at DOE's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) after a radioactive release closed WIPP in February 2014. By revising the estimate to include the current understanding of project conditions, including the uncertainty at WIPP, NNSA program managers can, for example, more accurately identify cost overruns.", "NNSA's cost estimate for the TRU Waste Facility (TWF), which consisted of separate cost estimates for completing construction and for operations and maintenance, partially reflected each of the four characteristics of a reliable estimate (comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible) as established by best practices. For example, NNSA's estimate was partially well-documented by clearly documenting the data sources and methodology used to develop the construction estimate. However, NNSA did not sufficiently document the approach used to develop the operations and maintenance estimate, which represented about 74 percent of the TWF's life-cycle costs, because DOE's project management order does not require these costs to be documented when a project is approved to request funding from Congress for construction. As a result, GAO could not determine whether the cost-estimating approach was appropriate. In addition, NNSA's estimate was partially credible because NNSA completed an independent cost estimate (ICE) that provided an unbiased cross-check of the construction estimate consistent with best practices, but it did not include the operations and maintenance costs in the ICE because it was not required by DOE's project management order. Moreover, NNSA did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to quantify variations in the TWF's cost estimates due to changes in key assumptions because it was not required by DOE, which also affected the estimate's credibility. Doing a sensitivity analysis increases the chance that decisions for the TWF will focus on the elements that have the greatest effect on cost, according to best practices. Updating the TWF's cost estimate to include all life-cycle costs and needed analyses, would provide NNSA more reliable information for better managing the TWF as it prepares for the start of operations, which NNSA expects could be as early as April 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE revise the cost estimate for the TRU waste removal project to reflect the current understanding of project conditions and update the TWF's cost estimate to allow better management of the project's life-cycle costs going forward.

This waste  includes transuranic (TRU) solid waste, which typically consists of  discarded rags, tools, equipment, soil, or other solid materials that have  been contaminated by certain man-made radioactive elements,  particularly plutonium. Exposure to TRU waste is dangerous. In  particular, internal exposure to plutonium through inhaling or swallowing  is an extremely serious health hazard. Because plutonium generally stays  in the body for decades, it exposes organs and tissues to radiation,  increasing the risk of cancer. TRU waste remains radioactive for  extremely long periods: hundreds of thousands of years, in some cases.  To reduce the long-term risks of exposure to this waste, TRU waste must  be disposed of properly.", "Today, LANL is one of the three national laboratories that support the  National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s (NNSA) mission to maintain a  safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons deterrent. NNSA\u2014a  semiautonomous agency established within the Department of Energy  (DOE)\u2014is responsible for managing the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons. LANL  houses most of NNSA\u2019s capabilities for conducting plutonium research  and for producing plutonium \u201cpits,\u201d which are the central cores of nuclear  weapons. Each year, these activities generate new TRU waste at LANL.", "For many years, the TRU waste generated at LANL has been stored and  processed at a location called Area G. The activities that generated TRU  waste at LANL also generated hazardous waste that requires  environmental cleanup. Under a 2005 consent order agreement with the  New Mexico Environment Department, DOE is required to, among other  things, clean up the hazardous waste contamination at Area G and then  close the site by December 6, 2015. To close Area G, DOE must first  complete two TRU waste projects: (1) a TRU waste removal project; and  (2) a TRU Waste Facility (TWF) construction project.", "The goal of the TRU waste removal project is to safely and securely  transfer the TRU waste stored at Area G to the DOE Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.  DOE must complete the TRU  waste removal project before it can complete the hazardous waste  cleanup actions required to close Area G. Most of the TRU waste stored  at Area G is categorized as legacy waste, which NNSA defines as waste  generated at LANL before fiscal year 1999, as opposed to newly  generated waste, which was generated starting in 1999. As the office  within DOE responsible for legacy waste cleanup operations, DOE\u2019s  Office of Environmental Management (EM) receives funding for cleanup  projects, including the TRU waste removal project, and has established  the project management protocols that apply to the project. Unlike at  other DOE sites where EM directly oversees cleanup projects, NNSA has  directly overseen the management and operating contractor at LANL  responsible for the project using EM\u2019s Operations Activity Protocol. EM  and NNSA have collaborated to develop the cost estimates for the  project. In 2006, EM and NNSA estimated that the TRU waste removal  project would cost $729 million to complete by 2012. After encountering  problems maintaining the schedule established as part of the 2006  estimate, EM and NNSA revised the estimate in 2009 to a cost range of  $848 million to $1.2 billion, with a completion date of 2018. However, in  May 2014, DOE placed the TRU waste removal project on hold  indefinitely in response to an incident in February 2014, at WIPP that has  halted all TRU waste shipments to WIPP. The incident involved a TRU  waste container shipped from LANL that ruptured while in storage,  releasing radioactive material. In September 2014, the Secretary of  Energy directed EM and NNSA to develop a plan to transition the direct  federal oversight of the legacy environmental cleanup work at LANL,  including the TRU waste removal project, from NNSA to EM in order to  align the focus and accountability of the cleanup work with EM and  enable NNSA\u2019s management and operating contractor at LANL to focus  on the core national security missions at the lab.", "The goal of the TWF construction project is to replace LANL\u2019s capabilities  that currently reside in Area G for storing and certifying newly generated  TRU waste containers for shipment to WIPP. DOE cannot close Area G  until the replacement facility is operational because LANL needs  continuous TRU waste capabilities to support the ongoing nuclear  weapons mission. NNSA is overseeing the TWF construction project  using DOE\u2019s project management order for capital asset acquisition  projects. In February 2013, NNSA approved the baseline cost estimate  of $99.2 million to complete the TWF\u2019s construction and prepare it for  operations. According to NNSA\u2019s current plan, it expects to complete  construction of the TWF between April 30, 2016, and January 31, 2018.  NNSA also estimated that, once completed, the facility will cost $300  million to operate and maintain for its projected useful life of 50 years,  spanning 2018 through 2068.", "Since 1990, DOE\u2019s management of contracts and projects, including  those executed by NNSA, has been on our list of areas at high risk for  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In particular, DOE and NNSA  have experienced long-standing difficulties in preparing reliable cost  estimates for cleanup projects and capital asset construction projects, as  well as in meeting their cost estimates. In our 2013 High-Risk Update, to  acknowledge progress DOE, including NNSA, has made in managing  nonmajor projects (i.e., those costing less than $750 million), we  narrowed the focus of DOE\u2019s high-risk designation to major contracts and  projects (i.e., those costing $750 million or greater) but noted that we  would continue to monitor nonmajor projects to ensure that progress in  this area continues and is sustained.

The new fiscal year 2015 draft  estimate, currently under review by NNSA and EM, projects that the final  project costs will be approximately $1.6 billion, or $400 million above the  upper range of the 2009 cost estimate.", "NNSA\u2019s TRU waste removal project exceeded the 2006 cost estimate  and is not expected to meet the 2009 cost estimate, in part, because  NNSA and EM developed the cost estimates using aggressive project  funding assumptions that were based on the need to meet the Consent  Order requirement for closing Area G by 2015, according to NNSA and  EM officials. For the 2006 cost estimate, NNSA officials overseeing the  TRU waste removal project developed the parameters of the project  estimate based on the need to remove almost all of the TRU waste by  2012. In particular, to meet these deadlines, NNSA based its cost  estimate on funding projections provided by EM that were consistent with  meeting the Consent Order deadline and that assumed that EM would  increase the yearly funding for environmental cleanup projects at LANL.  According to NNSA and EM officials, they recognized that the funding  assumptions used in the cost estimate were aggressive and that  significant funding shortfalls would inhibit the TRU waste removal  project\u2019s ability to remain on schedule. From fiscal year 2006 through  fiscal year 2008, EM provided approximately $457 million\u2014$284 million  (38 percent) less than the amount requested by NNSA officials for all  cleanup activities at LANL\u2014and, as a result, it was not possible to fund  the TRU waste removal project at the levels established in the 2006  estimate. According to NNSA officials, EM was unable to increase the  funding for LANL cleanup projects due to limited budget flexibility and  competing demands from cleanup projects at other DOE sites.

Similar to the 2006 estimate,  the 2009 cost estimate used funding projections provided by EM that  assumed an increase in the yearly levels of funding for LANL cleanup  activities that were necessary for NNSA to complete the TRU waste  removal project by July of 2018\u20142 and a half years after the Consent  Order deadline in 2015. However, due to the same budget restrictions  that affected cleanup project funding previously, actual funding levels  provided by EM for fiscal years 2009 to 2012 for all cleanup projects at  LANL again came in below the levels requested by NNSA officials at  LANL. Specifically, LANL received approximately $1 billion over these  years, which was $240 million (19 percent) less than the levels requested  by NNSA officials at LANL for cleanup projects at the site. As a result,  funding for the TRU waste removal project was reduced, and this  reduction caused the project to fall behind the schedule set in the 2009  cost estimate, according to NNSA officials. Moreover, the 2009 cost  estimate was never officially approved by NNSA and EM because the  date estimated for project completion was not consistent with the  requirements of the Consent Order. According to NNSA officials, they  could not formally approve the 2009 estimate because it included a 2018  estimated completion date for the TRU waste removal project, which  conflicted with the required 2015 closure date established in the Consent  Order.", "In addition to developing estimates using aggressive funding  assumptions, NNSA did not maintain or use two of the three project  baselines outlined in the Operations Activity Protocol, so the agency  could not measure the progress of the total project. As discussed  previously, NNSA was to manage the TRU waste removal project using  EM\u2019s Operations Activities Protocol, which is intended to provide the  framework for managing and reporting on the progress of cleanup  projects through the use of three performance baselines: life-cycle cost,  contract period of performance, and fiscal year work plan. However, for  the TRU waste removal project, because NNSA did not have an updated  life-cycle cost baseline and did not establish a contract period of  performance baseline, it only used the fiscal year work plan baseline to  manage the project, as discussed below:", "Life-cycle cost baseline. NNSA has not updated the life-cycle cost  baseline for the project since 2009, even though agency officials told  us they were aware that the estimate has been out-of-date since  about 2012. Since that year, the project has undergone significant  changes that affected its estimated cost and completion date. For  example, by initiating the 3706 Campaign in 2012, NNSA altered the  scope of work from what was planned in the 2009 cost estimate.  NNSA and EM officials told us that, although they recognized in 2012  that the 2009 estimate was no longer valid, they did not see the  purpose in completing a new estimate before completion of the  campaign and the expected renegotiation of the Consent Order  deadlines. According to these officials, a new cost estimate for the  project would have either needed to use unreasonably high funding  assumptions to achieve project completion by 2015 or, if it used more  reasonable funding assumptions, it could not have been approved  because of the political issues associated with a completion date  beyond the 2015 Consent Order deadline. The Operations Activities  Protocol requires that EM or NNSA Site Office Managers develop cost  estimates that cover the full life-cycle of a cleanup project, but it  leaves the Site Office Manager discretion to determine whether an  update to the life-cycle cost baseline is required. Because NNSA\u2019s  LANL Site Office Manager, in consultation with EM officials, decided  not to update the life-cycle cost baseline, NNSA could not measure  project performance to determine the impact of management actions.  For example, from fiscal year 2012 to 2014, NNSA used additional  funding that was reallocated to the TRU waste removal project to  increase the pace of TRU waste packaging and removal; however,  because they did not have an updated cost estimate to measure  against, NNSA managers were unable to identify the effect these  actions had on the total cost of the project.", "Contract period of performance baseline. NNSA has not managed  the TRU waste removal project using a contract period of  performance because, according to NNSA officials, the project, like  other projects at LANL, is being conducted through NNSA\u2019s  management and operating contract. According to the Operations  Activities Protocol, a contract period of performance baseline is  required for those cleanup projects that are executed through a  contract that establishes a performance baseline for cost and scope  over the duration of the contract. The management and operating  contract covers all work performed at LANL, but it does not establish a  cost estimate for specific projects such as the TRU waste removal  project, according to NNSA officials. In contrast, for cleanup projects  at EM-managed sites, the scope of the contract is typically limited to  the cleanup project and would not include other site activities that  were unrelated to the project. According to NNSA officials, executing  the TRU waste removal project through the management and  operating contract does not provide the baseline necessary for  establishing a contract period of performance, so NNSA is not  required to manage to a contract period of performance baseline for  this project. According to EM officials, DOE determined that as part of  EM\u2019s transition to direct oversight of the legacy cleanup work at LANL,  EM will transition away from using a management and operations  contract to manage the remaining cleanup work. When this change in  contract type is completed, the officials stated that a contract period of  performance baseline will be available for monitoring performance of  the work, including the TRU waste removal project.", "Fiscal year work plan baseline. NNSA has used the fiscal year work  plans outlined in the Operations Activities Protocol to monitor the  performance of portions of the TRU waste removal project and to  manage and assess the performance of the entire TRU waste  removal project in the absence of an accurate life-cycle cost estimate  baseline or a contract period of performance baseline. According to  NNSA officials, a new fiscal year work plan is developed each year for  the TRU waste removal project using an integrated priorities list for  remaining TRU removal work and the projected funding amount  allocated for LANL cleanup. However, while NNSA and EM site and  headquarters officials monitored progress against the fiscal year work  plan, the agency was unable to evaluate the performance of the entire  TRU waste removal project and identify potential cost overruns  because its life-cycle cost estimate was out-of-date, and it did not  manage to a contract period of performance. The Operations  Activities Protocol requires that the Site Office Manager report yearly  on any variances between total project costs to date and the  estimated costs for the entire project as part of the fiscal year work  plans. However, because NNSA did not have an accurate cost  estimate for the TRU waste removal project, the 2012, 2013, and  2014 fiscal year work plans used the outdated 2009 cost estimate to  report on the variances between the current and estimated costs for  the project. As a result, these fiscal year work plans did not provide  accurate information on project performance to date to help managers  measure total project performance and manage costs.", "At the time of our review, NNSA and EM were in the process of  developing a new cost estimate for the TRU waste removal project that  they expect to complete in fiscal year 2015; however, this estimate may  quickly become inaccurate due to assumptions related to funding and the  status of WIPP that could be invalidated. As discussed previously, the  new draft cost estimate increases the estimated total cost of the project to  $1.6 billion, with a completion date in fiscal year 2023 (i.e., October  2022). According to an NNSA official, this draft estimate uses a more  conservative approach than past estimates by expanding the scope of the  project estimate to include the costs to remove additional TRU waste that  was not included in past estimates.concerning when WIPP will reopen and the need to address the  impending Consent Order deadlines in 2015 that have not yet been  renegotiated with New Mexico, the same NNSA official told us that  several of the new estimate\u2019s assumptions are no longer valid or may not  be valid after a few years. For example, the funding assumptions in the  new estimate may already be invalid. With the TRU waste removal project  on hold as a result of the WIPP closure, the New Mexico Environment  Department is no longer providing deadline extensions for some of  LANL\u2019s hazardous waste cleanup work and, as a result, NNSA officials  managing the cleanup work have had to reprioritize their funding to  attempt to meet those deadlines. Restoring funding to hazardous waste  cleanup projects reduces the funding available for TRU waste removal,  which would invalidate the funding assumptions used in the new cost  estimate. In addition, the NNSA official told us that the new cost estimate  also assumes that LANL will resume TRU waste shipments to WIPP in  fiscal year 2017 based on an unofficial estimate from the WIPP manager  that WIPP will reopen between 18 and 30 months after the initial   However, in light of the uncertainty  assessment of the incident.shipments from LANL in this time frame, the TRU waste removal project  at LANL would be delayed, resulting in additional costs not accounted for  in the new estimate, such as the costs for maintaining the project  workforce longer than anticipated.", "If WIPP does not start accepting TRU waste  To objectively measure the performance of the TRU waste removal  project and take action to manage project costs, NNSA managers of the  project need an updated cost estimate. EM\u2019s Operations Activity Protocol  leaves it to the discretion of the Site Office Manager to update cleanup  project estimates, and NNSA\u2019s LANL Site Office Manager chose to delay  revising the outdated 2009 estimate. As a result, DOE does not have an  estimate of the total cost or completion date of the TRU waste removal  project that uses updated assumptions based on the current  understanding of project conditions. NNSA and EM are developing a new  cost estimate for the project; however, the new estimate may quickly  become inaccurate because of changes in funding, and the status of the  WIPP may soon invalidate its assumptions. According to best practices  for cost estimating, maintaining an updated cost estimate is critical so that  officials making decisions about the future management of a project have  accurate information for assessing their alternatives. By revising the TRU  waste removal project\u2019s estimate to include the current understanding of  project conditions, NNSA program managers could more accurately  identify cost overruns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Cost Estimate for the Transuranic Waste Facility Project at LANL Partially Met Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s cost estimate for the TWF partially met best practices. More  specifically, NNSA\u2019s cost estimate\u2014which consisted of separate cost  estimates for completing construction and for operations and  maintenance, as the TWF\u2019s life-cycle costs\u2014partially reflected each of  the four characteristics of a reliable estimate (comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible) as established by best practices.  In developing the construction estimate, NNSA took several steps that  conformed to best practices, such as validating the construction estimate  by completing an ICE. Although DOE\u2019s project management order for  capital asset projects does not require the use of all best practices in  developing a cost estimate, DOE\u2019s related cost-estimating guidance,  which is optional, describes most of them. In contrast, in developing its  operations and maintenance cost estimate, NNSA did not take steps that  conformed to best practices. In particular, NNSA did not sufficiently  document the approach (i.e., data sources and methodologies) used to  develop the estimate, even though operations and maintenance costs  represented about 74 percent of the total life-cycle costs of the facility.  The reason was that operations and maintenance cost estimates for a  construction project do not need to be updated and documented at CD-2  under DOE\u2019s project management order, as funds for these costs do not  need to be specifically requested from Congress to complete the project.  By not sufficiently documenting the approach used to develop the  estimate, NNSA may not have reliable information to support budgetary  decisions for funding the TWF\u2019s operations and maintenance in the  future. For example, the contractor\u2019s representatives told us that they  estimated the operations and maintenance costs to be $6 million annually  from 2018 through 2068, for a total of $300 million but did not use an  inflation rate in the calculations. Thus, although $6 million may be an  accurate estimate for the first year, without documentation of the  approach used to develop the estimate, we could not determine its  reliability for the first or future years.", "Appendix II provides a summary description of our assessment of  NNSA\u2019s cost estimates for the TWF project\u2019s construction and operations  and maintenance. The following are examples from our assessment, by  best practice characteristic:", "Comprehensive. The TWF estimates partially reflected the  characteristics of comprehensive cost estimates. For example, NNSA  partially followed the best practice for completely defining the  program, as NNSA\u2019s contractor based the TWF construction cost  estimate on a mature design plan that detailed the technical  requirements and characteristics for the TWF. In contrast, for the TWF  operations and maintenance cost estimate, NNSA\u2019s contractor was  not able to provide us with definitions of the technical requirements  and characteristics that would have formed the basis of the estimate,  although the $300 million estimate represented a substantial change  from a $642 million estimate that NNSA\u2019s contractor produced in June  2010 for CD-1 (approve alternative selection and cost range). As a  result, we could not determine whether the $300 million estimate  reflected the most recent TWF design approved at CD-2 to complete  construction. NNSA officials told us they did not develop an updated  and documented basis to support the operations and maintenance  cost estimate because DOE\u2019s project order does not require updated  and documented estimates of all life-cycle costs at CD-2. Instead, at  CD-2, the order focuses on the need for the baseline cost estimate to  complete construction because funding for construction needs to be  specifically requested from Congress to complete the project.  According to best practices, clearly defining the technical  requirements would help to ensure that managers have an adequate  understanding of the facility and where information was limited and  assumptions were made in developing the estimate.", "Well-documented. The TWF estimates partially reflected the  characteristics of well-documented cost estimates. For example,  regarding the construction estimate, NNSA\u2019s contractor documented  the data sources and the methodology used to calculate the  construction estimate so that a cost analyst unfamiliar with the project  could understand what was done and replicate the estimate. In  contrast, NNSA did not document the approach (data sources and  methodologies) used to develop the operations and maintenance  estimate, even though the operations and maintenance costs  represented about 74 percent of the TWF\u2019s life-cycle costs. As  mentioned previously, DOE\u2019s project management order does not  require documentation of the operations and maintenance costs at  CD-2. NNSA was required to report the operations and maintenance  cost estimate by following a DOE budget formulation guidance that  did not specify requirements for documenting the estimate. Because  NNSA did not document the approach used, we could not determine  whether it was appropriate for developing the operations and  maintenance estimate; whether NNSA management reviewed the  estimate, including its risks and uncertainties, or whether NNSA  management approved the estimate.", "Accurate. The TWF estimates partially reflected the characteristics of  accurate cost estimates. For example, NNSA\u2019s contractor partially  followed the best practice for properly adjusting the estimates for  inflation. Regarding the construction estimate, NNSA\u2019s contractor  developed the estimate using pricing data that were adjusted for  inflation. However, the contractor did not then normalize the data to  remove the effects of inflation. According to representatives from the  contractor, they did not believe data normalization was an applicable  step for the TWF construction estimate because the data set was too  small. According to cost-estimating best practices, data normalization  is often necessary to ensure comparability of data sets because data  can be gathered from a variety of sources and in different forms that  need to be adjusted before being used. Regarding the operations and  maintenance estimate, NNSA\u2019s contractor did not properly adjust the  estimate for inflation over the 50-year useful life of the TWF.  Specifically, the contractor\u2019s representatives told us that they  estimated the operations and maintenance costs to be $6 million  annually from 2018 through 2068, for a total of $300 million, but they  did not use an inflation rate in these calculations. Adjusting for  inflation is an important step in developing an estimate because if the  inflation amount is not correct, the estimate is not accurate. Applying  the wrong inflation rate will either result in a higher cost estimate or  estimated costs that are not sufficient to keep pace with inflation.", "Credible. The TWF estimates partially reflected the characteristics of  credible cost estimates. For example, NNSA followed the best  practice to have an ICE completed in January 2013 to validate the  TWF construction costs. However, because DOE\u2019s project  management order does not define the operations and maintenance  costs as project costs, NNSA was not required to include these costs  in the ICE. By not including the TWF operations and maintenance  costs in the ICE, NNSA managers may lack insight into these future  costs. According to best practices, an ICE can provide NNSA  managers with additional insight into the TWF\u2019s potential operations  and maintenance costs\u2014in part, because ICEs frequently use  different methods and are less burdened with organizational bias.  Therefore, according to best practices, an ICE can be used as a  benchmark to assess the reasonableness of the contractor\u2019s  proposed operations and maintenance costs, improving NNSA  management\u2019s ability to make sound investment decisions, and  accurately assess the contractor\u2019s performance. Moreover, because  DOE\u2019s project management order does not require it, NNSA\u2019s  contractor did not follow the best practice to complete a sensitivity  analysis to quantify the extent to which either the construction or  operations and maintenance cost estimates could vary because of  changes in key assumptions and ground rules. Such an analysis is a  best practice because uncertainty cannot be avoided and, therefore, it  is necessary to identify the cost elements that represent the most risk  and, if possible, quantify them. According to cost-estimating best  practices, doing a sensitivity analysis increases the chance that  decisions that influence the design, production, and operation of the  TWF will be made with a focus on the elements that have the greatest  effect on cost.", "According to NNSA officials who oversee the TWF project, combining the  TWF construction estimate with the operations and maintenance estimate  to reflect the life-cycle costs and assessing the combined estimate  obscured the positive steps NNSA took in developing the construction  estimate. We agree that the TWF construction estimate conformed to  several best practices. Examples are as follows:", "NNSA developed the construction estimate based on a mature design  plan for the facility to ensure that it was based on the best available  information at the time,", "NNSA documented the data sources and the methodologies used to  calculate the construction estimate so that a cost analyst unfamiliar  with the project could understand what was done and replicate it, and", "NNSA had an ICE completed to provide an unbiased test of the  reasonableness of the TWF construction costs.", "Nonetheless, as described above, and in appendix II, we also identified  examples where NNSA\u2019s construction estimate did not conform to best  practices. Because NNSA did not follow all best practices for cost  estimating, particularly for the TWF operations and maintenance cost  estimate, NNSA may not have reliable information to support budgetary  decisions for funding the TWF\u2019s operations and maintenance. NNSA  expects the TWF may be ready to start operations as early as April 2016,  and when it does, NNSA will need to balance funding for the TWF with  the operations and maintenance costs for other nuclear infrastructure and  facilities at LANL and other NNSA sites that make up the national nuclear  security enterprise. In December 2013, we found that, as the facilities and  infrastructure that support the nuclear security enterprise continue to age,  maintenance costs are likely to grow. In that report, NNSA officials said  that deferred maintenance projects will have to compete against  programmatic priorities for funding within the overall pool of maintenance  funds available. By having reliable information on the TWF\u2019s costs,  including operations and maintenance, well before the project starts  operations, NNSA managers would be better able to plan for, and  manage the costs of the TWF in balance with other infrastructure in the  national nuclear security enterprise.", "GAO, Project and Program Management: DOE Needs to Revise Requirements and  Guidance for Cost Estimating and Related Reviews, GAO-15-29 (Washington, D.C.: Nov.  25, 2015).

We focused on these  cost estimates because they were developed after the establishment of  the Consent Order in 2005, and they were the most recently completed  estimates for the total cost of the project. During our review, NNSA was in  the process of developing a new cost estimate, the draft fiscal year 2015  cost estimate, for the TRU waste removal project. We interviewed the  NNSA officials and representatives from its LANL contractor who were  working on the draft estimate to understand the cost estimation process  and preliminary results. We reviewed data provided to us by NNSA from  the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Integrated Planning, Accountability,  and Budgeting System on the annual dollars spent for fiscal years 2006  through 2013 for the TRU waste removal project, as well as NNSA\u2019s  estimate of fiscal year 2014 year-end spending for the project.

We also reviewed  data provided to us by NNSA from LANL\u2019s Waste Compliance and  Tracking System on total volumes of TRU waste removed from LANL  from 1999 through July 2014, as well as NNSA\u2019s estimate of the total  volume of TRU waste remaining. We assessed the reliability of the project  data we reviewed and analyzed, and we determined that the data for this  period were sufficiently reliable to examine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s  TRU waste removal project at LANL has met its cost targets. To assess  the reliability of the project data, we reviewed information provided by  NNSA on the data systems used for managing and reporting the data,  including the systems\u2019 controls and checks that ensure the accuracy and  completeness of the data, as well as procedures that were in place to  review and certify the reliability of the data such as inspector general or  internal audit reports of the quality of the data. In addition, we reviewed  NNSA\u2019s fiscal year work plans for the years after NNSA adopted the  Operations Activities Protocol for managing the TRU waste removal  project, fiscal years 2012 through 2014.

We consider a  cost estimate reliable if the overall assessment ratings for each of the four  characteristics are substantially or fully met.
