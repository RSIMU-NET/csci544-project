The continuous availability of GOES data is vital to the success of NWS\u2019 approximately $4.5 billion systems modernization program. GOES is one of two weather satellite systems operated by NOAA; the other is a system of polar-orbiting satellites. Unlike the polar satellites, geostationary weather satellites are placed into a special orbit that allows them to continuously maintain the same view of the earth\u2019s surface. Thus, they are uniquely positioned to observe the development of hazardous weather, such as hurricanes and severe thunderstorms, and track their movement and intensity so that major losses of property and life can be reduced or avoided. Further, the unique ability of geostationary satellites to provide broad, continuously updated coverage of atmospheric conditions over land as well as oceans is very important to NOAA\u2019s weather forecasting operations.", "NOAA\u2019s operating strategy calls for two GOES satellites to be active at all times\u2014one satellite to observe the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern half of the U.S., and the other to observe the Pacific Ocean and the western part of the country. Figure 1.1 shows the coverage provided by two GOES satellites.", "GOES satellites have two primary instruments for collecting weather data: an imager and a sounder. The imager is akin to a camera; it collects data in the form of digital images of the earth or some part of it, based on radiation that is sensed at five different spectral wavelengths or \u201cchannels,\u201d including four in the infrared range and one that corresponds to visible light. Forecasters use animated sequences of imager data to track the development of various weather phenomena. The sounder is mechanically similar to the imager but receives data much more slowly and is sensitive to a broader range of spectral wavelengths. The sounder\u2019s sensitivity to 19 different channels allows it to collect data on a number of natural variables, such as temperature and humidity, and attribute those measurements to specific levels of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The data from both the imager and sounder are relayed to a ground station at Wallops Island, Virginia, which processes the data to make them usable by weather forecasters. Then the data are retransmitted back up to the GOES satellites, which broadcast them to the weather forecasting community.", "NOAA has never been directly responsible for the design and development of any of its meteorological satellites. Instead, the agency has relied on NASA\u2019s expertise in spacecraft design and development. After NOAA defines user requirements for its satellite systems, it turns them over to NASA to contract with industry to design and develop satellites that meet NOAA\u2019s needs. NASA launches and tests the satellites, which are subsequently turned over to NOAA to operate. Beginning in the 1970s, NASA had a formal ongoing program, called the Operational Satellite Improvement Program (OSIP), to develop and demonstrate experimental versions of advanced meteorological satellites and instruments. Successful designs from the OSIP program were often incorporated into NOAA\u2019s operational satellite systems. OSIP was terminated in 1981 due to budgetary constraints at NASA. However, NASA continues to act as the procurement agent for NOAA\u2019s weather satellites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GOES Satellite Development History", "paragraphs": ["Even though GOES satellites have been operational for over 20 years, only one major design change has been implemented. The first generation design was developed and operated experimentally by NASA in the 1960s and early 1970s and subsequently became the basis for the first operational satellites, GOES-1 through GOES-7. Figure 1.2 is an illustration of the first generation design. This series of satellites was \u201cspin-stabilized,\u201d meaning that the satellites slowly spun while in orbit to maintain a stable position with respect to the earth. While these satellites operated effectively, they had technical limitations that NOAA wished to eventually overcome. The imager and the sounder on these satellites shared the same telescopic viewing apparatus and could not collect data at the same time. Further, because the satellite was spinning, it had to collect data very slowly, capturing one narrow band of data each time that its field-of-view swung past the earth. A complete set of sounding data, for example, took 2 to 3 hours to collect.", "In 1982, the National Weather Service (NWS) within NOAA sponsored a review of what new technologies were available and what additional missions could be performed by a new generation of geostationary satellites. The review was supported by NOAA\u2019s National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) as well as by NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and industry representatives. Based on input from these sources, requirements for a new generation spacecraft were developed.", "The new spacecraft design, called GOES-Next, was a significant departure from the first generation GOES. For example, GOES-Next was to be \u201cbody-stabilized.\u201d This meant that the satellite would hold a fixed position in orbit relative to the earth, allowing for continuous meteorological observations. Instead of maintaining stability by spinning, the satellite would preserve its fixed position by continuously making small adjustments in the rotation of internal momentum wheels or by firing small thrusters to compensate for drift. Further, the imager and sounder would be completely separate, so that they could function simultaneously and independently. These and other enhancements meant that the GOES-Next satellites would be able to collect significantly better quality data more quickly than the older series of satellites. However, the improvements would be made at the expense of a heavier and more complex spacecraft. Figure 1.3 is an illustration of the GOES-Next design."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GOES-Next Development Problems", "paragraphs": ["Although GOES-Next represented a complete redesign of NOAA\u2019s geostationary satellite system, satellite industry observers told us that the technical risks involved in developing GOES-Next appeared in the early 1980s to be manageable. Polar-orbiting meteorological spacecraft had already evolved from spin-stabilized to body-stabilized designs, and the GOES-Next builder, Ford Aerospace, had already built a body-stabilized geostationary meteorological satellite for India. Furthermore, the instrument manufacturer, ITT Corporation, had proposed designs that were closely based on successful imagers and sounders it was building for NOAA\u2019s polar-orbiting satellites. On this basis, NOAA did not authorize and NASA did not require engineering analysis prior to GOES-Next development work.", "Despite the spacecraft and instrument design heritage, the GOES-Next program experienced severe technical problems, massive cost overruns, and dangerous schedule delays. Technical issues that had seemed straightforward when the spacecraft design was being conceptualized proved to be substantially more difficult to implement. For example, the original design did not sufficiently take into consideration the harshness of geostationary orbit, which is subject to large daily temperature variations that can stress and warp ordinary materials. Accordingly, the scan mirrors on the instruments had to be completely redesigned using other materials. It was also discovered that it would be very difficult to establish the fine pointing necessary to meet requirements for accurately mapping the satellite\u2019s detailed images to their exact position on earth.", "These and other problems led to an increase of over 200 percent in NOAA\u2019s estimate of the overall development cost of the GOES-next program\u2014from $640 million in 1986 to $2.0 billion in 1996. Also, the first launch of a GOES-next satellite, which had been planned for July 1989, did not occur until April 1994. This nearly 5-year schedule slip left NOAA in real danger of temporarily losing geostationary satellite data coverage. Fortunately, due to the exceptional robustness of the last remaining first-generation satellite, GOES-7, as well as the use of a borrowed European satellite, NOAA was able to avoid a gap in coverage. GAO reported in 1991 that design complexity, inadequate management of the program by NASA and NOAA, and poor contractor performance all contributed to the cost, schedule, and technical problems experienced by the GOES-next program. Although some technical problems remain, the first two of these satellites, GOES-8 and GOES-9, are now producing useful, high quality weather data daily.", "The GOES-Next contract with Space Systems/Loral is for five spacecraft, designated GOES-I through GOES-M. Once the first two in the series, GOES-I and GOES-J, were successfully launched and placed in orbit, they were redesignated GOES-8 and GOES-9 respectively. The other three spacecraft in the GOES-Next series, GOES-K, GOES-L, and GOES-M, are in various stages of production. The GOES-K spacecraft has been completed and is scheduled for launch in April 1997. If GOES-8 and GOES-9 are still operational then, GOES-K will be stored at a central location in orbit and activated when either of its two predecessors fails. GOES-M and GOES-L are planned to be launched in 2000 and 2002, respectively. GOES-M, which has a stronger frame than the other satellites in the series, will be launched ahead of GOES-L in order to accommodate a new and heavier secondary instrument for measuring the space environment, called the Solar X-ray Imager."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In February 1996, the House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, requested that we review NOAA\u2019s management of the GOES Program.

The same meteorological instruments as the current series will be used, and the spacecraft itself (called the spacecraft \u201cbus\u201d) will be very similar. According to government and industry officials, limiting the amount of new design work should make an accelerated procurement feasible. NOAA, working through NASA, its procurement agent, has already negotiated a contract with the instrument manufacturer, ITT Corporation, to deliver up to four additional sets of GOES imagers and sounders to be flown on the continuation series satellites. NOAA and NASA also plan to soon issue a Request for Proposals for two to four spacecraft busses and expect several manufacturers to submit bids. In most cases, bids are likely to be based on modified versions of standard spacecraft busses that manufacturers have developed to satisfy commercial needs for geostationary communications satellites. NOAA and NASA plan to negotiate a firm fixed-price contract with the winner of the spacecraft bus competition.", "Although the instruments on the continuation series spacecraft will be identical to those currently in use, the spacecraft busses will not. The current spacecraft bus, which was designed by Space Systems/Loral in the mid 1980s, has never been able to fully meet NOAA\u2019s original GOES-Next specifications for spacecraft pointing. Designing the spacecraft to point very precisely at the earth and maintain that precise orientation is important because it allows the data collected by the instruments, especially the imager, to be mapped very accurately to their exact location on the surface of the earth. Because the GOES-Next spacecraft has been unable to achieve the originally required precision, extra work routinely needs to be done by spacecraft operators to correct for errors in mapping GOES data to its proper position over the earth\u2019s surface. According to NASA and NOAA officials, improvements in pointing accuracy made in commercial spacecraft busses since the time that the GOES-Next design was finalized will better meet original GOES-Next specifications and are expected to be incorporated into the continuation series spacecraft.", "Other, relatively minor improvements are expected in the spacecraft busses as well. For example, an improved power system, based on more recent battery technology, should reduce certain brief observation gaps that occur periodically with the current design.", "NOAA considered several other approaches before arriving at its current procurement strategy. Originally, NOAA intended to procure four or five additional \u201cclones\u201d of the current spacecraft from Loral on a sole-source basis. The clones would have been largely identical to the current spacecraft, using new parts only in cases where original parts were no longer available. However NASA and NOAA officials jointly concluded that the government would not be justified in avoiding a competitive procurement, and this strategy was dropped. NOAA then considered buying just one or two clones from Loral, to be followed by a competitive procurement for a continuation series. In September 1996, we reported that significant cost savings were not expected from the sole-source clone procurement and that requirements for a follow-on system had not been determined. Because of concerns raised by ourselves and others, NOAA eventually also abandoned this second strategy.", "NOAA\u2019s current strategy has advantages over earlier approaches that involved buying clones of the GOES-Next spacecraft. As discussed above, procuring a new spacecraft bus will allow NOAA to take advantage of technical improvements that have already been developed for commercial customers, such as greater pointing accuracy and a more capable power subsystem. In addition, use of a competitively awarded, firm fixed-price contract can be expected to help control or reduce costs.", "While moving to a fully competitive procurement approach for the continuation series, NOAA is also planning to reserve the option to obtain an additional satellite in the current series in the event that one is needed before the first satellite in the continuation series can be completed. To do this, NOAA and NASA are negotiating a \u201cwarranty option\u201d as an extension to the current contract with Space Systems/Loral. Under this arrangement, NASA will contract with Loral to procure necessary long-lead time parts so that it is ready to build an extra spacecraft of the current type, if such a spacecraft is needed due to (1) the premature failure of either GOES-8 or GOES-9, which were designed to last 5 years each, or (2) a launch failure of the GOES-K spacecraft in April 1997. Should either of these occur, NOAA plans to advance the launches of GOES-L and GOES-M and subsequently launch the warranty spacecraft to ensure continuity until the first continuation series spacecraft is available. NOAA and NASA will determine by mid-1998 whether to exercise this warranty option and complete construction of the additional spacecraft.", "NOAA does not yet know what the continuation series will cost.

Although NOAA has determined that it will need the first one in 2002, the actual date that a replacement satellite is launched may be different.

A major risk for any satellite program is the chance that a spacecraft launch will fail, necessitating that future planned launches be moved up to try to compensate for the lost spacecraft.

NOAA and NASA officials have told us that a failure rate of one in five launches is a reasonable estimate for the GOES program. NOAA has factored this risk into its launch schedule by designating the GOES-L launch in 2002 as a \u201cplanned failure.\u201d GOES-L will be the fifth and last in the current (GOES-Next) series. Because NOAA assumes for planning purposes that the GOES-L launch will fail, it is planning to have the next spacecraft (the first in the continuation series) ready for launch at the same time. NOAA officials told us that it is especially important to plan for the next spacecraft to be available at the same time as GOES-L is launched because it will be the first in a new series and may be vulnerable to schedule delays because of development problems. Conservatively scheduling its launch at the same time as GOES-L is one way to try to compensate for the risk of development delays. However, the success of other launches, especially the launch of GOES-K in April 1997, will also be of critical importance. If the GOES-K launch were to fail, NOAA could risk a gap in coverage between 1998 and 2000. NOAA GOES program officials told us that if this situation were to occur, they would attempt to move up the GOES-L or GOES-M launches to reduce the length of the coverage gap.", "Unexpected component failures are another source of risk to the launch schedule. GOES-8 and GOES-9, for example, are now expected to operate for only 3 years, due to several technical problems that were unforeseen when they were launched. The two satellites were launched in April 1994 and May 1995, respectively, and had been designed to last 5 years each. The most serious of the technical problems is a tendency of the motor windings within the satellites\u2019 meteorological instruments to break due to thermal stress. Each of the satellite\u2019s two instruments has a primary and a backup motor winding. If both windings fail, the instrument cannot operate. The 3-year lifetime for GOES-8 and GOES-9 was determined in mid 1996 after one winding (out of a total of four) had already failed on each spacecraft. If the revised predictions for the lifetimes of GOES-8 and GOES-9 are accurate, NOAA runs the risk of having only one operational satellite (GOES-K, assuming it is successfully launched in April 1997) between 1998 and 2000. As described above for launch failures, if this situation were to occur, NOAA officials would attempt to move up the GOES-L or GOES-M launches to reduce the length of the coverage gap. They would also likely exercise the warranty option on the GOES-Next contract to ensure continuity until the first continuation series satellite were available.", "Although it is possible to move up scheduled launches, NOAA officials say that it is difficult to do so for several reasons. First, the spacecraft itself must be ready for launch at the earlier date, which may not be practical if integration and ground testing have not been completed well in advance of the previously anticipated launch date. Second, only a limited number of commercial launch opportunities (usually six) are available each year for the Atlas launch vehicle that GOES spacecraft are designed to use. Most, if not all, of those launch opportunities are reserved far in advance. In order to move a launch forward, NOAA officials need to be able to find another scheduled launch that can be deferred and replaced by the GOES spacecraft. Third, it may be difficult to move a launch forward from one fiscal year to another because funding may not be available to support a launch. NOAA officials told us that a GOES launch costs approximately $25 million (not including the cost of the Atlas IIA launch vehicle itself, which is approximately $80 to 90 million).", "Because of the many uncertainties in its planned launch schedule, NOAA has not made a final determination of how many satellites in the continuation series it will procure. The possibility of exercising the warranty option on the current GOES-Next contract, in addition to the chance that the existing satellites will last longer than 3 years and that none of the planned launches will fail, are all factors that could delay the need date for the first continuation series spacecraft, either singly or in combination. Conversely, NOAA\u2019s current predictions for satellite lifetimes and launch failures could hold true, in which case the first continuation series spacecraft would be needed in 2002.", "The number of continuation series satellites needed also depends on when the potential for a coverage gap ends. The potential gap will end whenever the first of a new, follow-on series of satellites is available for deployment. As stated earlier, government and industry aerospace experts agree that it takes approximately 10 years to develop a new spacecraft system. If work were begun in 1998, the first spacecraft in a new GOES series would, therefore, be ready in about 2008 and could be launched as the GOES-Q spacecraft. (See figure 2.1.) Under this scenario, three continuation series satellites would be needed (GOES-N, -O, and -P). If satellites in the current series last longer than NOAA expects, or the expected launch failure does not occur, NOAA\u2019s schedule could easily slip one or two years for the later launches. In that situation, only two continuation series satellites might be needed.", "NOAA\u2019s planned continuation series contract will be for two spacecraft with two separate options for one additional spacecraft each.

A list of requirements was developed and turned over to NASA in May 1989 for an assessment of architectural options for a follow-on GOES program. Specifically, NOAA asked that NASA examine options for modifying the GOES-Next system to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and satisfy the new requirements. In response, NASA examined a range of three architectural options and presented its results in October 1990. NASA\u2019s final report indicated that the study had been very limited, both by resources and by the restriction of only looking at modifications to the GOES-Next architecture. NASA recommended that a more thorough study be conducted and that development work be immediately begun on the more challenging technical features of its design options. However, no further resources were committed to this line of effort.", "Since 1990, NOAA officials involved in the GOES program have made several attempts to initiate a follow-on program but have not received agency approval to move forward. An internal presentation delivered in March 1993 proposed studying a number of alternative approaches to the current GOES architecture, including flying low-cost weather cameras as secondary payloads on non-NOAA geostationary satellites. The presentation stressed the need to begin a formal study phase in fiscal year 1996 in order to have sufficient time to develop and implement a new architecture by 2008.

Although NOAA\u2019s approach is effective in putting an extra spacecraft into the production stream to compensate for a launch failure, it is ineffective in providing backup for each launch. An alternative approach would be to schedule each launch to be backed up by the next spacecraft in the production stream. Such an approach would not require procurement of any additional spacecraft or launch vehicles and would enhance NOAA\u2019s ability to compensate for launch failures by planning to have spacecraft always available for backup launches.", "According to NOAA satellite acquisition officials, the GOES program originally included the concept of maintaining an on-orbit spare in addition to the two operational satellites. The spare would be maintained in a central position and then moved either east or west to replace the first operational satellite that failed. As soon as possible after the on-orbit spare was activated, a new spare would be launched. If both GOES-8 and GOES-9 are still operating in April 1997 when GOES-K is launched, it will be put into on-orbit storage in the central location for up to 2 years. However, aside from this particular case, NOAA has not decided to move to this method of backup. Among aerospace experts, on-orbit storage of satellites is controversial. Although the practice can reduce the risk of a break in satellite coverage, other risks are incurred in the process of storing a spacecraft in orbit that could reduce its capabilities once it is activated. For example, a satellite stored in orbit would be susceptible to the possibility of radiation damage that it would not face if it were stored on the ground.

Forecasters have also discovered that combining data from two of the imager\u2019s infrared channels allows them to detect fog at night, a new capability that had not been planned when the imager was designed. This capability has helped forecasters in the West give advance warning to airports of the likelihood of early morning fog that could affect the startup of flight operations.", "According to NOAA and NASA officials, many forecasters would also like to see an increased availability of \u201crapid scan\u201d images of severe weather activity, such as thunderstorms and hurricanes. Rapid scan images are collected at short time intervals\u2014every few minutes\u2014so that a rapidly evolving storm can be carefully monitored and its direction and severity predicted. Since accurate prediction of severe weather is a critical activity for the NWS, there is high demand for rapid scan data when severe weather develops. However, GOES imagers cannot simultaneously produce rapidly updated imagery of storm activity within the continental United States and also collect a full set of data from the rest of the western hemisphere, which is important for routine weather forecasting. The conflicting demands for close-up (or \u201cmesoscale\u201d) views of severe storms and broad (or \u201csynoptic\u201d) views of hemispheric weather patterns are difficult to resolve.

Although sounder data from polar satellites is routinely used in preparing near-term weather forecasts, geostationary sounder data were never used on a daily basis in the numerical prediction models that provide the basic guidance to NWS forecasters until very recently. The sounder on GOES-4 through GOES-7 was very slow and could not be used at the same time as the imager. As a result, sounder data were used only for special experiments. With the advent of GOES-8 in 1994, continuous geostationary sounder data has been available for the first time. However, as stated above, these data are available mainly to researchers. Most weather forecasters have had no direct exposure to GOES sounder data.", "NOAA researchers are investigating a number of promising uses for GOES sounder data. For example, studies performed at the University of Wisconsin have shown that precipitation forecasts and hurricane landfall predictions can be improved by using temperature and moisture data from the sounder in conjunction with the imager data that is traditionally used for such predictions. Although key NOAA officials believe sounder data will grow in importance in the future, the degree of added value that the sounder could contribute to NWS\u2019 prediction models has been difficult to determine. Some researchers believe the data could significantly improve forecasts, while others believe the improvement would be only marginal. Meteorologists at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, which run the prediction models that guide NWS forecasters, had been hesitant to put the sounder data into operational use until they completed their own evaluations. However, they now plan to begin incorporating GOES sounder data into their standard prediction models by the middle of 1997.", "Given that experience with this data has been limited, it is difficult to determine how valuable sounder data may be in the future.

When NOAA developed the current generation, it moved from a relatively small and easy to operate spacecraft to one that is larger and much more complex. The newer satellites require a more expensive launch vehicle because they are larger and heavier than the first generation satellites. Furthermore, more extensive ground support is required to keep the spacecraft operating. These factors contribute to increased costs.", "Aerospace experts in industry and academia have identified a variety of options for attempting to reduce the costs of weather satellite systems such as GOES. For example, a number of studies have been done of alternative architectures based on smaller satellites carrying fewer instruments, which would have the potential to reduce launch and production costs. In the case of GOES, an architecture based on smaller satellites carrying one critical meteorological instrument instead of two could be considered. According to a recent study supported by NASA and the Department of Defense, cost reduction occurs predominantly, although not entirely, in small spacecraft, which tend to be inherently simpler and cost less than large spacecraft. Further, a smaller spacecraft would not need as large a launch vehicle as the current GOES system uses. Currently, GOES satellites are launched on Atlas IIA vehicles, which cost $80 to $90 million each. Smaller satellites could be designed to use Delta vehicles, for example, which currently cost $45 to $50 million apiece, or perhaps an even smaller vehicle. While the actual cost of launching a smaller GOES satellite 10 or more years from now cannot be determined, it is likely to continue to be cheaper than the launch cost for a large satellite.", "A recent study by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University shows that a small spacecraft architecture can increase the flexibility of the system to respond to failures and, in doing so, potentially reduce costs relative to an architecture based on larger satellites. For example, in the GOES system, failure of an instrument or a critical subsystem on one of the current spacecraft would likely necessitate the launch of a replacement, even though the original spacecraft might still retain some capabilities. If a smaller satellite architecture were used, in which each spacecraft would have only one primary meteorological instrument, the failure of an instrument would not affect the operations of the instruments flying on other spacecraft. Similarly, the failure of a critical subsystem, such as the communications or power subsystems, would only affect one instrument instead of two. Thus the overall robustness of the system would be enhanced.", "Based on discussions with NOAA, NASA, and academic experts, it appears that a smaller satellite architecture could also provide greater flexibility in the deployment of meteorological instruments. Currently, imagers and sounders are always deployed in pairs (one set per satellite) so that an operational constellation of a pair of instruments in both the east and west locations can be maintained. Flying the instruments on separate spacecraft would allow greater flexibility to position individual instruments in orbital locations where they are most needed and to change the locations of specific instruments in the event of a spacecraft failure or other emergency. It could also allow deployment of differing numbers of imagers and sounders to meet changing user needs.", "Making a decision about this or any other alternative architecture is not a simple task. Clearly, there are drawbacks to the small satellite architecture as well as advantages. Using such an architecture could require significantly more spacecraft launches, for example, even though the launch vehicles used would be smaller. The increased launch workload would have to be manageable by available launch facilities and ground crews. Ground operations, though possibly simplified for each spacecraft, would have to handle a larger total number of spacecraft. Also, the secondary instruments currently flown on GOES satellites would have to be accounted for, either within the new architecture or on other satellite systems.

For example, greater operational autonomy could be built into the spacecraft\u2019s control systems, allowing them to carry out orbit determination and station-keeping with less intensive involvement of ground controllers. High-density computers and memory devices combined with advanced software techniques could enable extensive on-board data processing and screening, reducing the amount of data to be transmitted to earth.

Specifically, technological advances now allow for placing a much larger array of more sensitive optoelectronic detectors inside the instruments, thus producing higher resolution data more quickly. In 1996, NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center proposed developing and flying an experimental satellite to be called the Geostationary Advanced Technology Environmental System (GATES) that would demonstrate this technology, known as focal plane arrays. Other proposals for advanced geostationary weather imagers have also been made in recent years, based on focal plane array technology. For example, the MITRE Corporation prepared a report in 1993 that assessed the development of an advanced focal plane array imager that could fly as a secondary payload on a commercial communications satellite. MITRE concluded in its study that such an imager would be feasible and would offer improved resolution and radiometric performance.

Because development risks were thought to be well understood and manageable, NOAA did not authorize and NASA did not require that engineering analysis be done prior to GOES-Next development work.

In discussions with us, NOAA officials confirmed that a follow-on program is not being planned until 2003 at the earliest.", "Commerce did provide information on four small research efforts that it has recently funded or that are currently underway to examine advanced technology and alternative architectures for potential adoption in the future. Two of these were initiated in February 1997, as we were completing our review. They include the Advanced Geostationary Studies program being supported by both NOAA and NASA and the contract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop design concepts for an advanced imager. The other two items mentioned by Commerce in its comments are an Aerospace Corporation study of possible future architectures, begun in late 1996, and support from MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory for several items, including the Aerospace architecture study, the advanced imager work, and a geostationary microwave sounder study.", "We believe that these are valuable activities and have included references to them where appropriate in the report. However, they do not obviate our overall concerns about planning for the future of the GOES program. Activities such as these are useful but do not represent a commitment to exploring all options and developing a new generation of satellites. The fiscal year 1998 NOAA budget request does not allow for either a follow-on program to formally begin until 2003 at the earliest or for enhanced instruments to be flown on the continuation series. Therefore, NOAA\u2019s ability to take action based on the results of these studies is questionable. Other studies funded by NOAA, such as the work on advanced sounders and imagers that is mentioned in our report, have not led to any operational implementation.", "We believe that continued deferral of the follow-on program is risky because it forgoes the opportunity to identify and develop a potentially more effective and economical architecture. Furthermore, the longer that NOAA continues without actively considering other options for a future system, the more it risks having to procure additional continuation series satellites, because the availability date for a fully developed new satellite system will slip farther into the future."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
