GAO obtained and reviewed shipment documentation for over 12.1 million of the 13.9 million gallons of Agent Orange procured by the Department of Defense (DOD). GAO reviewed logbooks for 96 percent (152 of 158) of those shipments and identified that vessels stopped at various ports on the way to Southeast Asia, including at least one vessel carrying Agent Orange that stopped at Guam.

For example, the list lacks clarity in descriptive information and omits both testing and storage locations and additional time periods covered by testing events. Also, the list has not been updated in over a decade, though DOD and VA have obtained reports on its shortcomings since 2006. Both DOD and VA communicate with veterans in response to inquiries about Agent Orange, but some veterans GAO met with expressed confusion regarding how to obtain information on potential exposure. DOD officials acknowledged this confusion and stated that veterans are contacting multiple agencies to obtain such information. However, DOD and VA have not established a formal process for coordinating on how best to communicate information to veterans and the public regarding the presence of Agent Orange outside of Vietnam. Without a reliable list with complete and accurate information and a formal process for DOD and VA to coordinate on communicating this information, veterans and the public do not have quality information about the full extent of locations where Agent Orange was present and where exposure could potentially have occurred.", "Challenges exist with testing for Agent Orange today due to degradation of the herbicide's two chemical components and a potential for sources of contamination other than the herbicide.

The suggested half-life of the dioxin 2,3,7,8-TCDD\u2014a by-product of the 2,4,5-T manufacturing process\u2014is much longer, but there are multiple sources of dioxins, including the burning of wood and waste. DOD and the U.S. and Guam Environmental Protection Agencies are testing for the acid form of the components of Agent Orange at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. While acknowledging the low probability of conclusively identifying the components of Agent Orange on Guam, DOD has made a decision to move forward with testing to address veterans' and the public's concerns, and it expects to complete the updates for the sampling and analysis plan, field sampling, analysis, and reporting in early 2019."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD develop a process for updating its list of Agent Orange testing and storage locations, and that DOD and VA develop a process for coordinating the communication of information on where Agent Orange was known to have been present.

Tactical herbicides were intended  for use by the U.S. military in the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, but were  not intended for use on U.S. military installations. During the mid-1960s,  U.S. chemical companies manufactured and shipped large quantities of  tactical herbicides to Vietnam for use by the U.S. military to eliminate  enemy cover and destroy the enemy\u2019s crops.

The U.S. EPA has  determined that there was not adequate data either to support or to refute  that the acid or ester forms of 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans. In  2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified 2,4-D as  possibly causing cancer to humans, since there was inadequate evidence  in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.

In 1944 the Crops Division was  given the mission of developing chemical compounds to destroy or  reduce the value of crops. These chemical compounds were intended to  rapidly clear vegetation in military operations in order to eliminate  concealed enemy positions, improve air and ground observations, and  destroy or reduce the value of crops. Initial field trials at Camp Detrick  were small-scale efforts involving test plots typically 6 by 18 feet in size,  and the herbicides being tested were usually applied using a hand  sprayer. Over the following three decades, DOD collaborated with the  U.S. Department of Agriculture, universities, and private companies to  conduct testing activities ranging from laboratory experiments to spray  tests of larger-scale aerial dissemination of a variety of chemical  compounds throughout the United States, U.S. territories, and abroad.", "The tactical herbicides used by the U.S. military in Vietnam were  formulations based on tests of thousands of different chemical  compositions at Camp Detrick in an effort to determine chemical agents  and chemical compounds that would meet specific requirements. The  U.S. military developed and tested six tactical \u201crainbow\u201d herbicides that it  used during the Vietnam War era\u2014Pink, Purple, Green, Blue, White, and  Orange. The chemical component n-butyl 2,4,5-T, which is known to have  been contaminated with 2,3,7,8-TCDD, was present in four of these six  tactical herbicides\u2014specifically, Agents Pink, Purple, Green, and  Orange. In late 1961, DOD began color-coding the herbicide  formulations that it was testing in aerial spray trials in Vietnam and  elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The tactical herbicides, which were used for  a variety of different purposes, to include defoliation and crop destruction,  were identified by colored bands placed around the drums, as shown in  figure 2. Beginning in 1962, the U.S. Air Force received shipments of  Agents Pink, Purple, and Green to supply the first spray missions for  Operation Ranch Hand, the program for defoliation and crop destruction  missions during the Vietnam War. Agent Purple was similar to the  herbicide formulation that was later designated \u201cOrange,\u201d but it was more  costly to purchase. Agents Blue and White were used in Vietnam  extensively along with Agent Orange after 1964, but they were of a  different chemical composition and did not contain any form of 2,4,5-T,  the component that produced 2,3,7,8-TCDD as a by-product of the  manufacturing process.", "Of the tactical herbicides, Agent Orange was used the most extensively in  Vietnam. In 1964 DOD began to procure large quantities from U.S.  manufacturers for military use in Vietnam. The first shipment of Agent  Orange arrived in Saigon in February 1965 by merchant vessel. Together,  nine manufacturers produced a total of approximately 13.9 million gallons  of Agent Orange, and DOD is estimated to have used approximately  12.1 million gallons between 1965 and 1970 in operations in Vietnam,  and much smaller quantities in Korea and Thailand.", "Evidence from animal and epidemiologic studies of adverse effects from  Agent Orange exposure led the U.S. government to restrict the use of  2,4,5-T in April of 1970 and led DOD to temporarily suspend the use of  Agent Orange. In 1972 the U.S. Air Force consolidated the approximately  1.36 million gallons of the herbicide that had remained unused in Vietnam  and shipped them for storage on Johnston Island in the Pacific. DOD  held its remaining stocks of Agent Orange\u2014approximately 860,000  gallons\u2014within the continental United States, at the Naval Construction  Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi, until those stocks were also  shipped toward Johnston Island in June 1977.

The U.S. military managed tactical herbicides differently  from commercial herbicides. According to DOD officials and archived  military specifications, tactical herbicides were not authorized for use on  lands owned by, or otherwise managed as military installations and were  not to be diverted for domestic use. DOD developed military  specifications for the tactical herbicides that provided detailed information  on product requirements, quality assurance, packaging, and  precautionary statements that prohibited domestic use. The tactical  herbicides were centrally managed, first by the Army Chemical Corps and  later by the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command. Agent Orange used in  Vietnam was formulated for aerial spraying by aircraft and helicopter and  applied at full strength without additional solvents at a rate of 3 gallons  per acre. Agent Orange is soluble in diesel fuel and organic solvents, but  it is insoluble in water, so equipment was cleaned using diesel fuel rather  than water.", "Commercial herbicides, conversely, were widely available worldwide for  use in vegetation management at military installations, to include  controlling vegetation adjacent to flightlines or along perimeter fencing.  Federal agencies developed federal specifications for these products to  ensure that they met specific requirements, and these specifications were  approved by the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service, in the General  Services Administration for use by all federal agencies. According to DOD  officials, during the Vietnam era there was no requirement for DOD to  retain records concerning the use of commercial herbicides on military  bases beyond 5 years. DOD officials also stated that DOD catalogued  these herbicides available for use on military installations in the federal  supply schedule under federal supply classification group 68, which  contains chemicals and chemical products.", "In reviewing supply catalogues from that time period, DOD officials  identified more than 35 different commercial herbicides that were listed in  the federal supply system for use on DOD installations between 1960 and  1973. Some of these commercial herbicides contained 2,4-D; 2,4,5-T; or  both, although they were not in the n-butyl form used in Agent Orange.  These included at least 4 commercial herbicides that contained some  form of 2,4,5-T, the component that contained the contaminant 2,3,7,8- TCDD. In addition, numerous commercial herbicides that were not in the  federal supply system but were being widely used elsewhere for  agriculture purposes contained the form of n-butyl 2,4,5-T found in Agent  Orange and thus its associated contaminant, 2,3,7,8-TCDD. According to  DOD officials, the commercial herbicides used on installations were  mixed with diesel or water and sprayed by hand or truck. Tactical  herbicides, however, were formulated for aerial spraying by fixed-wing  aircraft or helicopter without being diluted.", "When the U.S. military was employing these tactical and commercial  herbicides during the Vietnam War era, U.S. EPA had not yet been  established, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture had oversight of  commercial herbicides. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act of 1947, then administered by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, governed the marketing and use of these commercial  herbicides. Until amended in 1972, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,  and Rodenticide Act review process was designed as a consumer  protection measure that focused primarily on a product\u2019s effectiveness,  rather than on concerns about health or the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agent Orange Legislative and Regulatory History", "paragraphs": ["The Agent Orange Act of 1991, as amended, requires a review of the  available scientific evidence regarding the associations between certain  diseases and exposure to tactical herbicides.

Thus, the  total quantity of Agent Orange that DOD procured was approximately  equal to the total quantity that records indicate was tested in the United  States and its territories, damaged during storage and shipment, and  used during the Vietnam War, combined with the total quantity that  records indicate was disposed of afterwards.", "Procurement and Use. Based on available records we reviewed, DOD  procured approximately 13.9 million gallons of Agent Orange from nine  chemical manufacturers between 1963 and 1968. In 1963 DOD used  small amounts of Agent Orange for testing. DOD procurement officers  then advised the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in late 1964 that  they could fulfill the supply requirements for tactical herbicides with Agent  Orange. Available records further indicate that of the approximately 13.9  million gallons of Agent Orange procured, DOD used an estimated 12.1  million gallons in operations in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970. In addition to  the quantity used in Vietnam, Agent Orange usage also included  quantities that were tested in the United States and its territories; used or  tested in countries outside of Vietnam; lost during shipment and storage;  or removed from the inventory and used to test different disposal options  after its use was suspended. With the exception of the disposal testing  amounts, no archival resources we could locate and obtain provided  definitive usage figures. The last known shipment of Agent Orange to  Vietnam was aboard the SS Frederick Lykes and arrived in May 1970.", "Restrictions on Use. In 1969 the National Environmental Health Service  of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare conducted testing of  n-butyl 2,4,5-T\u2014the component of Agent Orange whose manufacturing  process produced 2,3,7,8-TCDD as a by-product\u2014on mice, which raised  concerns about health effects of the herbicide for women of child-bearing  age. These concerns led to several U.S. government decisions that  ended the use of tactical herbicides. Specifically, in 1969 DOD restricted  the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam to keep it away from population  centers. In April 1970 the federal government began restricting the use of  2,4,5-T in the United States. Exceptions were made for the control of  weeds and brush on range, pasture, and forests, or on rights of way and  other nonagricultural land. On April 15, 1970, DOD temporarily  suspended the use of Agent Orange, including new procurement,  acceptance of product on terminated contracts, transfer of stocks at  Gulfport, and ocean shipping operations.", "Consolidation and Incineration of Remaining Stocks. After the U.S.  government restricted the use of n-butyl 2,4,5-T\u2014a component of Agent  Orange\u2014in 1970, DOD decided to consolidate the remaining 2.3 million  gallons of Agent Orange stored in Vietnam and Gulfport, Mississippi, as  well as any remaining amounts of n-butyl 2,4,5-T. According to an Office  of Air Force History monograph, on January 16, 1971, DOD ordered the  termination of all crop destruction missions by U.S. forces in Vietnam, and  on September 27 of that year, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  directed the Air Force to return all remaining stocks of Agent Orange to  the United States and to dispose of them. Specifically,", "Agent Orange stocks in Vietnam were temporarily stored at U.S. Air  Force bases at Da Nang, Phu Cat, and Bien Hoa until they were  moved to Johnston Island in 1972. In 1972 the U.S. military moved  approximately 1.36 million gallons of Agent Orange onto Johnston  Island for storage. The cargo vessel SS Transpacific picked up this  quantity at three Vietnamese ports from March 15 to April 1, traveled  to Johnston Island, arrived on April 18, and completed offloading on  April 28 before returning to the United States. This consolidated  quantity of Agent Orange from Vietnam remained at Johnston Island  until 1977.", "The Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi, was  the final storage location in the continental United States for Agent  Orange until the U.S. Air Force began the incineration of Agent  Orange in 1977. There were approximately 860,000 gallons of Agent  Orange at this location in 1977, which takes into account amounts lost  in Hurricane Camille in 1969 or shipped away for testing, as described previously. The 1977 figure also takes into account 14,025 gallons  transferred to the Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, from  Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where the Air Force had tested  formulations of Agent Orange for aerial spraying. In addition, available  records show that quantities of the two components of Agent Orange  were stored at the former Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, until 1972  before they were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for  brush control projects. These reported amounts included 106,260  gallons of n-butyl 2,4-D and 38,940 gallons of n-butyl 2,4,5-T. These  records also show that 173,910 gallons of Agent Blue were stored at  the installation; see figure 5.", "DOD chartered the incinerator ship M/T Vulcanus and loaded the 860,000  gallons stored at Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport,  Mississippi, beginning in May 1977. The vessel left Gulfport, Mississippi,  in June 1977, and began incinerating the Agent Orange on board in July  1977 in a research burn to test the incineration process at sea near  Johnston Island. In August 1977, the M/T Vulcanus loaded the remaining  1.36 million gallons stored at Johnston Island and conducted two more  incineration operations just southwest of Johnston Island, as shown in  figure 6.

However, shipment  documentation is incomplete. Manufacturers of Agent Orange blended  the two components of the herbicide\u2014the n-butyl forms of 2,4-D and  2,4,5-T\u2014and marked 55-gallon drums for shipment to Southeast Asia.  Available records indicate that manufacturers produced Agent Orange  according to military specifications and marked all drums for shipment  directly to the receiving U.S. military unit in Vietnam. These specifications  indicated the precise herbicide formulation of Agent Orange (n-butyl  esters, 50 percent 2,4-D and 50 percent 2,4,5-T) and general instructions  for marking the 55-gallon drums for shipment. For example, according to  a historical monograph by the San Antonio Air Materiel Area, DOD  specified that each drum was to be marked with a colored band or bands  around the center as well as with transportation and contract data. Figure  7 shows an example of these drum markings.", "DOD then arranged for the transport of these drums, as well as drums of  other tactical herbicides, by train from the manufacturers to several U.S.  ports. DOD transportation officials accepted the product by signing a  Material Inspection and Receiving Report that indicated the destination of  the rail shipment and the final destination in Vietnam. DOD primarily  chartered merchant marine vessels to ship the drums to Southeast Asia,  but we identified one official Navy vessel, the USNS Lt. George W.G.  Boyce, that carried Agent Orange to Southeast Asia. The first known  shipment of Agent Orange left the port of New Orleans, Louisiana, on the  SS Adabelle Lykes and arrived in Vietnam in February 1965. The last  known shipment left the port of Gulfport, Mississippi, on the SS Frederick  Lykes and arrived in Vietnam in May 1970. By that time, DOD had  suspended all further shipments of Agent Orange. The photos in figure 8  provide examples of drums of Agent Orange being shipped by rail and  tactical herbicides being loaded onto a cargo ship.", "The bulk of materiel used to support U.S. military forces in Vietnam,  including tactical herbicides, was transported from the continental United  States to Vietnam via ship. The vessels carrying the tactical herbicides  generally stopped at foreign ports and sometimes at U.S. ports on the  way to Southeast Asia. Our analyses of available shipment  documentation indicate that at least 114 unique cargo vessels carried  Agent Orange to Southeast Asia on at least 158 different voyages from  1965 through 1970. For each of these voyages, merchant vessel captains  submitted logbooks to the U.S. port authorities at the end of each  voyage. We were able to locate and obtain logbooks for 152 of the 158  shipments (approximately 96 percent) we identified. For 3 of the 6  voyages for which we were not able to locate logbooks, we obtained  copies of the vessels\u2019 shipping articles. We were not able to obtain  shipping articles for the 3 foreign-flagged vessels because documents for  such vessels were not turned in at U.S. ports.", "The Military Sea Transportation Service  directly chartered merchant vessels to carry  tactical herbicides during the Vietnam War. At  least 28 vessels owned by the New Orleans,  Louisiana-based Lykes Brothers Steamship  Company transported Agent Orange between  1965 and 1970 from Gulf Coast ports to  Southeast Asia. Lykes Brothers vessels were  designed to handle cargo with cables that  could place the cargo in a series of holds\u2014 numerous compartmented internal storage  spaces. Tactical herbicides were stored  vertically on pallets in these holds. The first  large shipments of Agent Orange took place  on the SS Adabelle Lykes, SS Elizabeth  Lykes, and SS Mayo Lykes, traveling from the  port of New Orleans, Louisiana, through the  Panama Canal, and refueling in the  Philippines before offloading a total of 1,782  55-gallon drums (approximately 97,000  gallons) in Saigon, Vietnam, in February and  March of 1965.", "Our review of the logbooks and shipping articles for vessels carrying  Agent Orange and other tactical herbicides showed that these vessels  made stops at several U.S. and foreign ports, both in going to and in  returning from Vietnam. For example, we identified vessels that stopped  at several West Coast ports to load cargo before traveling to Vietnam,  and others that made port calls to refuel in Hawaii. We also identified  vessels that stopped at foreign ports such as Okinawa, Thailand, and  Taiwan, as well as locations near the major U.S. Naval Supply Depots in  Yokosuka, Japan, or Subic Bay, Philippines. These supply depots were  major logistics hubs for U.S. military operations in East Asia, and they  provided supplies to commercial ships that were chartered by DOD\u2019s  Military Sea Transportation Service through contracts with shipping  companies. These companies would reserve cargo space for military  cargo and include Saigon, Vietnam, as a destination, but the voyages  were otherwise made for normal commercial activities. From those  locations, the cargo vessels traveled to one or more ports in Vietnam.  However, while the logbooks we reviewed identify when vessels left the  various ports as they traveled to and from Vietnam, logbooks do not  provide information on whether and how much cargo was loaded and  unloaded at those ports of call, nor do they indicate whether tactical  herbicides were offloaded at any ports before the vessels reached  Vietnam."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Shipment Documentation Indicates at Least One Vessel Carrying Agent Orange Went Through Guam en Route to Vietnam, but Archival Information Lacks Details or Is Not Complete", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of available logbooks, we identified at least one  vessel carrying Agent Orange that stopped at Guam en route to Vietnam  and at least three vessels that stopped at Guam on the return from  Vietnam.

Figure 9 indicates  the timelines of the four vessels known to have carried Agent Orange that  stopped at Guam either on their way to or returning from Vietnam, each of  which is discussed in detail below.", "Available shipment documentation indicates that hundreds of vessels  delivered supplies to the Naval Supply Depot, including supplies bound  for Andersen Air Force Base, on Guam during the Vietnam War due to  both installations\u2019 strategic location in supporting the war effort. While the  logbooks we were able to locate and review for vessels that transported  Agent Orange to Southeast Asia between 1965 and 1970 do not show  that these vessels typically stopped at Guam or the Northern Mariana  Islands at any time during their voyages, we identified one ship carrying  Agents Orange, Blue, and White that did stop at Guam on its way to  Vietnam. Specifically, available records indicate that sometime around  February 1, 1968, the SS Gulf Shipper stopped at Port Apra (now Apra  Harbor) on Guam en route to Vietnam. Figure 10 shows a photo of the  logbook from the SS Gulf Shipper indicating the ship\u2019s ports of call en  route to Vietnam.", "The logbooks do not provide details about whether cargo was moved on  or off the vessels during these port calls, or whether tactical herbicides  were offloaded at these ports before the vessels reached Vietnam.  However, the SS Gulf Shipper\u2019s logbook indicates that the stop at Guam  could have been related at least in part to the repatriation of an injured  crew member to the United States, and not to matters related to the  loading or unloading of cargo. Further efforts to locate information on  cargo movements for the SS Gulf Shipper, such as customs records,  manifests, or bills of lading, were unsuccessful, because those records  were not routinely retained. As such, we were not able to verify why the  SS Gulf Shipper stopped at Guam, what its crew did while there, or  whether any cargo was loaded or unloaded.", "We also identified at least three vessels that stopped on Guam on their  return from Vietnam, based on our review of available logbooks.  Specifically, around November 30, 1969, the SS Aimee Lykes stopped at  Port Apra on Guam and offloaded an injured crew member into a small  motorboat so that he could be hospitalized on Guam. In addition, around  December 23, 1969, the SS Buckeye Atlantic stopped at Guam and  offloaded two injured crew members. Lastly, around May 5, 1970, the SS  Overseas Suzanne stopped at Guam and offloaded an injured crew  member. Based on a review of the vessels\u2019 logbooks, it is not clear  whether the stops at Guam were for reasons other than offloading injured  crew members\u2014for example, reasons related to the loading or unloading  of any cargo. Appendix III describes information that we were able to  obtain regarding the quantities of herbicides known to have been shipped  to Southeast Asia on the four vessels that we identified as having stopped  at Guam (either on the way to or from Vietnam) between February 1968  and May 1970.", "As noted earlier, based on our review of available shipment  documentation, we were able to identify approximately 87 percent of the  shipments of Agent Orange to Southeast Asia, and to obtain logbooks for  about 96 percent of the vessels known to have transported Agent Orange  from U.S. ports to Vietnam. Because we were unable to obtain logbooks  for every shipment of Agent Orange, we cannot conclude with certainty  whether any ships other than the SS Gulf Shipper that were transporting  the tactical herbicide to Vietnam, or the three ships returning to the United  States from Vietnam\u2014the SS Aimee Lykes, the SS Buckeye Atlantic, and  the SS Overseas Suzanne\u2014made port calls either at Guam or the  Northern Mariana Islands. Additionally, we found and U.S Air Force  officials agreed that it is unlikely that Agent Orange was shipped by air to  or from Guam. The U.S. Air Force transported small quantities of tactical  herbicides by air to Vietnam in 1961. However, we did not identify any  documentation showing the transport of tactical herbicides by air to  Vietnam after 1961. During our visit, officials at Andersen Air Force Base  stated that it would have been possible to fly 55-gallon drums from Guam  to supply operations in Vietnam, but that such an action would have been  an inefficient method of transporting large quantities of herbicides. Agent  Orange weighed approximately 600 pounds per drum, or about 11  pounds per gallon, a weight that, according to a 1966 memorandum from  the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, would have precluded large- scale transport of the herbicide by aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Documents Identify the Use of Commercial but Not Tactical Herbicides on Guam", "paragraphs": ["Available records show that DOD stored and used commercial herbicides  on Guam, possibly including those containing n-butyl 2,4,5-T, during the  1960s and 1970s, but documents do not indicate the use of tactical  herbicides on Guam. Commercial herbicides were available through the  federal supply system for use on U.S. military installations worldwide. For  example, the fuel supply for Andersen Air Force Base was delivered by  ship to the port at Naval Base Guam and was then delivered to the Air  Force base by a cross-island fuel pipeline\u2014see figure 11. A detailed 1968  report by the Naval Supply Depot states that the Public Works Center  sprayed herbicides semi-annually to control the vegetation along fuel  pipelines between the depot and Andersen Air Force Base.", "Additionally, draft environmental assessments written in 1999 and 2009  by Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific, indicate that  commercial herbicides containing 2,4-D were present on Guam, and that  commercial herbicides containing 2,4,5-T, which included the  contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD, had been used for weed control along power  lines and substations through 1980. Further, a 1969 master storage plan  for the Naval Supply Depot includes sketches of storage facilities that  specify the location of weed killers. Commercial herbicides approved for  DOD procurement for use on installations were issued in 55-gallon drums  and 5-gallon containers during the Vietnam War era, as were a range of  other products, such as fuel oil and diesel. According to DOD officials,  records for such purchases were not typically retained due to short record  retention policies related to such routine supply transactions.", "During the course of our review, we received photographs and written  statements from veterans alleging the presence of Agent Orange on  Guam. However, based on our discussion sessions with veterans and  civilians and our review of this documentation, we could not substantiate  the presence or use of Agent Orange or other tactical herbicides on  Guam. We asked veterans in our six discussion sessions about their  potential for exposure to Agent Orange and where, if, and how they  believe they were exposed. In their responses, some veterans in each of  the six discussion sessions stated that they believe they were exposed to  Agent Orange while deployed in Vietnam or other areas where a  presumption of service for benefits has already been granted, while some  veterans in three of the six discussion sessions stated that they believe  they were exposed to Agent Orange while stationed on Guam.  Specifically, some veterans in our discussion sessions described using  herbicides or witnessing the spraying of herbicides at locations on  Andersen Air Force Base and along the pipeline, as well as the burning of  contaminated fuel as part of firefighting training on the installation. As we  previously stated, according to DOD officials and archived military  specifications, tactical herbicides were not authorized or available for use  on lands owned by, or otherwise managed as military installations.  However, commercial herbicides were widely available worldwide for use  in vegetation management at military installations, to include controlling  vegetation adjacent to flightlines or along perimeter fencing.", "Selected Comments by Veterans at Discussion Sessions Moderated by GAO  Regarding Where They Believe They Were Exposed to Agent Orange or Its  Components  I feel like I was exposed on Guam. I was  temporary duty there during the conflict  and my duties were as a squadron controller that worked the schedules for the B-52  Bombers on Guam. I did venture into the loading area because I was with the aircrew on  the Navy field at Andersen Air Force Base.  I thought I was in contact with Agent Orange in Guam loading bombs in sites. We would  move from one site to another and they would spray those areas before we got there. I  never saw spraying but could smell it. One time I was near that and I broke out in boils  and blisters on my face and arms.  I was a fuel specialist  I witnessed spraying going on at the barracks at Marbo  Annex, 2 to 3 miles off the main Air Force base. It was sprayed all around the barracks.  As my job, I worked at POL \u2014where they stored all of the 55-gallon drums\u2014fuels,  pesticides, herbicides\u2014in bulk storage. Those were constantly sprayed around\u2014for  maintenance and fire safety. Also, I would work on the flightline and at the pump  houses\u2014these were about 20 yards from the security fence.

DOD\u2019s list includes  information on testing and storage locations, applicable dates, the  herbicide or herbicide components tested, a description of the project,  and DOD\u2019s involvement. See appendix IV for the list that was posted on  the VA website as of September 2018. When we began this review, DOD  and VA officials were unable to identify the origin of the DOD list that is  posted on the VA website, which does not have a date. A DOD official  subsequently informed us that the list was initially created in 2003 by an  individual in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in response to a  congressional inquiry about the use of Vietnam-era herbicides at specific  locations in the United States and overseas. DOD subsequently provided  this list to VA, which in turn posted the information on its website. VA\u2019s  Claims Adjudication Procedures Manual related to Agent Orange directs  VA officials to review the DOD list to determine whether herbicides were  used as claimed as part of verifying potential herbicide exposure when a  veteran alleges exposure at locations other than the Republic of Vietnam,  the Korean demilitarized zone, or Thailand. However, in our review of  several sources provided by DOD and VA officials, we identified multiple  examples of inaccurate and incomplete information in DOD\u2019s list, to  include the following:", "Omission of specific testing and storage locations: We identified  additional testing and storage locations in the United States and its  territories that were not included on DOD\u2019s list. For instance, we  identified additional testing locations at Belle Glade, Florida, and  Stuttgart, Arkansas, where researchers reported small-plot field tests  of the components of Agent Orange on rice. In addition, we found  examples of shipments of herbicides to Kelly Air Force Base, Texas,  where Agent Orange components were stored following the  cancellation of tactical herbicide contracts. None of these locations  are included on DOD\u2019s list.", "Lack of clarity in descriptive information: DOD\u2019s list lacks clarity in  descriptive information, making it difficult to identify which specific  herbicides or components were tested and stored, as well as when  and where. For example, the size and scope of some testing activities  are unclear from the descriptions provided in DOD\u2019s list, making it  difficult to differentiate between small-scale and large-scale testing.  Some testing events on DOD\u2019s list are described in detail, including  the amount of herbicide or components tested, while descriptions of  other testing activities contain little information about what took place.  Furthermore, we could not identify the chemical components of some  of the agents on DOD\u2019s list. We asked DOD and VA officials to  identify those specific agents for us, and they were unable to do so.  Specifically, neither DOD nor VA officials could identify the chemical  composition of 26 different agents on the DOD list, making it difficult  to determine whether these agents should be included on the list.", "Omission of additional time periods for identified locations: We  identified additional testing events of Agent Orange or its components  at locations that are on the DOD list but that cover additional time  periods not reflected on the list. For instance, the DOD list identified  testing that took place at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland, in  July 1969. However, our review uncovered additional testing events  that took place at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1963, 1965, and  1966.", "In addition to the lack of clarity and omissions that we identified, reports  commissioned by DOD and VA since 2003 have also identified omissions  in the list. For example, a report prepared for DOD in 2006 identified 40  different locations where Agent Orange was tested or stored outside of  Vietnam. However, during our review, we found several examples of  locations in the United States and its territories that were included in that  2006 report but are not included on the DOD list that is currently posted  on the VA website. These include locations in Arkansas, California, New  Jersey, New York, Maryland, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, and  Utah. Similarly, a report prepared for VA in May 2013 described locations where Agent Orange exposure to Vietnam-era veterans has  been alleged. This report summarized additional sites where veterans  alleged Agent Orange was used, stored, or destroyed. It also included an  assessment of the DOD information posted on the VA\u2019s website\u2014and  indicated, notably, that information had not changed since the 2006 report  to DOD. In the assessment, the report identified that the list contained  many errors of dates, chemicals, locations, and the governmental  agencies or institutions responsible for conducting the tests or military  operations. The report suggested specific criteria for validating the  presence of a tactical herbicide at a site, including evidence that a  veteran actually came into contact with a tactical herbicide at that site.", "Even though they have received reports dating back more than a decade  that identified issues with the accuracy and completeness of the list,  neither DOD nor VA has taken steps to validate or correct the list, or to  develop the criteria they would use to determine which locations and  dates to include on the list. As previously stated, this list is posted on the  VA\u2019s Agent Orange website as a primary source for veterans seeking  information on Agent Orange. Despite its inconsistencies, the list can be  accessed from multiple places on the VA website, and we found that  some veterans service organizations and other groups also post this  incomplete and inaccurate list of testing and storage sites on their  websites, as well as communicate this information to their members.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives. We  found and DOD officials agreed that DOD\u2019s list was not as accurate or  complete as available records would allow because (1) there are not  clearly identified responsibilities for validating the information on this list,  (2) there is no process for updating the list as needed, and (3) criteria  have not been developed and used to determine which locations and  dates to include on the list.", "Until recently, neither DOD nor VA has taken responsibility for ensuring  the accuracy and completeness of the list, which is being provided to  veterans and the public on the VA website. Federal internal control  standards state that management should establish an organizational  structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives. As noted earlier, DOD and VA officials were initially  unable to identify the source or date of this list, and neither agency took  action to respond to reports about the problems with it. During the course  of our review, DOD took some initial steps to begin validating the  accuracy and completeness of information on its list by reviewing primary  source records for additional locations and events of herbicide testing and  storage. However, thus far in its efforts, DOD has not identified  responsibilities for completing the validation of the information included on  the list, nor has it established a process for updating the list as any new  information becomes available.", "Moreover, it remains unclear whether DOD\u2019s review will cover all  locations, including non-DOD sites, where testing and storage of Agent  Orange or its components were thought to have occurred, or if it will focus  only on U.S. military installations. Private companies, academic  institutions, and other federal agencies were involved in the testing of  herbicides at some of the non-DOD sites on the list, and, in some of those  cases, Army personnel were involved in the testing at the non-DOD  locations. For instance, testing was performed by DOD personnel at non- DOD locations in Georgia and Tennessee in the 1960s. Some non-DOD  storage locations included various U.S. commercial ports, such as Mobile,  Alabama, where Agent Orange was transferred by rail from the  manufacturers to be stored until it was loaded onto vessels for shipment  to Vietnam. According to a DOD official, DOD\u2019s priority in its review of  testing and storage locations is to focus on DOD installations. Although  this official told us that the department expects to eventually identify non- DOD locations where the department was involved in herbicide testing  and/ or storage through collaboration or funding, the official was not able  to provide information on the time frames for conducting this review.  Finally, DOD has not established a process for how this list will be  updated once it has been validated and revised, when and if new  information about Agent Orange testing and storage locations is  identified.", "In our analysis of the DOD list, we were also unable to determine the  criteria that DOD initially used to select which locations and time periods  to include\u2014particularly given that the testing varied in intensity and  duration, and that the likelihood that personnel at a particular location  could have been exposed to the herbicides or components was unclear.  For example, some tests on the list included small laboratory experiments  on a couple of plants using a very small amount of chemical agents, as in  bench tests of various compounds at Forts Detrick and Ritchie, Maryland,  in the 1950s, while other tests included gallons of Agent Orange or other  chemical agent components that were used in field testing trials or to test  aerial spraying, as in a defoliation effort in which 13 drums were sprayed  by helicopter over an area covering 4 square miles. Similarly, the duration  of testing events could have been over a total of 3 days, as with spray  testing in Marathon, Florida, or over several months or even years, as  with spray testing of several tactical herbicides at Eglin Air Force Base,  Florida. Because of the variance in the size and duration of testing  events; the specific areas where the testing events took place at the  locations; and the number of personnel who actually came into contact  with the chemical agents during the testing, the presence of a location on  this list does not clearly indicate the likelihood or extent of potential  exposure that individuals not involved would have had if they were simply  present at the locations on the list at the times indicated.", "In May 2018, during the course of our review, a DOD official noted that  DOD and VA formed a joint Herbicide Orange Working Group to address  the issues with the DOD list and identify criteria for including information  on this list.

Specifically, we asked veterans in our six discussion sessions  about what they had heard from DOD, VA, or other federal agencies  about the potential that they could have been exposed to Agent Orange  or its components at locations where Agent Orange was manufactured,  transported, stored, used, or destroyed. Veterans in each of the six  sessions stated that, generally, the federal government has not reached  out to them regarding Agent Orange, but that they instead have relied on  their own research to learn more about their potential for having been  exposed, adding to the confusion about where to obtain information on  Agent Orange exposure. Other veterans, however, stated that they have  received information from VA regarding potential exposure. DOD officials  acknowledged that there is confusion among veterans about a variety of  issues related to their potential for exposure to Agent Orange, including  where to go for information.

It has mainly been from my own research, not from a federal agency.  Just based on the fact that I have heart disease and going through the VA process  means I receive updates from VA on just about everything going on, including Agent  Orange and all of the research they have done. I do know the Secretary is authorized  by law from Congress late last year to add additional presumptive diseases  associated with Agent Orange and how one would contract that.  I had to do the research myself. It seems to be a secret with information coming out in  spurts. When you have things happen to your body, they [the Department of Veterans  Affairs] say it is not service connected. Sometimes when the government tries to  explain something, they don\u2019t give the whole thing and they give it piecemeal. It does  not carry any essence of importance.  I am not hearing anything from the federal government. Most of the information I get  is from a USveterans.com website and I subscribe to a daily newsletter from the  Vietnam Veterans of America and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  There is information on the VA website about conditions attributed to Agent Orange In  that context, I went to the VA website and found that there are 21 states where Agent  Orange was used, including on Hawaii in Kauai. It is because of this list that I became  aware that people in Hawaii may have been exposed to Agent Orange. I learned that  such exposure might increase the likelihood of having diabetes or cancer. I believe  the list is still on the VA website and that there is also a list of units that were possibly  exposed to Agent Orange.  I have not been contacted by any government agency with regard to Agent Orange  exposure or ill health. I first heard about Agent Orange and dioxin and cancer related  issues/illnesses in late 1980s or early 1990s and later on after doing own research.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should internally and externally communicate the necessary  quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives. The standard further  states that management should evaluate the entity\u2019s methods of  communication so that the organization has the appropriate tools to  communicate quality information throughout the entity on a timely basis.  Additionally, DOD issued guidance in June 2017 establishing procedures  for DOD components to implement when there is a scientifically plausible  likelihood of a significant long-term health risk from a past environmental  exposure to military personnel or civilians resulting from living or working  on military installations. Even though the testing and storage of Agent  Orange and its components occurred several decades ago, this  instruction states that DOD components should provide targeted and  effective health risk communication early and continuously, as new and  credible information becomes available.", "However, DOD and VA officials stated that they have not developed a  formal process for coordinating on how best to communicate information  to veterans and the public regarding the presence of Agent Orange at  locations outside of Vietnam.

According to scientific research, it is difficult to find traces of the two  components of Agent Orange\u2014n-butyl 2,4-D and n-butyl 2,4,5-T\u2014 because, under normal environmental conditions, the n-butyl forms break  down rapidly into the acid forms. Scientific research indicates that the  half-lives of the acid forms of the chemical components 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T  in soil can range from several days to many months, depending on  conditions. The World Health Organization has stated that the half-life of  2,4-D in soil is reported to range from 4 to 7 days in most soil types.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the half-life  of 2,4,5-T in soil varies with conditions, ranging from several weeks to  many months. In addition, when Agent Orange is sprayed for  defoliation, there are several things that can happen to it. For example, it  can be washed out by rain, degrade in the presence of sunlight  (photodegradation), or slowly turn into a vapor (volatize) from surfaces  such as foliage. These factors reduce the chances of finding traces of  Agent Orange components after 50 years.", "The amount of time it takes for the contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD to degrade  is longer than that for the components of Agent Orange, although  estimates vary. For example, according to the research cited by the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the half-life of  2,3,7,8-TCDD is approximately 9 to 15 years in surface soil and 25 to 100  years in subsurface soil. Further, 2,3,7,8-TCDD breaks down quickly  when exposed to sunlight, providing one explanation for the shorter half- life in surface soil. Any 2,3,7,8-TCDD contamination from herbicide  spraying\u2014as opposed to being spilled onto the soil\u2014would generally be  expected to be found in surface soil, where it would be exposed to  degradation due to sunlight. This reduces the likelihood of detecting this  compound 50 years later.

Additionally, 2,4-D derivatives are still used in commercial herbicides  today. Therefore, even if testing were to show the presence of one of the  two components of Agent Orange, it would be difficult to distinguish  whether the chemicals were present from the use of commercial  herbicides or the use of tactical herbicides. Further, because 2,4-D is still  used in many commonly used herbicides sold today, the presence of this  component could be due to a recent use of a commercial herbicide rather  than a tactical herbicide used decades ago.", "Moreover, multiple sources of the contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD can be  found in the environment today.

In December 2017 DOD  developed a draft testing plan in collaboration with U.S. EPA and Guam  EPA to test for the acid form of the components 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T at  three different sites on Andersen Air Force Base. The draft testing plan  did not include testing for the presence of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. According to  DOD and U.S. EPA officials, they are not testing for 2,3,7,8-TCDD  because the test would not be able to conclusively link any positive  results to the use of tactical herbicides, given that dioxins are also  produced by, among other things, burning fossil fuels. These officials  noted that, over time, large quantities of fuel have been burned at  Andersen Air Force Base, and they stated their belief that if 2,3,7,8-TCDD  were found, the likely source would be from combustion. The areas  identified for testing included the fuel pipeline, a perimeter fenceline, and  an area near some fuel storage tanks. See figure 13 for a photograph of  the fenceline testing site near the fuel storage tanks on Andersen Air  Force Base.", "Based on our initial review of the draft testing plan and a review of the  scientific literature, we identified and discussed with DOD and U.S. EPA  officials some challenges the two agencies would face in detecting the  presence of Agent Orange on Guam due to two factors: (1) the short  amount of time that it takes for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T to degrade; and (2) the  inability of testing to determine whether the presence of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T  is attributable to the use of Agent Orange or to some other source.", "Degradation of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T: DOD officials and the jointly  developed draft testing plan acknowledged that the planned testing  would not be able to confirm the presence of Agent Orange, given that  the components degrade over time. The draft testing plan indicates  that the maximum half-lives of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are 14 days and 24  days, respectively, in soil and groundwater. Even given the possible  variation in half-lives discussed above, it is likely that no detectable  concentrations remain in soil today, given that the alleged period of  use on Guam was in the 1960s and 1970s.", "Inability to distinguish whether the presence of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T is  attributable to the use of Agent Orange or some other source: Even if  the results were to confirm the presence of either 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T in  any form, it would be difficult to distinguish the source of the chemical,  and whether its presence was attributable to the use of Agent Orange  or some other source. For example, 2,4-D is still in use today, and  2,4,5-T was used in both tactical and commercial herbicides during  the 1960s. In addition, if the components were found, the  interpretation of those results could be complicated by, for example,  natural variability in the potential half-lives and the possibility of more  recent use of banned products. Further, the testing protocol will  convert all forms of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, including the ester forms, to the  acid forms, further complicating any attempt to identify the source of  the compounds.", "We discussed with cognizant officials the challenges that we identified in  the draft testing plan to determine how the information from the testing  would be used to inform U.S. EPA, DOD, veterans, and the public about  whether Agent Orange was present on Andersen Air Force Base. DOD  officials subsequently stated that the questions raised by us and internally  within DOD led them to reconsider the approach for testing for Agent  Orange on Guam. For example, in December 2017, DOD officials told us  that they would begin testing for Agent Orange and other tactical  herbicides in March 2018. In late March 2018, a DOD official noted that  the department had placed the testing on hold until they were certain that  the methodology to be employed would meet scientific rigor and could be  replicated in future testing efforts at other locations. In April 2018, DOD  officials told us that the contract execution took longer than anticipated,  and that soil sample testing would commence that month.", "In April 2018, DOD provided us with a copy of the final plan that was  reviewed and approved by U.S. EPA and Guam EPA and was used to  test for Agent Orange and other tactical herbicides at Andersen Air Force  Base. When we reviewed the final testing plan and compared it with the  draft previously provided, we found that some of the challenges we had  initially identified in the draft testing plan, as described above, were still  present. For example, based on our review of the final testing plan, with  the proposed testing methodology, it would be difficult to determine if 2,4- D and 2,4,5-T came from Agent Orange or another source, and there  were inconsistencies in the reported half-lives of the components of Agent  Orange. At the same time, both DOD and U.S. EPA officials questioned  the ability of any testing for 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T on Andersen Air Force Base  to either confirm or deny the presence of Agent Orange on Guam.  Specifically, the final testing plan states that more than 50 years have  passed since the period of alleged use, and that a lack of detection  provides no evidence that herbicides were not used historically.  Moreover, U.S. EPA officials noted that the testing on Guam would not  provide definitive proof of Agent Orange use on the island. Although DOD  officials recognized these challenges and acknowledged the low  probability of conclusively identifying the components of Agent Orange,  they decided to move forward with testing to address veterans\u2019 and the  public\u2019s concerns.", "In April 2018, samples were collected from the three areas at Andersen  Air Force Base, according to DOD officials. Each sample was divided  following procedures outlined in the final testing plan, resulting in two  identical sample sets. A sample set was sent to two independent  laboratories for analysis. According to officials from DOD and U.S. EPA,  test results and associated quality control reports from both laboratories  agreed on the results from two of the area samples, but did not agree on  the third area sample. The jointly developed decision rules for the  sampling and analysis plan required the results from both laboratories to  agree in order to draw a conclusion on the presence or absence of Agent  Orange. As a result, according to the officials, the DOD, U.S. EPA, and  Guam EPA project team agreed in July 2018 to resample the one area  where the two labs reported differing results. The project team is updating  the sampling and analysis plan to address the various possible reasons  for the differing laboratory results in order to provide a conclusive final  testing result. DOD officials told us they do not anticipate completing the  updates for the sampling and analysis plan, field sampling, analysis, and  reporting until early 2019. As such, we were not able to comment on the  results of the final testing in this report. Moreover, DOD officials said that,  provided the final resampling results are negative, DOD does not have  plans to conduct additional testing, because the testing was conducted in  areas alleged to be the likeliest locations for the application of Agent  Orange. However, an official from U.S. EPA said that the challenges  associated with testing on Guam are not insurmountable and that the  agency would like to continue this investigation. Given that (1) DOD,  working with U.S. EPA and Guam EPA, made a decision to test for Agent  Orange and other tactical herbicides; (2) DOD, U.S. EPA, and Guam EPA  recognize the limitations associated with the testing; (3) the testing and  analysis of results are still on-going; and (4) there is currently uncertainty  regarding whether any additional testing will take place on Guam, we are  not making any recommendations with respect to the testing plan or its  execution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD suspended the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam in 1970 and  incinerated remaining stockpiles at sea in 1977, but concerns about the  effects of exposure in U.S. locations have persisted.

VA also stated in its letter that the focus on  commercial herbicides is not relevant for determining the list of locations  where tactical herbicides were tested or stored. We agree and as we  noted in this report, the U.S. military managed tactical herbicides used  during the Vietnam War era differently from commercial herbicides in the  federal supply system, which were widely available worldwide for use in  vegetation management at military installations. To avoid conflating  tactical and commercial herbicides, the report further notes that while  some of these commercial herbicides contained 2,4-D; 2,4,5-T; or both,  these commercial herbicides were not in the n-butyl form used in Agent  Orange. However, commercial herbicides with 2,4,5-T likely contained  some level of 2,3,7,8-TCDD.

These logbooks recorded  basic details about each ship\u2019s operation and route, which we analyzed to  identify any shipments that stopped at locations in the United States or its  territories before arriving in Vietnam. Because none of the logbooks we  reviewed provided detail about the specific types of cargo that were  loaded onto or unloaded from the vessels, we relied on available military  correspondence and reports about those vessels to identify whether the  ships carried Agent Orange.", "We attempted to locate the remaining 17 percent of the logbooks, or 27  shipments. Of those shipments, 3 were by foreign-flagged merchant  vessels, which did not submit logbooks to U.S. ports. Working with  officials from the U.S. Coast Guard, the agency that oversees the  retention and archiving of logbooks, we coordinated with archivists at the  Federal Records Centers to determine whether there were any  unprocessed boxes of logbooks that had not yet been archived. When  that effort did not turn up additional logbooks, we worked with archivists at  Archives I to obtain copies of shipping articles\u2014the articles of agreement  between the captain of a ship and the seamen with respect to wages,  length of time for which they are shipped, and related matters\u2014for the  remaining 24 shipments. While these documents focus on employment  issues, the annotations include the locations where different personnel  actions took place. We reviewed these documents to identify the locations  and approximate dates of the ports of call during those voyages. We were  able to obtain the shipping articles for the 24 remaining voyages, as well  as for the one vessel that stopped in Guam on the way to Vietnam (SS  Gulf Shipper) and the three that stopped in Guam on the way back (SS  Aimee Lykes, SS Buckeye Atlantic, and SS Overseas Suzanne). Using  the information on voyage ending dates and ports that we obtained from  the shipping articles, we were able to work with the regional archives to  obtain another 21 logbooks, bringing the total number of logbooks  obtained to 152, or 96 percent of the shipments we identified. We relied  on the shipping article information for the remaining three voyages  (excluding the shipments on the three foreign-flagged vessels) to provide  some information on the routes taken by those vessels. However, one  limitation of relying on shipping articles for port information and dates is  that locations are mentioned only if a personnel action\u2014such as an injury,  hospitalization, or desertion\u2014took place. If no personnel action took place at a location on a vessel\u2019s route, that port would not be listed in the  shipping articles.", "To obtain specific information about the SS Gulf Shipper voyage that  stopped in Guam en route to Vietnam, to include documentation on its  cargo and whether or not cargo was loaded or unloaded at the ports on  the way to Vietnam, we contacted officials at several agencies.", "In Guam, we contacted the Customs and Quarantine Service, the  University of Guam\u2019s Micronesian Research Center, and officials at  Naval Base Guam for information on vessels that stopped in Guam  during the Vietnam War era, and any cargo they carried.", "We also contacted archivists at the Federal Records Center in  Seattle, Washington, where the SS Gulf Shipper logbook is archived,  and the regional archives in Fort Worth, Texas, for additional  information on the vessel itself and guidance on retaining and  archiving cargo information. The National Archives had some  information on the SS Gulf Shipper, such as sales documents and  company correspondence records. However, the National Archives  did not have records for the manifest or bills of lading, which may  have documented any cargo offloaded from the ship.", "We contacted U.S. Customs and Border Protection for information on  movements of vessels engaged in foreign trade in and out of ports,  which is found in customs forms that are required to be archived after  30 years. We were unsuccessful in locating the customs forms for the  SS Gulf Shipper\u2019s voyage to Vietnam through Guam; however, an  official noted that although these records provide manifest numbers  and ports of sailing, the manifests themselves are not archived.", "An online search on the SS Gulf Shipper through the U.S. Maritime  Administration\u2019s website identified the transfer of vessel ownership  over the years. We contacted the latest company that owned the  vessel to see whether the company had retained any cargo manifests  or other historical records as the ownership changed hands. However,  we could not obtain this information because, according to a company  official we contacted, the vessel\u2019s records, along with other historical  documents, were stored in an off-site storage facility in New Jersey,  and were subsequently destroyed in a fire in 1996.", "We also looked at articles from Guam newspapers and news sources  such as the Military Sea Transportation Service Vietnam Chronicles for  any information about vessel comings and goings in Guam in early 1968  to see if they mentioned the SS Gulf Shipper or specific cargo being  offloaded in Guam. None of these contacts or written sources provided  information specific to any cargo that was being moved through Guam, or  about this particular vessel.", "We also obtained original DOD reports and command histories that  provided additional operational details about the procurement,  distribution, use, and disposition of Agent Orange and its components.  According to an Office of History, Air Force Logistics Command,  monograph, the command directly responsible for managing Agent  Orange was the Directorate of Aerospace Fuels at the San Antonio Air  Materiel Area at the former Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, which was a  sub-component of the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command during the  Vietnam War. The unclassified San Antonio Air Materiel Area command  histories for the years 1966 through 1973 include chapters with extensive  documentation on \u201cherbicide management.\u201d We obtained copies of  command histories from the Air Force Historical Research Agency at  Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and the Air Force Materiel Command  at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.", "To obtain information regarding herbicide use on Guam, we obtained  command histories for Naval Base Guam and an analysis and summary  of the available documentation by the historian at Andersen Air Force  Base. We also spoke with Navy and Air Force officials on Hawaii and  Guam to identify any relevant records pertaining to such use. In addition,  we met with and obtained information from officials representing the  Office of the Governor of Guam and senior members and staff from the  Guam Legislature. We also met with officials representing a veterans  service organization. Finally, as discussed below, we spoke directly with  veterans about their recollections of herbicide use on Guam, and any  documentation they might have pertaining to such use.", "For objective two, we analyzed the archival search records provided by  DOD to identify additional locations where Agent Orange or its  components were tested and stored in the United States and its  territories. We reviewed Army archives search reports of herbicide testing  at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (including Edgewood Arsenal), Maryland;  Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Fort Chaffee, Arkansas; Fort Gordon,  Georgia; Fort Meade, Fort Ritchie, and Fort Detrick, Maryland; and two  Air Force studies related to herbicide equipment testing at Eglin Air Force  Base, Florida, to determine whether there were additional sites and  testing events that were not included on the DOD list found on the VA  website. We also reviewed the proceedings of the First, Second, and  Third Defoliation Conferences, technical and special reports, and  published papers provided by the Armed Forces Pest Management Board  to determine whether there were additional sites and testing events that  were not included on the list. We compared the information about testing  locations and dates on the DOD list found on the VA website with  information found in a 2006 report on locations where Agent Orange was  tested and stored.", "To determine the locations where Agent Orange or its components were  tested and stored, we attempted to identify the chemical composition of  all the agents on DOD\u2019s list found on the VA website. We located  information on the chemical composition of agents on the list in archives  search reports for Forts Detrick, Meade, and Gordon; a glossary of  pesticide chemicals from the Food and Drug Administration; journal  articles; and the defoliation conference proceedings. We also  interviewed DOD and VA officials about the chemical composition of  agents on the list, the origins of the list, how the list is used, and the role  of each agency in managing the list. We compared the results with  information that DOD and VA provided publicly on testing and storage  locations of tactical herbicides in the United States and its territories, and  with DOD policies for conducting record research and responding to  inquiries related to past environmental exposures. We also compared the  accuracy and completeness of the list with Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government, which state that management should  internally and externally communicate the necessary quality information  to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "We also reviewed the extent to which DOD and VA have communicated  health information to DOD personnel and veterans. We compared the  communication process that both DOD and VA use with DOD\u2019s guidance  on assessing long-term health risks, and with VA\u2019s process for  determining benefits based on veterans\u2019 claims. We also compared DOD  and VA actions with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which state that management should internally and  externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives. The standard further states that management should  evaluate the entity\u2019s methods of communication so that the organization  has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information throughout  the entity on a timely basis. We also reviewed documents from DOD and  VA on communication with veterans, including the VA\u2019s website on Agent  Orange. Further, we interviewed cognizant agency officials from DOD and  VA, including officials from the Armed Forces Pest Management Board  and DOD\u2019s Joint Services Records Research Center.", "For objectives one and two, to better understand veterans\u2019 experiences  with Agent Orange and other herbicides and the health effects of  exposure to them, we conducted six small discussion sessions with a  non-generalizable sample of veterans. Four of the discussion sessions  were conducted in person in the following locations: two discussion  sessions in Guam, and two discussion sessions in Hawaii. We  conducted two additional discussion sessions that were moderated via  telephone from Washington, D.C.: one of those had individuals participate  both in person and by telephone, while the other was held solely by  telephone. We selected Guam because of the provision in House Report  115\u2013200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2018 for GAO to review the government\u2019s handling of  Agent Orange on Guam. We selected Hawaii because of its strategic  location during the Vietnam War and because of the VA presence in the  region. A total of 38 individuals attended the sessions, which ranged from  1 to 10 participants per session and lasted approximately 1 to 2 hours.  These discussion sessions were consistently moderated by the same  team member using a prepared script and documented by several other  team members.", "To select candidates for participating in our discussion sessions, we  worked with the Veterans Health Administration as well as veteran clinics  and veteran centers at the selected locations to identify non-combat  veterans who had served during the Vietnam era. In Guam, we also  worked with the Guam Environmental Protection Agency to coordinate a  discussion session. Attendees included Vietnam-era veterans who self- reported that they were in active service between 1961 and 1977 in  Vietnam, the United States, and its territories, including Guam. As we  became aware of other veterans who might be interested in these  discussion sessions, including Vietnam combat veterans, we reached out  to offer them the opportunity to participate in one of our discussion  sessions. Our six discussion sessions included questions to individuals  regarding what, if anything, they had heard from DOD, VA, or other  federal agencies about links between exposure to herbicides and  negative health effects, and whether attendees believed that they had  been exposed to Agent Orange or its components at locations where  Agent Orange was manufactured, transported, stored, used, or  destroyed. We also asked individuals if they believed they had been  exposed to Agent Orange in Guam, Vietnam, or another location, and if  so, to describe the situation. At the start of the discussion sessions, the  moderator told participants that their responses would be kept confidential  and that we were not recording their statements. The moderator noted  that we would be taking notes to make sure we accurately captured the  conversations, but that we would not attribute statements directly to  individuals.", "For those discussion sessions held in person in Guam and Hawaii, we  also administered a brief, written questionnaire about individuals\u2019  experiences during the Vietnam era (for example, duty locations, military  occupation, rank), and what they had heard and experienced related to  Agent Orange and other herbicides. Due to logistical obstacles, we were  not able to administer the questionnaire to participants in sessions held  via telephone. However, the information requested in the questionnaire  was also covered in the discussion sessions themselves. Therefore, we  did not analyze the information from the completed questionnaires. We  also solicited from the veterans any documentation they might have that  could support their allegations of the use of Agent Orange on Guam, but  we did not receive documentation that corroborated the use of Agent  Orange on Guam. In addition, we met with officers from the Vietnam  Veterans of America to discuss how, if at all, veterans could have been  exposed to Agent Orange beyond serving directly in Vietnam as part of  Operation Ranch Hand, and how the organization disseminates  information, especially on Agent Orange, to veterans.", "For objective three, we reviewed scientific literature and agency  documents regarding the degradation and sources of the components of  Agent Orange and an associated dioxin contaminant, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, as  well as other sources of dioxins. This review included documents from the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and reports and  protocols from U.S. EPA, the World Health Organization, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Industrial Hygiene  Association. We also reviewed the draft and final plans for testing for the  presence of the acid forms of the components of Agent Orange\u20142,4-D  and 2,4,5-T\u2014on Guam. We compared the information outlined in the  testing plan with scientific literature on the environmental fate of the  components of Agent Orange and other Agent Orange testing  methodologies. We interviewed officials from DOD, U.S. EPA, and Guam  EPA about the testing plan for Guam and the science surrounding Agent  Orange testing. We also conducted a site visit to Naval Base Guam and  Andersen Air Force Base on Guam and interviewed DOD and  Government of Guam officials involved in the planning for the testing for  Agent Orange on Andersen Air Force Base. We visited the three selected  sites where the initial testing took place and took photographs of those  sites.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 through November  2018, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comparison of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) List of Diseases Associated with Agent Orange against Those Identified by the National Academy of Sciences", "paragraphs": ["The VA recognizes 14 presumptive diseases associated with exposure to  Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service for which  veterans and their survivors may be eligible to receive disability  compensation benefits.

The list includes 5 diseases that  have been identified as having sufficient evidence of association and 9  that have been identified as having limited or suggestive evidence of  association. In the Academy\u2019s biannual reports, for a disease identified as  having sufficient evidence of association, the evidence is sufficient to  conclude that there is a positive association\u2014that is, a positive  association has been observed between herbicides and the outcome in  studies for which chance, bias, and confounding could be ruled out with  reasonable confidence. For a disease identified as having limited or  suggestive evidence of association, the evidence is suggestive of an  association between herbicides and the outcome but is limited, because  chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence.  Table 1 describes those 14 diseases and the extent of association  identified by the Academy.", "The 2014 Academy biannual report, issued in 2016, listed four more  diseases it categorized as having limited or suggestive evidence of  association, as described in table 2.", "VA officials told us that these diseases are not included on the VA\u2019s  current list of presumptive diseases associated with exposure to Agent  Orange or other herbicides because, as of October 25, 2018, the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs had yet to make the determination based on  the most recent biannual review (the 2014 report). According to the  officials, the Secretary is also considering the inclusion of parkinsonism  and Parkinson-like syndromes.", "Finally, according to the VA website, VA has recognized that certain birth  defects among veterans\u2019 children are associated with veterans\u2019 qualifying  service in Vietnam or Korea. For example, spina bifida (except spina  bifida occulta) is associated with veterans\u2019 exposure to Agent Orange or  other herbicides during qualifying service in Vietnam or Korea. The  affected child must have been conceived after the veteran entered  Vietnam or the Korean demilitarized zone during the qualifying service  period, and a child with spina bifida or covered birth defects who is a  biological child of a veteran with qualifying service may be eligible for a  monetary allowance, health care, and vocational training. The 2014 report  moved spina bifida to the lower category of \"inadequate or insufficient  evidence to determine an association,\" as studies that have been  released since the 1996 update do not support a link between the  condition and exposure to herbicides. According to VA officials, VA does  not currently plan to change its regulations based on this conclusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Quantities of Herbicides Known to Have Been Shipped to Southeast Asia on Ships Identified as Having Stopped in Guam between February 1968 and May 1970", "paragraphs": ["Based on available shipment documentation and logbooks, we identified  one vessel\u2014the SS Gulf Shipper\u2014carrying Agents Orange, Blue, and  White that stopped at Port Apra (now Apra Harbor) on Guam on its way to  Southeast Asia. Additionally, we identified three vessels\u2014the SS Aimee  Lykes, the SS Buckeye Atlantic, and the SS Overseas Suzanne\u2014that  stopped in Guam on the return routes after having made various port calls  in Southeast Asia. For each of these voyages, we obtained shipment  documentation that outlined the quantities of herbicides that records  indicate had been loaded onto the vessels while at port in the United  States, and to the extent available, quantities of herbicides that were  discharged in Southeast Asia. We also obtained logbooks that identified  the routes the vessels took from U.S. ports to Vietnam and back, and  identified any port calls en route. While we are unable to confirm the  reliability of the information available in shipment documentation and  logbooks, details on the quantities of herbicides that were documented to  have been transported on these vessels during their routes are outlined  below.", "SS Gulf Shipper: According to shipment documentation and the vessel\u2019s  logbook, the SS Gulf Shipper left the port of Mobile, Alabama, on January  9, 1968, and stopped at Port Apra (now Apra Harbor) on Guam and  offloaded a mariner for repatriation to the United States on February 2,  1968. We are unable to state with certainty whether there were reasons  why this vessel stopped in Guam beyond what was reported in available  shipment documentation and the vessel\u2019s logbook. The logbook further  indicates that the SS Gulf Shipper then arrived in Saigon, Vietnam,  approximately February 27, 1968, with subsequent stops in Cam Rahn  Bay, Vietnam, approximately February 29, 1968, and Nha Trang,  Vietnam, approximately March 2, 1968. According to available  documentation, there is some discrepancy with regard to the amount of  herbicides that records indicate were loaded onto the SS Gulf Shipper  when it left the port of Mobile, Alabama. Specifically, shipment  documentation indicates that 62,570 gallons of Agent Orange, 31,735  gallons of Agent White, and 4,620 gallons of Agent Blue\u2014a total of  98,925 gallons of herbicides\u2014were loaded onto the SS Gulf Shipper  before it departed for Saigon, Vietnam. On the contrary, according to the  available shipping documentation, the vessel\u2019s manifest indicates that the  vessel was carrying 86,270 gallons of herbicides, but does not break the  total down by individual herbicide. The vessel\u2019s manifest further indicates  that the SS Gulf Shipper discharged 93,150 gallons of herbicide in  Saigon, Vietnam, on March 1, 1968, which does not align with reported  dates in the vessel\u2019s logbook. However, we are unable to determine  discharge quantities by specific herbicide\u2014for example, the quantities of  Agents Orange, Blue, or White discharged\u2014because available  documentation states that the breakdown of the herbicides would not be  determined until arrival at the depot. Moreover, we are unable to account  for the difference between the number of gallons of herbicides reported to  have been loaded onto the vessel and the number of gallons reported to  have been discharged in Saigon, Vietnam, or potentially any other  location.", "SS Aimee Lykes: According to shipment documentation and the vessel\u2019s  logbook, the SS Aimee Lykes left the port of Beaumont, Texas, on  October 4, 1969.

However, the logbook does not include Guam on its list of ports  of call. Rather, there is a separate entry within the logbook that describes the vessel pulling into Apra Harbor and offloading the injured mariner into  a small motorboat so that he could be hospitalized in Guam. Therefore,  we cannot confirm whether the vessel docked at Port Apra during this  voyage. According to available documentation, the SS Aimee Lykes left  the port of Beaumont, Texas, with 880 gallons of Agent Orange on  board\u2014documentation does not indicate that there were any amounts of  Agents White or Blue on this voyage.
