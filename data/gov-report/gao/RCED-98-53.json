A household can be an individual, a family, or another group who lives together and customarily purchases and prepares food in common. Applicants must provide a Social Security number for each household member. The value of the food stamp benefits for a household is determined by the number of eligible household members and their income, adjusted for assets and such costs as expenses for shelter and utilities. Nationally, the average monthly value of the benefit per household member is about $73. The household\u2019s monthly food stamp allotment increases with each additional member, provided income limits are not exceeded. Households that receive food stamps are required to report changes in household membership, such as the loss of a member, to the administering state agency.", "Within USDA, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the Food Stamp Program through agreements with state agencies. FNS is responsible for approving state plans for operation and for ensuring that the states are administering the program in accordance with regulations. The states are required to establish a performance reporting system to monitor the program, including a quality control review process to help ensure that benefits are issued only to qualifying households and that the benefit amounts are correct. State agencies are responsible for imposing penalties for violations of program requirements and are responsible for recovering food stamp overpayments. The federal government pays all of the benefit costs and one-half of the administrative costs for each state. In 1996, USDA paid the states about $1.7 billion to administer the program.", "The program is administered by states. Eligibility workers in service centers work directly with clients to certify household eligibility and determine benefit amounts at the time of application and at least annually thereafter.", "With respect to deceased individuals, SSA\u2019s information is more comprehensive than that gathered by state agencies. SSA compiles information in its Death Master File from a wide variety of sources, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Health Care Finance Administration, funeral directors, and its own internal claims and postentitlement processes. SSA also includes in the Death Master File death information that it purchases from the states through agreements negotiated with each state. About half of these agreements restrict SSA\u2019s ability to disclose this information to agencies in other states. Each Social Security number in the Death Master File has been verified to ensure that it is associated with the appropriate name, date of birth, and gender for each deceased individual. SSA updates its file monthly. In contrast, state information regarding deceased individuals is initially compiled at the local level by, for example, county departments of health, which gather the information from local funeral homes and other sources, including coroners.

A household that wishes to receive benefits must present an application listing members and their Social Security numbers and provide information about income and other eligibility factors. Eligibility workers review this information, obtain identification documents such as a driver\u2019s license, interview a household representative, and certify eligibility.

According to FNS, only two other states, Illinois and Ohio, currently perform a monthly computer match between state records of deceased individuals and their food stamp rolls, and two other states, Maryland and Pennsylvania, have conducted matches, but not routinely.", "The California Department of Health Services conducts a monthly match of its assistance eligibility rolls, including that for food stamps, with state death records from its vital statistics agency. However, because the agency\u2019s Social Security numbers are not verified, and the information is limited to California, mismatches may occur, and some deceased individuals may not be identified.", "While Florida officials consider their match to be very useful, the state\u2019s reliance on unverified Social Security numbers and other identifying information reduces its effectiveness. The officials appreciate the positive effects of their match on the overall integrity of assistance programs (food stamps, Medicare, and others) because it eliminates ineligible individuals from the rolls and discourages fraud and abuse. However, because the agency\u2019s match is based solely on Social Security numbers, and these numbers are not verified in the state\u2019s record of deceased individuals, invalid matches are produced. During the first year of the match (initiated in December 1995), 4,528 matches were acted on by eligibility workers in the following way: 1,439 cases were updated, 21 cases were referred for fraud investigation, and 57 cases were determined to be duplicative. According to a state official, the remaining 3,011 matches required no action because (1) the case file had already been revised or (2) the match was invalid because although a Social Security number matched, other data\u2014 such as date of birth, gender, and race\u2014did not. Access to SSA\u2019s death information, in which the Social Security number, name, date of birth, and gender have been verified, would reduce the number of invalid matches.", "The New York State matching effort was suspended in June 1997 because the outdated death information used in the match resulted in invalid matches. The match, which had been in place since the late 1970s, was conducted using only the state\u2019s vital statistics data from the previous year. Eligibility workers stopped following up on the match results because they often found that appropriate action had already been taken as a result of more recent information provided by other sources, such as household members or obituary listings. In 1996, a new state law required the state to conduct a computer match to identify deceased individuals included in households receiving federal and state assistance, primarily so that liens could be placed on the estates of individuals owing funds to the state. In response to this requirement, the state is redesigning the matching program and establishing a process with the state\u2019s vital statistics bureau to ensure that current data are used.

A 1995 FNS study of the Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS), which compares wage, benefit, and other payment information reported by food stamp clients with records in six government agencies\u2019 databases, demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of programs using computer matches to verify beneficiary information.In the two sample states it reviewed, FNS found that all of the IEVS matching programs had a cost-effectiveness ratio (program savings compared with the costs of the match, follow-up, and claims collection) greater than 1, indicating that every dollar spent on IEVS returned more than a dollar in savings to the program.", "We found during this and our prior review of prisoners\u2019 participation that developing the computer programs to identify participation by ineligible individuals did not require a large investment of programmers\u2019 time. Our programmers required an average of about 20 days to develop a program for each state. This effort required them to become familiar with the files, resolve any apparent data problems, and create and run each program. State programmers may require less time because they are already familiar with the food stamp data in their state. The cost of having states conduct computer matching is relatively low for the return generated: According to the 1995 study of IEVS, data-processing costs were approximately 2 cents per case, and investigative follow-up and claim collection costs were about $5 to $7 for all matches, whether or not there were overpayments.", "Although the states we reviewed that matched their vital statistics data with the food stamp rolls had mixed success, their success rate could be improved if they used the more comprehensive data maintained by SSA. However, states wishing to conduct such matches may have difficulties because of the size of the SSA database\u2014which includes 57 million records.

According to SSA officials, while the cost and time required to do this programming is unknown, it is not expected to be prohibitive.", "Second, and more significantly, SSA does not have the authority to provide death information obtained from one state to other states. Under section 205 (r)(1) of the Social Security Act, SSA has the authority to enter into agreements with the states to obtain states\u2019 death information. In addition, section 205 (r)(3) of the Social Security Act authorizes SSA to provide death information to federal and state agencies administering federal benefit programs to \u201cthe extent feasible.\u201d However, some of the state agreements restrict SSA\u2019s ability to disclose such information. According to SSA, over half of the agreements between SSA and the states contain such restrictions.", "This problem of disclosure has been recognized for some time. In 1991, we recommended that the Congress remove these restrictions. In 1993, the Congress passed legislation to remove such restrictions on disclosure to federal agencies to ensure that federal payments or other benefits are not erroneously paid to deceased individuals (26 U.S.C. 6103 (d)(4)). However, the legislation did not cover state agencies administering such federal programs. One of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 recommendations for the National Performance Review would have resolved this problem. The recommendation called for establishing a federal clearinghouse for death information that could have been used by federal and state agencies. Legislation to establish such a clearinghouse was introduced in the 103rd Congress but was not enacted.", "In addition to providing accurate, comprehensive match data to identify deceased individuals in the Food Stamp Program, access to SSA\u2019s Death Master File information would provide opportunities to states to identify deceased individuals in other assistance programs and to improve the integrity of their food stamp data. The states use SVES to verify information for applicants and current recipients of all assistance programs, including the Food Stamp Program, Medicare, and the states\u2019 programs of aid to families and children and general relief.", "SSA\u2019s information on deceased individuals could also be used to identify agency errors.

A notice of a match with SSA\u2019s data sent to the eligibility worker would provide another opportunity for the case to be looked at and adjusted to reflect the change in household size.", "SSA\u2019s death information could also help agencies to profile the circumstances under which benefits are erroneously issued to deceased and other ineligible individuals. For example, an examination on the basis of household size of instances in which identified deceased individuals counted as members of food stamp households could be useful in determining if the problem is predominantly caused by (1) multimember households\u2019 not reporting deceased members or (2) individuals\u2019 fraudulently using the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of deceased individuals. An agency could then take appropriate steps to address the problem, such as reinforcing the responsibility of households to report changes in composition to the agency. Similarly, examining the method of food stamp issuance (electronic benefit transfer, mail, or clients\u2019 pickup) could alert an agency to the issuance method under which having deceased individuals counted as members of food stamp households is most prevalent and help it to select appropriate countermeasures.

The Department stated that the integrity of the Food Stamp Program would be improved with better access to Social Security\u2019s death record information. While agreeing with our report\u2019s overall findings and recommendations, the Department believed that our report was too definite about the magnitude of the overpayments and that our methodology did not provide an exact determination of the extent to which issued benefits were actually used. As our report recognizes, without a detailed review of each of the 26,000 cases we identified, it is not possible to precisely calculate the level of the associated overpayments. Instead, to demonstrate the general magnitude of the dollar values involved, we prepared an estimate using average monthly payments per person in the states involved. Our estimating approach, which we believe was reasonable, could understate or overstate the actual values. In any event, we believe the key observation remains: The large number of deceased individuals counted in food stamp households that we identified suggests a systemic problem needing immediate attention.", "In commenting on the draft report, the Social Security Administration agreed with our conclusion that the use of its Death Master File could improve efforts to identify deceased individuals counted as members of food stamp households.

We believe there is no sound reason why the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the states should not have the benefit of all the information possessed by Social Security as they strive to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Food Stamp Program. Furthermore, we do not believe the data now shared by Social Security can address 95 percent of the problem; available data from the Food and Nutrition Service indicate that a significant number of deceased individuals now included in food stamp households cannot be identified with the information Social Security now provides.

For those deceased individuals identified as members of households, we determined the periods in which food stamp issuance occurred after the date of death. We estimated the dollar value of food stamps issued to households with deceased members by applying the state\u2019s average monthly issuance per individual recipient from 1995 and 1996 to each period in which issuance occurred after the date of death. Food stamp benefits are calculated for households, not for individuals. As such, it is difficult to determine the exact value of benefits issued to a deceased individual included in a household, unless he or she is the only member of a household. Even then, the amount will vary from individual to individual, on the basis of such factors as income, assets, and the cost of shelter. Therefore, we relied on the average monthly benefit issued per person in the locations we reviewed, which ranged from a high of $82 in New York to a low of $65 in California.", "In recognition of the notification and processing time frames that allow 10 days for clients to report household changes and 10 days for the state agency to take action, we did not consider any issuance in the month of death or in the following month, where appropriate, to be an overpayment.", "Because of the quality control program operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the states\u2019 ongoing quality assurance efforts, we accepted the computerized food stamp data as reliable. To provide additional confidence in the data\u2019s accuracy, we reviewed a limited number of food stamp case files at social service centers in six large metropolitan areas: Los Angeles County, California; Orange County, California; San Diego County, California; San Antonio, Texas; Tampa, Florida; and New York City, New York.

We did not attempt to verify dates of benefit issuance because many case files did not contain complete information.", "The reliability of SSA\u2019s death information was confirmed in our prior report, which found that nearly all the information was accurate, and in a 1994 Internal Revenue Service review that reported that up to 98 percent of the data was accurate.", "To determine why the inclusion of deceased individuals in food stamp households was not detected, we visited state agency officials in Sacramento, California; Tallahassee, Florida; Albany, New York; and Austin, Texas; to discuss and review policy and procedures for verifying applicant data and any subsequent changes, including the loss of a household member. We discussed fraud detection and computerized data matching efforts, quality control and assurance efforts, and methods of food stamp issuance with state officials. In addition, at the social service centers in the six large metropolitan areas we selected for review, we discussed the processes for food stamp application, data verification, certification, and recertification. We discussed local fraud detection and computerized data matching efforts. While reviewing case files at each location, we validated to the extent possible the death of a participant.", "To determine whether computer matching or other methods could effectively identify deceased individuals included in food stamp households, we discussed with agency officials in each of the states we visited their opinions regarding the value of such a match. We contacted state officials who had implemented a match to identify such deceased individuals to determine the cost, quality, savings, and barriers to matching. To determine the effort associated with data matching to identify such individuals, we calculated the time used by our programmer to develop and implement the match programs and reviewed studies performed for FNS and the Office of Management and Budget regarding the costs and effectiveness of matching routines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s letter dated January 15, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We agree with USDA\u2019s observation that our methodology did not allow an exact determination of the dollar value of benefits issued on behalf of deceased household members and the extent to which the benefits issued were actually used. Our estimates of overpayments are based on the number of deceased individuals we identified and FNS\u2019 per person average monthly value of food stamp benefits provided in each state. Given the various factors that determine specific benefit amounts\u2014including household income, assets, costs of housing, and the number of individuals in the household\u2014actual overpayments could not be determined without a detailed analysis of the 26,000 cases we identified\u2014the actual overpayments may have been lower or may have been higher. Our estimates are presented to show the general magnitude of the problem. The fact that almost 26,000 deceased individuals were included in food stamp households indicates a significant, systemic problem that needs to be addressed. 2. Concerning USDA\u2019s view that data matching will not allow the recovery of all overpayments, the states are required to recover overpayments by establishing claims against households, and they have several years to take action on those claims. In addition, the states can recover overpayments by reducing future food stamp benefits. While state agencies may be unsuccessful in recovering overpayments from some households whose membership includes deceased individuals, such as single-member households, the use of SSA\u2019s comprehensive death information will still yield savings to the program by (1) identifying deceased individuals in the application process before any benefits are issued and (2) preventing additional issuance once the deceased individual is identified. Furthermore, such efforts have the effect of reinforcing the requirement that clients report changes in household composition. 3. Concerning USDA\u2019s view that the report does not discuss all the costs of identifying and following up on information regarding deceased individuals in food stamp households, we noted in this report the results of a 1995 Food and Nutrition Service study of the Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS), which is used to identify unreported and underreported income. The study found that data-processing costs were approximately 2 cents per case, and investigative followup and claim collection costs were about $5 to $7 per case for all cases, whether or not they were overpayments. The cost of identifying and following up on deceased individual cases would be similar to those incurred under IEVS. As such, our recommendation to use the existing SSA system was made with the goal of maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs by simply adding a vital piece of information to reports that are already routinely used by eligibility workers. We continue to believe that we have recommended the most cost-effective method for identifying deceased individuals on food stamp rolls\u2014one that would require state agencies, as part of the normal course of their work, to follow up on the information provided. 4. We have modified the report title to better capture the key issue identified in this report; namely, that thousands of deceased individuals are being inappropriately included in food stamp households."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Social Security Administration\u2019s letter dated January 16, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We continue to believe that our recommendation to the Congress has merit. As SSA concedes in its comment, the agency has death information that if shared with USDA and the states would help reduce the number of deceased individuals inappropriately included in food stamp households. However, SSA states that it does not have the authority to disclose such information to USDA or the states. In this context, we believe that USDA could better ensure the integrity of the Food Stamp Program if it had all the information already in the hands of another federal agency. If the Congress enacted legislation enabling SSA to share this information with the states, this legislation would help USDA reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in this program.", "Such legislation could, but would not have to, amend the Social Security Act. The Congress has partially addressed the issue of restricted state death data in a 1993 amendment to the Internal Revenue Code. Under this provision, the Internal Revenue Service may not disclose federal tax information to a state unless that state allows federal agencies to use restricted state death data for the purpose of ensuring that federal benefits and other payments are not erroneously paid to deceased individuals. 26 U.S.C. 6103 (d) (4). While this provision covers USDA, it does not include state agencies administering federal benefit programs, such as the Food Stamp Program. If the Congress wished, this provision could be amended to cover such state agencies. 2. We do not share SSA\u2019s view that making roughly 95 percent of its death information available to the states administering the Food Stamp Program is adequate to solve the problem of deceased individuals being counted as members of food stamp households. For the four states included in our review, we identified almost 26,000 deceased individuals that were being counted as members of food stamp households. While in this instance we cannot determine what proportion of these individuals were identified from SSA\u2019s data that are currently withheld from USDA and the states, previous GAO work related to this issue has demonstrated that using SSA\u2019s data was extremely useful in identifying and reducing overpayments in other federal benefit programs. As part of that work, we estimated that millions could be saved annually if agencies had access to the restricted death information.", "In addition, FNS data regarding the characteristics of food stamp households provides evidence that a significant number of deceased individuals included in food stamp households may be excluded from the data that SSA currently makes available to states. As is noted in this report, SSA only provides information through the State Verification and Exchange System (SVES) on deceased individuals who were Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or social security beneficiaries. In 1995, FNS reported that 83% of individuals in food stamp households did not receive SSI, and that 87% did not receive social security income. In the final analysis, therefore, we don\u2019t believe there is merit in SSA\u2019s view that the information it already provides is good enough. We believe there is no sound reason why USDA and the states should not have the benefit of all the information possessed by SSA as they strive to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the Food Stamp Program. 3.
