During 1993, the District contributed a total of about $292.3 million to the plans and the federal government paid about $52.1 million.", "The Congress created the three plans over a number of years beginning early in this century. Under the plans\u2019 enabling legislation, only the federal government paid into the plans and did so just for current annual retirement benefits (known as pay-as-you-go funding). The Congress did not authorize accumulating funds to meet the plans\u2019 normal costs\u2014the amount of funds needed each year that would be sufficient to pay all retirement benefits of active plan participants when due. Effective with Home Rule in January 1975, the responsibility for making the pay-as-you-go payments was transferred to the District government.", "Because the plans\u2019 normal costs were not funded, the shortfall in funds needed to pay future retirement benefits\u2014the plans\u2019 unfunded liability\u2014increased each year. The Congress partly addressed the plans\u2019 unfunded liability with the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act of 1979, which changed the District\u2019s payments to the plans to a modified pay-as-you-go basis and authorized annual federal payments to the plans of about $52.1 million. Consequently, the contribution requirements in the reform act did not provide for amortizing (paying off over a number of years) the plans\u2019 unfunded liability.", "In November 1992, we reported that the plans\u2019 unfunded liability had grown to about $5 billion and that they were not as well funded as other public plans. Our report also noted that the District faced an increasing demand on revenues from the three plans. We reported that by the year 2005 its contributions could grow to about 15 percent of revenues ($640.2 million), compared with about 8 percent ($234.9 million) in 1991.", "Similarly, as shown in figure 1.1, without changes to the current law the District\u2019s contributions to the three plans as a percentage of payroll will increase from 54 percent to a high of 71 percent in 2005, when federal contributions cease.", "Since our report, there has been much discussion about how to address these plans\u2019 continued underfunding.

The House bill and the District\u2019s act would eliminate the unfunded liability in the year 2035, mainly by increasing the obligations of the federal government, active plan participants, and retirees, and by placing the District\u2019s contributions on an actuarial basis. (See chapter 3 for a full discussion of these provisions.)", "Concern for the plans\u2019 underfunding was heightened by the District\u2019s recent cash flow difficulties. These difficulties caused the District to defer its contributions to the funds for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 1994 until fiscal year 1995. This action led to a lawsuit by the District of Columbia Retirement Board (DCRB) that required the contributions to be made. We reported in June 1994 that the District is faced with both unresolved long-term financial issues and continued short-term financial crises, such as a significant and continuing decline in its cash position.", "Placing the plans\u2019 funding on an actuarial basis and eliminating their unfunded liability would relieve the District of a significant financial burden.

Subsequently in 1968, the District\u2019s commissioners requested and were granted permission by the Congress to fund only the normal cost of the plan each year because of the need to use revenues for other purposes. This change was enacted in 1970 by Public Law 91-263, which put the fund on a modified pay-as-you-go basis, covering only the normal cost each year.

However, they believed that the District\u2019s financial resources (1) would never enable its share to the amortized, (2) would eventually enable it to pay the annual net normal cost and interest on its share, and (3) should not be overly burdened with paying the latter amounts during the 25-year period in which the federal share was being amortized. Accordingly, the formula for calculating the District\u2019s annual contribution was devised to limit its payments to amounts that essentially allow its share of the unfunded liability to increase with the rate of inflation to the year 2005 and to remain constant after that time. In that year, the unfunded liability could be about $6.1 billion and the District\u2019s contribution could be about 15 percent of its revenues, compared with about 8 percent in 1993\u2014a significant financial burden.

This would be accomplished through placing additional obligations on the federal government and active and retired employees and putting the District\u2019s contributions on an actuarial basis, while also mandating a minimum annual District payment. The basic approach is to stabilize the District\u2019s contributions at 45 percent of payroll through year 2035, as shown in figure 3.1. At 45 percent of payroll, the annual contributions would range from $403.5 million in year 2005 to $1.7 billion in year 2035. Maintaining pension contributions as a level percentage of payroll is the most common funding method used by public sector pension plans.", "The federal contribution to the plans would significantly increase under H.R. 3728. Under current law, the annual federal payments of $52.1 million, which have a present value of about $392 million, cease as of 2005. The bill proposes increasing the federal payment by 5 percent each year, beginning with fiscal year 1996, and extending it for 30 additional years, from 2005 through 2035. The federal payment would increase substantially in the latter part of the 40-year period, rising to about $367 million in the 40th year (see fig. 3.2). Overall, the present value of the total federal obligation would be increased by about $1.1 billion. (See app. I.)", "The obligations of the plans\u2019 active participants would increase and the retirees\u2019 benefits would decrease. All three plans\u2019 active participants would be required to contribute an additional 1 percent of pay: police officers\u2019, firefighters\u2019, and teachers\u2019 contributions would rise from 7 to 8 percent, and judges\u2019 would go from 3.5 to 4.5 percent. In addition, retirees\u2019 cost-of-living adjustments would be reduced from two to one each year. Also, police officers and firefighters who retired before February 15, 1980, would receive cost-of-living adjustments based on the consumer price index rather than on the active participants\u2019 pay raises.", "Finally, H.R. 3728 requires several changes in the District\u2019s responsibilities. In particular, the formula for determining the District\u2019s payment would be changed to one that is actuarially based; this approach adjusts the District\u2019s contributions to a level percentage of payroll and is most commonly used by public sector plans. Under this formula, the District\u2019s contribution would be stable as a level percentage of payroll and consist of several components: (1) the plans\u2019 net normal cost; (2) the amortization of their unfunded liability as of October 1, 1995, over 40 years; and (3) the amortization of actuarial gains and losses as well as benefit increases over 15 and 25 years, respectively. However, the bill specifically provides that the District\u2019s annual contribution must be at least $295.5 million, the amount of its certified contribution for 1995. Using this approach, the District\u2019s contributions would be slightly lower than current costs in the first few years, then increase in step with payroll. The percentage of payroll contribution for these groups will gradually fall from the current 53.8 percent to 44.8 percent after 2005. The District\u2019s contributions from 1996 through 2020 would be less than the current law requires and would be greater thereafter (see fig. 3.3). The present value of the District\u2019s contributions under current law through 2035 is about $8.2 billion and decreases to about $7.0 billion under the bill.", "We note that under the District\u2019s act, its contributions would be at the mandatory $295.5 million minimum for fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Our analysis shows that this provision results in the District paying a total of about $58 million more in annual dollars than would be required actuarially.

A more equitable federal funding method, which shifts less of the burden to the future, would be a constant annual payment, as under current law (see further discussion in ch. 4).
