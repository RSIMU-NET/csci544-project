Most broker-dealers or firms that process customer payments for mutual funds are subject to U.S. anti-money laundering requirements. However, unlike banks, most of these firms are not required to report suspicious activities. The Treasury Department is now developing a rule requiring broker-dealers to report suspicious activities. Treasury expects that the rule will be issued for public comment by the end of this year. Various intergovernmental groups, such as the Financial Action Task Force, have been working on recommendations that call for member nations to take various steps to combat money laundering through their financial institutions, including requiring securities firms to report suspicious activities. Although many members countries report that they have issued all or many of these recommendations and have applied them to their securities firms, it is difficult to determine how well the measures are being implemented and enforced."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report is in response to your request that we conduct a review of  money laundering issues related to the securities industry.  Money  laundering is criminal activity that occurs when individuals or  organizations seek to disguise or place illegally obtained funds in the  stream of legitimate commerce and finance. Money launderers have  traditionally targeted banks, which accept cash and facilitate domestic and  international funds transfers.  However, the U.S. securities markets, which  are the largest and most liquid in the world, may also be targeted by  criminals seeking to hide and obscure illicit funds.  In response to one of  the matters raised in your request, we reported in March 2001 on the status  of regulatory efforts to oversee the anti-money laundering activities of  certain broker-dealers affiliated with banks after the passage of the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).", "To address the remaining matters contained in your request, this report  describes (1) government and industry views on the potential for money  laundering in the securities industry, (2) current legal and regulatory  requirements relating to anti-money laundering in the securities industry  and the actions regulators have taken to oversee these requirements, (3)  the efforts that broker-dealers and mutual funds have undertaken to detect  and prevent money laundering, and (4) international anti-money laundering  efforts relating to securities activities and the effectiveness of these efforts.", "In completing our work, we interviewed U.S. and foreign officials from law  enforcement and regulatory agencies, broker-dealers, mutual fund groups,  industry associations, and international bodies formed to combat money  laundering.  We also reviewed available documents, including domestic and  foreign reports on anti-money laundering initiatives, pertinent U.S. laws  and examination procedures, and proposed drafts of a suspicious activity  report (SAR) rule for the U.S. securities industry.

Money laundering is the process used to transform the  monetary proceeds derived from such criminal  activities into funds and  assets that appear to have come from legitimate sources.  Money  laundering generally occurs in three stages.  As shown in figure 1, in the  placement stage, cash is converted into monetary instruments, such as  money orders or traveler\u2019s checks, or deposited into financial institution  accounts.  In the layering stage, these funds are transferred or moved into  other accounts or other financial institutions to further obscure their illicit  origin.  In the integration stage, the funds are used to purchase assets in the  legitimate economy or to fund further activities.", "There is no way to determine the actual amount of money that is being  laundered in general, let alone through a single industry such as the  securities industry.  However, experts have estimated that money  laundering in the global financial system is between 2 to 5 percent of the  world\u2019s gross domestic product.

These  SROs, which include NASDR and NYSE, oversee members\u2019 compliance  with their own rules, rules enacted by SEC, and the securities laws.   Federal regulators of depository institutions have oversight responsibilities  for banks, thrifts, and their holding companies. Prior to the passage of  GLBA in 1999, banks conducting securities activities directly were subject  to regulation and supervision by their respective banking regulators rather  than SEC.  After GLBA is fully implemented, banks and thrifts conducting  certain securities activities will have to do so in entities registered as  broker-dealers subject to oversight by SEC and securities industry SROs.

These include issuing anti-money  laundering regulations applicable to financial institutions and other  organizations, such as banks, broker-dealers, casinos, and money  transmitters.  Within Treasury, the authority to issue and administer these  regulations has been delegated to the Director of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

All financial sectors, and even commercial  businesses, could be targeted by money launderers. The securities industry  has characteristics similar to other financial sectors but also has some  significant differences.  Criminals seeking to convert their illegal proceeds  to legitimate assets have targeted banks, which take cash for deposit, as a  means to initially introduce illicit income into the financial system.", "Law enforcement and securities industry officials said that because  securities activities generally do not involve cash, broker-dealers and  mutual funds are not as vulnerable as banks during the initial placement  stage of the money laundering process.  However, some structuring  schemes used in the placement stage involve monetary instruments such as  money orders, and money launderers could attempt to use broker-dealers  and mutual funds that accept these forms of payment.", "According to law enforcement officials, money launderers would more  likely attempt to use brokerage or mutual fund accounts in the layering and  integration stages of money laundering, rather than for the placement  stage.  Similar to their use of banks, money launderers could use brokerage  or mutual fund accounts to layer their funds by, for example, sending and  receiving money and wiring it quickly through several accounts and  multiple institutions.  The securities industry could also be targeted for  integrating illicit income into legitimate assets.  In one case, illicit proceeds  from food stamp fraud were used to open brokerage accounts and invest in  stocks through an ongoing stream of deposits that ranged from less than  $1,000 to almost $10,000.", "Law enforcement officials were concerned that various characteristics of  the securities industry and securities transactions were particularly  attractive to money launderers.  For example, the U.S. national money  laundering strategy for 2000, issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and  the U.S. Attorney General, notes that the general nature of the securities  industry provides criminals with opportunities to move and thus obscure  funds.  The report suggests that money launderers may target the industry  because funds can be efficiently transferred among accounts and to other  financial institutions, both domestically and internationally.  For example,  like some banking organizations, several large broker-dealers have offices  located throughout the United States and in many foreign countries.  Some  law enforcement officials noted that wire transfers, specifically those that  involve offshore accounts, can be particularly vulnerable to money  laundering.  The national strategy report also suggests that money  launderers may be attracted to the industry because of the high degree of  liquidity in securities products, which can be readily bought and sold.", "Some law enforcement officials pointed to the high volume, large-dollar  amounts, and potentially profitable nature of securities transactions.  On a  typical day, for example, an estimated 3 billion shares of stock worth over  $85 billion are traded on the main U.S. markets\u2014a dramatic increase from  about $20 billion in 1995.  (Appendix III provides additional information on  the size and growth of the U.S. securities industry.)  Officials noted that the  rapid growth of the securities markets and increasing popularity of  investing in stocks and mutual funds may also have raised the industry\u2019s  profile with money launderers, who are becoming increasingly  sophisticated and are attempting to find as many avenues as possible to  launder funds.", "Law enforcement and securities industry officials also identified several  specific financial activities that securities firms conduct and that they  viewed to be more at risk for potential money laundering.  For example,  law enforcement officials expressed concern that on-line brokerage  accounts were vulnerable to use by money launderers, and such accounts  have grown substantially in the last few years, jumping from an estimated 7  million in 1998 to almost 20 million in 2000.  On-line brokerage services  provide little opportunity for face-to-face contact with customers or for  verifying the identity of those logging into accounts\u2014a safeguard that is  important to anti-fraud as well as anti-money laundering initiatives.  Although the industry already conducts much of its customer contacts  solely by telephone, securities regulators and industry officials  acknowledged that on-line activities pose particular challenges from a  money laundering perspective.  Law enforcement officials also noted that  some large broker-dealers are offering private banking services (broadly  defined as financial and related services provided to wealthy clients) that  are deemed vulnerable to money laundering.  These services generally  attempt to offer considerable confidentiality as part of the client  relationship, routinely involve large-dollar transactions, and sometimes  offer the use of offshore accounts.", "Some law enforcement officials maintained that the securities industry  lacks adequate anti-money laundering requirements and thus represents a  weak link in the U.S. regulatory regime that can be exploited by money  launderers in their search for new ways to hide their funds.  These officials  described the securities sector as a \u201cmoney laundering loophole\u201d within the  financial services industry that should be closed, particularly as other  financial sectors are being required to improve their defenses against  money laundering.  For example, Treasury issued rules for banks in 1996  and for money services businesses in 2000 requiring these firms to report  suspicious activities, including potential money laundering. However,  similar requirements do not yet apply to all broker-dealers and mutual fund  firms, and law enforcement officials saw this fact as a reason that criminals  may seek to use such firms to facilitate money laundering.  Some law  enforcement officials also suggested that as financial institutions continue  to merge in response to GLBA, the need for consistent and adequate anti- money laundering requirements in all financial sectors is becoming even  more pronounced.", "Securities industry officials acknowledged that money launderers could  potentially target their industry. SEC staff have noted that the large volume  of money generated by illegal activities creates a risk for broker-dealers as  well as other financial institutions.  In a May 2001 speech, an SEC official  stated that firms in the securities industry face great risks if they allow  themselves to be used for money laundering.  The official noted that  trillions of dollars flow through the industry each year, and criminal activity  within the industry could taint important U.S. capital markets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of Identified Cases in Which Money Has Been Laundered Through Securities Accounts Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Despite concerns regarding potential money laundering in the securities  industry, the extent to which money launderers are actually using broker- dealers and mutual fund firms is not known. According to law enforcement  officials, no organization currently collects information in a way that lends  itself to readily identifying cases in which funds generated by illegal activity  outside of the securities industry were laundered through brokerage or  mutual fund accounts.  Legal searches of cases primarily identify money  laundering cases in which broker-dealers or others committed securities  law violations, such as insider trading, market manipulation, or the sale of  fraudulent securities, and then laundered the proceeds from their illegal  activities through banks or other financial institutions.", "Law enforcement and securities industry officials acknowledged that a  limited number of cases involving money laundering through broker-dealer  or mutual fund accounts could be readily identified to date.  At our request,  the Internal Revenue Service and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys  collected information from some of their field staff that identified about 15  criminal or civil forfeiture cases since 1997 involving money laundering  through brokerage and mutual fund accounts.  The laundered funds in  these cases came from a number of activities, including drug trafficking,  illegal gambling, and food stamp fraud, and the estimated amounts of  laundered funds varied widely, ranging from $25,000 to $25 million per  case. In contrast, during 1999 alone, the United States reported having 996  money laundering convictions, most of which involved funds that were  laundered through banks or other means.   SEC and industry officials also  pointed out that the industry has not had a history of money laundering  cases.", "Law enforcement officials suggested that several factors could have  contributed to the limited number of known cases involving money  laundered through brokerage or mutual fund accounts.  These factors  include the difficulty of detecting money laundering at the layering and  integration stages and the lack of adequate systems to detect money  laundering activities in the securities industry. Specifically, they noted that  the absence of a SAR rule may be limiting the identification of money  laundering through broker-dealer and mutual fund accounts. A few  officials also explained that some investigators faced with time constraints  and multiple leads may choose to trace illegal funds through bank rather  than brokerage or mutual fund accounts because banks are subject to SAR  rules and thus are expected to have SAR-related procedures and  documentation needed for investigations.", "Law enforcement officials anticipated that more cases may surface in the  future as criminals continue to search for new ways to launder their funds  and turn to the securities industry.  One U.S. attorney stated that although,  historically, money laundering through the securities industry has not been  an apparent problem, some pending investigations involving the movement  of Russian funds through various types of financial accounts, including  brokerage accounts, indicate that activity in the area may be increasing.   Other law enforcement agencies were also attempting to identify and  develop additional cases in which brokerage and mutual funds accounts  were used to launder money.

Penalties under the Money  Laundering Control Act include imprisonment, fines, and forfeiture.", "Like other financial institutions, broker-dealers and those mutual fund  service providers that accept customer funds are required to comply with  various BSA or similar reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  Such  requirements are designed to be useful in tax, regulatory, or criminal  investigations, including those relating to money laundering.  As shown in  table 1, firms subject to these requirements are to identify and report  currency transactions exceeding $10,000 with FinCEN, file reports on  foreign bank and financial institution accounts with FinCEN, and report  the transportation of currency or monetary instruments into or out of the  United States with the U.S. Customs Service.", "In addition to imposing reporting requirements, the BSA requires broker- dealers and mutual fund service providers to maintain certain records.

Amendments to the BSA adopted in 1992 gave  Treasury the authority to require financial institutions to report any  suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of a law.  In 1996,  Treasury issued a rule requiring banks to report suspicious activities  involving possible money laundering to FinCEN using a SAR form. In  1996, the depository institution regulators promulgated regulations that  require broker-dealer subsidiaries of bank holding companies, national  banks, and federal thrifts to file SARs if the subsidiaries identify potential  money laundering or violations of the BSA involving transactions of $5,000  or more. Until Treasury promulgates SAR rules for broker-dealers, only  broker-dealers that are subsidiaries of depository institutions or of their  holding companies are subject to SAR requirements. Depository institution  regulators have also issued regulations that require banks to have BSA  compliance programs in place, including (1) developing internal policies,  procedures, and controls; (2) independently testing for compliance; (3)  designating an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring  compliance; and (4) conducting training for personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Develop a Securities SAR Rule Renewed", "paragraphs": ["Treasury is engaged in renewed efforts to develop a SAR rule for the  securities industry and anticipates that a proposed rule will be issued for  public comment before the end of 2001.  Working with SEC, Treasury  initially attempted to develop a SAR rule for the securities industry in 1997.   Treasury officials explained that this effort was set aside so that the  Department could focus first on cash-intensive businesses, such as the  money services businesses and casinos, that are viewed as more vulnerable  to money laundering at the placement stage.  During 2001, Treasury  resumed working with SEC to develop a SAR rule for the securities  industry.  Key issues being discussed include determining the appropriate  threshold for reporting suspicious activities, ensuring that the SAR rule will  not interfere with existing procedures for reporting securities law  violations that apply to broker-dealers, and providing for compliance  program requirements.", "One question being debated is whether the $5,000 threshold for reporting  suspicious activities that applies to banks should also apply to the  securities industry.  Securities industry and regulatory officials explained  that this reporting threshold reflects the cash-intensive nature of the  banking industry and its vulnerability to money laundering at the  placement stage and, as such, should not be applied to securities firms.   They also noted that the banking threshold does not reflect the typically  high-dollar amount of securities transactions.  Instead, these officials have  proposed thresholds ranging from $25,000 to $100,000.  Officials from a few  large firms stated that they currently use thresholds ranging from $250,000  to $1 million in their proprietary systems for monitoring suspicious  transactions.  They explained that $5,000 transactions would be too  difficult to identify in the accounts of several million customers and too  burdensome for processing and review purposes. In responding to our  survey, five broker-dealer subsidiaries of bank holding companies, which  are required by bank regulators to file SARs, suggested that the threshold  for the securities SAR rule needed to be raised. A few broker-dealer  subsidiaries said that the thresholds should be the same for both the  banking and securities industry rules, and the remaining 18 respondents  did not offer any comment on tailoring the SAR threshold to the securities  industry.", "Results from our surveys did suggest that the average securities transaction  tends to be much larger than $5,000.  For example, broker-dealers reported  that the average size of an individual transaction processed for retail  customers was about $22,000, although the size of these transactions  ranged anywhere from $200 to $150,000.  Appendix V provides additional  survey information on the size of average transaction amounts.", "Securities industry representatives also pointed out that a low SAR  threshold could result in an inordinate number of SAR filings from the  industry, undermining the ability of law enforcement agencies to use the  reports effectively.  Federal Reserve officials supported a higher SAR  threshold for the securities industry, in part because they thought it could  help justify a higher reporting threshold for the banking industry as well.   Finally, some law enforcement officials also viewed the reporting threshold  as too low for the securities industry but did not propose an alternative  amount.  Although they acknowledged that the securities industry appears  to be engaged in larger dollar transactions than other types of financial  institutions, a few officials expressed concerns about having different  reporting thresholds for the banking and securities financial sectors.", "Another issue being discussed is the scope of suspicious activities that  should be reported to FinCEN on the SAR form.  Financial regulators,  industry, and law enforcement officials agree that any rule requiring the  securities industry to report suspicious activities involving money  laundering should not replace existing procedures that require broker- dealers to report suspected violations of securities laws.  Currently broker- dealers are to report possible securities law violations to SEC, SROs, or a  U.S. attorney\u2019s office. In turn, SEC and the SROs are to refer criminal  money laundering offenses that are reported along with suspected  securities law violations to the appropriate U.S. attorney\u2019s office.  To  minimize any potential confusion on the part of the industry, officials  emphasized that the language of the SAR rule should be written to ensure  that firms understand that they are to continue to report potential  securities violations to the appropriate securities regulators.", "Both securities industry and law enforcement officials recognize the value  of requiring compliance programs for reporting suspicious activities and  are discussing whether the SAR rule is the most appropriate mechanism for  imposing such requirements. Law enforcement officials said that industry  participants cannot fully implement a suspicious activity reporting regime  unless they are also required to set up systems to monitor their customers\u2019  activities to prevent and detect transactions involving money laundering.   In addition, securities industry officials said that the SAR rule should  provide that broker-dealers with systems for reasonably detecting  suspicious transactions, appropriate procedures for filing SARs, and no  basis for believing that these procedures are not being followed, have a  defense against being cited for violating the SAR reporting requirement.  Such a provision would be an effective incentive for broker-dealers to  develop and maintain up-to-date programs designed to monitor and report  suspicious activities that may involve money laundering.", "In addition to issues relating to the SAR rule itself, some unique  characteristics of the securities industry, including the variety of business  structures and processes, product lines, and client bases among broker- dealers and mutual funds, will make implementing the rule more  challenging.  Not all firms in the industry perform similar activities and thus  may have to work with other firms to fulfill their SAR-related  responsibilities.  For example, determining whether particular transactions  are suspicious may require information from an introducing broker on a  customer\u2019s identity and business activities or investment patterns and  information from a clearing broker on the customer\u2019s payment and  transaction histories.  Regulators and others have also noted that  addressing anti-money laundering considerations will be more challenging  within the securities industry because firms may not collect the same type  of information about customers as banks.  Broker-dealers are expected to  collect enough information about their customers to ensure that any  recommended investments are suitable. However, for some accounts this  may not include all information, such as the customer\u2019s source of the  wealth or income, that can be important for assessing whether this  customer\u2019s activities are suspicious.   Further, with the securities industry,  there is a greater need to focus on the layering and integration stages of  money laundering."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securities Regulators Examine Broker-Dealers and Mutual Fund Firms for Compliance With Applicable Requirements and Plan for Broader Reviews", "paragraphs": ["SEC and the securities industry SROs oversee broker-dealers\u2019 compliance  with BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements involving currency  and other related transactions. After Treasury granted SEC the authority to  examine broker-dealers for compliance with these BSA requirements, SEC  adopted Rule 17a-8 under the Exchange Act, incorporating these  requirements into its own rules.  As a result, SEC and the SROs have the  authority to both examine broker-dealers for compliance with these  requirements and bring action against firms that violate them.", "Along with SEC, the SROs are to perform examinations of broker-dealers,  including reviews to assess compliance with anti-money laundering  reporting and recordkeeping requirements. These examinations do not  routinely include assessing compliance with BSA SAR requirements that do  not yet apply to the industry.  During 2000, NASDR reported that it  conducted 1,808 broker-dealer examinations, and NYSE reported that it  conducted 319 examinations.  Both SROs found that some broker-dealers  had deficiencies in supervisory procedures pertaining to the currency  reporting and recordkeeping requirements under SEC Rule 17a-8.", "Although most broker-dealers are not subject to SAR requirements,  National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and NYSE  representatives noted that they have reviewed broker-dealers\u2019 procedures  relating to suspicious activities.  In 1989, NASD and NYSE issued guidance  advising their members that reporting suspicious activities could prevent  firms from being prosecuted under the Money Laundering Control Act. In  its issuance, NASD specifically warned its members that failure to report  suspicious transactions could be construed as aiding and abetting  violations of the act and could subject the broker to civil and criminal  charges. In its guidance, NYSE cautioned its members to establish  procedures to detect transactions by money launderers and others who  seek to hide profits obtained from illegal activity. In conducting reviews of  their members\u2019 procedures relative to such guidance, these SROs cited a  few firms for deficiencies such as failing to maintain written supervisory  procedures to identify and record suspicious transactions.", "Although the SROs conduct most examinations of broker-dealers, SEC staff  also perform them and examinations of certain transfer agents.  For  instance, SEC staff conduct oversight examinations of broker-dealers that  are designed to test both the firms\u2019 compliance with securities laws and  SEC rules (such as SEC Rule 17a-8) and the quality of SRO examinations.   SEC staff also perform \u201ccause examinations\u201d that are initiated in response  to special concerns related to a firm.  These examinations can sometimes  cover compliance with Rule 17a-8, even though BSA compliance may not  have been the initial reason for the examination.  During 2000, SEC  completed 422 oversight examinations and 283 cause examinations but  found no violations of anti-money laundering requirements that had not  already been identified by the SROs.", "SEC also conducts examinations of mutual funds and their transfer agents  that address some money laundering issues.  Among the firms that act as  transfer agents for mutual funds are broker-dealers, banks, and  nonfinancial firms that provide other services to mutual funds.  Although  Rule 17a-8 does not apply to transfer agents that are not broker-dealers,  SEC staff explained that the examiners also inquire about these firms\u2019  policies for detecting transactions that may involve money laundering.   Most mutual fund shares, however, are sold by broker-dealers or other  financial intermediaries that have primary responsibility for complying  with the BSA or other currency reporting requirements (such as those  contained in the Internal Revenue Code).", "Recognizing the need to strengthen the securities industry\u2019s efforts to  combat money laundering, and anticipating a SAR rule for the industry,  SEC and the SROs are in the process of developing a \u201crefocused\u201d approach  to anti-money laundering examinations.  According to SEC officials, this  enhanced approach will result in a broader review of securities firms than  the current approach, which focuses on compliance with Rule 17a-8. The  new approach is intended to assess firms\u2019 overall anti-money laundering  strategies to determine whether they include policies, procedures, and  internal control systems for monitoring suspicious activities.  SEC officials  anticipated that the expanded procedures would be used during  examinations starting in the fall of 2001.

Survey results also showed  that some broker-dealers and direct-marketed mutual fund groups had  implemented voluntary anti-money laundering measures designed to  identify and report suspicious activities that may involve money  laundering, but most have yet to take such steps.  Clearing brokers were  more actively engaged in such voluntary anti-money laundering efforts than  introducing brokers. In some cases, introducing brokers relied on their  clearing brokers to conduct anti-money laundering activities for them, but  not all clearing firms performed such activities or subjected introducing  broker transactions to such measures.  The largest broker-dealers and  direct-marketed mutual fund groups, which represent the majority of  assets and accounts in the securities industry, were reportedly much more  actively engaged in such voluntary anti-money laundering efforts than  small and medium-sized firms, although these represent the majority of  industry participants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Broker-Dealers and Mutual Fund Groups Restricted Cash Transactions and the Use of Some Monetary Instruments", "paragraphs": ["A vast majority of the broker-dealers and direct-marketed mutual fund  groups surveyed reported having policies that prohibit the acceptance of  cash.  By prohibiting cash transactions, firms reduce their vulnerability to  money laundering at the placement stage and the number of instances in  which they must report certain currency transactions.  Our survey showed  that 95 percent of a projected 2,979 broker-dealers among our survey  population and 92 percent of the 310 mutual fund groups never accept  cash in the normal course of business.  The remaining firms accept cash  only as an exception. For example, these firms might accept small amounts  (less than $1,000) or conduct cash transactions approved by a legal or  compliance department.  Industry officials explained that most securities  firms and mutual funds are not set up to handle cash.  Conducting  securities business in cash is generally viewed as too burdensome, and  many firms have chosen not to develop the needed infrastructure,  including policies and procedures, storage facilities, and internal controls.   Furthermore, industry officials note that prohibiting the use of cash is a  prudent business practice that helps to reduce risks, other than money  laundering, commonly associated with handling cash, including theft and  embezzlement.", "Although most broker-dealers and direct-marketed mutual fund groups  have reduced their vulnerability to money laundering that involves cash  transactions, many may still be vulnerable to money laundering using other  forms of payment or deposit, such as traveler\u2019s checks, money orders, and  cashier\u2019s checks.  As shown in figure 4, over 55 percent of direct-marketed  mutual fund groups reported always accepting money orders.  According to  law enforcement officials, such forms of payment or deposit can be used as  part of structuring schemes in which cash is converted into monetary  instruments and deposited in increments of less than the $10,000 reporting  threshold. In addition, a large portion of mutual fund groups and broker- dealers also reported accepting cashier\u2019s checks, which can also be used in  money laundering schemes.  A securities industry official pointed out that  cashier\u2019s checks are a common form of payment that firms tend to monitor  rather than restrict for money laundering purposes.  Personal checks are  the most widely accepted form of payment but, according to industry  officials, are viewed with less concern since they can usually be traced to  accounts at depository institutions that have their own anti-money  laundering requirements.", "Industry representatives also pointed out that although the survey  responses reflect the proportion of firms that accept certain forms of  payment, these figures do not likely correspond with the extent to which  the cited forms of payment are actually used to deposit funds into broker- dealer or mutual fund accounts. For example, officials from a mutual fund  industry association said that considerable amounts of money are  deposited into mutual funds through electronic fund transfers from bank  accounts or through payroll deposits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Broker-Dealers and Direct-Marketed Mutual Fund Groups Reported Implementing Additional Voluntary Anti-Money Laundering Measures", "paragraphs": ["Although not subject to SAR requirements, some broker-dealers and direct- marketed mutual fund groups reported having implemented anti-money  laundering measures designed to identify and report suspicious activities.   According to our survey, 17 percent of broker-dealers, or an estimated 513  of 3,015 firms, reported implementing anti-money laundering measures that  go beyond BSA provisions for the securities industry at large.  In our  survey, we asked firms to identify the type of voluntary anti-money  laundering measures, if any, they have implemented.  We divided these  types of measures into four broad categories:    written policies and procedures, such as those requiring staff to learn  more about customers and the nature of the customers\u2019 businesses;  internal controls, including supervisory reviews to ensure that anti- money laundering policies and procedures are being followed;  tools and processes, such as an automated transaction monitoring  program to facilitate the detection of potential money laundering; and  formal training programs for staff, such as those that provide guidance  on how to identify suspicious activities that may involve money  laundering.", "These categories were used to determine the general nature of industry efforts and do not  represent a comprehensive list of anti-money laundering efforts. which firms that reported  implementing anti-money laundering measures  were actually adhering to them.  In addition, the effectiveness of these  measures at any firm would depend on various factors, including the level  of  a firm\u2019s management commitment to detecting and preventing money  laundering  and the degree to which the employees responsible for  following anti-money laundering policies and procedures are being  supervised and held accountable.", "Although 17 percent of broker-dealers overall reported implementing at  least one voluntary anti-money laundering measure, broker-dealers that  clear trades for themselves and other firms reported being more active in  the area.  According to our survey analysis, 15 percent of introducing  brokers and 63 percent of clearing brokers reported implementing  voluntary anti-money laundering measures. As shown in figure 5, the  extent to which introducing brokers reported implementing the various  voluntary measures identified in our survey ranged from 2 to 10 percent.   The extent to which clearing brokers reported implementing the various  voluntary measures identified in our survey ranged from 5 to 53 percent.", "Our survey results also showed that the transactions processed by 40  percent of direct-marketed mutual fund groups were subject to some type  of voluntary anti-money laundering measures.  Over 30 percent of these  groups reported that they or their transfer agents had put in place policies  and many of the tools and processes for identifying and monitoring  suspicious activities (fig. 6).", "The extent to which firms had implemented multiple anti-money  laundering measures varied.  For example, for broker-dealers that reported  having implemented voluntary anti-money laundering measures, almost 20 percent indicated they had three or fewer of these measures in place.   Almost 30 percent of these broker-dealers reported having implemented  more than 10 measures.", "Even when firms reported implementing the same measures, the scope of  their efforts differed.  For example, officials at one firm explained that its  transaction monitoring system, although still in the process of being  implemented, was specifically designed for anti-money laundering  purposes and focused on the overall financial activities of its customers,  including deposits, wire transfers, and transactions involving cash  equivalents.  This firm\u2019s system will eventually use customer profiling  techniques to identify unusual spikes in account activity and will have the  ability to make links among related customers to identify any suspicious  patterns of activity that may involve money laundering. In contrast,  officials at another firm that reported having a transaction monitoring  system told us that that their system involved the manual review of  transactions identified by a reporting system designed to identify fraud to  determine if the transactions might also involve money laundering.   Similarly, some firms described having ongoing training programs  specifically tailored to money laundering issues, including guidance on  how to identify suspicious activities.  A few firms addressed money  laundering issues only as part of the orientation training provided to new  employees.", "Industry officials noted that, in general, a firm\u2019s vulnerability to money  laundering will vary, depending upon such factors as its type of business  activities, customer base, and company size.  They suggested that this  variance in vulnerability among firms may account for some of the  observed differences in the extent and scope of voluntary anti-money  laundering measures implemented by broker-dealers and mutual fund  groups.", "Our survey results also disclosed that a relatively small number of broker- dealers and direct-marketed mutual fund groups filed SARs during calendar  year 2000, although they were not legally required to do so.  Specifically, 12  of 152 broker-dealer respondents and 6 of 65 mutual fund group  respondents indicated that they had filed SARs. Almost all were larger  firms.  Most indicated that they had submitted 25 or fewer SARs during  2000, but 1 reported submitting over 200 reports during the year. An  industry association official noted that, rather than filing SARs, some firms  informally refer suspicious activities that may involve money laundering  informally to appropriate regulatory or law enforcement authorities.", "Industry officials explained that firms have generally chosen to adopt  voluntary anti-money laundering measures to protect themselves from  becoming unwitting participants in money laundering activities.  The firms  hope that implementing such measures will also help to reduce the  likelihood of prosecution or civil enforcement actions for violations of  money laundering laws and mitigate sanctions in the event that a violation  does occur. Industry trade associations encourage voluntary efforts, noting  that firms are less likely to be subject to a regulatory penalty (or may have a  penalty reduced) if a violation occurs when an effective compliance  program is in place.  Firms also believe that being associated with criminal  elements or activities such as money laundering can threaten their  reputation and have a tremendous impact in terms of lost business and  costly legal fees.  Lastly, firms note that they are taking voluntary actions in  anticipation of a SAR rule for broker-dealers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Introducing Brokers\u2019 Transactions Were Covered by Anti-Money Laundering Activities Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Although a relatively small portion of introducing brokers reported having  implemented voluntary anti-money laundering measures, many other  introducing brokers reported relying on their clearing brokers to conduct  anti-money laundering activities on their behalf.

Almost another third reported that they had no voluntary measures of their  own and did not rely on their clearing brokers to undertake such measures  for them.", "We found that the allocation of anti-money laundering responsibilities  between introducing and clearing brokers was not always clear. Of the  many introducing brokers that reported relying on clearing brokers to  conduct anti-money laundering activities, most did not know exactly what  types of anti-money laundering activities the clearing brokers performed.   Several introducing brokers indicated that they thought their clearing  brokers monitored customer accounts to identify suspicious activities that  could involve money laundering and would report such activities to them.   Few of the introducing brokers indicated that they received regular  transaction reports from their clearing brokers for anti-money laundering  purposes.", "In addition, many of the clearing brokers responding to our survey reported  that they either did not engage in voluntary anti-money laundering  activities or performed them only for their own firms\u2019 transactions, not for  those of introducing brokers.  As a result, some introducing brokers may  have been mistaken in assuming that their clearing brokers performed anti- money laundering activities on their behalf.  We were not able to determine  whether any of the introducing brokers in our survey population used the  clearing brokers that reported performing anti-money laundering  activities. Six of the 29 clearing broker respondents that provided clearing  services for other broker-dealers reported that they did not engage in any  type of voluntary anti-money laundering measures.

For the mutual fund survey, our results are representative only of those  mutual fund groups that are direct marketed and that offer predominantly  no-load funds, which we believe is closest to the target population of  mutual funds that are self-distributing.  Also, we discovered a small number  of firms in our broker-dealer sample that was affiliated with depository  institutions and subject to banking SAR requirements.

To minimize such errors, we asked subject  matter experts to review our questionnaires before the survey, and  pretested the questionnaires by telephone with respondents at several  firms of various sizes and levels of anti-money laundering activity.", "Nonresponse error arises when surveys are unsuccessful in obtaining any  information from eligible sample elements or fail to get valid answers to  individual questions on returned questionnaires.  To the extent that those  not providing information would have provided significantly different  information from those that did respond, bias from nonresponse can also  result.  Because the seriousness of this type of error is often proportional to  the level of missing data, response rates are commonly used as indirect  measures of nonresponse error and bias.  We took steps to maximize  response rates, such as sending multiple faxes of the questionnaires and  making several telephone follow-ups to convert nonrespondents.", "Finally, surveys may be subject to processing error in data entry,  processing, and analysis.
