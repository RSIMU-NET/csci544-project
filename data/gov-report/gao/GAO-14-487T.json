Consequently, it is critical that federal agencies take steps to  secure the information they collect, retain, and disseminate and that,  when events such as data breaches occur, they respond swiftly and  appropriately.

Figure 3 shows that the number of incidents involving  PII for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 increased over 140 percent.", "Data breaches at federal agencies have received considerable publicity  and raised concerns about the protection of PII at those agencies. Most  notably, in May 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reported  that computer equipment containing PII on about 26.5 million veterans  and active duty members of the military was stolen from the home of a VA  employee. More recent examples of incidents that compromised  individuals\u2019 personal information further highlight the impact that such  incidents can have:  In July 2013, hackers stole a variety of PII on more than 104,000  individuals from a Department of Energy system. Types of data stolen  included Social Security numbers, birth dates and locations, bank  account numbers and security questions and answers. According to  the department\u2019s Inspector General, the combined costs of assisting  affected individuals and lost productivity\u2014due to federal employees  being granted administrative leave to correct issues stemming from  the breach\u2014could be more than $3.7 million.  In May 2012, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB)  reported a sophisticated cyber attack on the computer of a contractor  that provided services to the Thrift Savings Plan. As a result of the  attack, PII associated with approximately 123,000 plan participants  was accessed. According to FRTIB, the information included 43,587  individuals\u2019 names, addresses, and Social Security numbers, and  79,614 individuals\u2019 Social Security numbers and other PII-related  information.  In March 2012, a laptop computer containing sensitive PII was stolen  from a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee at  the Kennedy Space Center. As a result, 2,300 employees\u2019 names,  Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and other personal  information were exposed.  In February 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration notified  employees that an agency computer had been illegally accessed and  that employee PII had been stolen electronically.

According to  FISMA, each agency is responsible for, among other things, providing  information security protections commensurate with the risk and  magnitude resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,  disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or  maintained by or on behalf of the agency and information systems used  or operated by an agency or by a contractor or other organization on  behalf of an agency. These protections are to provide federal information  and systems with integrity\u2014preventing improper modification or  destruction of information; confidentiality\u2014preserving authorized  restrictions on access and disclosure; and availability\u2014ensuring timely  and reliable access to and use of information.", "Under FISMA, agencies are required to develop procedures for detecting,  reporting, and responding to security incidents, consistent with federal  standards and guidelines, including mitigating risks associated with such  incidents before substantial damage is done. The law also requires the  operation of a central federal information security incident center that  compiles and analyzes information about incidents that threaten  information security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was  given the role of operating this center, which became US-CERT, by the  Homeland Security Act. DHS\u2019s role is further defined by Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, which requires that incidents  involving PII be reported to US-CERT within 1 hour of discovery. US- CERT is also responsible for providing timely technical assistance to  operators of agency information systems regarding security incidents,  including offering guidance on detecting and handling incidents.", "In addition to establishing responsibilities for agencies, FISMA assigns  specific responsibilities to OMB, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) and inspectors general:", "OMB is to develop and oversee the implementation of policies,  principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal  agencies (except with regard to national security systems). It is also  responsible for reviewing, at least annually, and approving or  disapproving agency information security programs.", "NIST\u2019s responsibilities include developing security standards and  guidelines for agencies that include standards for categorizing  information and information systems according to ranges of risk  levels, minimum security requirements for information and information  systems in risk categories, guidelines for detection and handling of  information security incidents, and guidelines for identifying an  information system as a national security system.", "Agency inspectors general are required to annually evaluate the  information security program and practices of their agency. The  results of these evaluations are to be submitted to OMB, and OMB is  to summarize the results in its reporting to Congress.", "In July 2010, the Director of OMB and the White House Cybersecurity  Coordinator issued a joint memorandum stating that DHS was to exercise  primary responsibility within the executive branch for the operational  aspects of cybersecurity for federal information systems that fall within the  scope of FISMA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Continue to Face Challenges in Effectively Securing Their Information", "paragraphs": ["In September 2013 we issued the most recent of our periodic reports on  federal agencies\u2019 compliance with the requirements of FISMA.

These  weaknesses show that information security continues to be a major  challenge for federal agencies, putting federal systems and the  information they contain, including PII, at increased risk.

However, they did not consistently implement the operational  practices, as summarized in figure 4.", "Of the seven agencies we reviewed, only the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) consistently documented both an assigned risk level  and how that level was determined for PII-related data breach  incidents; only the Army and IRS documented the number of affected  individuals for each incident; and only the Army and the Securities  and Exchange Commission notified affected individuals for all high- risk breaches.", "The seven agencies did not consistently offer credit monitoring to  individuals affected by PII-related breaches.", "None of the seven agencies consistently documented lessons learned  from PII breaches, including corrective actions to prevent similar  incidents in the future or whether better security controls could help  detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents.", "Incomplete guidance from OMB contributed to this inconsistent  implementation. For example, OMB\u2019s guidance does not make clear how  agencies should use risk levels in making a determination about  notification to affected individuals. Further, OMB guidance states that the  risk levels should help determine when and how notification should be  provided, but it does not set specific requirements for notification based  on agency risk determinations.", "In addition, OMB guidance for reporting on data breaches involving PII  may be too stringent. Specifically, OMB guidance requires that DHS  collect information about PII-related breaches within 1 hour, but officials  at US-CERT and the agencies in our review generally agreed that this  requirement was difficult to meet and may not provide US-CERT with the  best information. For example, some agencies noted that it is difficult to  provide a meaningful report on a breach within 1 hour since relevant  information\u2014such as how much PII was affected or the extent of the  risk\u2014may not be available within that time frame.", "Agency officials also questioned the value of reporting certain types of PII  breaches, such as paper-based incidents or incidents involving the loss of  hardware containing encrypted PII, individually to US-CERT, as currently  required. Officials from US-CERT agreed that their office should not be  receiving all PII-related incident reports individually as they occur.", "According to DHS officials, the PII-related incident data they collect are  not generally used to help remediate incidents or provide technical  assistance to agencies. Rather, the information is compiled in accordance  with certain FISMA requirements and reported to OMB. We determined  that the limited use of these data calls into question OMB\u2019s requirement  that such incidents be reported within 1 hour. US-CERT officials also  noted that the vast majority of PII-related data breaches are not  cybersecurity related\u2014that is, they do not involve attacks on or threats to  government systems or networks. Thus receiving information about such  incidents on an individual basis may not be useful to the office in pursuing  its mission.", "Finally, we reported that seven of the eight agencies in our review had not  requested technical assistance from US-CERT when PII data breaches  occurred. DHS officials said that US-CERT is not equipped to assist  agencies in remediating paper-based incidents, and agencies agreed that  issues they encounter in dealing with PII breaches are generally best  addressed by agency general counsel staff or privacy officers. DHS\u2019s  Privacy Office has developed guidance that addresses agencies\u2019  obligations to protect PII and procedures to follow when a suspected PII  incident occurs, but this is geared more toward developing agency  response capabilities in general rather than supporting decision-making  related to specific incidents.", "In our report, we recommended that OMB revise its guidance on federal  agencies\u2019 response to PII-related data breaches to include (1) guidance  on notifying affected individuals based on a determination of the level of  risk; (2) criteria for determining whether to offer assistance, such as credit  monitoring, to affected individuals; and (3) revised requirements for  reporting PII-related breaches to US-CERT. In commenting on our draft  report, officials from OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  stated that our recommendation did not sufficiently specify what  supplemental guidance was needed; we subsequently revised the draft  recommendation to provide greater specificity.", "We also made a number of recommendations to the individual agencies  in our review to improve their response to data breaches involving PII.  Specifically, we recommended, among other things, that several of the  agencies (1) consistently document risk levels and how those levels are  determined for PII-related data breach incidents; (2) document the  number of affected individuals for each incident; and (3) identify lessons  learned from responses to PII breaches.
