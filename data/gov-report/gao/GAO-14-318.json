TEOAF officials attribute the variation in total  obligations for remission and mitigation payments each year to the  different types of investigations that lead to forfeiture from 1 year to the  next. According to these officials, higher remission and mitigation  payments in a fiscal year may be in part due to high-impact forfeitures  resulting from fraud investigations with significant numbers of victims.", "Seizure investigative costs and asset management expenses: In  addition to carrying out equitable sharing and making payments to  victims, DHS components use funds to pay for the costs associated with  the seizure of assets.

TEOAF increased one agency\u2019s share because it provided a Special  Assistant United States Attorney to handle the forfeiture, which was considered unique  and indispensable assistance. The attorney had expertise in asset forfeiture cases,  negotiated the terms of the forfeiture payments to help ensure recovery of the entire  forfeited amount, and provided a range of other legal support.", "DHS components have designed controls to help ensure that equitable  sharing packages contain required information and are reviewed and  approved by appropriate component authorities to help ensure  compliance with Treasury\u2019s guidance. According to the guidance, state  and local law enforcement agencies are to submit an application for  equitable sharing in which they outline the asset that was seized, the  number of work hours they expended on the investigation, and other  contributions. One control to help ensure DHS components comply with  guidance is the requirement to prepare and submit an equitable sharing  decision form when making determinations. The decision form is to  include estimated work hours, recommended and approved sharing  percentages, and a narrative section for providing an overview of the  case and describing specific agency contributions. Another control  involves required signatures on the form documenting submission by field  office officials and approval by component headquarters officials.", "Moreover, all three DHS components have designed multiple levels of  review for equitable sharing packages. First, component field office  officials\u2014including the agents leading the investigation, asset forfeiture  specialists, and supervisory agents or sector chiefs, among others\u2014are  to review equitable sharing applications and provide recommended  sharing percentages on the equitable sharing decision form. HSI officials  stated that HSI has an asset forfeiture specialist in each special agent in  charge field office, and Border Patrol officials stated that Border Patrol  has an asset forfeiture officer in each sector. According to USSS\u2019s  Asset Forfeiture Liaison, USSS does not have asset forfeiture specialists  in its field offices, with the exception of New York, and instead has  designated staff that review and process equitable sharing requests as  collateral duties. Officials from all nine of the DHS component field  offices with whom we spoke said that they review applications to ensure  that they are complete and accurate. These officials noted that they work  closely with state and local agencies requesting equitable sharing and as  a result are knowledgeable about their work hours and other  contributions. Officials from all nine of the state and local agencies we  interviewed said that component field offices can contact them if they  need clarification or additional information regarding their participation.", "After field office review, the equitable sharing package\u2014which is to  include the decision form, state and local equitable sharing applications,  and other relevant documents, such as the forfeiture order\u2014is submitted  to component headquarters for approval. Each component has a full-time  asset forfeiture liaison who is responsible for reviewing packages and  overseeing all interactions with TEOAF on forfeitures and equitable  sharing. The review process at the headquarters level varies across  components. HSI headquarters officials stated that within the Asset  Forfeiture Unit, an asset forfeiture specialist, program manager, section  chief, and unit chief review all equitable sharing packages. According to  Border Patrol officials, the Assistant Chief of the Asset Forfeiture  Program, who is the asset forfeiture liaison to TEOAF, reviews all  packages. USSS officials said that the asset forfeiture liaison and an  administrative staff person review packages. Component headquarters  officials told us that they review packages to ensure that they are  complete, include the necessary forms and information, and reflect the  degree of agency participation in the seizure. Components then are to  submit the packages to TEOAF for payment authorization. DHS asset  forfeiture liaisons are to be available to address any questions that  TEOAF may have regarding their packages or obtain additional  information about sharing determinations from the field offices if needed.  Figure 6 shows the steps involved in making equitable sharing  determinations.", "HSI and Border Patrol have also issued additional guidance to their field  offices to help ensure compliance with Treasury\u2019s guidance for making  equitable sharing determinations. Specifically, HSI issued a memorandum  in January 2013 to remind all offices on the proper procedures to follow  when dealing with equitable sharing requests. HSI officials stated that the  memorandum was intended to underscore and clarify Treasury\u2019s  guidance as it pertained to HSI cases. For example, it outlines time  frames for submitting equitable sharing packages to the Asset Forfeiture  Unit in HSI headquarters. It also reiterates Treasury\u2019s guidance on how  equitable sharing determinations should be made based on investigative  work hours and qualitative factors, if applicable. In addition, the  memorandum provides additional guidance on what should be considered  unique and indispensable assistance. Specifically, it lists an additional  example of such assistance\u2014an undercover officer with a special skill or  language ability not readily available elsewhere. Border Patrol issued  additional guidance in 2006 that outlines the equitable sharing process in  detail. The guidance lists the steps that the requesting agency, sector  asset forfeiture office, headquarters asset forfeiture office, and TEOAF  perform in the process. It also reiterates Treasury\u2019s guidance on factors to  consider when making equitable sharing determinations, among other  things. USSS has not issued additional guidance because, according to  the component\u2019s asset forfeiture liaison, field office staff use Treasury\u2019s  guidance and can contact headquarters if they need assistance in making  sharing determinations.", "HSI and USSS have also provided training to headquarters and field  office staff responsible for equitable sharing. HSI headquarters officials  said that they began providing training to field office staff in August 2012  and asset forfeiture officials from all 26 field offices have received  training. Training sessions addressed the process for equitable sharing,  factors to consider when making equitable sharing determinations, and  what to include in packages submitted to HSI headquarters, among other  things. USSS officials stated that since fiscal year 2011, USSS has  provided 37 field office trainings for operational personnel\u2014including a  nationwide asset forfeiture training in February 2013\u2014and has conducted  19 training sessions and seminars for field office senior management  personnel. According to DHS component and TEOAF officials, both HSI  and USSS training were funded by and provided in coordination with  TEOAF. Officials from all six HSI and USSS field offices we contacted  stated that the training provided useful information on equitable sharing  requirements and processes.

TEOAF requires  high-value packages (forfeitures of $1 million or more) to include DHS  component work hours and justifications for material deviations from work  hour calculated percentages due to qualitative factors. This is not,  however, required of low-value packages (forfeitures under $1 million).  Accordingly, 31 of the 40 low-value equitable sharing packages that we  reviewed were missing key information to support the basis for final  sharing percentages. Specifically, these 31 packages did not include one  or more of the following: DHS component work hours, support for how  qualitative factors were applied to make determinations, and the rationale  for changes made to sharing percentages recommended by the field  offices.value packages that we reviewed were fully supported by the information  in the package.", "In contrast, the equitable sharing determinations in the 5 high- Component work hours: Treasury\u2019s guidance states that equitable  sharing determinations are normally determined by comparing the  number of investigative hours expended by state, local, and other  requesting agencies and the lead component through the completion of  the forfeiture.

According to documents in the equitable sharing determination  package, the state police expended an estimated 671 work hours on the case and HSI  expended 670, resulting in a 50 percent share of forfeiture proceeds for the state police.", "State and local agency work hours were included in all 40 low-value  equitable sharing packages that we reviewed. HSI included its own work  hours in all 26 low-value HSI packages that we reviewed, but USSS and  Border Patrol did not include this information in any of their packages.  Specifically, all 10 USSS and 4 Border Patrol packages that we reviewed  did not include lead component work hours or the total work hours  contributed by all agencies involved in the case. USSS\u2019s asset forfeiture  liaison stated that this information was not included because the lead  USSS component does not receive equitable sharing funds and the  information is not explicitly required on the equitable sharing decision  form. This official said, however, that he has directed field offices to  include component work hours in equitable sharing decision forms  starting in fiscal year 2014. We reviewed an additional USSS equitable  sharing package that was approved by headquarters in fiscal year 2014  and found that the USSS field office included its work hours. Border  Patrol\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Liaison said that because most of the  component\u2019s seizures occur at checkpoints or while agents are on  patrols\u2014unlike HSI and USSS seizures, which result primarily from  investigations\u2014work hours can be difficult to measure and are not always  used to make equitable sharing determinations. However, state and  local agency work hours were included in all 4 Border Patrol equitable  sharing packages that we reviewed. Border Patrol\u2019s Asset Forfeiture  Liaison stated that it would be useful to include Border Patrol work hours  when possible if they are measured consistently across all participating  agencies. In the absence of documented component work hours, we  could not determine what proportion of total work hours components  contributed to the case and how deciding authorities verified whether  equitable sharing determinations were calculated in accordance with  Treasury\u2019s guidance.", "Application of qualitative factors: All 31 low-value packages we  reviewed that did not include full support for sharing determinations did  not contain clear documentation of how qualitative factors were used to  adjust sharing determinations. Treasury\u2019s guidance directs deciding  officials to consider additional factors when the work hours do not  adequately reflect the degree of agency participation in the investigation.  These factors could include, for example, originating the information  leading to the seizure or providing unique and indispensable assistance.  The decision forms in the packages that we reviewed generally contained  narratives that summarized what each agency contributed to the case,  which included interviewing suspects, executing search warrants,  conducting surveillance, providing a drug-sniffing canine, and a range of  other investigative support. However, the forms did not identify which  specific agency contributions were used to adjust percentages and what  adjustments were made. For example, in 1 HSI equitable sharing  package we reviewed, two police departments contributed the same  number of work hours, but one received a 10 percent larger share than  the other, resulting in a difference of about $48,000 in forfeiture proceeds.  Both departments indicated on their application forms that they provided  unique or indispensable assistance and originated the information leading  to the seizure. HSI\u2019s equitable sharing decision form for this package  includes a summary of how each police department participated in the  investigation, such as assisting in undercover operations, interviews, and  search and surveillance, but does not explicitly state which specific  contribution or contributions were used to adjust percentages or why one  agency\u2019s contribution was valued more than the other\u2019s.", "HSI\u2019s January 2013 guidance memorandum states that when work hours  do not adequately reflect the degree of agency participation, it is critical  that the narratives contained in the documents submitted to the Asset  Forfeiture Unit in headquarters specifically detail the participation of all  agencies involved. This helps to ensure that agency contributions  outside of work hours are documented in the equitable sharing packages,  but does not require field offices to identify which qualitative factors or  contributions were used to adjust percentages and how these factors  were applied. Moreover, in USSS and Border Patrol equitable sharing  packages where component work hours were not documented, it was not  possible to determine if adjustments were made to sharing percentages  based on qualitative factors. Border Patrol\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Liaison  stated that Border Patrol could document this information if required.  USSS\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Liaison said that it would be administratively  burdensome to specify which, if any, qualitative factors were used to  adjust percentages and how they were applied because USSS primarily  relies on field office staff to process equitable sharing requests as  collateral duties, in addition to their other responsibilities. However,  agency contributions are generally already included in the decision form  narratives and specifying which contribution was used to adjust  percentages could be done by including a short sentence or annotation.  For example, in a USSS high-value package that we reviewed, TEOAF  documented that a state agency\u2019s percentages were adjusted upward  because the agency conducted all key interviews in the investigation.  Components could document the same kind of information for low-value  packages with minimal additional narrative. Documenting the rationale for  making adjustments to sharing percentages based on qualitative factors  could improve transparency for approving authorities and officials  overseeing equitable sharing regarding how and why adjustments are  made when work hours alone do not fully reflect the degree of agency  participation in the investigation. Such documentation could also help  these officials better assess the extent to which qualitative factors were  applied appropriately and consistently in determinations.", "Component headquarters changes to sharing percentages: USSS  and HSI headquarters made changes to sharing percentages in 8 of the  31 low-value packages we reviewed that did not include full support for  determinations, and in all 8 of these instances, the reasons for the  changes were not documented. USSS and HSI officials noted that they  contact field office staff to discuss any changes, but that the reasons for  the changes are generally not included in the packages submitted to  TEOAF. USSS headquarters made changes to sharing percentages  recommended by field offices in 6 of the 10 USSS packages that we  reviewed. For example, in 1 package, USSS headquarters decreased a  state agency\u2019s share from 60 to 40 percent\u2014resulting in a difference of  about $28,400\u2014but the decision form did not note why the change was  made. USSS\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Liaison stated that these changes are  primarily due to headquarters taking into account additional work that  USSS agents perform to identify victims of financial crimes after the field  offices submit the decision forms to headquarters. The liaison said that  these additional work hours and resources are not reflected in the field  office\u2019s recommended sharing percentages or on the decision forms.  According to the USSS liaison, headquarters has only one other official  who reviews and approves equitable sharing determinations, and  documenting the rationale for changes to sharing percentages would  require additional work. However, he noted that including a short  annotation would be feasible. HSI officials stated that the reasons for  headquarters\u2019 changes to field office sharing percentages are generally  documented in HSI review forms and e-mail correspondence with the field  and provided examples of such documentation. However, this support is  not included in the packages that HSI submits to TEOAF for review and  payment authorization. HSI officials said that they could include this   Documenting the rationale for  information if requested by TEOAF.changes to sharing percentages recommended by the field\u2014by, for  example, including a short sentence or annotation\u2014could help enhance  transparency regarding why changes were made and how final sharing  percentages were determined.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  controls are to provide reasonable assurance for compliance with laws  and regulations and help ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried  out, among other things. To achieve these objectives, it states that  transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and  value to management in controlling operations and making decisions.  This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or event  from the initiation and authorization through its final classification in  summary records. In addition, internal control standards state that all  transactions and other significant events need to be clearly documented,  and the documentation should be readily available for examination. In the  absence of consistently documenting component work hours, how  qualitative factors are applied to adjust sharing percentages, and the  reasons for headquarters\u2019 changes to percentages, it is unclear how  equitable sharing deciding authorities evaluated the nature and value of  the contributions of each of the agencies involved in the investigation.  TEOAF officials said that clearly documenting the basis for equitable  sharing determinations in low-value packages would be helpful for  approving officials. This is important because, according to TEOAF  officials, equitable sharing determinations have grown more complex in  recent years as a result of the increase in large investigations that involve  multiple agencies. These officials said that it would be feasible for  TEOAF\u2014as the manager of the TFF and the equitable sharing program\u2014 to issue a memorandum to DHS components to include additional  information in equitable sharing packages and work with components as  needed to implement it. Establishing a mechanism to ensure that the  basis for low-value equitable sharing determinations is fully documented  by all DHS components responsible for making determinations could  enhance the transparency of decision making and help DHS components  and TEOAF better ensure that equitable sharing decisions are made in  compliance with Treasury\u2019s guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance on Qualitative Factors", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has established general guidance on the qualitative factors to  consider if work hours do not adequately reflect the degree of agency  participation in the investigation.

For example, the guidance states that unique  and indispensable assistance entails an agency providing support only it  can provide, such as seizing assets in a jurisdiction hundreds of miles  from where the investigation is being conducted or providing an informant  who has access to documents that are essential to securing a conviction.  The guidance does not provide specific information on how to apply these  examples to adjust sharing percentages. Treasury is in the process of  revising its guidance, and as of January 2014, the draft guidance  contained a more abbreviated discussion of qualitative factors, with two  examples and less detail regarding the contributions to consider. For  example, the draft guidance does not provide examples of contributions  that could be considered unique or indispensable assistance. TEOAF  officials stated that the revised guidance is being finalized and indicated  that they do not plan to include more information on qualitative factors in  the guidance. The office expects to issue the guidance in 2014, but did  not have a more specific time frame, in part because the guidance was  undergoing an interagency review. HSI\u2019s January 2013 memorandum  includes additional guidance on qualitative factors, such as clarifying what  types of activities are considered unique and indispensable assistance.  USSS and Border Patrol have not issued similar guidance.", "TEOAF and DHS component officials stated that guidance on qualitative  factors is general because equitable sharing determinations are made on  a case-by-case basis and the facts and circumstances of each case must  be considered in totality when making adjustments to sharing  percentages. Accordingly, DHS component field office and headquarters  officials said that they use their judgment and experience when  determining if and how qualitative factors should be applied in making  equitable sharing decisions. However, officials from six of the nine field  offices we interviewed across all DHS components that conduct equitable  sharing stated that additional guidance on qualitative factors would be  useful. Specifically, these officials said that additional examples of factors,  such as what constitutes extraordinary expenses; clarification of what is  considered unique and indispensible assistance; guidance on how to  apply factors, including more information on how to adjust percentages  based on the type and significance of agency contributions; or illustrations  of how factors were applied in real-world cases would be helpful for  making equitable sharing determinations. Officials from the remaining  three field offices said that additional guidance was not needed because  sharing recommendations are made in consultation with requesting  agencies or they can contact component headquarters to discuss any  questions about qualitative factors. Nonetheless, headquarters officials  from all three DHS components that conduct equitable sharing stated that  additional guidance could help ensure a more consistent understanding of  these factors among headquarters and field offices. For example, HSI  officials said that adjustments related to qualitative factors are one of the  reasons for headquarters changes to sharing percentages recommended  by field offices. These officials noted that any additional guidance should  continue to allow for determinations to be based on the facts and  circumstances of each case.", "Officials from all nine state and local law enforcement agencies with  whom we spoke were generally satisfied with the equitable shares that  they received. These officials noted that they typically do not have  visibility over the equitable sharing process after they have submitted  their applications. In addition, the equitable sharing determinations we  reviewed indicate that state and local agencies may not have a clear  understanding of how some qualitative factors are defined and  considered. For example, in 12 of the 15 low-value packages we  reviewed where an agency indicated on its application form that it  incurred extraordinary expenses during the investigation, the expenses  were not clearly described in the narrative. In 1 equitable sharing package  we reviewed for a currency-smuggling case, a police department checked  that it had incurred extraordinary expenses and stated that its officer had  conducted surveillance, assisted in a search of a suspect\u2019s house, and  participated in the interview of two individuals who were detained as part  of the investigation. However, we could not determine how these activities  constituted extraordinary expenses. Treasury\u2019s guidance does not include  incurring extraordinary expenses as an example of a qualitative factor,  despite this factor being included in the equitable sharing application. In  addition, the application includes two other factors to consider when  assessing agency contributions that are not included in Treasury\u2019s  guidance. Providing guidance on qualitative factors that are listed on the  application form, including what they entail and how to apply them, could  help officials from state and local agencies, as well as DHS components,  have a better and more consistent understanding of these factors.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for  significant events to be clearly documented in directives, policies, or  manuals to help ensure operations are carried out as intended. While  we recognize the subjective nature of evaluating agency contributions  based on the facts and circumstances of each case, additional guidance  on qualitative factors could help better ensure consistency with which  these factors are applied across cases.

However, HSI and USSS  officials have taken steps to address the deficiencies we found in our  analysis of these packages. Specifically, the guidance requires that state  and local law enforcement agencies submit equitable sharing applications  within 60 days after the seizure, and if this deadline is not met, agencies  need to submit a written request stating the reasons for the late  submission in order for components to waive the requirement. TEOAF  officials said that this requirement is in place to ensure that components  receive all sharing requests in a timely manner and are aware of all  agency contributions before determining equitable shares. HSI and USSS  headquarters officials stated that if a state or local agency submitted a  request for a waiver, they would include it in the package provided to  TEOAF. However, requests for waivers were not included in 8 of the 9  HSI and USSS packages we reviewed where an agency did not meet the  60-day deadline. HSI headquarters officials stated that they began  enforcing the waiver requirement in January 2013. The officials said that  this requirement may take some time to fully implement. Specifically,  because of the potential lengthy forfeiture process, equitable sharing  determinations processed after January 2013 may be from applications  that were submitted to field offices over a year earlier. USSS\u2019s Asset  Forfeiture Liaison stated that in fiscal year 2013, USSS\u2019s asset forfeiture  system was programmed to automatically notify field offices when  equitable sharing applications are due to meet the 60-day requirement  and provided an example of such a notice.", "In addition, Treasury\u2019s guidance specifies that final determination of  sharing percentages cannot be made until after assets have been  forfeited. TEOAF officials said that this requirement is in place so that  state and local agencies do not expect equitable shares before forfeitures  are finalized, because in some cases, funds may not be available for  sharing. However, USSS headquarters officials approved sharing  determinations in 5 of the 10 low-value USSS equitable sharing packages  we reviewed before assets were forfeited. These 5 packages were all  approved by headquarters in 2011.
