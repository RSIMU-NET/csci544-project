These certificates and approvals, which FAA bases on its interpretation of federal standards, indicate that such things as new aircraft, the design and production of aircraft parts and equipment, and new air operators are safe for use in the national airspace system. Past studies and industry spokespersons assert that FAA's interpretations produce variation in its decisions and inefficiencies that adversely affect the industry. GAO was asked to examine the (1) extent of variation in FAA's interpretation of standards for certification and approval decisions and (2) views of key stakeholders and experts on how well these processes work. To perform the study, GAO reviewed industry studies and reports and FAA documents and processes; convened a panel of aviation experts; and interviewed officials from various industry sectors, senior FAA officials, and unions representing FAA staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Studies, stakeholders, and experts indicated that variation in FAA's interpretation of standards for certification and approval decisions is a long-standing issue, but GAO found no evidence that quantified the extent of the problem in the industry as a whole. Ten of the 13 industry group and company officials GAO interviewed said that they or members of their organization had experienced variation in FAA certification and approval decisions on similar submissions. In addition, experts on GAO's panel, who discussed and then ranked problems with FAA's certification and approval processes, ranked inconsistent interpretation of regulations, which can lead to variation in decisions, as the first and second most significant problem, respectively, with these processes for FAA's Flight Standards Service (which issues certificates and approvals for individuals and entities to operate in the national airspace system) and Aircraft Certification Service (which issues approvals to the designers and manufacturers of aircraft and aircraft parts and equipment). According to industry stakeholders, variation in FAA's interpretation of standards for certification and approval decisions is a result of factors related to performance-based regulations, which allow for multiple avenues of compliance, and the use of professional judgment by FAA staff and can result in delays and higher costs. Industry stakeholders and experts generally agreed that FAA's certification and approval processes contribute to aviation safety and work well most of the time, but negative experiences have led to costly delays for the industry. Industry stakeholders have also raised concerns about the effects of process inefficiencies on the implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)--the transformation of the U.S. national airspace system from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management. They said that the processes take too long and impose costs that discourage aircraft operators from investing in NextGen equipment. FAA has taken actions to improve the certification and approval processes, including hiring additional inspectors and engineers and increasing the use of designees and delegated organizations--private persons and entities authorized to carry out many certification activities. Additionally, FAA is working to ensure that its processes are being followed and improved through a quality management system, which provides a mechanism for stakeholders to appeal FAA decisions. However, FAA does not know whether its actions under the quality management system are achieving the intended goals of reducing inconsistencies and increasing consistency and fairness in the agency's application of regulations and policies because FAA does not have outcome-based performance measures and a continuous evaluative process that would allow it to determine progress toward these goals. Without ongoing information on results, FAA managers do not know if their actions are having the intended effects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FAA develop a continuous evaluative process with measurable performance goals to determine the effectiveness of the agency's actions to improve its certification and approval processes.

According to FAA, the field  offices are also assisted by a headquarters-based office that provides  experts on specific aircraft and airlines. Accepted projects are processed  on a first-in, first-out basis within each office once FAA determines that it  has the resources to oversee an additional new certificate holder. Flight  Standards issued 599 air operator and air agency certificates in fiscal year  2009.

Inconsistent or  variant FAA interpretations have been noted in studies published over the  last 14 years. A 1996 study by Booz Allen & Hamilton, conducted at the  request of the FAA Administrator to assess challenges to the agency\u2019s  regulatory and certification practices, reported that, for air carriers and  other operators, the agency\u2019s regulations are often ambiguous; subject to  variation in interpretation by FAA inspectors, supervisors, and policy  managers; and in need of simplification and consistent implementation.

While FAA has put measures in place since these two reports appeared, a  2008 Independent Review Team, which was commissioned by the  Secretary of Transportation to assess FAA\u2019s safety culture and approach to  safety management, found that a wide degree of variation in \u201cregulatory  ideology\u201d among FAA staff continues to create the likelihood of wide  variation in decisions within and among field offices.", "Industry officials and experts representing a broad range of large and  small aviation businesses told us that variation in interpretation and  subsequent decisions occurs in both Aircraft Certification and Flight  Standards, but we found no evidence that quantified the extent of the  problem in the industry as a whole.

For example, an official from one air carrier told us  that variation in decisions occurs regularly when obtaining approvals from  Flight Standards district offices, especially when dealing with inspectors  who are newly hired or replacing a previous inspector. He explained that  new inspectors often task air carriers to make changes to previously  obtained minimum equipment lists or conformity approvals for an  aircraft. The official further noted that inspector assignments often  change for reasons such as transfers, promotions, or retirement and that  four different principal operations inspectors were assigned to his  company during the past 18 months.", "Experts on our panel and most industry officials we interviewed indicated  that, though variation in decisions is a long-standing, widespread problem,  it has rarely led to serious certification and approval process problems.  Experts on our panel generally noted that serious problems with the  certification and approval processes occur less than 10 percent of the  time. However, when we asked them to rank certification and approval  process problems we summarized from their discussion, they chose  inconsistent interpretation of regulations, which can lead to variation in  decisions, as the most significant problem for Flight Standards and as the  second most significant problem for Aircraft Certification. Panelists\u2019  concerns about variation in decisions included instances in which  approvals are reevaluated and sometimes revised or revoked in FAA  jurisdictions other than those in which they were originally granted.  Industry officials we interviewed, though most had experienced it, did not  mention the frequency with which variation in decisions occurred.

FAA uses performance- based regulations, which identify a desired outcome and are flexible about  how the outcome is achieved. For example, performance-based  regulations on aircraft braking would establish minimum braking  distances for aircraft but would not call for a particular material in the  brake pads or a specific braking system design. According to officials in  FAA\u2019s rulemaking office, about 20 percent of FAA\u2019s regulations are  performance-based. Performance-based regulations, which are issued  governmentwide, provide a number of benefits, according to literature on  the regulatory process. By focusing on outcomes, for example,  performance-based regulations give firms flexibility in achieving the stated  level of performance; such regulations can accommodate technological  change in ways that prescriptive regulations that focus on a specific  technology generally cannot. For those certifications and approvals that  relate to performance-based regulations, variation in decisions is a  consequence of such regulations, according to one air carrier, since  performance-based regulations allow the applicant multiple avenues to  comply with regulations and broader discretion by FAA staff in making  certification and approval decisions. According to senior FAA officials,  performance-based regulations allow innovation and flexibility while  setting a specific safety standard. The officials added that the benefits of  performance-based regulations outweigh the potential for erroneous  interpretation by an individual inspector or engineer. While agreeing with  this statement, a panel member pointed out that the potential for  erroneous interpretation also entails a risk of inconsistent decisions.", "In addition, FAA oversees a large, diverse industry, and its certification  and approval processes rely, in part, on FAA staffs\u2019 exercise of  professional judgment in the unique situations they encounter. In the  opinion of senior FAA officials, some differences among inspectors may  be due to situation-specific factors that industry stakeholders may not be  aware of.

While  industry stakeholders indicated that negative experiences occur in  dealings with both Aircraft Certification and Flight Standards, experts on  our panel noted that negative experiences are more likely to occur with  Flight Standards than with Aircraft Certification. For example, three  experts noted that, overall, industry\u2019s experience in obtaining  certifications and approvals from Flight Standards has been negative or  very negative, while no experts thought industry\u2019s experience with Aircraft  Certification was negative. The panelists indicated that negative  experiences occur during the processing of certifications and approvals  and as applicants wait for FAA resources to become available to  commence their certification or approval projects. For example, an  aviation industry representative reported that his company incurred a  delay of over 5 years and millions of dollars in costs when it attempted to  obtain approvals from Aircraft Certification and Flight Standards field  offices. Another industry representative indicated that it abandoned an  effort to obtain an operating certification after spending $1.2 million and  never receiving an explanation from FAA as to why the company\u2019s  application was stalled. One panelist indicated that the negative  experiences focus more on administrative aspects of the certification and  approval processes and not on safety-related items.", "The processing of original certifications and approvals in Aircraft  Certification and Flight Standards involves progressing through a schedule  of steps or phases. Responsibilities of both FAA and the applicant are  delineated. However, even with this framework in place, industry  stakeholders noted that the time it takes to obtain certifications and  approvals can differ from one FAA field office to another because of  differences in office resources and expertise. In some cases, delays may be  avoided when FAA directs the applicant to apply at a different field office.", "Nevertheless, applicants who must apply to offices with fewer resources  can experience costly delays in obtaining certifications or approvals.", "Delays also occur when FAA wait-lists certification submissions because it  does not have the resources to begin work on them. Aircraft Certification  meets weekly to review certification project submissions. If it determines  that a submission is to be wait-listed, the applicant is sent a 90-day delay  letter and if, after the initial 90 days, the submission is still wait-listed, the  applicant is sent another letter. Additionally, Aircraft Certification staff  and managers periodically contact applicants to advise them of the status  of their submissions. Flight Standards also notifies applicants when their  certification submissions are wait-listed, and Flight Standards staff are  encouraged to communicate with applicants regularly about the status of  their submissions. However, according to an FAA notice, staff are advised  not to provide an estimate of when an applicant\u2019s submission might be  processed. While Aircraft Certification tracks in a national database how  long individual submissions are wait-listed, Flight Standards does not.  Without data on how long submissions are wait-listed, Flight Standards  cannot assess the extent of wait-listing delays or reallocate resources to  better meet demand. Further, industry stakeholders face uncertainty with  respect to any plans or investments that depend on obtaining a certificate  in a timely manner.", "Industry stakeholders have also raised concerns about the effects of  inefficiencies in the certification and approval processes on the  implementation of NextGen. As NextGen progresses, operators will need  to install additional equipment on their aircraft to take full advantage of  NextGen capabilities, and FAA\u2019s certification and approval workload is  likely to increase substantially. According to our October 2009 testimony  on NextGen, airlines and manufacturers said that FAA\u2019s certification  processes take too long and impose costs on industry that discourage  them from investing in NextGen equipment. We reported that this  inefficiency in FAA\u2019s processes constitutes a challenge to delivering  NextGen benefits to stakeholders and that streamlining FAA\u2019s processes  will be essential for the timely implementation of NextGen. FAA is  working to address the certification issues that may impede the adoption  and acceleration of NextGen capabilities. Flight Standards has identified  NextGen-dedicated staff in each of its regional offices to support the  review and approval of NextGen capabilities within each region. Aircraft  Certification has created a team of experts from different offices to  coordinate NextGen approvals and identify specialists in Aircraft  Certification offices with significant NextGen activity. FAA also plans a  number of other actions to facilitate the certification and approval of  NextGen-related technology, including new procedures and criteria for  prioritizing certifications, updating policy and guidance, developing  additional communication mechanisms, and developing training for  inspectors and engineers. Since many of these actions have either just  been implemented or have not yet been completed, it is too early to tell  whether they will increase the efficiency of FAA\u2019s certification and  approval processes and reduce unanticipated delays and costs for the  industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Stakeholders and Experts Told Us That the Efficiency of FAA\u2019s Processes Is Hampered by Several Shortcomings; FAA Has Taken Some Actions to Remedy Them", "paragraphs": ["Industry stakeholders also noted that the efficiency of the certification and  approval processes was hampered by a lack of sufficient staff resources to  carry out certifications and approvals and a lack of effective  communication mechanisms for explaining the intent of the regulations to  both FAA staff and industry. The stakeholders said that these  inefficiencies have resulted in costly delays for them.", "Stakeholders and experts said that, at some FAA offices, delays in  obtaining certifications and approvals were due to heavy staff workloads,  a lack of staff, or a lack of staff with the appropriate expertise. Staff and  managers at one FAA field office told us that in the past a lack of staff had  contributed to delays in completing certifications. The relative priority of  certifications and approvals within FAA\u2019s overall workload also affects the  availability of staff to process certifications and approvals. According to  FAA, its highest priority is overseeing the continued operational safety of  the people and products already operating within the national airspace  system, but the same staff who provide this oversight are also tasked  with the lower-priority task of processing new certifications and  approvals. Additionally, Flight Standards field staff we contacted said that  the system under which their pay grades are established and maintained  provides a disincentive for inspectors to perform certification work  because the system allocates no credit toward retention of their pay  grades for doing certification work. Flight Standards headquarters officials  pointed out that there is an incentive for field office inspectors to perform  initial certifications because once certificated the new entities add points  to an inspector\u2019s complexity calculation, which is used to determine his or  her pay grade.", "FAA has addressed staff resource issues by increasing the number of  inspectors and engineers. Over the past 3 years, FAA has steadily  increased its hiring of Aircraft Certification engineers and Flight Standards  inspectors, thereby reducing the risk of certification delays. According to  agency data, FAA\u2019s hiring efforts since fiscal year 2007 have resulted in an  8.8 percent increase in the number of Aircraft Certification engineers and  a 9.4 percent increase in the number of Flight Standards inspectors on  board. FAA hired 106 engineers in Aircraft Certification and 696 inspectors  in Flight Standards from the beginning of fiscal year 2007 to March 15,  2010. FAA also hired 89 inspectors in Aircraft Certification from fiscal year  2007 through August 2010. In addition, Flight Standards headquarters  staff are available to assist field staff with the certification of part 121 air  carriers\u2014an average of 35 of these staff were available for this assistance  annually from 2005 through 2009, and they helped with 16 certification  projects.", "Furthermore, FAA delegates many certification activities to individuals  and organizations (called designees) to better leverage its resources. As  we previously reported, FAA\u2019s designees perform more than 90 percent of  FAA\u2019s certification activities. We have reported that designees generally  conduct routine certification functions, such as approvals of aircraft  technologies that the agency and designees already have experience with,  allowing FAA staff to focus on new and complex aircraft designs or design  changes. Panelists ranked the expanded use of designees second and  fifth, respectively, among actions that we summarized from their  discussions that would have the most positive impact on improving  Aircraft Certification\u2019s and Flight Standards\u2019 certification and approval  processes. FAA is increasing organizational delegations under its  organization designation authorization (ODA) program and expects the  ODA program will allow more effective use of its resources over time.", "Stakeholders pointed to a lack of effective communication mechanisms as  another problem with the certification and approval processes, especially  deficiencies in the guidance FAA issues and a lack of additional  communication mechanisms for sharing information on the interpretation  of regulations. Stakeholders said that the lack of effective communication  mechanisms can lead to costly delays when, for example, methods or  guidance for complying with regulations is not clear. Stakeholders and  experts had several issues with the FAA guidance that interprets the  regulations and provides supplemental information to the industry.  Stakeholders said there are sometimes discrepancies between the  guidance and the regulations. For example, one stakeholder reported  informing an FAA training course instructor that a particular piece of  guidance contradicted the regulations. The instructor agreed that the  contradiction existed but told the stakeholder that FAA teaches to the  guidance, not the regulations. One employee group representing some  FAA inspectors was concerned that not all guidance has been included in  an online system that FAA has established to consolidate regulations,  policy, and guidance. FAA acknowledged that it is working to further  standardize and simplify the online guidance in the Flight Standards  information management system.", "Stakeholders also identified a lack of opportunities for sharing information  about the interpretation of regulations and guidance. An industry expert  noted that FAA lacks a culture that fosters communication and discussion  among peer groups. Moreover, an industry group with over 300 aviation  company members suggested that FAA should support and promote more  agencywide and industrywide information sharing in less formal, less  structured ways to enhance communication. Finally, according to an  official of an employee group representing some FAA inspectors, because  their workloads tend to be heavy, inspectors are less able to communicate  with the companies they oversee, and the reduced level of communication  contributes to variation in the interpretation of regulations. FAA officials  disagreed with these assertions and indicated that FAA staff participate in  numerous committees and conferences, share methods of compliance in  technical areas via forums with stakeholders, and communicate  resolutions to problems in various formats, such as by placing legal  decisions online."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Taken Other Actions That Might Address Process Shortcomings but Lacks Performance Data to Assess the Actions\u2019 Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Other FAA actions could identify and potentially address some of the  shortcomings in the agency\u2019s certification and approval processes as  follows:  In 2004, FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety introduced QMS, which is  intended to ensure that processes are being followed and improved and to  provide a methodology to standardize processes. QMS is expected to help  ensure that processes are followed by providing a means for staff to report  nonconformance with FAA procedures or processes and was established  as part of the office\u2019s effort to achieve certification by the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). Any employee can submit a  report and check the status of an issue that has been reported. From  October 2008 to March 2009, approximately 900 reports were submitted,  and 46 internal audits were completed. For example, in July 2009, an FAA  staffer noted that a required paragraph on aging aircraft inspection and  records review was missing from a certificate holder\u2019s operations  specifications. The issue was resolved and closed in August 2009 when  the missing paragraph was issued to the certificate holder. Some FAA staff  told us that QMS has helped improve the processes because it requires  management action to respond to report submissions.", "To provide industry stakeholders with a mechanism for appealing  certification and other decisions, the Office of Aviation Safety  implemented the Consistency and Standardization Initiative (CSI) in  2004. Appeals must begin at the field office level and can eventually be  taken to FAA headquarters. CSI requires that FAA staff document their  safety decisions and that stakeholders support their positions with specific  documentation. Within Aircraft Certification and Flight Standards, CSI  cases at each appeal level are expected to be processed within 30 working  days. The total length of the CSI process depends on how many levels of  appeal the stakeholder chooses. Aircraft Certification has had over 20 CSI  cases, and Flight Standards has had over 300. Most CSI cases in Aircraft  Certification involved clarification of a policy or an approved means of  complying with a regulation, while most of those submitted to Flight  Standards involved policy or method clarification, as well as scheduling  issues, such as delays in addressing a stakeholder\u2019s certification, approval,  or other issue. The large discrepancy between the number of cases filed  for the two services, according to FAA officials, may be due to the fact that  Aircraft Certification decisions are the result of highly interactive,  deliberative processes, which are not typical in granting approvals in  Flight Standards, where an inspector might find the need to hand down a  decision without prolonged discussion or deliberation. Stakeholders told  us that CSI lacks agencywide buy-in and can leave stakeholders who use  the program potentially open to retribution from FAA staff. However,  others noted that CSI is beneficial because it requires industry  stakeholders to use the regulations as a basis for their complaints, which  often leads to resolution. According to one of our panelists,  inconsistencies occur when FAA does not start with the regulations as the  basis for decisions.", "Although QMS and CSI are positive steps toward identifying ways to make  the certification and approval processes more efficient, FAA does not  know whether the programs are achieving their stated goals because it has  not established performance measures for determining program  accomplishments. One of the goals for QMS is to reduce inconsistencies  and increase standardization. A QMS database documents the reports  submitted and, through information in these reports, FAA says it has  identified instances of nonconformance and initiated corrective action to  prevent recurrence; revised orders to ensure they are consistent with  actual practice; and improved its processes to collect feedback from  stakeholders and take action on trends. However, FAA does not know  whether its actions have reduced inconsistencies because its measures  describe the agency\u2019s output\u2014for example, number of audits conducted\u2014 rather than any outcomes related to reductions in process inconsistencies.  FAA officials described CSI goals as promoting early resolution of  disagreements and consistency and fairness in applying FAA regulations  and policies. They provided us with data on the number of CSI cases in  both Aircraft Certification and Flight Standards, the types of complaints,  and the percentage of resolutions that upheld FAA\u2019s original decision, but  as with the overall QMS program, we could find no evidence that FAA has  instituted CSI performance measures that would allow it to determine  progress toward program outcomes, such as consistency and fairness in  applying regulations and policies. Outcome-based performance measures  would also allow QMS and CSI program managers to determine where to  better target program resources to improve performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FAA has taken actions to address variation in decisions and inefficiency in  its certification and approval processes, although the agency does not  have outcome-based performance measures and a continuous evaluative  process to determine if these actions are having their intended effects.  Because the number of certification and approval applications is likely to  increase for NextGen technologies, achieving more efficiency in these  processes will help FAA better manage this increased workload, as well as  its current workload. In addition, while both Aircraft Certification and  Flight Standards notify applicants whether resources are available to begin  their projects, Flight Standards does not monitor how long applicants are  wait-listed and is therefore unaware how long projects are wait-listed and  unable to reallocate resources to better meet demand for certification  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that FAA actions contribute to more consistent decisions and  more efficient certification and approval processes, we recommend that  the Secretary of Transportation direct the Administrator of FAA to take  the following two actions:", "Determine the effectiveness of actions to improve the certification and  approval processes by developing a continuous evaluative process and use  it to create measurable performance goals for the actions, track  performance toward those goals, and determine appropriate process  changes.
