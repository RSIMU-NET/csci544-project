For a selected few projects, Treasury and the U.S. Agency for International Development analyze in more depth a proposal's potential environmental and social impacts. Both agencies learn about many such projects through regular interaction with nongovernmental organizations. Time constraints limit the U.S. government's ability to identify environmental and social concerns associated with World Bank Group projects before a vote on the proposal, and projects with potentially significant adverse impacts proceed with or without U.S. government support. The compressed review time frame makes it difficult for U.S. officials to examine proposal documentation and solicit information from knowledgeable parties. In addition, by the time of the vote, a project is often already in its final design stage or even under construction, which limits U.S. agencies' ability to identify ways to mitigate the concerns. Furthermore, proposals with potentially significant adverse impacts proceed with or without U.S. government support. The board consistently approves proposals that lack U.S. support; between January 2004 and May 2008, all 34 of the proposals the United States did not support because they did not meet legislative requirements were still approved by the board.

Critics of the World Bank Group, as well as oversight entities  within the World Bank Group, have claimed that many of these projects  have harmed the environment and the local population. For example,  some road projects have led to deforestation caused by clear-cutting, and  artificial lakes created by large dam projects have forced thousands of  local inhabitants to leave their homes and communities and resettle  elsewhere. In 1989, the World Bank established policies that require  project sponsors to prepare assessments that would identify  environmental and social impacts associated with the projects it finances.  The World Bank Group also established policies guiding the disclosure of  this information to the public. However, concerns persist about the  implementation of these policies as well as the quality of the  environmental assessments associated with the projects.

It requires, in part, that the U.S. government review  proposed World Bank Group and other multilateral development bank- funded projects with the potential for such impacts. To do so, U.S.  government agencies examine project-specific environmental assessments  prior to project approval and ensure that these assessments were made  available to the public by the project sponsors at least 120 days before the  project is voted on by the World Bank Group Board of Directors. The  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) instructs the U.S. Executive  Director on the U.S. position for each proposed project based on its  review; the legislation specifically precludes the U.S. Executive Director  from supporting projects that do not meet the 120-day public disclosure  requirement.", "For this report, you asked us to assess (1) how U.S. agencies implement  their legislative requirements to review the potential environmental and  social concerns associated with proposed World Bank Group projects, and  (2) agencies\u2019 ability to identify and address these concerns.

The  overall purpose of the legislation is to ensure that U.S. assistance to  multilateral development banks promotes sustainable use of natural  resources and the protection of the environment, public health, and the  status of indigenous people in developing countries. In 1989, Congress  amended Title XIII to include Section 1307, commonly referred to as the  Pelosi Amendment. The Pelosi Amendment directly affects whether the  U.S. government will support a proposed project. It directs the U.S.  government to ensure that a proposed project with potentially significant  negative impacts meets certain requirements, such as making publicly  available an assessment of the project\u2019s environmental impact 120 days  before the World Bank Group\u2019s Board of Directors votes on the project. If  the World Bank Group\u2019s project sponsor does not make the assessment or  a summary of the assessment publicly available within this time frame, the  law instructs the U.S. government not to vote in favor of the proposal. The  law also requires that the assessment include an analysis of the project\u2019s  cumulative and associated impacts, as well as alternatives to the proposed  project. As a result of the Pelosi Amendment, the World Bank Group and  other major multilateral development banks began requiring project  sponsors to prepare environmental impact assessments and make them  available to affected groups, according to representatives from U.S.  government agencies and nongovernmental organizations, as well as a  1998 U.S. Congressional Research Service report determining the impact  of the Pelosi Amendment.", "Both the Pelosi Amendment and other sections of Title XIII specify the  responsibilities of several U.S. agencies in monitoring proposed  multilateral development bank projects with the potential for significant  environmental and social impacts.

Since the  amendment does not require Treasury to review proposals to determine if  they meet the World Bank Group\u2019s environmental and social safeguard  policies, Treasury generally does not evaluate proposals for compliance  with these policies. Treasury officials stated that they do not do this  because the multilateral development banks have their own procedures,  staff, and accountability mechanisms for ensuring compliance with bank  policies. Treasury officials noted that they occasionally may closely review  the analysis contained in the environmental assessment or other project  documentation if they have concerns about the environmental and social  impact of the project.

Although the board must approve the proposal as a whole, future sub- projects\u2014some of which could have significant adverse impacts\u2014are not  subject to board approval. Since the board does not vote on subprojects,  the Pelosi Amendment does not require Treasury to review them. Instead,  Treasury reviews these types of proposals on a case-by-case basis.

USAID is also  required to ensure that investigations of proposed projects with  \u201csubstantial adverse impacts\u201d are conducted. Because the law contains no  prescriptive requirements for how to ensure that investigations of projects  with likely substantial adverse impacts are conducted, USAID has taken  various approaches to fulfilling this requirement. In previous years, the  agency conducted a brief annual review of a large number of proposed  projects; in contrast, its current approach is to conduct a thorough  analysis of a much smaller number of proposed projects.

To perform its  analyses, USAID employs a technical expert, who evaluates proposals\u2019  environmental and social impacts against USAID standards as well as  other guidance, such as that developed by the Council on Environmental  Quality (CEQ). This technical expert told us she uses certain criteria  when determining whether a proposed project should be investigated and  applies them at her discretion. These criteria include, among others, the  significance and potential of adverse cumulative impacts, the ability of the  proposal to serve as a model for similar proposals within a particular  sector, and the potential for the proposal to undermine USAID\u2019s  sustainable development activities. USAID may also perform site visits to  the proposed project location. During these visits, USAID and other U.S.  government officials, including those from Treasury and State, may meet  with stakeholders such as the project sponsor, World Bank Group staff,  host-country government officials, and local communities affected by the  proposal.

Between January 2004 and July 2008, Treasury supported 17  World Bank Group proposals for which it determined that significant  environmental impacts would occur, but be mitigated. However, because  Treasury does not generally write memos to the U.S. Executive Director  for projects it supports, it does not maintain documentation to show to  what extent other issues may have outweighed environmental and social  concerns in these cases. Treasury officials responsible for conducting  environmental reviews stated that for controversial projects, decisions are  made by senior-level administration officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Given the potential consequences of World Bank Group projects with  significant environmental and social impacts, the overriding constraints  posed by the World Bank Group\u2019s project development and approval  process, and the restrictions the Pelosi Amendment imposes on the U.S.  government\u2019s decision-making, U.S. agencies must coordinate efficiently  to maximize their resources within the very limited time they have  available to review upcoming projects. However, Treasury is not  maximizing the effectiveness of a major mechanism for gathering  interagency views on projects\u2014the weekly interagency working group it  leads. The working group meetings, which Treasury uses to meet its legal  requirement to consult with other agencies on the possible impacts of  World Bank Group proposals, are meant to provide an opportunity for all  participants to utilize their expertise and discuss their perspectives and  concerns as part of the vetting process to determine a U.S. position on the  proposals. Prior to the meetings, Treasury\u2019s staff flag those projects that  they believe have potentially significant environmental and social impacts.  Treasury has not, however, been routinely passing this information on to  the other participants of the working group in advance of group meetings.  For example, Treasury only identified about 15 percent of such projects in  working group agendas in 2007. Without this identification, working group  agencies have been limited in their ability to effectively contribute to the  interagency effort to evaluate proposed World Bank Group projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve U.S. agencies\u2019 ability to effectively contribute to the  interagency effort to evaluate World Bank Group proposals that are likely  to have significant adverse environmental and social impacts, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury, in his capacity as the chair  of the Working Group on Multilateral Assistance, routinely identify all  proposals of concern in advance of working group meetings with other  agencies in order to maximize the ability of all participants to contribute  to the evaluation of World Bank Group proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Treasury and USAID for their review  and comment.

Treasury also disagreed with two  of our findings. First, Treasury disputed our finding that its efforts had  little impact, because it believed we did not adequately note Treasury\u2019s  behind the scenes efforts to influence project design. In response, we have  added language to the report to reflect some of these efforts. However,  Treasury did not provide us with information to gauge the impact of these  communications and Treasury officials also told us they could not  determine what impact these communications have on project design.

We did not, however, revise this recommendation  because we believe it is up to Treasury to determine how best to  implement the recommendation. USAID\u2019s comments also raised several  issues, including that our report title was overly expansive. In response,  we modified the title to clarify that the report addresses certain  procedures required by U.S. law. USAID was also concerned that our  report did not address all provisions in Title XIII, such as creating a system  for information exchange with other interested member countries. These  were not within the scope of this report because we focused our review on  those sections of Title XIII that directly address U.S. government oversight  of the potential environmental and social concerns associated with  proposed World Bank Group projects. USAID was also concerned that we  did not address whether Treasury has sufficient expertise to evaluate  measures to mitigate environmental damage. However, it is beyond the  scope of this report to determine whether mitigation measures have been  effective; we anticipate addressing this issue in our next report, which will  focus on project implementation.

Part 26; as well as the U.S.  Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) Environmental  Procedures contained in 22 C.F.R. Part 216. We also reviewed legislation  governing U.S. environmental assessments, such as the National  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and Council on Environmental  Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA,  40 C.F.R. Parts 1500-1508; and, Council on Environmental Quality  guidance on implementing 40 C.F.R. Part 1500-1508. To determine how  agencies implement their legislative requirements, we interviewed U.S.  government officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  USAID, and the Departments of State and the Treasury (Treasury), as well  as expert staff from environmental non-governmental organizations.  Because not every agency keeps complete records of its environmental  oversight activities or has internal policies governing such actions, certain  procedural documentation could not be provided. In such cases, we relied  on agency officials\u2019 testimonial evidence.", "To examine agencies\u2019 ability to identify and address environmental  concerns of proposed World Bank Group projects, we reviewed agency  documents such as periodic reports to Congress, agency decision memos,  and the U.S. government\u2019s voting record on World Bank Group proposals.  We also interviewed U.S. government officials from EPA, USAID, and the  Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury. In addition, we  interviewed relevant World Bank Group officials from the International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development  Association, the International Finance Corporation, and the Multilateral  Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as environmental experts from  nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.", "To determine the number of World Bank Group projects that the U.S.  Executive Director abstained from voting on due to the requirements of  the Pelosi Amendment, we collected data from Treasury on the U.S.  Executive Director\u2019s voting record from January 2004 through May 2008.  We also used these data to identify projects supported by the U.S.", "Executive Director that Treasury determined may have significant  environmental impacts, but that the U.S. Executive Director supported  based on Treasury\u2019s determination that such impacts have been addressed  and mitigated in the design of the project.", "To assess the reliability of Treasury\u2019s data on the U.S. Executive Director\u2019s  voting record, we (1) interviewed the Treasury official responsible for  managing the team of analysts who record data on the status of  multilateral development bank projects; and (2) reviewed the voting  record data. During the course of our review, we identified incomplete  data fields and manual data entry errors, such as duplicate entries of the  same project. However, based on our intended use of the data\u2014to identify  how the U.S. Executive Director voted on particular World Bank Group  projects\u2014and the results of our assessment, we determined that the data  provided were sufficiently reliable for the this purpose.", "Because Treasury does not maintain a database of the projects it reviews  for compliance with the Pelosi Amendment, we requested that the agency  create a list of projects receiving such a review for calendar years 2006  through 2008. The Treasury analyst conducting these reviews compiled for  us an estimate of the projects she reviewed during this time frame. She  stated that she compiled the list from a manual log she keeps along with  archived emails. Although the analyst stated that the list was generally  accurate it is possible that a few projects may not have been captured. We  determined, however, that the data provided were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "To determine the total number of projects the World Bank Group  identified as (1) having the potential for significant adverse impacts;   (2) having the potential for limited adverse impacts; or (3) having funds  channeled through a financial intermediary, we extracted data from the  World Bank\u2019s and IFC\u2019s project Web sites from January 2004 through May  2008. Since the World Bank Group has not completed vetting its response  to our request to conduct a review of World Bank Group environmental  assessment policies and their implementation, it therefore did not allow us  to assess the reliability of World Bank and IFC data. Although we used this  data to identify an approximate number of projects that were categorized  by the World Bank and IFC as likely to have significant adverse  environmental impacts, the reliability of those data are undetermined.", "Due to the nature of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency\u2019s  (MIGA) business model (providing political risk insurance and project  guarantees), it was not feasible for us to collect project-related data, since  MIGA\u2019s tracking and monitoring activities are different than those of the  IFC or the World Bank. For example, MIGA does not categorize its support  in terms of individual projects, but rather in terms of individual guarantees  from distinct investors. Therefore, there may be more than one investor  who has applied for and obtained MIGA insurance and, thus, more than  one guarantee for a given project.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to November  2008, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

USAID commented that several sections of Title XIII are not discussed  in the report, such as creating a system for information exchange with  other interested member countries. This is outside the scope of our  report, which focuses on U.S. government efforts to review the World  Bank Group\u2019s process for assessing the environmental impact of  projects. We have added language to the report to clarify this point. 2.  USAID commented that our draft report title was overly expansive. In  response, we have changed the title to clarify that our report addresses  certain procedures required by U.S. law. 3.  USAID commented that the focus on a short timeline is misleading  because it does not take into consideration the time period leading up  to the release of the project appraisal document. However, Title XIII  does not provide a timeline for when U.S. government agencies should  begin reviewing World Bank Group or other multilateral development  bank proposals. By not specifying a timeline, the legislation leaves it  up to the agencies to determine when they should begin reviewing  proposals. We do note that an April 2008 USAID report to Congress  stated that there are inadequate opportunities to identify, avert, or  mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts associated with  projects even when the banks release the environmental documents  120 days before the board votes. USAID has acknowledged that it can  only use the early, upstream approach to provide a more intensive look  at a limited number of projects.  4.  USAID commented that our report implies that Treasury has the  expertise to review environmental impact assessments and determine  if mitigation measures are appropriate. However, we do not comment  on Treasury expertise. Rather, we acknowledge that USAID and  Treasury review documentation for different purposes. We also state  that Treasury is the lead agency in formulating the U.S. government\u2019s  position on proposed multilateral development projects, and that its  decisions do not always reflect consensus among agencies or even  among units of the same agencies. While the Pelosi Amendment  (Section 1307) requires that environmental impact assessments  contain associated and cumulative impacts and alternatives to the  proposal in order for Treasury to support a project in a board vote,  Treasury is not required to consider specific mitigating measures in  determining how to instruct the U.S. executive director to vote.", "Section 1306, a separate law in Title XIII, requires Treasury to instruct  the U.S. Executive Director to vigorously urge the multilateral  development banks to consider other environmental factors and to  circulate to the bank board documents that include these factors,  including mitigating measures. It is beyond the scope of this report to  determine whether mitigation measures have been effective; we  anticipate addressing this issue in our next report, which will focus on  project implementation.  5.  USAID strongly believes that the intent of Section 1307 of Title XIII is  to be more than just a procedural process. However, the specific  provisions of Section 1307 that require U.S. government oversight of  the potential environmental and social concerns associated with  proposed World Bank Group projects are primarily procedural in  nature. We revised the report as appropriate in response to this  comment.  6.  USAID states that Treasury has not consulted with other U.S. agencies  to develop environmental impact review procedures for multilateral  development bank projects. USAID believes that our report should  include recommendations to harmonize disparate review standards.  However, the law does not require agencies to harmonize review  standards. Therefore, we did not address this issue in this report.  7.  USAID commented on several factual errors in the report with respect  to the Tuesday Group. We have revised the report to incorporate the  first point regarding Tuesday Group co-chairs. Regarding the second  point, we characterized the proposal, dating from mid-2008, as it was  described to us by Treasury and the Bank Information Center.  Moreover, in a technical comment regarding this proposal, Treasury  did not dispute its timing. We have added a sentence to an existing  footnote stating that this proposal is very similar to one described in  section 5, annex A of USAID\u2019s 2002-2004 report to Congress.  8.  USAID commented that our recommendation may warrant further  guidance to more clearly address the very short lead times for notice  to other agencies.
