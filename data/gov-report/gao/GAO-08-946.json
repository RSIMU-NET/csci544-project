With new funds being created and many growing rapidly, some see these funds providing valuable capital to world markets, but others are concerned that the funds are not transparent and could be used to further national goals and potentially harm the countries where they invest. GAO plans to issue a series of reports on various aspects of SWFs. This first report analyzed (1) the availability of publicly reported data from SWFs and others on their sizes and holdings internationally, and (2) the availability of publicly reported data from the U.S. government and other sources on SWFs' U.S. investments. GAO reviewed foreign government disclosures, Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Department of Commerce (Commerce) reporting, and private researcher data to identify SWFs and their activities. GAO also analyzed information from international organizations and securities filings. Treasury and Commerce commented that GAO's report provides timely and useful contributions to the SWF debate; SEC noted that U.S. securities requirements apply to all large investors, including SWFs. Future GAO reports will address laws affecting SWF investments, SWF governance practices, and the potential impact of SWFs and U.S. options for addressing them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Limited information is publicly available from official government sources for some SWFs. While some have existed for decades, 28 of the 48 SWFs that GAO identified have been created since 2000, primarily in countries whose foreign exchange reserves are growing through oil revenues or trade export surpluses. GAO analysis showed that about 60 percent of these 48 SWFs publicly disclosed information about the size of their assets since the beginning of 2007, but only about 4 funds published detailed information about all their investments--and some countries specifically prohibit any disclosure of their SWF activities. Although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) currently collects data on countries' international financial flows, GAO found that only 13 countries separately reported their SWF holdings in public IMF documents. IMF plans to issue new reporting guidance in 2009 that asks countries to voluntarily report the size of their SWF holdings in their international statistics. While this could increase the transparency of SWFs, its success depends on the extent to which countries participate. In the absence of official national or international public reporting, much of the available information about the value of holdings for many SWFs is from estimates by private researchers who project funds sizes by adjusting any reported amounts to reflect likely reserve growth and asset market returns. For the funds GAO identified, officially reported data and researcher estimates indicated that the size of these 48 funds' total assets was from $2.7 trillion to $3.2 trillion. Some researchers expect these assets to continue to grow significantly. U.S. government agencies and others collect and publicly report information on foreign investments in the United States, but these sources have limitations and the overall level of U.S. investments by SWFs cannot be specially identified. From surveys of U.S. financial institutions and others, Treasury and Commerce reported that foreign investors, including governments, private entities, and individuals, owned over $20 trillion of U.S. assets in 2007, but the amounts held by SWFs cannot be specifically identified from the reported data because either the agencies do not obtain specific investor identities or the agencies are precluded from disclosing individual investor information. GAO found that as many as 16 of the 48 SWFs reported some information on their U. S. investments. One reported all U.S. holdings, but others only identified a few specific investments or indicated that some of their total assets were invested in the United States. Some SWF investments can be identified in U.S. securities filings, under a requirement for disclosure of investments that result in aggregate beneficial ownership of greater than 5 percent of a voting class of certain equity securities. At least 8 SWFs have disclosed such investments since 1990. GAO analysis of a private financial research database identified SWF investments in U.S. companies totaling over $43 billion from January 2007 through June 2008, including SWF investments in U.S. financial institutions needing capital as a result of the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis. Additional U.S. reporting requirements would yield additional information for monitoring the U.S. activities of SWFs, although some U.S. officials have expressed concerns that they could also increase compliance costs for U.S. financial institutions and agencies and could potentially discourage SWFs from making investments in U.S. assets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although the United States government has long welcomed foreign  investment, at times acquisitions of American companies and assets by  foreign entities have attracted a high level of public interest. Recently,  increased attention has been given to the activities of sovereign wealth  funds (SWF), which are pools of government funds invested in assets in  other countries. Some SWFs, such as those in certain Middle Eastern  nations, have existed for decades, but others, such as those in China and  Russia, have been formed recently. Funded through the sale of natural  resources such as oil or through other trade surpluses, some SWFs have  large and growing sums of money to invest.", "Perspectives about SWF activities are mixed. Some observers see SWFs as  having positive effects on markets because they are usually long-term,  stable investors. Since August 2007, SWFs have made key investments into  U.S. and European banks seeking capital as the result of disruptions in the  subprime mortgage loan market. However, as large government-controlled  investment funds, SWFs have also been criticized for the lack of  transparency about their holdings and their investment strategies. Some  market observers have also expressed concerns that SWFs could  adversely affect asset prices by moving large amounts of funds into or out  of countries or markets. Concerns have also been raised in congressional  hearings and elsewhere that rather than making investments primarily to  earn investment returns, as is generally the motivation of a private  investor, some SWFs may instead invest their assets to achieve the  noncommercial or political goals of their governments. Some observers  note, however, that little evidence exists that SWFs have engaged or  intend to engage in noncommercial behavior detrimental to another  country\u2019s economy.", "Your letter asked us to examine a broad range of issues about SWFs. As  agreed with your offices, we plan to address the issues raised in your  request in a series of reports. In order to respond to questions raised about  SWFs, having an understanding of how large they are and what  investments they are making can be useful. Therefore, in this report we  analyzed (1) the availability of data on the size of SWFs and their holdings  internationally that have been publicly reported by SWFs, their  governments, international organizations, or private sources and (2) the  availability of published or reported data from the U.S. government or  others on SWF investments in the United States. Further reports will  examine the extent to which various laws address the ability of SWFs to  invest in the United States, the disclosure and governance practices SWFs  follow, and the potential impact of SWFs and options for addressing these  for the United States.", "Determining the availability of public data on the size of SWFs required  that we first identify SWFs by reviewing the definitions and the lists of  such funds that have been compiled by U.S. and international agencies,  financial services firms, and private research organizations. Government  officials and private researchers define SWFs in various ways. Based on  our research, we determined that the funds likely to be of the most interest  to policymakers are those that  1.  are government-chartered or government-sponsored investment  vehicles;  2. invest some or all of their funds in assets other than sovereign debt  outside the country that established them;  3.  are funded through government transfers arising primarily from  sovereign budget surpluses, trade surpluses, central bank currency  reserves, or revenues from the commodity wealth of a country; and  4.  are not actively functioning as a pension fund.", "We excluded funds that act as pension funds\u2014that is, that received  contributions from or made benefit payments to individuals\u2014because  these funds generally have specific liabilities in the form of near-term to  long-term obligations that other funds do not have. As of July 2008, we had  identified 48 funds that met these characteristics (see app. II). For these  funds, we attempted to identify any reported or published asset amounts  from their official SWF or other government Web sites. When information  was not available from these official government sources, we used  International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports on countries\u2019 international  financial positions. When neither of these was available, we used  information compiled by private researchers. To identify SWF investments  in the United States, we reviewed data on foreign investment collected and  published by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the  Department of Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) Bureau of Economic Analysis  (BEA). We also reviewed information on individual SWF investments from  public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and data compiled by private database firms on financial transactions,  including mergers and acquisitions, that are available for public  subscription. For this report, we did not review information collected by  the U.S. government about SWFs that may be part of nonpublic processes,  such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  (CFIUS) review process or filings with the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System in relation to banking law. We also did not review  nonpublic information collected by IMF in connection with Article IV  consultations. We interviewed officials from the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System, Commerce, the Department of Defense, the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, SEC, the Department of State,  Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative. We also spoke with staff  from private research organizations, investment banks, foreign investment  funds, trade and investment associations, and others.

While all countries need some amount of foreign currency reserves to  meet their international payment obligations, in some cases countries may  accumulate currency reserves in excess of the amounts needed for current  or future obligations. Some countries invest their foreign exchange  reserves in assets such as the sovereign debt of other countries, including  securities issued by Treasury to fund U.S. government operations.  However, some countries have formed SWFs to invest a portion of their  excess foreign currency reserves in assets likely to earn higher returns,  such as the equity shares issued by foreign publicly traded companies.", "Some countries with current account (a broad measure of international  flows that includes trade balances) surpluses have created SWFs. These  include countries that are major exporters of commodities or natural  resources, such as oil, as well as those, such as China, that are exporters  of manufactured goods. In contrast, as the world\u2019s largest importer of  goods and natural resources, the United States has run increasingly large  current account deficits since the early 1990s. The current account deficit  of the United States was $731.2 billion in 2007, whereas Asian countries  with SWFs had a combined current account surplus of over $400 billion  and oil-producing countries with SWFs had a combined surplus of about  $338 billion (see fig. 1).", "These current account surpluses have led to a buildup of foreign currency  reserves in some countries. Since 1995, currency reserves in industrial  economies have more than doubled and currency reserves in developing  economies have increased sevenfold. Foreign currency accumulation has  been especially large among oil-producing countries and Asian countries  with large trade surpluses, especially with the United States. China, Korea,  Japan, and Russia hold the largest quantities of foreign currency reserves.  Asian exporting countries\u2019 combined current account surpluses grew from  $53 billion in 2000 to $443 billion in 2007. Currency reserves have  accumulated in SWF countries (see fig. 2). The U.S. dollar accounted for  slightly less than two-thirds of total central bank foreign reserve holdings  of all countries as of the first quarter of 2008.", "For oil-exporting countries with SWFs, which include some nations in the  Middle East, as well as Norway and Russia, oil revenues remained  relatively stable from 1992 to 1998. But in 1999, oil prices\u2014as measured by  the annual weighted world average price per barrel\u2014began to rise (see   fig. 3). Consequently, oil revenues have increased 561 percent for the  major exporting nations from 1992 to 2006, the year for which the latest  data were available. These revenue increases have occurred as the price of  oil per barrel has increased from $23 in January 2000 to well over $100 in  the first half of 2008, including over $137 in July 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States Reviews Some Foreign Investments", "paragraphs": ["An interagency group is responsible for reviewing some foreign  investment transactions in the United States. CFIUS, initially established  by executive order in 1975, reviews some foreign investments in U.S.  businesses, including some investments by SWFs. Section 721 of the  Defense Production Act authorizes the President to suspend or prohibit  mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that could result in foreign control of a  U.S. business if the transaction threatens to impair national security. The  President delegated his section 721 authority to review individual  transactions to CFIUS. CFIUS and its structure, role, process, and  responsibilities were formally established in statute in July 2007 with the  enactment of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act (FINSA).  FINSA amends section 721 of the Defense Production Act to expand the  illustrative list of factors to be considered in deciding which investments  could affect national security and brings greater accountability to the  CFIUS review process. Under FINSA, foreign government-controlled  transactions, including investments by SWFs, reviewed by CFIUS must be  subjected to an additional 45-day investigation beyond the initial 30-day  review, unless a determination is made by an official at the deputy  secretary level that the investment will not impair national security.  CFIUS reviews transactions solely to determine their effect on national  security, including factors such as the level of domestic production needed  for projected national defense requirements and the capability and  capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements. If a  transaction proceeds to a 45-day investigation after the initial 30-day  review and national security concerns remain after the investigation, the  President may suspend or prohibit a transaction.

However, since 2000, many commodity and trade- exporting countries have set up new SWFs. These funds have grown as a  result of rising exports of commodities such as oil, whose prices have also  risen.

These assets usually included equities, bonds, real estate, or other  alternative investments.", "We found that about 77 percent of the 48 SWFs publicly reported the  purpose of their funds, with 13 of the largest 20 funds doing so. In many  cases, fund purposes included using the country\u2019s financial or natural  resources to earn investment returns intended to benefit the country in  various ways, including providing income for future generations, balancing  the government\u2019s budget, or preserving foreign currency purchasing  power.", "The information publicly reported about SWFs varies in part because of  different disclosure requirements across countries. The nature,  frequency, and content of any SWF information are reported at each  country\u2019s discretion. Some countries may restrict the type of reporting that  can be released. For example, according to documents published by the  government of Kuwait, Kuwaiti law requires the Kuwait Investment  Authority to submit a detailed report on its activities to the Kuwaiti  government authorities, but prohibits it from disclosing this information to  the public. In contrast, according to Norwegian government documents,  Norwegian law requires that the country\u2019s SWF publicly release  comprehensive and detailed information regarding its assets, objectives,  and current holdings on a quarterly and annual basis. Some funds that are  not required to disclose information have begun to do so voluntarily. For  example, Temasek Holdings, an SWF located in Singapore, is not required  by Singapore law to release financial performance reports, but it began  doing so in 2004, according to a Temasek Holdings official. This official  told us that each SWF operates in a different environment and must decide  on the appropriate amount of transparency. The official said that since  Temasek Holdings began publishing its annual review in 2004, it has  disclosed more information each year.", "The extent to which other large private classes of investors disclose  information about their assets and investments also varies. For example,  investors such as hedge funds and private equity funds that are not  investment companies under U.S. securities laws have as their investors  primarily institutions or high net worth individuals and are generally not  required to publicly disclose information about their investment portfolios.  In contrast, U.S. mutual funds are generally required to disclose certain  information about their investment portfolios and portfolio transactions.

IMF officials  have initiated an effort to increase the amount and specificity of SWF  activities in IMF documents. Currently, IMF members are expected to  disclose a range of fiscal and macroeconomic statistics, including  countries\u2019 balance of payments and their international investment  position, that are made public in various IMF reports and IMF\u2019s World  Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report. The data that  countries report may include the level of reserves and the amount of  external assets they hold. However, the coverage of SWFs in these  statistics is not uniform, not least because SWFs can be included in  different accounts depending on specific statistical criteria. According to  IMF staff, the countries themselves determine whether to include the  value of their SWF assets in their reserve assets or separately as external  assets. In some cases, countries do not report any information about their  SWF. Further, some member countries do not submit data on their  international investment position to IMF. Analyzing a selection of 21  countries with SWFs, IMF staff found that only 11 included the value of  their SWFs\u2019 assets in either their balance of payments or international  investment position data. IMF staff noted that members are not required to  report the value of the SWF holdings as a separate line item and no  member currently does so.", "In addition to information from required data reporting, IMF staff also  collected some information about SWFs through their consultations with  individual countries.

The current version of this manual was last  updated in 1993 and does not address SWFs. In recognition of the growing  number of SWFs, IMF officials told us that they began to address the  methodological issues related to a definition of SWFs and SWF assets in  2005 and subsequently initiated an international consultation on the issue.  IMF expects that this additional detail will provide an understanding of the  location of SWF assets, which, depending on certain criteria, can be  reported in either the reserve assets or the external accounts or in other  accounts of a country\u2019s financial accounts data. IMF notes that this new  reporting item will help to facilitate proper identification of SWFs and may  contribute to greater transparency and to a better understanding of their  impact on the country\u2019s external position and reserve assets. Treasury  staff told us that they were involved in the group that considered these  changes, and while the United States and some other countries would  have preferred that the proposed SWF reporting be mandatory, the group  chose the voluntary option.", "In addition, IMF is facilitating and coordinating the work of the  International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds that is  deliberating on a set of Generally Accepted Principles and Practices  relating to sovereign wealth funds. These are intended to set out a  framework of sound operation for SWFs. The specific elements are likely  to come from reviews of good SWF practices. These principles are also  aimed at improving the understanding of SWFs in both their home  countries and recipient countries.", "Other organizations involved in monitoring international financial  developments do not regularly report on SWF activities. For example, the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an  organization of 30 countries responsible for supporting global economic  growth and trade, collects data on foreign direct investment inflows and  outflows and national accounts information from its member countries  and some selected nonmember countries. These data, however, do not  specifically identify SWFs. Further, only 9 countries included in OECD\u2019s  surveys are known to have SWFs. Many countries with SWFs are not  members of OECD. A recent document from OECD indicates that it is  using other publicly available sources of data to estimate the size and asset  allocation of selected SWFs.

The act requires that a  benchmark survey of foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio  investments in the United States be conducted at least once every 5  years. Under this authority, BEA collects data on foreign direct  investment in the United States, defined as the ownership of 10 percent or  more of a business enterprise.

However, the information that is  reported to Treasury does not include the specific identity of the investing  organization; thus the extent of SWF investment within the overall foreign  official holdings data cannot be identified. In addition, Treasury officials  reported that some SWF investments may be classified as private if the  investments are made through private foreign intermediaries, such as  investment banks, or if an SWF is operated on a subnational level, such as  by a state or a province of a country, as those types of organizations are  not included in Treasury\u2019s definition of official government institutions.", "Both BEA and Treasury stated that the data published do not include the  identity of specific investors and are aggregated to ensure compliance with  the statutory requirement that collected information not be published or  disclosed in a manner in which a reporting person can be identified.

They stated that they are considering  reporting the information in this manner. This breakout would help to  narrow the segment of foreign direct investment that contains SWF  investments, but it would not identify SWF investment specifically since it  would still combine SWF investments with other official government  investments. Regarding portfolio investment, Treasury officials reported  that while more detailed information would allow them to report SWF  investment separately from that of other foreign official institutions,  Treasury would be prohibited from releasing such information publicly in  cases where it would make the foreign owners easily identifiable.  According to a Treasury official, some business groups advised Congress  during the initial passage of the International Investment Survey Act that  disclosure of their transactions and holdings in foreign countries would  adversely affect their companies. If foreign companies in the United States  share that view, then removing the disclosure restriction might make  foreign investors less likely to invest in the United States, and they might  seek investments in countries with less stringent disclosure requirements.  In addition, the official said that collecting additional information on  foreign investment would increase costs for Treasury as well as for  reporting entities. A representative of one financial institution that is a  reporting entity told us that the institution would need to make changes to  its internal reporting systems in order to provide more identifying  information on investors, but the official could not estimate the total costs  of doing so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Information on Specific SWF Investments in the United States Is Available from SWF Disclosures and Private Sources", "paragraphs": ["Some information on specific SWF investments in U.S. assets can be  determined from disclosures made by SWFs themselves and from private  data sources.

For example, Norway\u2019s SWF publishes a complete  list of its holdings, which indicated that as of year-end 2006, its fund held  positions in over 1,000 U.S. companies, valued at over $110 million.

Any investor, including SWFs, upon acquiring  beneficial ownership of greater than 5 percent of a voting class of an  issuer\u2019s Section 12 registered equity securities, must file a statement of  disclosure with SEC. The information required on this statement includes  identifying information, including citizenship; the securities being purchased and the issuer; the source and amount of funds used to purchase the securities; the purpose of the transaction; the number of shares acquired, and the percent of ownership that  number reflects; and the identification of any contracts, arrangements, understandings, or  relationships with respect to securities of the issuer.", "When there are changes to the level of ownership or amount of securities  held, the investor is generally required to file an amendment. Investors  taking passive ownership stakes in the same equities, meaning they do not  intend to exert any form of control, may qualify to file a less-detailed  statement.", "SEC also requires disclosure for investors, including SWFs, whose  beneficial ownership of a class of voting equity securities registered under  Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 exceeds 10  percent.  Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  within 10 calendar days of becoming a more than 10 percent beneficial  owner, an investor must file an initial report disclosing the amount of the  investor\u2019s beneficial ownership of any equity securities of the issuer,  whether direct or indirect.  In addition, for as long as investors remain  more than 10 percent beneficial owners, they must file reports of changes  in beneficial ownership with the SEC within two business days of the  transaction resulting in the change in beneficial ownership.  This  requirement applies to sales and additional purchases of any equity  securities of the same issuer.", "Certain beneficial ownership filings required under U.S. securities laws  offer some information about SWF activities, but cannot be used to  determine the full extent of SWF transactions in the United States. For  example, any transaction involving a purchase resulting in total beneficial  ownership of 5 percent or less of a voting class of an issuer\u2019s Section 12  registered equity securities would not have to be disclosed under the  federal beneficial ownership reporting rules and otherwise may not  necessarily have to be disclosed. Thus, the SEC data would most likely not  include information on SWF investments under this threshold. In addition,  although the filing of these reports is mandatory for all investors who meet  the requirements, SEC staff told us that without conducting a specific  inquiry, their ability to determine whether all qualifying investments have  been disclosed, including any by an SWF, may be limited. To identify  nonfilers, the SEC staff told us that they sometimes use sources such as  public comments and media reports. SEC has not brought a public action  against an SWF for violating these beneficial ownership reporting  requirements. Finally, given that these filings are primarily used to disclose  ownership in the securities of specific issuers, the information is not  compiled or reported by SEC in any aggregated format. Thus, identifying  SWF transactions requires searching by issuer or SWF name, and SEC staff  noted, for example, that identifying such transactions can be difficult  because some SWF filers may have numerous subsidiaries under whose  names they might file a report.", "Information about some SWF investments in U.S. issuers can be identified  in certain filings made under the federal securities laws. As a result of the  recent interest in SWF activities, SEC staff analyzed such filings to identify  transactions involving SWFs. To identify specific transactions, they  searched for filings by known SWFs and also reviewed filings from  countries with SWFs to identify SWF filings. According to their analysis,  since 1990 eight different SWFs have reported to SEC ownership of over 5  percent, covering 147 transactions in 58 unique issuers. SEC staff told us  that their analysis likely reflects only some of the SWF investments in U.S.  issuers.", "The federal securities laws also require U.S. public companies to file  reports on their financial condition, which can also reveal data on some  SWF investments in the United States below the greater than 5 percent  threshold for investor disclosures. Companies with publicly traded  securities are required to publicly disclose events they deem material to  their operations or financial condition, such as the acquisition of assets or  the resignation of officers. In some cases, U.S. companies have made  these filings to announce that they have received investments from an  SWF, including investments that did not exceed the 5 percent threshold  and require a beneficial ownership filing by the SWF. For example,  Citigroup filed a report outlining a transaction involving an SWF  investment that was below the 5 percent ownership stake but the SWF  investment was still deemed material to the financial condition of the  company. Some of the U.S. companies that recently received SWF  investments also included information about these transactions in their  annual reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Data Collection Entities Compile and Report Information on SWF Investments in the United States but Do Not Capture All Activity", "paragraphs": ["Private data collection entities compile and report information on specific  SWF transactions, including those captured by SEC filings, but do not  capture all SWF transactions. A number of private firms collect and  distribute information relating to financial transactions. For example,  database companies, such as Dealogic and Thompson Reuters, collect  information globally on financial transactions, including mergers and  acquisitions, for users such as investment banks, rating agencies, and  private researchers. To compile their databases, they use public filings  (including SEC filings), press releases, news announcements, and  shareholder lists, as well as information from relationships with large  financial intermediaries, such as investment banks and attorneys.  Therefore, information in these databases includes transactions that can  be identified through SEC filings but also may include additional  transactions that are not disclosed through U.S. securities laws but are  identified in other ways, such as through company press statements or  discussions with parties to the transaction. However, these data may not  be complete, and the database companies cannot determine to what  extent they capture all SWF transactions. For example, officials at these  companies told us that they will most likely miss smaller transactions,  consisting of acquisitions resulting in aggregate beneficial ownership of 5  percent or less, or unannounced relatively small dollar deals. Since many  SWFs have historically taken noncontrolling interests in U.S. companies  with total ownership often below 5 percent, the number of transactions  not captured could be large. In addition, a transaction completed by a  subsidiary of an SWF may not be identified as an SWF investment.", "We reviewed the information collected by Dealogic on investments made  by SWFs in foreign countries, otherwise known as cross-border  transactions. Based on this, the United States has, since 2000, attracted the  largest volume of cross-border SWF investment, with announced deals  totaling approximately $48 billion. Roughly $43 billion of this value reflects  investment since 2007, largely consisting of deals involving financial sector  entities. These deals comprised 8 of the top 10 announced SWF  investments in the United States since 2000 (see table 1).", "These large SWF-led investments into financial sector entities came at a  time when firms were facing large losses and asset write-downs due to the  subprime mortgage crisis of 2007. The investments were seen as positive  events by some market participants because they provided much-needed  capital. (See app. III for a summary of some of these transactions.)", "According to Dealogic, Switzerland, China, and the United Kingdom were  also major targets of cross-border SWF investments since 2000 (see fig. 9).", "Dealogic data also show that announced cross-border investments led by  SWFs worldwide have risen dramatically since 2000, both in terms of  number of deals and total dollar volume. (See fig. 10) Transactions  targeting the United States have also risen sharply, due in part to favorable  market conditions for foreign investors. In 2005, only one announced U.S.  transaction totaling $50 million was reported by Dealogic. In contrast,  nine transactions were reported in 2007, totaling $28 billion. As of June  2008, four transactions in the United States have been announced for the  year, totaling almost $20 billion.

To identify SWFs and to develop  criteria for selecting the funds to include in our analysis, we reviewed the  definitions of SWF and the lists of such funds that have been compiled by  U.S. and international agencies, financial services firms, and private  researchers. The funds of most interest to policymakers were those that  are separate pools of capital without underlying liabilities or obligations to  make payments in the near term. SWFs have raised concerns over their  potential to use their investments for non-economic purposes. As a result,  we chose to include in our analysis those funds that (1) were government  chartered or sponsored investment vehicles; (2) invested, in other than  sovereign debt, some or all of their assets outside the country that  established them; (3) were funded through transfers from their  governments of funds arising primarily from sovereign budget surpluses,  trade surpluses, central bank currency reserves, or revenues from the  commodity wealth of the countries, and (4) were not currently functioning  as pension funds receiving contributions from and making payments to  individuals. We included government-chartered or government-sponsored  entities that invest internationally because such entities raise concerns  over whether the controlling government will use their funds to make  investments to further national interests rather than to solely earn  financial returns. Entities that are funded primarily through trade  surpluses or natural resources wealth would also seem to be more  vulnerable to pressure to make noneconomic investments than entities  funded through employee contributions or other nonwindfall sources. We  excluded internationally active pension funds that are receiving  contributions from or making benefit payments to individuals as these  funds generally have specific liabilities, unlike SWFs that are not  encumbered by such near-term obligations, and thus are not as likely to  make noneconomic investments. We also excluded investment funds that  invested only in the sovereign debt of other nations. Such an investment  strategy is an approach that central banks have traditionally taken and,  although widely debated, has not generally raised control issues. SWF  investments in the equity securities of commercial firms in other countries  may be viewed as creating the potential for actions of a noncommercial  nature that could be detrimental to another country's economy.", "In order to determine our final list of SWFs, we independently examined  each fund on a compiled list of unique funds that others claimed were  SWFs. We verified that our above criteria were met using national  authorities and International Monetary Fund (IMF) data sources. To begin  our analysis, we reviewed lists of SWFs generated from seven different  private data sources and IMF. These sources, included in publications  from Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, the  Peterson Institute, RGE Monitor, Standard Chartered Bank, and IMF,  were then used to prepare a comprehensive list of 258 possible SWFs.  Since the names of the funds varied depending on the source, we manually  matched the sources based on the fund name, inception year, and fund  size to obtain a list of 81 unique funds.", "After compiling the list of unique funds, we attempted to verify the extent  to which the funds met our four criteria. We did this by having at least two  analysts reach agreement on whether the criteria were met upon review of  several data sources. We used official governmental source data, such as  information from the country\u2019s central bank, finance ministry, or other  government organization or from the fund\u2019s Web site. If official  government source information was unavailable, we used the country\u2019s  Article IV consultation report or other documents reported to IMF as a  secondary source. Those funds that did not meet any one of our four  specified criteria were excluded from our analysis. In cases where we  could verify some but not all of our criteria from national authority or IMF  sources, we attempted to validate the remaining criteria using private or  academic sources. Analyst judgment to include or exclude a fund was  employed in some cases where all criteria could not be validated. Of the 48  funds selected for our analysis, we were able to verify all four criteria in 60  percent of cases. For all of the 48 funds we were able to verify two or  more of our four criteria using a mix of various sources.", "We encountered some limitations to our independent verification of  national authorities\u2019 source data. These limitations include Web searches  only being conducted in English, Web sites being under construction, and  Web sites being incompletely translated from the original source language  to English. In these cases, we located speakers of the languages in  question and assisted them in conducting searches for SWF information  on the national government Web sites in the country\u2019s language. If our  team members who were knowledgeable of the foreign language found  relevant information, we asked them to translate the information to  English and provide us with a written copy. We used this translated  information to verify our criteria for 10 funds. Languages needing  translation were Arabic, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.

We  assessed the procedures that Dealogic uses to collect and analyze data and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  identify the transactions, we worked with Dealogic to develop a query that  would extract all transactions with an SWF as the acquirer of the asset and  where the asset resided in a country other than that of the SWF. However,  Dealogic does not capture all SWF transactions. Because of its reliance on  public filings, news releases, and relationships with investment banks,  Dealogic may not capture low-value transactions that are not reported  publicly. We also reviewed public filings, obtained through SEC\u2019s  Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database, of  selected U.S. companies that received major SWF investments in 2007 and  2008.

They seek higher rates of return and may be invested in a wider  range of asset classes than traditional reserves. Treasury says that SWFs  generally fall into two categories based on the source of their foreign  exchange assets: commodity and noncommodity funds. Treasury has not  released a list of SWFs.", "IMF defines SWFs as government-owned investment funds set up for a  variety of macroeconomic purposes. They are commonly funded by the  transfer of foreign exchange assets that are invested long term and  overseas. SWFs are a heterogeneous group and may serve multiple,  overlapping, and changing objectives over time: as stabilization funds to  insulate the budget and economy against commodity price swings; as  savings funds for future generations; as reserve investment corporations  established to increase the return on reserves; as development funds to  help fund socioeconomic projects or promote industrial policies; or as  contingent pension reserve funds to provide for unspecified pension  liabilities on the government\u2019s balance sheet. IMF researchers have  published a list of SWFs. This relatively broad definition allows for  inclusion of a Saudi Arabian investment fund managed from the central  bank.", "Some investment bank reports have offered definitions of SWFs. One  states that SWFs are broadly defined as special government asset  management vehicles that invest public funds in a wide range of financial  instruments. Unlike central banks, which focus more on liquidity and  safekeeping of foreign reserves, most SWFs have the mandate to enhance  returns and are allowed to invest in riskier asset classes, including equity  and alternative assets, such as private equity, property, hedge funds, and  commodities. This bank does publish a list of SWFs. It says that it is not  always easy to differentiate between pure SWFs and other forms of public  funds, such as conventional public sector pension funds or state-owned  enterprises. Another investment bank defines SWFs as having five  characteristics: (1) sovereign, (2) high foreign currency exposure, (3) no  explicit liabilities, (4) high-risk tolerance, and (5) long investment horizon.  Similar to SWFs are official reserves and sovereign pension funds.  Another investment bank says that SWFs are vehicles owned by states that  hold, manage, or administer public funds and invest them in a wider range  of assets of various kinds. SWFs are mainly derived from excess liquidity  in the public sector stemming from government fiscal surpluses or from  official reserves at central banks. They are of two types\u2014either  stabilization funds to even out budgetary and fiscal policies of a country or  intergenerational funds that are stores of wealth for future generations.  SWFs are different from pension funds, hedge funds, and private equity  funds. SWFs are not privately owned. This investment bank researcher  does offer a list of SWFs.", "Some non-investment-bank private researcher reports have offered  definitions of SWFs. One researcher says that SWFs are a separate pool of  government owned or government-controlled assets that include some  international assets. The broadest definition of an SWF is a collection of  government-owned or government-controlled assets. Narrower definitions  may exclude government financial or nonfinancial corporations, purely  domestic assets, foreign exchange reserves, assets owned or controlled by  subnational governmental units, or some or all government pension funds.  This researcher includes all government pension and nonpension funds to  the extent that they manage marketable assets. This researcher does  publish a list of SWFs. Another private research group defines an SWF as  meeting three criteria: (1) it is owned by a sovereign government; (2) it is  managed separately from funds administered by the sovereign  government\u2019s central bank, ministry of finance, or treasury; and (3) it  invests in a portfolio of financial assets of different classes and risk  profiles, including bonds, stocks, property, and alternative instruments,  with a significant portion of its assets under management invested in  higher-risk asset classes in foreign countries. This researcher thinks of  SWFs as part of a continuum of sovereign government investment vehicles  that runs along a spectrum of financial risk, from central banks as the  most conservative and risk averse, to traditional pension funds, to special  government funds, to SWFs, and finally to state-owned enterprises, which  are the least liquid and are the highest-risk investments. This research  group publishes a list of SWFs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Cody Goebel, Assistant Director;  Celia Thomas, Assistant Director; Patrick Dynes; Nina Horowitz; Richard  Krashevski; Jessica Mailey ; Michael Maslowski; Marc Molino; Omyra  Ramsingh; and Jeremy Schwartz made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
