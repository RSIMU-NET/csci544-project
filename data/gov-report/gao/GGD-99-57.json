The factors relate primarily to the current system for compensating federal employees, a prominent topic in the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s strategic plan and an area that will need additional consideration as the government evaluates the guiding principles and best practices for addressing a wide range of federal human capital issues. In this regard, we believe a strong link is needed between human capital planning and agencies\u2019 strategic and programmatic approaches to accomplishing their missions. Accordingly, in this report we are recommending that Congress, in considering buyout legislation, continue to require agencies to prepare and submit strategic buyout plans for congressional review as a prerequisite for implementing buyout authority and to implement downsizing consistent with the results of their planning efforts.", "As agreed, unless you announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the date of this letter.

However, the federal payroll increased by $8.7 billion, or 9.3 percent, from $93.7 billion to $102.4 billion, while the federal civilian workforce was reduced by about 297,000 employees, or 13.8 percent, to 1.9 million employees during fiscal years 1993 through 1997.

Beginning in 1993, Congress and the administration, through a series of legislative acts and executive orders, established authorities and goals for reducing federal staffing levels governmentwide. In this regard, three key pieces of legislation were the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993; the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994; and section 663 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1997, each of which authorized agencies to pay separation incentives\u2014commonly known as buyouts\u2014of as much as $25,000 to eligible employees as inducements to leave federal service voluntarily. Buyouts provided agencies a tool to avoid or reduce the need for reductions-in-force.", "The National Defense Authorization Act authorized buyouts for civilian employees at DOD agencies from January 1, 1993, through September 30, 1997. This closing date was later extended to September 30, 1999. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, in addition to authorizing buyouts, mandated governmentwide reductions of 272,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions through fiscal year 1999. The Workforce Restructuring Act generally gave non-DOD agencies authority to offer buyouts from March 30, 1994, through March 31, 1995.

A description of the five categories follows.", "Professional occupations require incumbents to use discretion and judgment in applying knowledge acquired through education or training equivalent to a bachelor\u2019s degree in a specialized field. Professional occupations include statistician, accountant, and architect.", "Administrative occupations involve the exercise of analytical ability, judgment, and the application of a substantial body of knowledge of administrative or management principles and practices. While these occupations do not require specialized educational majors, they do involve the type of skills typically gained through a general college education or progressively responsible work. These occupations include air traffic controller, criminal investigator, and financial analyst.", "Technical occupations consist of nonroutine work that is learned on-the- job or from specialized training less than that represented by college graduation, to support professional or administrative fields.

They are covered by the Federal Wage System (FWS), the major pay system covering trade, craft, and labor occupations. These occupations include machine tool work, printing, and plumbing and pipefitting. Wage schedules consist of 15 grades, covering most nonsupervisory employees.

Basic pay consists of the salaries and wages paid directly to employees for duties performed during the employees\u2019 regular workweek. Basic pay also includes amounts paid for annual and sick leave. Premium pay is supplemental pay, such as overtime, for work in excess of the regular workweek, which is generally an 8-hour day and a 5-day week that does not include Sunday. Benefits provided to employees at a cost to the government include agencies\u2019 shares of health and life insurance premiums and retirement contributions.

FEPCA introduced a new annual pay-setting process that, beginning in 1994, was to gradually raise federal pay rates to within 5 percent of nonfederal rates by the year 2002.", "Annual pay comparability adjustments consist of two components: a single nationwide basic pay schedule percentage adjustment and varying adjustments in specific localities. The nationwide adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), an index prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that measures the change in nonfederal employers\u2019 wages and salaries. The ECI adjustment generally applies to GS\u2014that is, most\u2014 federal employees; Foreign Service pay schedules; and pay schedules established under title 38 for certain Veterans Health Administration employees. It may also be applied to other pay systems, such as the Senior Executive Service. The locality pay adjustments apply to specific geographical areas within the continental United States in which surveyed nonfederal pay rates exceed GS pay rates by 5 percent. As with the ECI adjustment, the locality pay adjustment may also be applied to other pay systems up to established statutory pay ceilings.", "The locality and nationwide pay comparability adjustments were intended to deal with the pay gap as well as any annual increases in nonfederal pay rates. At the time of enactment, the estimated pay gap was about 28 percent, and FEPCA required that 20 percent of the gap be closed in 1994, with locality pay adjustments each year thereafter until the pay gap was reduced to 5 percent. FEPCA also authorizes the President to propose lower alternative pay comparability adjustments under certain specified conditions. Since 1994, either the adjustment based on the ECI or the locality pay surveys have been limited by alternative adjustments by the President and Congress.", "Employees\u2019 pay also varies at a given grade level, depending on which of 10 steps the employee occupies within that grade. Each higher step increases the employee\u2019s rate of basic pay within that grade. Employees\u2019 advancement to the next step within a grade (career step increases) is to be based on performance at an acceptable level of competence and established waiting periods for the steps. The waiting periods for steps 1 through 4, 5 through 7, and 8 through 10 are 52, 104, and 156 weeks, respectively.  Employees demonstrating \u201chigh quality performance\u201d may advance more rapidly through the steps by being granted additional performance-based step increases (quality step increases). An employee may receive only one such increase during any 52-week period.", "Pay under FWS is to be based on what private industry is paying for the same kind of work in local wage areas. Federal blue-collar employees are to be paid the full prevailing rate at step 2 of their grade. At step 5, the highest step, they may be paid 12 percent above the prevailing rate. Since fiscal year 1979, separate legislation has limited or delayed annual FWS wage adjustments.", "Blue-collar employees also receive career step increases and, based on creditable service, may advance to step 5 in about 6 years. However, there are no provisions for their receiving quality step increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairmen of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and its Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services asked us to analyze changes in the federal workforce\u2019s pay and composition since passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 and the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, to determine why the federal payroll increased while the number of federal employees was decreasing. Our specific objectives were to determine to what extent and for what reasons the amounts of basic pay, costs of benefits, and premium pay changed during downsizing, and how, and to the extent possible why, grade and pay levels, the proportion of employees in occupations, and other demographics of the workforce changed in DOD and non-DOD agencies during downsizing and what impact these changes had on the federal payroll.", "We also answered the question of to what extent the number and salaries of supervisors and managers and their ratio to employees changed during downsizing and how those changes affected the payroll. In addition, we summarized our prior findings on human capital issues related to downsizing.", "To determine the extent to which and for what reasons basic pay, benefits costs, and premium pay changed during downsizing, we identified the factors that affected these payroll costs\u2014annual comparability adjustments, changes in the grades and pay levels of federal employees, and changes in agencies\u2019 use of benefits and premium pay. We obtained data on pay comparability adjustments from reports prepared by the President\u2019s Pay Agent and OPM\u2019s annual reports entitled Pay Structure of the Federal Civil Service. We obtained data on the number of employees, basic pay, benefits costs, and premium pay and the average grade of full- time federal employees from OPM\u2019s annual reports entitled Work Years and Personnel Costs and The Fact Book: Federal Civilian Workforce Statistics.", "We used the difference between the average payroll cost per employee for the 2.2 million employees at the beginning of fiscal year 1993 and for the 1.9 million employees at the end of fiscal year 1997 to approximate a $21.6 billion payroll increase for a constant workforce of 1.9 million employees. We did not have the data necessary to determine the exact payroll cost for the employees who separated during fiscal years 1993 through 1997. However, we were able to determine that the average payroll cost per employee for the 2.2 million employees included subsequently separated employees, who had lower average payroll costs than the remaining employees.", "We calculated the impact of annual comparability adjustments on the basic pay portion of the federal payroll and on the average employee\u2019s basic pay during fiscal years 1988 through 1997. We used a single average for each of the years to represent the nationwide and locality pay adjustments. To facilitate our analysis, we applied these increases to the entire payroll for all federal civilian employees, including blue-collar employees, who received pay adjustments under another system. After determining the amount that basic pay increased as a result of annual comparability adjustments, we calculated the amounts that basic pay increased each year due to other pay actions and separation and hiring trends that resulted in changes in employees\u2019 grade and pay levels. We then determined the proportionate relationship each year between the impact on basic pay of comparability adjustments and the impact on basic pay of other pay actions and of separation and hiring trends.", "To calculate the effect comparability adjustments and other pay actions had on the costs of benefits and premium pay, we analyzed the extent to which the cost of each benefit and premium pay changed during fiscal years 1988 through 1997 due to basic pay increases--as distinct from changes in usage of the benefits and premium pays, which may also increase their costs. Since most benefits and premium pays are based on employees\u2019 basic pay, we calculated the proportions of the costs of benefits and premium pays that increased annually due to pay comparability adjustments. We then used these proportionate cost increases due to comparability adjustments, and the proportionate relationship of comparability adjustments to grade and pay level changes, to calculate the increases in the costs of benefits and premium pay due to grade and pay level changes. One exception was that we did not attribute any increases in the government\u2019s share of health insurance premiums to pay comparability adjustments or other pay actions, since health insurance premiums are not based on employees\u2019 pay. We considered the changes in costs of benefits and premium pay to be the difference between the amounts due to comparability adjustments and grade and pay changes and the total changes in the annual costs of benefits and premium pays.", "Our calculations of the impact of comparability and other pay increases do not provide an exact amount but rather an estimate, because the government\u2019s costs for some benefits and premium pay, such as overtime, are also affected by other factors, such as a cap on the amounts that can be paid. In addition, per employee costs were calculated on the basis of all employees because data were not readily available on the specific number of employees who received each type of benefit or premium pay. Further, although temporary employees generally do not receive benefits, we did not determine and adjust for the number of such temporary employees in our calculations. Temporary employees comprised about 10 percent of the federal civilian workforce in fiscal year 1997.", "We totaled the change due to usage in the costs of various benefits and premium pays to determine whether, in aggregate, the annual costs of benefits and premium pays increased during the downsizing period and thus contributed to an increase in the federal payroll. In addition, we determined the extent to which the costs of benefits and premium pays due to usage increased or decreased during fiscal years 1993 through 1997.", "To determine how, and to the extent possible why, the proportion of employees in occupations and grade and pay levels changed governmentwide, as well as in DOD and non-DOD agencies, we used OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) to analyze data on the numbers of employees in occupations and general occupational categories in each agency and governmentwide. We calculated the extent to which the percentage of employees in occupations with 500 or more employees, and in general occupational categories, changed in proportion to the federal workforce between October 1, 1987, and December 31, 1992, compared with the period January 1, 1993, to March 31, 1998. We also did the same analysis for the periods from October 1, 1987, through March 31, 1994, and April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1998, for non-DOD agencies. We ranked the five agencies with the highest increases and decreases in individual occupations and in each general occupational category. We then selected eight agencies that were among those ranked highest in a number of these categories and that also had payrolls that represented over 3 percent of the total federal payroll. Two agencies with smaller payrolls\u2014the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2014were selected because they had the highest number of changes in several occupations and occupational groups. We interviewed officials at these 10 agencies to determine reasons why the changes had occurred.", "To determine how and why employees\u2019 grade and pay levels changed and the impact of those changes, we identified the primary factors that increased employees\u2019 pay. We obtained and analyzed CPDF data on the types of pay actions and determined that career steps, promotions, and performance pay increases together played the largest part in increasing employees\u2019 pay. We analyzed the CPDF data to determine the total number and amounts of these actions for the two 5-year periods and adjusted the amounts to exclude the sums attributable to annual pay comparability adjustments. We had previously estimated the effect of comparability adjustments on the costs of benefits and premium pay. We used these estimates and assumed that the pay actions\u2019 impact was in the same proportional relationship to the comparability pay adjustments\u2019 effect on the costs of benefits and premium pay as was the proportional relationship of comparability and pay actions for basic pay.", "To determine the impact of separation and hiring patterns on the average grade levels, we also analyzed the CPDF database to determine the average grade for employees who were separated from, were hired into, and who remained in the government in fiscal years 1988 through 1997. To determine whether the average grade increased at a different rate during downsizing than before downsizing, we calculated the difference in employees\u2019 average grade for the periods before downsizing\u2014fiscal years 1988 through 1992\u2014and during downsizing\u2014fiscal years 1993 through 1997. We recognize that some of the change in the average grade and pay would occur as a result of downsizing if the distribution of separated employees were uneven across federal grade levels.", "To determine the extent to which the number and salaries of supervisors and managers, and their span-of-control, changed, and the effect of such changes on the federal payroll, we analyzed the CPDF data on GS and blue collar employees to identify the number of supervisors and managers, and their ratio to staff, on September 30, 1987; September 30, 1992; and September 30, 1997, for all agencies governmentwide. For fiscal years 1993 through 1997, we also determined whether employees who had been identified as supervisors or managers after downsizing began, but were no longer identified as supervisors or managers at subsequent dates, had a code indicating the reason for the change, such as reclassification or transfer to another position. For these former supervisors and managers, we reviewed their salaries to determine the amount of any salary change at the time they changed to nonsupervisory or nonmanagement positions.", "For employees who became supervisors or managers, and for supervisors and managers who left the federal government during downsizing, we determined the amount of their salaries at those times. Our estimate of the total pay of new supervisors and managers assumed that 86 percent of those who were not hired from outside government were either replaced in their previous nonsupervisory positions by new hires or that, somewhere in the line of succession caused by the vacancy in their former position, an employee from outside government was hired. We assumed that 14 percent of the vacated positions were not filled, to reflect the overall 14 percent staffing reduction during downsizing. We could not verify our assumptions because the CPDF does not have information on whether newly appointed supervisors or managers or other employees were replaced in their former positions by new hires or existing employees.", "To provide contextual information on the impact of downsizing on human capital, we reviewed and summarized the relevant portions of our prior reports. These reports, issued during fiscal years 1996 through 1999, are cited where the relevant discussion occurs in chapter 2.", "We did our audit work in Washington, D.C., from September 1998 through July 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Director of OPM and the Secretary of DOD or their designees.

In terms of 1997 constant dollars, however, the payroll declined by $2.4 billion during the 5-year downsizing period. Based on the change in the average cost per employee during fiscal years 1993 through 1997, the payroll cost could have been about $16.4 billion, or 16 percent, higher had there been no employee reductions.

These factors are discussed in more detail in chapter 3. Certain changes in the characteristics of the federal workforce also increased the overall federal payroll cost. However, while career steps, promotions, and performance pay increased the overall grade and payroll cost averages governmentwide, hiring and separation patterns had the combined effect of lessening the growth in the governmentwide average grade and payroll cost.
