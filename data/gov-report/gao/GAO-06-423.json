IT manufacturing, notably semiconductor manufacturing, has a longer history of offshoring of manufacturing operations. Under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, GAO addressed the following questions: (1) How has offshoring in semiconductor manufacturing and software services developed over time? (2)What factors enabled the expansion of offshoring in these industries? (3) As these industries have become more global, what have been the trends in their U.S.-based activities?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. semiconductor industry began offshoring labor-intensive manufacturing operations in the 1960s, followed in the 1970s and 1980s by increasingly complex operations, including wafer fabrication and some research and development (R&D) and design work. Semiconductor assembly and testing was the first to move to Asia, followed by fabrication and, more recently, by some design operations. Software services offshoring began in the 1990s after Internet communications made it possible to trade services such as software programming and software design. The year 2000 changeover hastened this offshoring trend related to software services because programmers knowledgeable in the appropriate programming languages were available, primarily in India. In the 2000s, firms further expanded their offshoring operations, based on the low-cost and high-quality work from the offshored services undertaken in the late 1990s. Although a lower labor cost was initially a key factor that attracted firms to offshore locations, other factors such as technological advances, available skilled workers, and foreign government policy, also played roles. Technological advances helped firms in the semiconductor industry improve their management of global supply chains and logistics. Regarding software services, technological advances opened the way to trade in programming and other software services. Foreign government policies in Taiwan and China created favorable investment conditions for U.S. semiconductor firms. India changed its emphasis from state-owned enterprises in the 1970s to an environment more amenable to private enterprise by the mid-1980s. Although its restrictions on foreign investment constrained the software services industry's overall development, India established software technology parks in 1990 to give domestic firms preferential access to the infrastructure essential for offshored operations. Although offshoring continues to grow in both the semiconductor manufacturing and software services industries, the United States remains one of the largest and most advanced producers of semiconductors and software services. U.S. production data show that both industries have largely rebounded from the 2001 recession. Employment data show a mixed picture, with semiconductor employment remaining flat and software employment mostly recovering. The United States has global trade surpluses in the semiconductors and software services sectors, although production is increasingly shifting to Asia. Both U.S. industries have become global, sourcing components from many locations overseas. U.S. firms have offshored increasingly complex products, essentially moving up the value chain. The ability of the United States to compete depends on research and development investment, innovative academic environments attracting top-quality students, and a competitive business environment. It will be important for U.S. businesses and policymakers to keep alert to technological changes and competitor countries' strategies while enhancing the elements of the innovation environment in the United States."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Foreign competition over the last several decades has contributed to a  decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, while U.S. firms have also  moved some production activities to foreign locations in order to reduce  costs or gain access to foreign markets. Concerns about U.S.  manufacturing job losses have been allayed somewhat by the prospect of  large numbers of high paying jobs developing in U.S. knowledge-based  services industries, such as in the information technology (IT) sector.  However, some types of knowledge-based services have become more  easily tradable within the past 10 years due to the spread of the Internet,  and concerns have now also arisen about what the offshoring of these  types of activities may mean for the United States.", "In response to widespread congressional interest, we have undertaken a  body of work related to offshoring under the Comptroller General\u2019s  authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. In this report, one in  a series of reports on services offshoring, we address offshoring trends in  two important U.S. information technology industries\u2014semiconductor  manufacturing and software services. To analyze the U.S. semiconductor  and U.S. software industries\u2019 experiences with offshoring, we addressed  the following questions:  How has offshoring in semiconductor manufacturing and software  services developed over time?", "What factors enabled the expansion of offshoring in these industries?", "As these industries have become more global, what have been the trends  in their U.S.\u2013based activities?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed data and other research to develop  a broad understanding of these industries. We conducted research on how  these industries developed offshoring relationships in specific countries\u2014 Taiwan and China for semiconductor manufacturing and India for software  services. We examined the available literature on both industries; analyzed  U.S. government data on foreign investment and trade in these industries;  and interviewed representatives from firms and private sector associations,  as well as industry analysts in the United States, Taiwan, China, and India.  We conducted our analysis in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards from October 2005 through August 2006.

For  example, if a U.S.-based company decides to move its computer  programming activities to an overseas supplier, this would be considered  offshoring. The overseas supplier may be an affiliate of the company, in  which case the company has also invested overseas. In contrast, the  supplier may be unrelated to the domestic company, in which case the  company has outsourced its computer programming activities, as well as  offshored them.", "Semiconductors are devices that enable computers and other products  such as telecommunication systems to store and process information.  Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to create \u201cchips,\u201d the  integrated circuits that are present in everyday electrical and electronic  products. It is a multiple-step sequence of photographic and chemical  processing steps during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a  wafer made of pure semiconducting material, most commonly silicon.  Improvement in the performance of increasingly sophisticated electronics  products depends on more powerful semiconductors that can store more  information and process it faster. Demand for semiconductors is driven by  the demand for computers and communications products that use them.", "The semiconductor manufacturing process can be divided into three  distinct stages: (1) design of the semiconductor integrated circuit, (2)  fabrication of the semiconductor wafer, and (3) assembly and testing of the  finished integrated circuit. The design and fabrication processes are the  most capital-intensive, while the assembly and testing process tends to be  more labor-intensive, although still relatively technologically sophisticated.  For example, semiconductors are designed by computer engineers with the  assistance of advanced software. They are then fabricated using chemicals,  gases, and materials combined in an intricate series of operations using  complex manufacturing equipment to produce wafers containing a large  number of chips. During assembly, the chips are assembled into the  finished semiconductor components and tested for defects. The finished  semiconductor consists of millions of transistors and other microscopic  components.", "The technological complexity of semiconductors is indicated by the  diameter of the wafer and the density of the etched lines (feature size) on  the wafer. The size of the wafer is an important element because the  number of chips per wafer increases dramatically as the wafer size  increases. The current leading-edge manufacturers produce 12-inch (300  millimeters) wafers. Smaller feature size measured in microns allows for  more components to be integrated on a single semiconductor, thus creating  more powerful semiconductors. Each reduction in feature size\u2014from 0.35  micron to 0.25 micron, for example\u2014is considered a move to greater  technological sophistication.", "The software services industry also includes several types of services and  levels of technological sophistication. Software services include writing  individual software programs or combined \u201cmodules;\u201d supporting these  programs and modules once they are installed on computers; designing  software networks, which might include various software programs, as  well as systems of networks;  integrating and maintaining these networks  and systems as they are applied to clients\u2019 tasks; and managing and  operating clients\u2019 overall computer systems.", "Software services are now broadly diffused throughout the U.S. economy.  Firms across most industries now use some form of software services\u2014 whether it is basic accounting software, inventory control software, or a  much more complex software product applied to manufacturing  operations. Automobile companies, for example, use advanced computer  software in the design of new car models, on production lines that  manufacture these cars, and in the cars themselves that now contain  electronic components.", "Software services generally range in complexity from routine software  programming and testing to complex software programming, software  project management, and higher-end software systems integration,  architecture, and research. In general, software programs and modules can  be produced in various locations; integrating these requires some focal  points capable of working closely with the various locations.", "Both semiconductor manufacturing and software services are key  industries within the broader information and communications technology  (ICT) sector; they have contributed significantly to overall U.S. growth and  productivity. For example, semiconductor and related device  manufacturing in the United States represents about 24 percent of the total  value of the ICT sector\u2019s computer and electronic products manufacturing.  Software services comprise about 48 percent of the total production of the  categories of services industries included in the broader ICT sector\u2014 publishing industries (includes software), information and data processing  services, and computer systems design and related services (averaged over  1990 to 2004).", "Although the ICT sector represents a small share of the overall U.S.  economy (about 4 percent), it has contributed significantly to U.S.  economic expansion. According to the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau  of Economic Analysis (BEA), the ICT sector accounted for about 11  percent of total economywide value-added growth in 2004. Examining  value-added growth is a useful way to compare growth rates across  industries because it measures only the increase in output due to that  industry, excluding any inputs or materials from other industries.  Therefore, value-added growth measures the changes in output due to  increases in factors such as labor and capital and to improvements in the  productivity of those factors. Figure 1 shows that, from 2002 to 2004, the  ICT sector\u2019s growth in real value added accelerated more than any other  industry group. Although the ICT sector\u2019s growth slowed in 2001 during the  recession, annual real growth has recently accelerated from 2.0 percent in  2002, to 6.7 percent in 2003, and to 12.9 percent in 2004.", "The ICT sector also contributes to productivity in the rest of the economy.  For example, other manufacturing and services sectors, such as  automobiles and banking, have become more productive as they have used  the latest products and advances from the ICT sector. Economic research  has generally found that the investments made in ICT sector products by  other industries contributed to a rapid economywide increase in  productivity during the 1990s. In addition, the technological advances and  competition within the sector have resulted in declining prices and rising  performance in ICT products. This, in turn, has contributed to lower rates  of inflation throughout the economy as other sectors benefit from these  improvements.", "We present information on multinational companies\u2019 global operations in  semiconductor and software services in appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Firms Continue to Offshore Increasingly Complex Semiconductor Manufacturing Activities and Software Services", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. semiconductor industry has foreign operations in several  locations, notably in Taiwan and China.

Firms domestically  sourced the design and fabrication of higher-skilled, more capital-intensive  semiconductor manufacturing activities and then shipped the  semiconductors to Asia for assembly. The finished semiconductors were  returned to the United States for final testing and shipment to the  customer. According to some industry experts, offshoring of assembly  work kept the U.S. semiconductor industry cost-competitive as new foreign  rivals emerged in countries such as Japan.", "The overall U.S. business models for semiconductor manufacturing  changed in the 1980s. Two types of company models developed for  semiconductor production. Some companies, known as Integrated Device  Manufacturers (IDMs), conduct their own research, produce their own  designs, and operate their own fabrication plants to produce semiconductor wafers. Other companies, known as fabless design firms,  develop their own designs and contract with independent fabrication  plants, known as foundries, to produce their wafers. Foundries emerged  during the 1980s as firms in Asia, particularly Taiwan, began to specialize in  wafer fabrication. With the emergence of overseas foundries, U.S. firms  developed global supply chains for sourcing different parts of the  semiconductor production process over multiple global locations. They  continued to design in the United States and other developed countries,  while contracting with foundries in Taiwan to perform capital-intensive  wafer fabrication. They also continued domestic fabrication, but Asian  countries increased their share of overall production\u2014with Taiwan  expanding as a major supplier of fabrication services and China emerging  as a new source of fabrication services in the late 1990s.", "In recent years, some U.S. firms have offshored increasingly complex  semiconductor fabrication and design activities\u2014essentially going up the  value chain (see fig. 2). As firms in other countries, notably Taiwan, became  more adept at producing more complex semiconductors, U.S. firms  increasingly turned to offshore manufacturers to produce these  semiconductors. The most complex semiconductors now manufactured in  fabrication plants (commonly called fabs) are 12-inch (300 millimeter)  wafers with submicron feature size. U.S. firms were leaders in developing  12-inch wafers. According to industry experts, firms have offshored design  services to Taiwan due, in part, to maintain close contact with Asian  customers to meet their specific requirements. Also, as semiconductor  manufacturing becomes more complex, some experts have noted, it  becomes all the more important to develop close relationships among  design and manufacturing activities, so as to enable feedback discussions.", "The gap in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities has narrowed  between the United States and Taiwan and China. Currently, Taiwanese and  Chinese foundries are capable of producing technologically sophisticated  semiconductors. For example, Taiwanese foundries are now capable of  producing integrated circuits as small as 0.09 microns, and some Taiwanese  firms provide design services to support this level of semiconductor  technology. In addition, according to industry experts, the newest  semiconductor manufacturing facilities in China are capable of producing  integrated circuits up to 0.13 microns in size, with one Chinese foundry  known to be producing circuits at the 0.09 micron size.

These industries\u2019 overall business model is now a global one, in  which U.S. firms regularly consider a wide range of locations for their  operations and source different parts of their operations wherever the  advantages are most compelling. For the semiconductor industry, firms  initially offshored labor-intensive assembly activities to cut labor costs, but  more recently firms have offshored other activities for various reasons,  including proximity to other industry suppliers, closer relations with  foreign customers, benefits offered by foreign governments, and the  availability of both skilled and unskilled human capital. In the software  industry, the offshoring trend is more recent, but the motivations are  similar.", "For software services, however, an important difference may be the  possible speed and scale of employment shifts. Software services  offshoring, compared with semiconductor manufacturing offshoring, does  not need the same physical infrastructure, such as ports, roads, and  factories, and thus can be set up more quickly. It is more labor intensive  than capital intensive, and thus may be more sensitive to wage differentials.  In addition, service occupations related to software programming are large  in comparison to manufacturing jobs in the semiconductor industry. In  semiconductor manufacturing, there was relatively slow movement up the  value chain as firms invested in the overseas workforce and factory  facilities. India\u2019s software industry development has advanced more  quickly, with rapid technological changes bringing large numbers of highly  educated, but underused, English-speaking workers to the doorstep of  firms willing to operate from India.

Semiconductor  products, for example, can be identified and inspected at U.S. borders,  whereas software imports and exports can be transmitted almost  instantaneously over the Internet.", "Government policies also played important, but different, roles in Taiwan,  China, and India; however, all three governments have placed high  importance on education. In recent years, China has been transforming  large parts of its coastal cities through massive infrastructure investments  and has provided more targeted inducements for firms, such as support for  science and technology parks and various types of financial assistance.  India liberalized parts of its central government apparatus in the early  1990s, but its investment in physical infrastructure such as roads and ports  has been much more limited, although India has also supported its science  parks and put in place advanced telecommunications infrastructure  improvements. These incentives for software exporters appear to have  been well targeted.", "The comparison of these two offshoring experiences offers some insights  for U.S. policies. Clearly, a large and well-educated population appears to  be a central element to success in both semiconductor manufacturing and  software services activities.
