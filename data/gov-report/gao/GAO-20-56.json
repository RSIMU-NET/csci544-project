Detection standards specify the prohibited items (e.g., guns, explosives) that technologies are to detect, the minimum rate of detection, and the maximum rate at which technologies incorrectly flag an item. TSA operationalizes standards by adapting them as detection requirements, working with manufacturers to develop and test new technologies (software or hardware), and acquiring and deploying technologies to airports. For the standards GAO reviewed, this process took 2 to 7 years, based on manufacturers' technical abilities and other factors.", "TSA's deployment decisions are generally based on logistical factors and it is unclear how risk is considered when determining where and in what order technologies are deployed because TSA did not document its decisions. TSA considers risks across the civil aviation system when making acquisition decisions. However, TSA did not document the extent risk played a role in deployment, and could not fully explain how risk analyses contributed to those decisions. Moving forward, increased transparency about TSA's decisions would better ensure that deployment of technologies matches potential risks.", "Technology performance can degrade over time; however, TSA does not ensure that technologies continue to meet detection requirements after deployment to airports. TSA certifies technologies to ensure they meet requirements before deployment, and screeners are to regularly calibrate deployed technologies to demonstrate they are minimally operational. However, neither process ensures that technologies continue to meet requirements after deployment. In 2015 and 2016, DHS tested a sample of deployed explosives trace detection and bottled liquid scanner units and found that some no longer met detection requirements. Developing and implementing a process to ensure technologies continue to meet detection requirements after deployment would help ensure that TSA screening procedures are effective and enable TSA to take corrective action if needed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that TSA document analysis of risk in deploying technologies, and implement a process to ensure technologies continue to meet detection requirements after deployment.

The ongoing threat of terrorism and the projected growth in air  travelers require TSA to continually assess the effectiveness of screening  operations. This includes identifying new and emerging threats, assessing  potential risks to the aviation system, and, if necessary, developing and  deploying new screening technologies.

We identified nine technologies used to screen passengers  and their carry-on bags (two of these were in operation at select airports  as pilot projects) and two technologies used for screening checked  baggage. Additional details on the screening technologies we reviewed,  including their function and the number of units deployed, are in appendix  I. We assessed the reliability of the inventory data by interviewing agency  officials and reviewing related documentation, such as the database user  manual, and determined the data were sufficiently reliable to identify the  type and number of screening technologies deployed.", "We conducted site visits to seven commercial airports to observe the  operation of screening technologies in the airport setting. We selected the  airports to reflect a range of airport categories, technologies, and  geographic diversity. The results of these site visits and interviews  cannot be generalized to all commercial airports, but they provided us  with important context about the installation, use, and maintenance of  screening technologies across the different categories of commercial  airports.

We  assessed the reliability of the life-cycle cost data estimates by reviewing  TSA\u2019s methodology for developing the estimates and interviewing TSA  officials, and determined the estimates were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We identified estimated costs by multiplying the estimated per- unit-cost of each technology, by phase, against the number of units  deployed to commercial airports as of September 24, 2018, using  inventory data from the Government Property Management database. We  chose this methodology in consultation with TSA officials and after  determining that historical records of expenditures and obligations were  not complete and do not provide consistent and sufficient detail for the  purposes of our analysis. Because the life-cycle cost estimates were  developed in different years, we used TSA guidelines to adjust costs for  inflation and convert our estimates to 2018 dollars.

TSA does not always or immediately operationalize detection  standards, for reasons which are explained later in this report.", "To operationalize a detection standard, TSA must acquire technology  capable of meeting the standard. TSA officials told us they follow DHS  acquisition policies and procedures when acquiring new screening  technologies. Officials said they adapt detection standards as detection  requirements to guide the acquisition process, meaning the specifications  described in the standards are incorporated into the requirements  manufacturers must meet when developing new technology. Once  manufacturers have developed new technologies that meet detection  requirements, the technologies undergo a test and evaluation process,  known as the qualification process. The following are key steps in that  process:  1.  Certification \u2013 Certification is a preliminary step in TSA\u2019s qualification  process. For TSA to certify that a screening technology meets its  detection requirements, S&T\u2019s Transportation Security Laboratory  conducts certification testing on a manufacturer\u2019s initial submission of  its proposed screening technology to determine whether it meets  TSA\u2019s detection requirements (i.e., the rate at which it must accurately  detect each category of explosive it is designed to detect, among  other things).  2.  Integration/Implementation Testing \u2013 TSA Systems Integration Facility  administers qualification testing to test system performance against  additional requirements, such as reliability, availability, and  maintainability. TSA also conducts field testing to ensure readiness for  operational test and evaluation.  3.  Operational Test and Evaluation - TSA deploys units to selected  airports to conduct operational testing. Operational testing allows TSA  to evaluate the operational effectiveness, suitability, and cyber  resiliency of the technology in a realistic environment.", "After new technologies have been tested and approved, TSA can  purchase and deploy them to commercial airports.

Beginning in the early 2000s,  homemade explosives replaced military and  conventional explosives as the preferred tool  of terrorists, and challenged the capabilities of  existing screening technologies. Unlike  conventional threats, homemade explosives  are often made of common commercial items  and it can be challenging to distinguish them  from innocuous gels and liquids stored in  personal baggage or cargo.

Our review of  the document found that, as of August 2019, it did not accurately reflect  (1) designated procedures for developing detection standards, (2) the  roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders such as S&T, and (3) TSA\u2019s  organizational structure. For example, one way in which the 2015  guidance has not been updated is in the designated procedures it  describes for reviewing available intelligence information. Specifically, the  guidance calls for an annual assessment of emerging threats, which a  senior TSA official told us TSA no longer conducts because relevant  emerging threats are now occurring more frequently and intelligence  information is processed on an ongoing basis.", "In another example, the guidance specifies that TSA will form working  groups composed of agency officials and stakeholders to assess potential  threat materials and develop an analysis plan, and that each working  group will define the roles and responsibilities of its members. According  to a senior TSA official, the agency does not convene working groups to  assess intelligence or develop an analysis plan, although officials  regularly meet with stakeholders to discuss the steps needed to  characterize new threat materials and document the minutes from these  meetings.", "Finally, while the guidance discusses in detail which TSA offices and  management positions are responsible for implementing and overseeing  the process, the agency has since reorganized and these offices and  positions no longer exist.

We found that  TSA and S&T produced a series of detailed material threat assessments  to document the characterization of threat materials and consistently  developed action memos to justify proposed detection standards.  However, we also found that in five of the seven material threat  assessments we reviewed TSA and S&T did not consistently document  key steps in the testing and analyses of materials, such as how selected  samples were prepared for testing. For example, one S&T material threat  assessment we reviewed did not document the method used to  synthesize (chemically produce) material samples used for testing. Not  documenting the method could prevent officials from fully understanding  the results of the analysis. Specifically, the assessment noted that there  are multiple methods of synthesis, and that the chosen method could  affect the makeup of the resulting material and therefore the ability of the  screening technologies to detect it. Additionally, while two of the seven  material threat assessments cited standard operating procedures for  sample preparation for all participating laboratories, three did not cite  standard operating procedures for at least one laboratory and two stated  that sample preparation information had not been provided by one or  more of the participating laboratories. Without documentation, TSA might  not have all the necessary information to address future issues involving  detection of these materials.", "We also found four instances in which TSA did not clearly document why  select materials were sent for additional testing or did not document key  decisions regarding the development and consideration of detection  standards. For example, S&T performed additional testing and analysis  on select threat materials after the material threat assessment was  finalized. However, the documentation of this additional testing left out  key elements regarding how and why the additional testing was needed  and conducted. The action memo documenting new standards based on  the results of the additional testing did not include a justification for why  specific threat materials were selected for additional data collection.  While a test plan for equivalency testing of one material stated that the  additional testing was conducted because data reported in the literature  were not considered representative of current threat configurations,  similar justification was not included in the action memo justifying  changes to the new standard based on the additional testing. Finally, a  senior TSA official told us he requested the additional equivalency testing  because the values in the previous detection standards appeared to be  more conservative than expected and there was no documentation  explaining how TSA had arrived at those numbers.

Officials  said they approved a subsequent standard, 4.1, in January 2012, began  deploying technology to meet it in October 2014, and completed the  deployment in September 2017. Officials said it took 3 years to complete  deployment because the demand for advanced imaging technology  increased over time as airports experienced an increase in passenger  volumes, among other reasons. Since 2012, TSA approved two additional  detection standards for advanced imaging technology\u20144.3 in February  2016 and 4.3.1 in August 2016.

They said  they make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, depending on many  factors. These include whether: (1) manufacturers have the technological  ability, (2) a new technology is in development, and (3) screening  technologies already have the capability.", "Manufacturers do not have the technological ability. TSA officials said  manufacturers do not always have the technical ability to meet detection  standards. According to officials, it can be challenging for manufacturers  to develop the technology necessary to detect new threats as presented  in a detection standard, and in some cases impossible without further  research and development. For example, TSA officials said that  manufacturers have been unable to develop the requisite technology to  meet the most recent detection standards (4.3 and 4.3.1) for advanced  imaging technology. However, TSA officials said they have expanded  their research and development efforts to try to develop the technology.  TSA officials told us they plan to continue developing detection standards  irrespective of the capabilities of currently deployed technologies so that  they can focus on identifying emerging threats. The new detection  standards then serve to set expectations for manufacturers about the  capability to which they should aspire and justify research and  development necessary to realize that capability. To better manage the  difference between the capabilities of deployed technologies and the  capabilities described in detection standards, TSA officials said they are  in the process of developing a new position of Capability Manager, who  would be responsible for managing the development of mission-essential  capabilities\u2014such as carry-on baggage screening\u2014from start to finish.  Officials said they expect this position will help bridge the gap between  approved detection standards and the detection capabilities of deployed  screening technologies over time, because the managers will have cross- cutting oversight of the process.", "A new technology is in development. Officials said that they may not  operationalize a detection standard if they expect a new type of screening  technology will replace an existing one. For example, officials said that  TSA is exploring new alarm resolution technologies\u2014that is, screening  technologies that are used to determine whether alarms are false  positives. Officials said new alarm resolution technologies may replace  the bottled liquid scanner in the future, and therefore they have not  pursued operationalizing detection standard 2.3.", "Screening technologies already have the capability. According to TSA  officials, new detection standards do not always add significant detection  capabilities. For example, officials decided not to operationalize bottled  liquid scanner detection standard 3.0 when it was approved in 2017  because the deployed units already had most of the capabilities called for  in the detection standard; TSA developed the new standard to better align  with standards for other technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Deployment Decisions are Generally Based on Logistical Factors, and the Extent to Which TSA Considers Risk Is Unclear Because Decision- Making Lacks Documentation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Assesses Risks and Capability Gaps When Determining Acquisition Needs", "paragraphs": ["Our review of TSA acquisition documents found that TSA considers risk  at the beginning of the screening technologies acquisition process..

Figure 4 provides an  overview of TSA\u2019s acquisition process for new screening technologies.", "Risk assessment. TSA uses intelligence information and modeling tools,  such as the Risk and Trade Space Portfolio Analysis, to assess risk to the  aviation system. The Risk and Trade Space Portfolio Analysis was  developed in 2014 to analyze the security effectiveness of alternate  combinations of some aviation security countermeasures. Officials said a  recent example of a risk-informed deployment decision influenced by the  Risk and Trade Space Portfolio Analysis was TSA\u2019s 2017 deployment of  141 advanced imaging technology units to category III and IV airports.  Officials said that around 2014, TSA received intelligence about a  potential terrorist threat to airports, as well as the results of covert testing  at airports that identified screening vulnerabilities. Officials said a 2014  Risk and Trade Space Portfolio Analysis also identified disparities in  screening capabilities at smaller airports. In part because of the  vulnerability identified by these three factors, as well as ongoing  conversations between TSA senior leadership, the DHS Inspector  General, and members of Congress, officials said TSA procured and  deployed additional advanced imaging technology units to some category  III and IV airports that did not have them.", "Capability analysis. TSA uses the Transportation Security Capability  Analysis Process, a structured decision-making tool, to identify and  prioritize capability gaps and help direct agency resources towards  closing critical gaps to an acceptable level. When existing screening  capabilities do not fully meet TSA\u2019s mission needs, the associated  capability gap presents a security risk. As part of the Transportation  Security Capability Analysis Process, TSA produces Capability Analysis  Reports that identify and recommend solutions to closing capability gaps.  Recommendations have included procedural changes, such as new  training for TSOs, and investments in new technology. TSA\u2019s investment  in computed tomography technology for checkpoint screening of carry-on  baggage is an example of TSA\u2019s implementation of the Transportation  Security Capability Analysis Process to validate capability gaps and  identify recommended courses of action.

Officials noted the exception to this assumption is a handful of  airports that are consistently considered to be the highest risk because of  known threats and a high volume of international travelers.", "Further, officials said that if they had information about a threat to a  specific airport that would be mitigated by deploying a screening  technology, they would modify their plans for deployment accordingly.", "However, TSA\u2019s process for how it would change its deployment plans to  specific airports based on risk lacks transparency. For example, officials  said that as part of the acquisition process they have ongoing discussions  with stakeholders about their deployment strategies, including security  and intelligence officials who would inform them of any relevant risk  information. Officials said these discussions are generally informal and  not documented\u2014it was unclear how these discussions have  incorporated information about risk in the past, and officials could not  provide an example of when risk information at specific airports had  directly influenced deployment of technologies to airports in the recent  past.", "In 2018, the agency released its Transportation Security Administration  Systems Acquisition Manual, which called for deployment plans to be  written documents, and officials said they began documenting their plans  for deploying screening technologies in the last two years. TSA officials  provided us with one deployment plan\u2014for their 2018 deployment of  explosives trace detection units\u2014but we found that it was not transparent  about how risk was a factor in officials\u2019 methodology for determining the  order of airports to receive the technology. The explosives trace  detection plan documented TSA\u2019s schedule of deployment and the roles  and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders, among other things.  However, while the plan indicated that officials would coordinate with  relevant offices within the agency for information about risks that might  impact their deployment strategy, we found that the plan did not  document how risk had informed their decisions about where and how to  deploy the technology, including the assumptions, methodology, and  uncertainties considered.", "Additionally, TSA officials did not document, and could not fully explain,  how risk analyses contributed to and factored into the following specific  deployment decisions.", "Deployment of advanced imaging technology to smaller airports.  Officials said many factors influenced their decision to deploy advanced  imaging technology units to category III and IV airports, including  information about threats and a related 2014 risk analysis. However,  officials did not document their decisions and could not fully explain their  risk analysis, including their process for analyzing and weighing relevant  factors. According to officials, the decision was made during discussions  with senior leadership, which were risk-informed and supported by  whiteboard analyses and classified documents. Additionally, officials told  us that, for practical reasons, they deployed units to those category III  and IV airports that had the space to accommodate them, but did not  further assess the priority of deployment among the smaller airports  because they had determined that the risk was uniform and because they  planned to deploy the units within a short timeframe. Officials did not  document the risk assessment that led to this determination, and could  not explain how the three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability, and  consequence\u2014were used or assessed.", "Deployment of targeted threat algorithm.

After testing the operational impacts of the software  algorithm, the agency decided to stop further deployment. The  documentation TSA provided did not explain how officials had analyzed  the risk-mitigation benefits of the algorithm, including the underlying  assumptions and uncertainty, or how they had weighed those benefits  against the operational impacts and costs when they made their decision  not to fully deploy the algorithm.", "TSA officials said they follow the DHS acquisition process to acquire and  deploy technologies and their deployment decisions are based on, and  informed by, their initial assessments of capability gaps, as well as their  understanding that every airport offers equal entry into the aviation  system. However, officials had not documented the rationale for these  decisions and could not fully explain how risk had informed their decisions  about where and in what order to deploy screening technologies.", "DHS\u2019s Risk Management Fundamentals states that components should  consistently and comprehensively incorporate risk management into all  aspects of the planning and execution of their organizational missions.  Additionally, it says transparency is vitally important in homeland security  risk management, and documentation should include transparent  disclosure of the rationale behind decisions, including the assumptions,  methodology, and the uncertainty considered. By fully disclosing what risk  factors are weighed and how decisions are made, TSA officials can better  ensure that their deployment of screening technologies matches potential  risks (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences).

These factors  influence the number of units of a technology the agency deploys to  airports, the order in which they deploy them, and where they are  deployed.", "Officials said they use modeling software to determine the most efficient  number of units to allocate to an airport for each type of screening  system. This analysis takes into account variables such as the number  of flights at an airport, airport passenger volumes, items per passenger,  and secondary search rates. Additionally, agency officials said the layout  of an airport is a significant determining factor for the number of units it  receives. For example, an airport that has centralized checked baggage  screening areas will need fewer explosives detection systems than an  airport that has checked baggage screening areas dispersed in different  locations.", "Additionally, TSA officials said that logistical and funding factors can  influence the order of deployment, including the manufacturer\u2019s ability and  resources to develop and deliver technologies. For example, as of June  2019, officials said the agency was in the process of updating the  detection capabilities of 62 percent of its advanced technology x-ray fleet  because one of its two manufacturers had completed testing and  certification of the new technology, but the second manufacturer\u2019s  technology had yet to be certified. Officials said they also try to plan  their deployment schedule around minimizing disruptions to airport  operations, so if an airport could not absorb a full deployment of a  technology because it would affect too many passengers, TSA would  schedule the deployment in phases to minimize disruptions.", "Further, TSA officials said that, as a result of these many logistical  considerations, they generally fully deploy new screening technologies to  category X airports first\u2014generally, airports with the highest passenger  volumes\u2014and then proceed in order down to the airport with the lowest  passenger volume. Officials said larger airports generally have the  infrastructure in place to incorporate new technology without extensive  disruption to operations, and they will screen the most passengers by  deploying screening technologies to the largest airports first."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Does Not Ensure That Screening Technologies Continue to Meet Detection Requirements after Deployment to Airports", "paragraphs": ["TSA practices do not ensure that screening technologies continue to  meet detection requirements after they have been deployed to airports.  According to agency officials, the agency uses certification to confirm that  technologies meet detection requirements before they are deployed to  airports, and calibration to confirm that technologies are at least minimally  operational while in use at airports. Officials stated these processes are  sufficient to assure TSA that screening technologies are operating as  intended. However, while certification and calibration serve important  purposes in the acquisition and operation of screening technologies, they  have not ensured that TSA screening technologies continue to meet  detection requirements after they have been deployed.", "Certification occurs prior to deployment. TSA\u2019s certification process is  designed to ensure screening technologies meet detection requirements  during the acquisition process, prior to the procurement and deployment  of the technologies, but it does not ensure screening technologies  continue to meet detection requirements after deployment. As previously  described, manufacturers provide an initial submission of the screening  technology to TSA for certification testing as part of the acquisition  process. During the certification process, S&T\u2019s Transportation Security  Laboratory tests the technology under controlled conditions to determine  whether it meets TSA\u2019s detection requirements. After TSA certifies that a  screening technology meets detection requirements and it undergoes  additional testing to determine whether it meets other TSA requirements  in controlled testing facilities, TSA may deploy it to select airports for  operational testing and evaluation to determine how it performs in an  airport setting. Certification testing demonstrates that a manufacturer\u2019s  screening technology meets detection requirements during the acquisition  process, which allows TSA to determine whether it should continue to  consider the technology for acquisition.", "Certification does not ensure that deployed technologies continue to meet  detection requirements because it does not account for the possibility that  performance of technologies can degrade over time throughout the  technologies\u2019 lifecycles after deployment. For example, in 2015 and 2016,  DHS removed a sample of deployed explosives trace detection and  bottled liquid scanner units from airports for testing in the Transportation  Security Laboratory. The laboratory concluded that some deployed units  for each technology it tested no longer met detection requirements\u2014 either the required probability of detection for certain explosives or the  required rate for false alarm, or both. One explosives trace detection unit  that was tested was found to have a probability of detection much lower  than required. According to TSA officials, the units did not meet detection  requirements because they were not adequately maintained, which  affected their performance. In light of this, officials stated that they  introduced better controls to ensure that routine preventative  maintenance is performed as required. However, because TSA does not  test the units after they are deployed to airports, it cannot determine the  extent to which these controls ensure technologies continue to meet  detection requirements. Officials noted that TSA uses a layered security  approach at airports, so if one layer should fail\u2014such as a deployed  technology\u2014the agency can still rely on other security measures among  the various layers of security to detect threats. We have previously  reported on the importance that TSA ensure each measure is effective to  make the best use of its limited resources, in order to serve its aviation  security mission.", "Calibration does not test whether technologies meet detection  requirements. TSA officials stated that daily calibration also helps ensure  that screening technologies continue to meet detection requirements after  deployment. However, while calibration demonstrates that the screening  technology is at least minimally operational, it is not designed to test  whether the screening technology meets detection requirements. For  example, each explosives detection system is calibrated with an  operational test kit that contains items of various densities. To calibrate  explosives detection systems, a TSO must run the operational test kit  through the unit and verify that the item is correctly displayed on the  monitor (see figure 5 below). This process demonstrates whether the  system can identify the known items\u2019 densities, but it does not ensure that  the system meets detection requirements. As a result, calibration could  indicate that the unit is functioning even when its detection capabilities  have degraded\u2014that is, calibration determines that the technology is  functional, but it does not ensure that the technology is meeting detection  requirements.", "TSA officials stated that they plan to develop a process to review  screening technologies on an annual basis to analyze their performance,  including detection over time. TSA officials stated that, as of August 2019,  they were actively working on developing a review process for the  explosives detection system but did not have a date for when they  planned to complete it. TSA officials for the passenger and carry-on  screening technologies stated that they had not yet started developing a  review process for those technologies and the timeline for developing a  review process will depend on funding.", "TSA officials also noted that there are challenges in designing a process  to ensure that screening technologies continue to meet detection  requirements after deployment. For example, TSA and S&T officials  stated that it is not feasible to conduct live explosives testing in airports.  Further, according to TSA officials, while it is relatively easy to temporarily  transfer smaller screening technologies, such as explosives trace  detection and bottled liquid scanner units, to a controlled setting for live  explosives testing, it would not be feasible to transfer larger installed  units, such as advanced imaging technology. Although testing with live  explosives in an airport poses undue risks and transferring larger  machines for testing may be costly, TSA could develop other measures.", "TSA officials stated that there is no requirement to ensure that its  screening technologies continue to meet detection requirements after  deployment to airports. However, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government calls for agencies to establish and operate a system  to continuously monitor the quality of performance over time. Without  taking additional steps to ensure screening technologies are meeting  detection requirements, TSA may run the risk that its deployed screening  technologies are not detecting explosives and other prohibited items.  Developing and implementing a process to monitor screening  technologies\u2019 detection performance over time would help provide TSA  assurance that screening technologies continue to meet detection  requirements, as appropriate, after deployment.

Further, TSA estimates additional life-cycle costs  of $804 million to acquire, deploy, and maintain computed tomography  systems through fiscal year 2026. The following provides more  information on these estimated expenditures.", "Airport modifications. TSA incurs costs related to modifying commercial  airports to accommodate certain screening technologies, such as  checked baggage screening systems (e.g., explosives detection  systems). In December 2017, we reported that TSA had obligated at least  $783 million from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to reimburse airports for  the allowable design and construction costs associated with installing,  updating, or replacing screening technology. For example, TSA may  enter into agreements to reimburse airport operators for a percentage of  the allowable design and construction costs associated with facility  modifications needed for installing, updating, or replacing in-line  explosives detection systems. In-line screening systems use conveyor  belts to route checked luggage through explosives detection systems,  which capture images of the checked baggage to determine if a bag  contains threat items not permitted for transport, including explosives.  From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, agreements for TSA  reimbursements to airports for checked baggage screening systems  generally ranged in value from $50,000 to $150 million. As we reported  in December 2017, in general, depending on the airport\u2019s size, TSA will  reimburse 90 or 95 percent of the allowable, allocable, and reasonable  cost of certain projects. For other projects, TSA may provide 100 percent  reimbursement\u2014for example, where existing systems require the  correction of security or safety deficiencies.", "Computed tomography. In addition to its fiscal year 2018 inventory, TSA  is currently in the process of deploying computed tomography to  commercial airports to replace advanced technology x-ray systems.  Computed tomography technology applies sophisticated algorithms to  detect explosives and other prohibited items and creates a 3D image of  carry-on baggage that a TSO can view and rotate 360 degrees. In fiscal  year 2018, TSA determined that computed tomography is the best  technology available to address rapidly evolving threats in the  transportation sector, and plans to eventually deploy it to all checkpoints  and replace advanced technology x-ray technology.

As shown in table 2,  TSA also planned to spend $805 million to purchase, deploy, and  maintain this new technology through fiscal year 2026. However, in  August 2019, TSA officials told us that they expect this estimated total  procurement cost of $805 million to likely decrease as the per unit cost  had decreased from $400,000 to $233,000 in the initial fiscal year 2019  contract for computed tomography."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["TSA has invested billions of dollars in screening technologies as it  responds to terrorists\u2019 attempts to use homemade explosives to disrupt  and damage civil aviation.

Additionally, by  documenting key decisions in the development of detection standards,  TSA could better assure the effectiveness of decision-making and the  retention of organizational knowledge in the face of inevitable changes in  personnel.", "Similarly, when making technology deployment decisions, incorporating  DHS-recommended practices for risk management would improve TSA\u2019s  ability to effectively fulfill its mission to secure the nation\u2019s civil aviation  system. While TSA assesses risk when deciding whether to invest in a  new technology to address an identified capability gap, it is unclear the  extent to which it considers risk when determining where and in what  order to deploy approved screening technologies to airports. DHS  guidance for homeland security risk management calls for risk to be  considered consistently and comprehensively in all aspects of an  agency\u2019s work. Additionally, risk management includes transparent  disclosure of the rationale behind decision-making so that stakeholders  can understand how key factors were weighed. Incorporating these risk  management principles into its decision-making for deploying screening  technologies to airports would allow TSA to align its deployment  strategies with potential threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.", "Lastly, TSA cannot ensure that its screening technologies continue to  meet detection requirements after they have been deployed to airports.

DHS stated that  TSA will continue to include a comparable level of documentation in  future deployment plans for screening technologies. We agree the  computed tomography deployment site selection strategy is an example  of how TSA can document the rationale governing the deployment of a  screening technology. Future plans can further benefit by explaining the  risk analysis itself along with the role that risk considerations played in the  selection of airports for deployment.

To observe TSA screening procedures  and the operation of screening technologies in the airport setting, we  conducted site visits to seven commercial airports. During these visits we  discussed screening technology issues with TSA federal security  directors or their representatives. We selected these airports to reflect a  range of airport categories, technologies, and geographic diversity.

We requested information about  the detection standards that deployed screening technologies met, as of  August 2019, as well as subsequently approved detection standards,  including the date the standards were approved, the dates when TSA  achieved certain acquisition milestones when developing and deploying  the associated technologies, and the status of ongoing and upcoming  efforts to update detection capabilities to meet new standards. We  identified the acquisition milestones by reviewing a past GAO report on  TSA\u2019s acquisition process and in consultation with GAO acquisition  experts. We also reviewed a classified TSA report that evaluated the  performance of a particular algorithm in order to understand TSA\u2019s  process for developing new screening technologies to meet detection  standards. In addition, we reviewed relevant acquisition documents, such  as DHS\u2019s Acquisition Management Instruction 102, the 2018  Transportation Security Administration Systems Acquisition Manual,  acquisition decision memos, acquisition plans, and Operations  Requirements Documents. To understand TSA\u2019s process for deciding  whether to operationalize detection standards, we requested and  reviewed available documentation for the standards that TSA had not  operationalized, such as an operational status transition memo for bottled  liquid scanner, and interviewed TSA officials about those decisions.", "To understand how TSA had considered risk in its approach to deploying  screening technologies at airports, we reviewed available documentation  related to TSA\u2019s deployment decisions. These included decision memos  from acquisition review board meetings and action memos to TSA  leadership; risk registers for checked baggage and checkpoint acquisition  programs; available deployment plans, such as the agency\u2019s Action Plan  for deploying explosives trace detection units to airports in 2018; and  acquisition guidance. To understand how TSA assesses capability  needs and gaps, we interviewed agency officials about TSA\u2019s  Transportation Security Capability Analysis Process and reviewed  capability analysis reports from 2018 and 2019, as well as TSA\u2019s  prioritized list of capability gaps and needs. We also interviewed  acquisition officials, including TSA\u2019s Component Acquisition Executive,  about the role of risk in deployment decisions and requested written  responses to specific questions. We assessed TSA\u2019s decision-making  process for deploying and updating screening technologies, generally,  against DHS risk management criteria, such as DHS\u2019s Risk Management  Fundamentals. We also reviewed related areas of risk management and  decision-making to understand the context in which TSA makes  deployment decisions. Specifically, we reviewed the 2017 Transportation  Sector Security Risk Assessment and the Cities and Airports Threat  Assessment reports to understand the risks facing the nation\u2019s aviation  system. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s enterprise risk management  framework, such as the Enterprise Risk Management Policy Manual, to  understand the role it played in TSA\u2019s deployment decisions. We also  interviewed an official from TSA\u2019s Enterprise Performance and Risk office  and the Executive Risk Steering Committee. To understand how TSA  categorizes airports, we reviewed a 2017 Nationwide Airport  Categorization Review memo from TSA\u2019s Security Operations office and  interviewed Security Operations officials.", "To understand how TSA deploys screening technologies across airports  and categories of airports, we analyzed TSA\u2019s Deployed Locations  Report, which reported on technologies that were in use or available for  use at commercial airports from September 24 through September 30,  2018. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s standardized methodology for determining  the most efficient number of screening technologies at an airport.  Additionally, we reviewed TSA\u2019s Strategic Five-Year Technology  Investment Plan from 2015 and the 2017 Biennial Refresh to understand  TSA\u2019s plans for ongoing investment in screening technologies. We  reviewed various throughput data, such as annual passenger throughput  for all commercial airports for fiscal year 2018 and enplanements data for  calendar year 2017, to understand and compare TSA\u2019s allocation of  screening technologies with throughput data across airports and airport  categories. We used this analysis to identify airports that had an  unusually large or small number of screening technologies within a  category, and interviewed TSA officials to understand the decisions that  led to the allocation of screening technologies across airports and airport  categories.", "In addition, we reviewed the status of TSA\u2019s limited deployment of  computed tomography units to checkpoints. Specifically, we reviewed  TSA\u2019s 2018 Deployment Site Selection Strategy, which described the  airports to which TSA would deploy computed tomography units and the  methodology it used to select them, slides from recent conferences TSA  held with industry representatives where it shared its plans for  transitioning to computed tomography, and relevant Operational  Requirements Documents. We also interviewed agency officials about  their plans for the limited deployment and TSA\u2019s transition from advanced  technology x-ray to computed tomography for checkpoint screening.", "To determine the extent to which TSA ensures its screening technologies  continue meeting detection requirements after deploying them to airports,  we reviewed TSA acquisition detection requirements for each screening  technology as well as TSA guidance related to the testing and evaluation  of screening technologies identified by TSA officials in interviews. We  also interviewed TSA and S&T Transportation Security Laboratory  officials about TSA requirements to test screening technologies, both  prior to and after deployment, to determine the extent to which they meet  detection requirements. We also observed transportation security  officers and a transportation security specialist for explosives conduct  verification and calibration procedures on screening technologies at the  airports we visited. We reviewed TSA guidance to determine the extent  to which its procedures ensure that screening technologies continued to  meet detection requirements in airports. We then evaluated the  procedures against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government for monitoring.", "To identify TSA\u2019s estimated expenditures to purchase, deploy, install, and  maintain its inventory of screening technologies as of the end of fiscal  year 2018, we reviewed TSA programs\u2019 life-cycle cost estimates, which,  for the purposes of acquisition planning, provide per unit estimates of the  cost to purchase, deploy, install, and maintain passenger and checked  baggage screening technologies. We chose this methodology in  consultation with TSA officials and after determining that historical  records of obligations and expenditures do not provided consistent and  sufficient detail for the purposes of our analysis.", "The life-cycle cost estimates include relevant phases for each screening  technology (i.e., purchase, deploy, install, and maintain), although not all  technologies have cost estimates for each phase of the life cycle. For  example, some screening technologies may not specify deployment costs  because such costs are included in the initial purchase price of the unit. In  other cases, the technology does not have a deployment cost because  the unit is small and portable, and placement of the unit is therefore  handled by TSA airport staff at no charge. Estimated expenditures for  installation also include costs associated with site acceptance testing,  which is performed when a system is installed at its operational location.  Unlike the purchase, deploy, and install unit prices, the maintenance unit price is the yearly cost of maintenance for one unit, and therefore recurs  every year.", "We assessed the reliability of the life-cycle cost estimates by reviewing  documentation on the development of the estimates and interviewing TSA  officials, among other things, and determined the estimates were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of estimating the amount of funds  spent on acquiring, deploying, installing, and maintaining TSA\u2019s inventory  of screening technologies as of the end of fiscal year 2018. Because the  life-cycle cost estimates were developed in different years, we used TSA  guidelines to adjust costs for inflation and convert our estimates to 2018  dollars. We multiplied these estimates against the number of screening  technologies deployed to commercial airports as of September 24, 2018,  using data from TSA\u2019s Government Property Management database. For  computed tomography, we also obtained information on price and  quantity from the technology\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and TSA officials.  We also reviewed prior GAO work on TSA cost sharing programs for  airport facility modification related to installation of some of the  technologies in our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to December 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Estimated Expenditures for Screening Technologies", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that TSA spent $3.1 billion to purchase, deploy, install, and  maintain its inventory of screening technologies, as of the end of fiscal  year 2018, based on agency estimates of costs.
