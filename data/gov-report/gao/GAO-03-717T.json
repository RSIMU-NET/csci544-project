The federal personnel system is clearly broken in critical respects--designed for a time and workforce of an earlier era and not able to meet the needs and challenges of our current rapidly changing and knowledge-based environment. DOD's proposal recognizes that as GAO has stated and the experiences of leading public sector organizations here and abroad have found strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious government transformation effort. More generally, from a conceptual standpoint, GAO strongly supports the need to expand broad banding and pay for performance-based systems in the federal government. However, moving to quickly or prematurely at DOD or elsewhere, can significantly raise the risk of doing it wrong. This could also serve to severely set back the legitimate need to move to a more performance and results-based system for the federal government as a whole. Thus, while it is imperative that we take steps to better link employee pay and other personnel decisions to performance across the the federal government, how it is done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is done, can make all the difference in whether or not we are successful. In our view, one key need is to modernize performance management systems in executive agencies so that they are capable of supporting more performance-based pay and other personnel decisions. Unfortunately, based on GAO's past work, most existing federal performance appraisal systems, including a vast majority of DOD's systems, are not currently designed to support a meaningful performance-based pay system. The critical questions to consider are: should DOD and/or other agencies be granted broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what bas; and whether they have the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of the new authorities. This institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum, a human capital planning process that integrates the agency's human capital policies, strategies, and programs with its program goals and mission, and desired outcomes; the capabilities to effectively develop and implement a new human capital system; and, importantly, a set of adequate safeguards, including reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms to ensure the fair, effective, and credible implementation of a new system. In our view, Congress should consider providing governmentwide broad banding and pay for performance authorities that DOD and other federal agencies can use provided they can demonstrate that they have a performance management system in place that meets certain statutory standards, which can be certified to by a qualified and independent party, such as OPM, within prescribed timeframes. Congress should also consider establishing a governmentwide fund whereby agencies, based on a sound business case, could apply for funding to modernize their performance management systems and ensure that those systems have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. This approach would serve as a positive step to promote high-performing organizations throughout the federal government while avoiding fragmentation within the executive branch in the critical human capital area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to appear before you today to provide our preliminary  observations on the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) proposed National  Security Personnel System (NSPS) included as part of the Defense  Transformation for the 21st Century Act of 2003. As you know, DOD is in  the midst of a major transformation and it has undertaken a number of  related initiatives to transform its forces and fundamentally improve its  business operations. As part of DOD\u2019s transformation process, the  Secretary of Defense and senior civilian and military leaders have  committed to adopt a capabilities-based approach to acquisition planning  and to improve the linkage between overall strategy and individual  investments. At the same time, DOD has embarked on a series of efforts to  achieve strategic savings and improve its business processes, including  financial management, support infrastructure reforms to include base  closures, information technology modernization, logistics reengineering,  and strategic human capital management. In that regard, I am pleased to  serve as an observer to the Defense Business Practice Implementation  Board. Notwithstanding these ongoing efforts, GAO has reported a range  of DOD challenges for many years. In addition, DOD also is covered by  several of GAO\u2019s governmentwide high-risk areas, including the area of  strategic human capital management.", "The proposed Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act of 2003  represents a substantive legislative proposal that has both significant  precedent-setting implications for the government and far-reaching  implications on the way DOD is managed. Specifically, the critical  questions are whether DOD and/or other agencies should be granted  broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what basis; and  do agencies have the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective  use of the new authorities they are seeking. DOD\u2019s legislative initiative  would, among other things, provide for major changes in civilian and  military human capital management, make important adjustments to the  DOD acquisition process, affect DOD\u2019s organization structure, and change  DOD\u2019s reporting requirements to Congress.", "As a starting point, and as agreed with the Subcommittee, today I will  provide our preliminary observations on DOD\u2019s legislative proposal to  make changes to its civilian personnel system. The proposed NSPS would  provide for wide-ranging changes in DOD\u2019s civilian personnel pay and  performance management, collective bargaining, rightsizing, and a variety  of other human capital areas. The NSPS would enable DOD to develop and  implement a consistent, DOD-wide civilian personnel system bringing  together the many disparate systems that exist today. The proposal, while  providing a section-by-section analysis, does not provide an adequate  justification given the significance of the proposed changes. In addition, it  is my understanding that a document containing a fully developed  justification for the proposed changes is not available. At the same time, it  our understanding that DOD\u2019s current thinking is that NSPS will be based  on the work done by DOD\u2019s Human Resources Best Practices Task Force.  The Task Force reviewed federal personnel demonstration projects and  selected alternative personnel systems to identify practices that it  considered promising for a DOD civilian human resources strategy. These  practices were outlined in a April 2, 2003, Federal Register notice asking  for comment on DOD\u2019s plan to integrate all of its current science and  technology reinvention laboratory demonstration projects under a single  human capital framework consistent with the best practices DOD  identified.", "Many of the basic principles underlying DOD\u2019s civilian human capital  proposals have merit and deserve serious consideration.

However, given the massive size of DOD and the nature  and scope of the changes that are being considered, DOD\u2019s proposal also  has important precedent-setting implications for federal human capital  management generally and should also be considered in that context. The  critical questions raised are should DOD and/or other agencies be granted  broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what basis; and  whether they have the institutional infrastructure in place to make  effective use of the new authorities. This institutional infrastructure  includes, at a minimum, a human capital planning process that integrates  the agency\u2019s human capital policies, strategies, and programs with its  program goals and mission, and desired outcomes; the capabilities to  effectively develop and implement a new human capital system; and  importantly a set of adequate safeguards, including reasonable  transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, to ensure the  fair, effective, and credible implementation and application of a new  system.", "Consistent with this view, we have long held that the first step toward  meeting the government\u2019s human capital challenges is for agency leaders  to identify and make use of all the appropriate administrative authorities  available to them to manage their people for results, undertaken as part of  and consistent with proven change management practices. Much of the  authority agency leaders need to manage human capital strategically is  already available under current laws and regulations. This includes the  ability to develop modern, effective, and credible performance  management systems that would support more performance-based pay  decisions. The second step is for policymakers to pursue incremental  legislative reforms to give agencies additional tools and flexibilities to hire,  manage, and retain the human capital they need, particularly in critical  occupations. The third step is for all interested parties to work together to  identify, based in part on the experiences of the incremental reforms and  demonstration projects, the kinds of comprehensive legislative reforms in  the human capital area that should be enacted over time, taking into  account the extent to which existing approaches make sense in the  current and future operating environment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Observations on Selected Provisions of the Proposed NSPS", "paragraphs": ["With almost 700,000 civilian employees on its payroll, DOD is the second  largest federal employer of civilians in the nation, after the Postal Service.  Defense civilian personnel, among other things, develop policy, provide  intelligence, manage finances, and acquire and maintain weapon systems.  Given the current global war on terrorism, the role of DOD\u2019s civilian  workforce is expanding, such as participation in combat support functions  that free military personnel to focus on warfighting duties for which they  are uniquely qualified. Civilian personnel are also key to maintaining  DOD\u2019s institutional knowledge because of frequent rotations of military  personnel. However, since the end of the Cold War, the civilian workforce  has undergone substantial change, due primarily to downsizing, base  realignments and closures, competitive sourcing initiatives, and DOD\u2019s  changing missions. For example, between fiscal years 1989 and 2002, DOD  reduced its civilian workforce by about 38 percent, with an additional  reduction of about 55,000 personnel proposed through fiscal year 2007.  Some DOD officials have expressed concern about a possible shortfall of  critical skills because downsizing has resulted in a significant imbalance in  the shape, skills, and experience of its civilian workforce while more than  50 percent of the civilian workforce will become eligible to retire in the  next 5 years. As a result, the orderly transfer of DOD\u2019s institutional  knowledge is at risk.", "These factors, coupled with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s significant  transformation initiatives, make it imperative for DOD to strategically  manage its civilian workforce based on a total force perspective which  includes civilian personnel as well as active duty and reserve military  personnel and contractor personnel. This strategic management approach  will enable DOD to accomplish its mission by putting the right people in  the right place at the right time and at a reasonable cost.", "NSPS is intended to be a major component of DOD\u2019s efforts to more  strategically manage its workforce and respond to current and emerging  challenges.

The joint issuance of  regulations is similar to that set forth in the Homeland Security Act of  2002 between the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of  OPM for the development of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  human resources management system. However, unlike the legislation  creating DHS, the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act would  allow the Secretary of Defense to waive the requirement for joint issuance  of regulations if, in his or her judgment, it is \u201cessential to the national  security\u201d\u2014which is not defined in the act. While the act specifies a  number of key provisions of Title 5 that shall not be altered or waived,  including those concerning veterans\u2019 preference, merit protections, and  safeguards against discrimination and prohibited personnel practices, the  act nonetheless would, in substance, provide the Secretary of Defense  with significant independent authority to develop a separate and largely  autonomous human capital system for DOD.", "The DOD proposal also has significant potential implications for  governmentwide human capital policies and procedures and for OPM as  the President\u2019s agent and advisor for human capital matters and overseer  of federal human capital management activities. In essence, the act would  allow for the development of a personnel system for the second largest  segment of the federal workforce that is not necessarily within the control  or even direct influence of OPM. To strike a better balance between  reasonable management flexibility and the need for a reasonable degree of  consistency and adequate safeguards to prevent abuse throughout the  government, Congress should consider making these provisions of the  Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act consistent with the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, or at a minimum, providing some statutory  guidance on what would constitute a situation \u201cessential to the national  security\u201d that would warrant the Secretary of Defense to act independently  of the Director of OPM."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Pay Reform and Performance Management", "paragraphs": ["DOD states that it needs a human capital management system that  provides new and increased flexibility in the way it assesses and  compensates its employees, and toward that end, we understand that in  implementing NSPS DOD plans to strengthen its performance appraisal  systems and implement pay banding approaches as core components of  any new DOD human capital system. We have a long and successful  experience in using pay banding with our analyst staff as a result of the  GAO Personnel Act of 1980. Certain DOD components have had a number  of years of experience with pay banding through OPM\u2019s personnel  demonstration projects, authorized by the Civil Service Reform Act of  1978, to test and introduce beneficial change in governmentwide human  resources management systems. For example, in 1980, the Navy personnel  demonstration project, commonly referred to as the China Lake  demonstration project, implemented a number of reforms including pay  banding and a pay for performance system. More recently, the Civilian  Acquisition Workforce personnel demonstration project (AcqDemo) was  implemented in 1999 and created a pay banding system that covers part of  its civilian acquisition, technology, and logistics workforce. The expected  results of AcqDemo\u2019s pay banding system include increased flexibility to  assign employees as well as increased pay potential and satisfaction with  advancement for employees. According to agency officials, an evaluation  to OPM on AcqDemo\u2019s progress is scheduled to be available this June.  Lastly, DOD\u2019s science and technology reinvention laboratory  demonstration projects all implemented some form of pay banding and  pay for performance. OPM reports that these reinvention laboratory  demonstration projects have been able to offer more competitive starting  salaries. Additionally some labs\u2019 turnover experience was significantly  lower among highly-rated employees and higher among employees with  lower ratings. DOD\u2019s demonstration projects clearly provide helpful  insights and valuable lessons learned in connection with broad banding  and pay for performance efforts. At the same time these projects and  related DOD efforts involve less than 10 percent of DOD\u2019s civilian  workforce and expanding these concepts to the entire department will  require significant effort and likely need to be implemented in phases over  several years.", "As you know, there is growing agreement on the need to better link  individual pay to performance. Establishing such linkages is essential if we  expect to maximize the performance and assure the accountability of the  federal government for the benefit of the American people. As a result,  from a conceptual standpoint, we strongly support the need to expand  broad banding approaches and pay for performance-based systems in the  federal government. However, moving too quickly or prematurely at DOD  or elsewhere can significantly raise the risk of doing it wrong. This could  also serve to severely set back the legitimate need to move to a more  performance and results-based system for the federal government as a  whole. Thus, while it is imperative that we take steps to better link  employee pay to performance across the federal government, how it is  done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is done can make all the  difference in whether or not such efforts are successful. In our view, one  key need is to modernize performance management systems in executive  agencies so that they are capable of adequately supporting more  performance-based pay and other personnel decisions. Unfortunately,  based on GAO\u2019s past work, most existing federal performance appraisal  systems, including a vast majority of DOD\u2019s systems, are not designed to  support a meaningful performance-based pay system.", "The bottom line is that in order to receive any additional performance- based pay flexibility for broad based employee groups, agencies should  have to demonstrate that they have modern, effective, credible, and, as  appropriate, validated performance management systems in place with  adequate safeguards, including reasonable transparency and appropriate  accountability mechanisms, to ensure fairness and prevent politicalization  and abuse.", "At your request Madam Chairwoman, and that of Senator Voinovich, we  identified key practices leading public sector organizations both here in  the United States and abroad have used in their performance management  systems to link organizational goals to individual performance and create  a \u201cline of sight\u201d between an individual\u2019s activities and organizational  results. These practices can help agencies develop and implement  performance management systems with the attributes necessary to  effectively support pay for performance.", "More specifically, Congress should consider establishing statutory  standards that an agency must have in place before it can implement broad  banding or a more performanced-based pay program. As the request of  Congressman Danny Davis, we developed an initial list of possible  safeguards to help ensure that any additional flexibility Congress may  grant for expanding pay for performance management systems in the  government are fair, effective, and credible. We provided an initial list to  Congressman Davis late last week. This initial list of safeguards was  developed based on our extensive body of work looking at the  performance management practices used by leading public sector  organizations both in the United States and in other countries as well as  our own experiences at GAO in implementing a modern performance  management system for our own staff. We believe that the following could  provide a starting point for developing a set of statutory safeguards in  connection with any additional efforts to expand pay for performance  systems.", "Assure that the agency\u2019s performance management systems (1) link to the  agency\u2019s strategic plan, related goals, and desired outcomes, and (2) result  in meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance.

OPM would then issue guidance  implementing the legislatively defined safeguards. The effort to develop  such safeguards could be part of a broad-based expanded pay for  performance authority under which whole agencies and/or employee  groups could adopt broad-banding and move to more pay for performance  oriented systems if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the agency  would have to demonstrate, and OPM would have to certify, that a  modern, effective, credible, and, as appropriate, validated performance  management system with adequate safeguards, including reasonable  transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, is in place to  support more performance-based pay and related personnel decisions  before the agency could implement a new system. In this regard OPM  should consider adopting class exemption approaches and OPM should be  required to act on any individual certifications within prescribed time  frames (e.g., 30-60 days). This approach would allow for a broader-based  yet more conceptually consistent approach in this critical area. It would  also facilitate a phased-implementation approach throughout government.  The list is not intended to cover all the attributes of a modern, results- oriented performance management system. Rather, the items on the list  cover possible safeguards for performance management systems to help  ensure those systems are fair, effective, and credible.", "Congress should also consider establishing a governmentwide fund  whereby agencies, based on a sound business case, could apply for funds  to modernize their performance management systems and ensure those  systems have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse.

We have reported that the involvement of employees  both directly and indirectly is crucial to the success of new initiatives,  including implementing a pay for performance system. High-performing  organizations have found that actively involving employees and  stakeholders, such as unions or other employee associations when  developing results-oriented performance management systems helps  improve employees\u2019 confidence and belief in the fairness of the system  and increases their understanding and ownership of organizational goals  and objectives.

However, given DOD\u2019s past  efforts in using existing rightsizing tools, there is reason to be concerned  that DOD may struggle to effectively manage additional authorities that  may be provided. While DOD has used existing authorities in the past to  mitigate the adverse effects of force reductions, the approach to  reductions was not oriented toward strategically shaping the makeup of  the workforce. We have previously reported that the net effect of lack of  attention to workforce shaping is a civilian workforce that is not balanced  by age or experience, which risks the orderly transfer of institutional  knowledge. DOD thus may be challenged in using new authorities in a  cohesive, integrated way that supports achieving mission results, absent a  comprehensive and integrated human capital strategy and workforce plan.", "In the past, OPM has managed its authority to reemploy an annuitant with  no reduction in annuity on a case-by-case basis. The NSPS proposal, which  broadly grants such treatment, raises basic questions about the intent and  design of the federal benefits or total compensation of federal employees  and obviates the importance of establishing an effective DOD partnership  with OPM in prescribing the use of this authority. As noted previously,  providing such authority only to DOD would provide DOD a competitive  advantage in the market place that would place other agencies at a  disadvantage. It would also involve incremental costs that have yet to be  estimated. Flexible approaches to shaping the workforce, such as 2-year  excepted service appointments, may be helpful in avoiding long-term  commitments for short-term requirements, addressing transition gaps, and  smoothing outsourcing strategies.

Our work looking at DOD\u2019s  strategic human capital planning efforts and our work looking across the  federal government at the use of human capital flexibilities and related   human capital efforts underscores the critical steps that DOD needs to  take to properly develop and effectively implement any new personnel  authorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategic Human Capital Planning at DOD", "paragraphs": ["Our work here and abroad has consistently demonstrated that leading  organizations align their human capital approaches, policies, strategies,  and programs with their mission and programmatic goals. Human capital  plans that are aligned with mission and program goals integrate the  achievement of human capital objectives with the agency\u2019s strategic and  program goals. Careful and thoughtful human capital planning efforts are  critical to making intelligent competitive sourcing decisions. The  Commercial Activities Panel, which I was privileged to chair, called for  federal sourcing policy to be \u201cconsistent with human capital practices  designed to attract, motivate, retain, and reward a high performing  workforce\u201d and highlighted a number of human capital approaches to help  achieve that objective.", "In April 2002, DOD published a strategic plan for civilian personnel.  However, as we reported in March 2003, top-level leadership at the  department and the component levels has not until recently been  extensively involved in strategic planning for civilian personnel; however,  civilian personnel issues appear to be a higher priority for top-level leaders  today than in the past. Although DOD began downsizing its civilian  workforce more than a decade ago, top-level leadership has not, until  recently, developed and directed reforms to improve planning for civilian  personnel. With the exception of the Army and the Air Force, neither the  department nor the components in our March review had developed  strategic plans to address challenges affecting the civilian workforce until  2001 or 2002, which is indicative of civilian personnel issues being an  emerging priority.", "In addition, we reported that top-level leaders in the Air Force, the Marine  Corps, the Defense Contract Management Agency, and the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service have been or are working in partnership  with their civilian human capital professionals to develop and implement  civilian strategic plans; such partnership is increasing in the Army and not  as evident in the Navy. Moreover, DOD\u2019s issuance of its departmentwide  civilian human capital plan begins to lay a foundation for strategically  addressing civilian human capital issues; however, DOD has not provided  guidance on aligning the component-level plans with the department-level  plan to obtain a coordinated focus to carry out the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  transformation initiatives in an effective manner. High-level leadership  attention is critical to developing and directing reforms because, without  the overarching perspective of such leaders as Chief Operating Officers  and the Chief Human Capital Officers, reforms may not be sufficiently  focused on mission accomplishment, and without their support, reforms  may not receive the resources needed for successful implementation. We  have previously reported that the concept of a Chief Operating Officer  (COO) could offer the leadership to help elevate attention on key  management issues and transformational change, integrate these various  efforts, and institutionalize accountability for addressing management  issues and leading transformational change both within and between  administrations. In our view, DOD is a prime candidate to adopt this COO  concept. In addition, if Congress provides DOD with many of the  flexibilities it is seeking under the NSPS, the basis for adding a COO  position at DOD would be even stronger.", "Despite the progress that has been made recently, the DOD human capital  strategic plans we reviewed, for the most part, were not fully aligned with  the overall mission of the department or respective components, results  oriented, or based on data about the future civilian workforce. For  example, the goals and objectives contained in strategic plans for civilian  personnel were not explicitly aligned with the overarching missions of the  respective organizations. Consequently, it is difficult to determine whether  DOD\u2019s and the components\u2019 strategic goals are properly focused on  mission achievement. In addition, none of the plans contained results- oriented performance measures that could provide meaningful data  critical to measuring the results of their civilian human capital initiatives  (i.e., programs, policies, and processes). Thus, DOD and the components  cannot gauge the extent to which their human capital initiatives contribute  to achieving their organizations\u2019 mission. Also, for the most part, the  civilian human capital plans in our review did not contain detailed  information on the skills and competencies needed to successfully  accomplish future missions. Without information about what is needed in  the future workforce, it is unclear if DOD and its components are  designing and funding initiatives that are efficient and effective in  accomplishing the mission, and ultimately contributing to force readiness.", "Lastly, the DOD civilian strategic plans we reviewed did not address how  the civilian workforce will be integrated with their military counterparts or  with sourcing initiatives. At the department level, the strategic plan for  civilian personnel was prepared separately from corresponding plans for  military personnel and not integrated to form a seamless and  comprehensive strategy and did not address how DOD plans to link its  human capital initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to  outsource non-core responsibilities. For the most part, at the component  level, the plans set goals to integrate planning for the total workforce, to  include civilian, military, and contractor personnel. The Air Force and the  Army, in particular, have begun to integrate their strategic planning efforts  for civilian and military personnel, also taking contractor responsibilities  into consideration. Without integrated planning, goals for shaping and  deploying civilian, military, and contractor personnel may not be  consistent with and support each other. Consequently, DOD and its  components may not have the workforce with the skills and competencies  needed to accomplish tasks critical to assuring readiness and achieving  mission success.", "In our March report we recommended, among other things, that DOD  improve future revisions and updates to the departmentwide strategic  human capital plan by more explicitly aligning its elements with DOD\u2019s  overarching mission, including performance measures, and focusing on  future workforce needs. DOD only partially concurred with our  recommendation, and, as explanation, stated that the recommendation did  not recognize the involvement in and impact of DOD\u2019s Quadrennial  Defense Review on the development of the departmentwide plan. We also  recommended that DOD develop a departmentwide human capital  strategic plan that integrates both military and civilian workforces and  takes into account contractor roles and sourcing initiatives. DOD did not  concur with this recommendation stating that it has both a military and  civilian plan, and the use of contractors is just another tool to accomplish  the mission, not a separate workforce with separate needs to manage. The  intent of our recommendation is not to say that DOD has a direct  responsibility to manage contractor employees, but rather to recognize  that strategic planning for the civilian workforce should be undertaken in  the context of the total force\u2014civilian, military, and contractors\u2014since  the three workforces need to perform their responsibilities in a seamless  manner to accomplish DOD\u2019s mission. In commenting on our  recommendations, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness stated that DOD is in the early stages of its strategic planning  efforts. We recognize this and believe that our recommendations represent  opportunities that exist to strengthen its developing planning efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Capabilities Needed to Effectively Develop and Implement Human Capital Flexibilities", "paragraphs": ["Our work has identified a set of key practices that appear to be central to  the effective use of human capital authorities.

In  addition to the suggestions made above, Congress should consider  requiring DOD to fully track and periodically report on its performance.  This requirement would be fully consistent with those contained in our  calendar year 2000 human capital legislation, which required us to  comprehensively assess our use of the authorities granted to us under the  act. More generally, Congress should consider requiring DOD to  undertake evaluations that are broadly modeled on the evaluation  requirements of OPM\u2019s personnel demonstration program. Under the  demonstration project authority, agencies must evaluate and periodically  report on results, implementation of the demonstration project, cost and  benefits, impacts on veterans and other EEO groups, adherence to merit  principles, and extent to which the lessons from the project can be applied  elsewhere, including governmentwide. This evaluation and reporting  requirement would facilitate congressional oversight of NSPS, allow for  any mid-course corrections in its implementation, and serve as a tool for  documenting best practices and sharing lessons learned with employees,  stakeholders, other federal agencies, and the public.

Should DOD and/or other federal agencies be granted broad- based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what basis? Does DOD  have the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of the  new authorities? This institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum, a  human capital planning process that integrates the agency\u2019s human capital  policies, strategies, and programs with its program goals and mission, and  desired outcomes; the capabilities to effectively develop and implement a  new human capital system; and a set of adequate safeguards, including  reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms to  ensure the fair, effective, and credible implementation and application of a  new system.", "Many of the basic principles underlying DOD\u2019s civilian human capital  proposals have merit and deserve the serious consideration they are  receiving here today and will no doubt be received by others in the coming  weeks and months. However, the same critical questions should be posed  to the DOD proposal. Should DOD and/or other federal agencies be  granted broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what  basis? In addition, Congress and DOD should carefully assess the degree  to which DOD has the institutional infrastructure in place to make  effective use the new authorities it is seeking. Our work has shown that  while progress has been and is being made, additional efforts are needed  by DOD to integrate its human capital planning process with the  department\u2019s program goals and mission. The practices that have been  shown to be critical to the effective use of flexibilities provide a validated  roadmap for DOD and Congress to consider. Finally, as I have pointed out  in several key areas, Congress should consider, if the authorities are  granted, establishing additional safeguards to ensure the fair, merit-based,  transparent, and accountable implementation and application of NSPS.", "In our view, Congress should consider providing governmentwide broad  banding and pay for performance authorities that DOD and other federal  agencies can use provided they can demonstrate that they have a  performance management system in place that meets certain statutory  standards, which can be certified to by a qualified and independent party,  such as OPM. Congress should also consider establishing a  governmentwide fund whereby agencies, based on a sound business case,  could apply for funds to modernize their performance management  systems and ensure that those systems have adequate safeguards to  prevent abuse. This would serve as a positive step to promote high- performing organizations throughout the federal government while  avoiding further fragmentation within the executive branch in the critical  human capital area.", "This morning, I have offered some preliminary observations on some  aspects of the proposal. However, these preliminary observations have not  included some serious concerns I have with other sections of the proposed  legislation that go beyond the civilian personnel proposal. My observations  have included suggestions for how Congress can help DOD effectively  address its human capital challenges and ensure that NSPS is designed and  implemented in an effective, efficient, and fair manner that meets the  current and future needs of DOD, its employees, and the American people.  Human capital reforms at DOD obviously have important implications for  national security and precedent-setting implications for governmentwide  human capital management. Given the massive size of DOD and the  magnitude of the nature and scope of the changes that are being  considered, such reform at DOD also has important precedent-setting  implications for federal human capital management generally and should  be considered in that context.", "We look forward to continuing to support Congress and work with DOD in  addressing the vital transformation challenges it faces.
