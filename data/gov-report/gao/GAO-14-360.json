GAO found that the remaining 33 State assigned personnel on such assignments had not complied with the mandatory requirement. For State and USAID personnel on temporary duty of 6 months or less (short-term TDY personnel), GAO was unable to assess compliance because of gaps in State's data. State does not systematically maintain data on the universe of U.S. personnel on short-term TDY status to designated high-threat countries who were required to complete FACT training. This is because State lacks a mechanism for identifying those who are subject to the training requirement. These data gaps prevent State or an independent reviewer from assessing compliance with the FACT training requirement among short-term TDY personnel.

However, the manual and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also note that management is responsible for putting in place adequate controls to help ensure that agency directives are carried out.

For short-term TDY personnel traveling to two specific  countries, State officials noted that OIP officials use the eCC system to  determine cumulative numbers of days traveled within each country;  however, they cannot determine personnel\u2019s cumulative numbers of days  traveled across countries. Furthermore, in-country officials who approve  country clearance requests can generally view employees\u2019 travel histories  only for that particular country and generally do not have eCC system  authority to look at employee travel histories for other countries.  According to State officials, the department has no plans to ensure short- term TDY personnel\u2019s compliance with the 45 cumulative-day  requirement. The officials said that (1) the process to view personnel\u2019s  travel records is labor intensive and (2) they would not want to burden  post officials by asking them to track personnel\u2019s cumulative travel days.
