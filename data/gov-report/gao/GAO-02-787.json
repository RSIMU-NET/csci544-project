The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other departments and agencies made significant achievements in helping the affected countries rebuild their infrastructure and recover from the hurricanes. USAID and others used the disaster recovery assistance to bring about economic recovery, improve public health and access to education, provide permanent housing for displaced families, and improve disaster mitigation and preparedness. To achieve these broad objectives, USAID funded infrastructure construction and repair, technical assistance and training, loans for farmers and small businesses, and some equipment. In addition to its normal controls, USAID ensured that the funds were spent for intended purposes. USAID coordinated its activities with 12 other departments and agencies that were allocated $96 million for disaster recovery efforts.

USAID attempted to strengthen the capacity of host government audit in situations as a means to resist corruption. However, USAID was not successful in this area, mostly due to country conditions. USAID did not begin expending the supplemental funds until January 2000, 7 months after the appropriation was enacted. Some of the factors that added time included arranging for additional program staff and contractor support; ensuring that financial controls and other oversight measures were in place; coordinating with and planning for the involvement of numerous other departments and agencies; and providing for U.S. contractors and other organizations to compete for most of the contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that were awarded."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the fall of 1998, Hurricanes Mitch and Georges struck Central America  and the Caribbean.

Each country\u2019s program varied based on country conditions and the USAID  mission\u2019s approach. In general, the funds were used for  repairing or rebuilding the infrastructure needed for reactivating  economies (e.g., roads and bridges), public health infrastructure (e.g.,  potable water systems, sewage and drainage systems, and health  clinics), housing, and schools;   providing loans, credits, and technical assistance for small- and  medium-sized farms and businesses;   strengthening disaster mitigation efforts such as civil defense, early  warning and prevention, and watershed management; and  strengthening accountability.", "In Honduras and Nicaragua, USAID financed the repair of 2,817 kilometers  (about 1,756 miles) of secondary and tertiary roads. In Honduras, USAID  funded the repair of 62 municipal water and sanitation systems and 1,211  rural water systems. In the Dominican Republic, USAID funding repaired  1,514 houses and constructed 2,248 new homes (see fig. 2). The activities of  other U.S. agencies ranged from installing stream gauges for early flood  warning to equipping national public health laboratories. These and many  other projects resulted in improved transportation, agricultural land  restored to productive use, improved health through potable water and  sanitation systems, increased access to health care and education,  increased employment through credit programs, and improved capabilities  to mitigate the effects of future disasters.", "USAID attempted to ensure that projects and activities would be  sustainable after its disaster recovery activities were completed. For  example, in Honduras, USAID funded training for municipal officials and  local water boards to provide them with the management and budget skills  to operate and maintain new water and sanitation systems. Also, the  Honduran government ministry responsible for road maintenance gave  USAID-funded roads priority in its 2-year maintenance schedule. However,  the hurricane-affected countries are poor and in debt and, in many  instances, plagued by bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.

In addition, the supplemental legislation provided funds for  USAID\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and for us to monitor the provision  of the assistance. This additional oversight and monitoring resulted in  instances of problems being identified and addressed by USAID and other  U.S. government departments and agencies as activities were under way  and changes could still affect the success of the program or project.

To help protect the U.S. assistance from potential misuse, the  mission established a separate oversight unit within the fund for its  $50 million road and bridge program (see fig. 3). A U.S. project manager  headed the unit with a U.S. chief engineer and local technical and support  staff. For both the road and municipal water and sanitation system  programs, the mission contracted with financial services firms to handle  disbursements to the fund following approvals by USAID and the oversight  unit. For the water and sanitation program, USAID relied on the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers to provide technical oversight. For its school  construction program, USAID only reimbursed the fund after units were  completed and inspected by USAID and its oversight contractors (see fig.  4). Finally, in many instances, the Honduran mission hired U.S.  management services firms and private voluntary organizations to oversee  other activities implemented by local entities.", "USAID\u2019s program in Nicaragua was mostly implemented by U.S. and  international voluntary and local implementing organizations that had a  proven track record with the mission and whose ongoing cooperative  agreements were easily amended. For its only program with the  Nicaraguan government\u2014a $2.1 million municipal infrastructure program  implemented by the Emergency Social Investment Fund (an entity similar  to the Honduras fund)\u2014USAID hired a U.S. management services firm to  provide oversight and technical assistance. USAID also relied on the Corps  of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to review municipal  infrastructure designs and make recommendations accordingly.", "A primary component of oversight is having sufficient staff to monitor  project activities and spending and identify any problems that may occur  along the way. As USAID\u2019s direct-hire foreign service staff levels have  declined over the years, it has turned increasingly to using personal  services contractors to conduct most of the day-to-day oversight of its  programs, including the disaster recovery program. USAID hired  numerous personal services contractors to help oversee its activities and  provide technical and administrative support. In Honduras, the program  office and technical officers throughout the mission shared responsibility  for oversight. The mission hired 33 additional personal services contractors  to oversee its program and provide administrative support.

USAID eventually was  successful in having the implementing organization negotiate a way to  provide potable water. To better track and report on the progress of its  housing program, USAID also developed a matrix for each housing project  that specified how water and other infrastructure were to be provided as  well as proof that an environmental assessment had been completed (see  fig. 5).", "USAID provided $2.5 million to a Honduran agricultural lending  cooperative for loans for small- and medium-sized farms despite a record of  concerns about its management problems and financial viability.

Based on USAID\u2019s  continuing oversight and our review, USAID strongly encouraged the  organization\u2019s Board of Directors to accept major restructuring of its  organizational, management, and financial framework. In January 2001, the  Honduran minister of finance signed a memorandum of understanding with  the lending organization outlining these changes and the likely  consequences if the reforms were not made.

During this time, USAID  missions were also operating with the staff resources allocated based on  their regular programs, and they also had to deal with the rotation of  several senior-level staff during the summer of 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Start-up Challenges and Obstacles Slowed Program Initiation", "paragraphs": ["Before Hurricane Mitch, the Honduran and Nicaraguan missions were  managing annual programs of about $23 million and $30 million,  respectively.

In particular, the Honduran mission  did not have a permanent contracts officer\u2014it had been sharing one with  the Nicaraguan mission\u2014until October 1999, a year after Hurricane Mitch.  Other missions also shared contracts officers. As noted in appendix II, the  missions in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic said the  absence of full-time contracts officers led to delays.", "The number of USAID direct-hire staff in general, and contracts officers in  particular, has declined in recent years and USAID had difficulty finding  qualified personnel to manage this large-scale emergency program on an  expedited basis. This problem was compounded by some USAID senior- level staff (for example, contracts and administrative officers) rotations  during the summer of 1999. Although USAID\u2019s headquarters office  attempted to ease the burden by providing temporary staff in the hurricane- affected countries, the missions lacked needed continuity, and, according  to the Honduran mission, the lack of travel funds precluded timely  assistance for some activities. The Honduran mission emphasized that the  need to obtain qualified staff more quickly is one of the most important  lessons learned from the hurricane reconstruction program.", "USAID also does not have any procedures to expedite the hiring of  personal services contractors. As a result, acquiring personal services  contractors with the requisite language and technical skills to manage the  reconstruction program often took 6 months to more than a year. The  process involves revisions in position descriptions and scopes of work,  internal and external position announcements, screenings, interviews, and  medical and security checks. For example, the Nicaraguan mission  experienced major delays in security clearances\u2014one person accepted a  job elsewhere after waiting more than a year for a clearance. The hiring and  clearance process also precluded the timely arrival of in-country staff from  other U.S. departments and agencies to conduct their programs. Because  contractor and other U.S. agency staff provided much of the day-to-day  management of the program, these delays were burdensome for the USAID  staff on board and slowed the pace of implementation.", "In addition to building up staffing levels, the missions in some countries  decided to implement certain accountability measures prior to program  implementation. For example, before it began its host country contracting  programs for major infrastructure projects, the USAID mission in  Honduras advertised for and selected a U.S. engineering and project  management firm to oversee the technical aspects and a third-party  accounting firm to handle disbursements to the Honduran government.", "Although USAID missions had the authority to waive full and open  competition for awarding contracts and grants, it was used sparingly. The  Honduran mission used the waiver authority to bypass the normal  requirement to advertise in the Commerce Business Daily, which saved 60  days in awarding some contracts. In many instances, missions amended  existing cooperative agreements and contracts to accelerate the  procurement process. However, although using sole source awards would  have speeded up the award process, it may have precluded U.S. firms from  being awarded contracts. The Honduran mission, for example, redesigned  much of its municipal water and sanitation program to allow U.S. firms to  compete, resulting in a later start date.", "The involvement of numerous other U.S. government departments and  agencies presented a challenge for which the USAID missions were  unprepared. Mission staff told us that, at the beginning of the program,  coordinating with officials from other agencies, helping them with their  work plans, and facilitating their administrative needs took considerable  time away from their already busy workload. The burden eased as some  agencies assigned in-country personnel, but it took considerable time for  these people to arrive because their positions had to be approved by the  embassy and they needed security clearances.

According to NOAA, future projects should  have follow-on activities to assess implementation of the technical  guidance and training provided. NOAA further noted that more time and  resources should have been devoted to training host country  counterpart organizations.
