Understandably, the expansion initially lacked a clear, governmentwide coordinated strategy. In that emergency situation, the expansion was based on individual agency perceptions of the capacity their high-containment labs required as well as the availability of congressionally approved funding. Decisions to fund the construction of high-containment labs were made by multiple federal agencies in multiple budget cycles. Federal and state agencies, academia, and the private sector considered their individual requirements, but an assessment of national needs was lacking. Even now, after more than 7 years, GAO was unable to find any projections based on a governmentwide strategic evaluation of future capacity requirements set in light of existing capacity; the numbers, location, and mission of the laboratories needed to effectively counter biothreats; and national public health goals. Such information is needed to ensure that the United States will have facilities in the right place with the right specifications. Furthermore, since no single agency is in charge of the expansion, no one is determining the aggregate risks associated with this expansion. As a consequence, no federal agency can determine whether high-containment laboratory capacity may now meet or exceed the national need or is at a level that can be operated safely. If an agency were tasked, or a mechanism were established, with the purpose of overseeing the expansion of high-containment laboratories, it could develop a strategic plan to (1) ensure that the numbers and capabilities of potentially dangerous high-containment laboratories are no greater than necessary, (2) balance the risks and benefits of expanding such laboratories, and (3) determine the type of oversight needed. Four highly publicized incidents in high-containment laboratories, as well as evidence in scientific literature, demonstrate that (1) while laboratory accidents are rare, they do occur, primarily due to human error or systems (management and technical operations) failure, including the failure of safety equipment and procedures, (2) insiders can pose a risk, and (3) it is difficult to control inventories of biological agents with currently available technologies. Taken as a whole, these incidents demonstrate failures of systems and procedures meant to maintain biosafety and biosecurity in high-containment laboratories. For example, they revealed the failure to comply with regulatory requirements, safety measures that were not commensurate with the level of risk to public health posed by laboratory workers and pathogens in the laboratories, and the failure to fund ongoing facility maintenance and monitor the operational effectiveness of laboratory physical infrastructure. Oversight plays a critical role in improving biosafety and ensuring that high-containment laboratories comply with regulations. However, some aspects of the current oversight programs provided by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture are dependent upon entities monitoring themselves and reporting incidents to federal regulators. Since 2001, personnel reliability programs have been established to counter insider risks, but their cost, effectiveness, and impact has not been evaluated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Across the United States, federal and state agencies, industries, and  academic institutions are building biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4  laboratories\u2014commonly referred to as high-containment laboratories\u2014to  research dangerous pathogens (which might accidentally or intentionally  be released into the environment) and emerging infectious diseases for  which risks may not be clearly understood.

The public is concerned about these  laboratories because the deliberate or accidental release of biological  agents can have disastrous consequences by exposing workers and the  public to dangerous pathogens. Highly publicized laboratory errors and  controversies about where high-containment laboratories should be  located have raised questions about whether the governing framework,  oversight, and standards for biosafety and biosecurity measures are  adequate.

Which federal agency is responsible for tracking the expansion of high- containment laboratories and determining the associated aggregate  risks? 3.  What lessons can be learned from highly publicized incidents at high- containment laboratories and actions taken by the regulatory  agencies?", "To answer these questions, we interviewed federal agency officials as well  as experts in microbiology, reviewed literature, conducted site visits, and  surveyed 12 federal agencies to determine if they have a mission to track  high-containment laboratories in the United States.

It follows that  research laboratories clearly represent a significant capability that can be  potentially misused, and this capability is growing with the increasing  number of high-containment laboratories. While efforts to strengthen  inventory controls, assess and monitor personnel, and prevent facility  misuse (for example, by video monitoring) have been undertaken to  address insider threats, we are not aware of any evaluation of the  effectiveness of these measures. While there are clearly major difficulties  in imposing such controls in research laboratories, insider risk needs to be  recognized and evaluated.", "Assuming that Dr. Ivins was the perpetrator in the anthrax attacks, he  represents one rogue insider in a period of some 60 years, during which  several thousand scientists and technicians had the opportunity to commit  similar crimes. Thus, the probability of repeating that one event is,  historically, very small. Devising any program to reliably reduce that figure  for biological laboratory personnel is challenging. Furthermore, some  DOD biological laboratory scientists and academicians we spoke with  have pointed out that highly intrusive personnel reliability programs,  which rely on profiling to identify insider threats, can have a negative  effect on staff morale and performance by institutionalizing the concept  that no one can be trusted.", "The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity reported that there is  little evidence that personnel reliability measures are effective or have  predictive value in identifying individuals who may pose an insider  threat.

Personnel working with select agents need training to ensure  their own safety and that of coworkers and the surrounding community.  Training is specifically designed to address select agent characteristics  that include infectivity and pathogenicity. Training must also address  hazardous operations such as intentional aerosolization, centrifugation,  and homogenization. Some laboratories require inexperienced workers to  be mentored by personnel experienced in containment procedures, a  process that can take up to a year to complete. The mentor maintains a  checklist of important operations that must be performed in a responsible  manner before the worker will be allowed to work independently.

Because elevated titers can be due to reasons other  than active infection with a particular agent, the results need to be treated  with caution. Nevertheless, an elevated antibody titer in cases where that  agent is being worked with in the laboratory must always be a matter of  concern and action.", "Serological testing is not definitive and scenario 20 does not provide clear  guidance with regard to follow-up actions. Accordingly, standard  operating procedures need to be developed by the institutions working  together with biosafety officers/responsible officials and occupational  health physicians to describe the appropriate course of action when  elevated titers are observed.", "The use of serological testing as a method to identify potential exposures  to select agents must be approached with a high degree of caution. First,  guidelines must be very clear regarding the intended use of any serology- based screening program. If routine screening indicates elevated antibody  titers against a specific pathogen over baseline levels, it may suggest a  laboratory exposure to a pathogen; however, alternative explanations are  also feasible. The increase in titers may indicate natural exposure to the  agent (depending on the agent and location of the laboratory). The  increase could also result from inconsistencies associated with laboratory  testing. Most serological assays for select agents are not commonly  conducted in clinical laboratories and are mostly performed in research  laboratories. As such, these assays may not be properly controlled and  validated. Assay-to-assay variation may be high, especially if experience is  limited. Additionally, such assays are not particularly robust unless  baseline specimens are available for comparison testing and serum  samples are collected at relatively short intervals (for example, 3 to 6  months).", "Similarly, a serological screening program used as a method to diagnose  infection or prevent the spread of contagious pathogens to the community  is unlikely to be successful unless samples are taken at short intervals, as  elevated antibody titers are usually detected after the period of maximum  contagiousness of most pathogens. Therefore, the most appropriate use  for a serological screening program would be to identify past exposures  and to facilitate remedial training or conduct retrospective risk analyses  that might lead to improved risk mitigation procedures and policies that  might prevent future exposures. It is critical that guidance on the use of  blood screening programs clearly identify the purpose of these programs  and also provide guidance on how information from these programs  should be used. Any suspicion of exposure should be reported and  investigated, and the result of that investigation should be reported, thus  providing a complete picture for DSAT and reducing subjective bias in  reporting.", "The development of scientifically sound and standardized methods of  identifying exposure is critical so that individual laboratory owners are not  left to determine for themselves what is and what is not reportable.

It also extended  the suspension of research with select agents until the university  addressed the issues in the August report.", "HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) imposed a fine on TAMU for the  select agent violations. The HHS OIG was delegated authority to impose  civil monetary penalties of up to $250,000 against an individual and up to  $500,000 against any other person, including any entity. The HHS OIG  and TAMU disagreed on the number of violations. In February 2008, TAM agreed to pay a $1 million fine, which was an unprecedented amount for a  fine paid by any institution under the select agent program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incident 3: Power Failures at CDC\u2019s High- Containment Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["Continuity of electrical power is vital for the safe functioning of high- containment laboratories, in particular since maintenance of essential  pressure differentials using electrically driven fans provides an important  barrier for preventing the uncontrolled release of agents. Lapses in  electrical power that occurred at a CDC laboratory raise concerns about  standards in high-containment laboratory facility design, management of  construction, and operations.", "On June 8, 2007, the CDC campus in Atlanta experienced lightning strikes  in and around its new BSL-4 facility, and both the Georgia Power-supplied  primary power and CDC-supplied backup power from its centrally-located  generator plant were unavailable. The high-containment laboratory  facility, not operational at the time, was left with only emergency battery  power\u2014which can provides limited electrical power for functions such as  emergency lighting to aid in evacuation. Among other things, the outage  shut down the high-containment laboratory\u2019s negative air pressure  system. While investigating the power outage, the CDC later determined  that, some time earlier, a critical grounding cable buried in the ground  outside the building had been cut by construction workers digging at an  adjacent site. The cutting of the grounding cable, which had hitherto gone  unnoticed by CDC facility managers, compromised the electrical system of  the facility that housed the BSL-4 laboratory. With the grounding cable  cut, the lightning strikes caused the circuit breakers in the building\u2019s  switchgear to disengage or open, resulting in a loss of primary power to  the building. In addition, when the circuit breakers disengaged, the CDC\u2019s  backup generators were electrically isolated from the building and could  not supply the building with power. It took approximately an hour for the  CDC facility staff to reset the circuit breakers in the building to reengage  the primary power.", "Because of the June 2007 power outage incident, questions about the  design of the backup power system for the new facility resurfaced. When  the CDC designed the backup power system for the new BSL-4 facility, it  decided to use diesel generators centralized at CDC\u2019s utility plant that also  serve other facilities, as well as functions such as chillers, on the campus.  According to internal documents provided to us, during the design phase  for the facility, some CDC engineers had questioned the choice of this  remotely placed, integrated design rather than a simpler design using local  backup generators near the BSL-4 facility.", "According to CDC facility officials, the full backup power capabilities for  the new BSL-4 facility were not in place at the time of the power outage  but were awaiting completion of other construction projects on campus.  Once these projects are completed, these officials said, the new BSL-4  facility will have multiple levels of backup power, including the ability to  get power from a second central utility plant on campus, if needed. But  some CDC engineers that we talked with questioned the degree of  complexity in the design. They worried that an overly integrated backup  power system might be more susceptible to failure. As a result of the  power outage, CDC officials conducted a reliability assessment for the  entire campus power system, which included the backup power design for  the new BSL-4 facility. CDC concluded that its existing centrally located  generators and planned power-related construction projects with  equipment upgrades were more reliable and cost-effective than scenarios  that locate generators at individual buildings.", "CDC officials reported that its backup power system is tested monthly, as  required by building code. In commenting on our draft report, CDC  provided studies and data that showed the theoretical reliability of the  power system. However, CDC could not provide us documentation of  actual non-testing instances where the backup generator system operated  as designed. This incident highlighted the risks inherent in relying on  standard building codes to ensure the safety of high-containment  laboratories\u2014as there are no building codes and testing procedures  specifically for high-containment laboratories.", "In a second incident, on Friday January 4, 2008, CDC officials told us that  nearby construction again damaged the grounding system of the building  containing the new BSL-4 facility. The damage was observed when it  occurred, but the cable was not repaired until the following week. While  there was no loss of power to the BSL-4 facility, the potential for repeating  a grounding-related power failure existed until repairs were made.", "According to CDC officials, at the time of both incidents, the new BSL-4  facility in building 18 was in preparation to become fully operational. No  laboratory work of any kind had been conducted inside the BSL-4  laboratories, and no live agents were inside the facility as the  commissioning process was still ongoing and the laboratories were not  activated. However, given that the grounding cables were cut, it is  apparent that the building\u2019s integrity as it related to adjacent construction  was not adequately supervised. Further, according to CDC officials,  standard procedures under building codes do not require monitoring of  the integrity of the electrical grounding of the new BSL-4 facility. CDC has  now instituted annual testing of the electrical grounding system as the  result of its review of these incidents.", "According to CDC officials, a third incident occurred on July 11, 2008,  when a bird flew into the high voltage side of one of the Georgia Power  transformers on the CDC campus, causing a failure in the primary  electrical power supplied to buildings containing BSL-3 facilities. The  CDC\u2019s backup generators did not provide power because of the cascading  effects of a failure by one of the generators. As in the June 2007 incident,  the facilities were left with only temporary battery power, shutting down  the fans powering the facility\u2019s negative air pressure system. The generator  problems were corrected by CDC in approximately an hour, at about the  same time that Georgia Power completed its repairs and primary electrical  power was restored."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lessons Learned: BSL -3 and -4 Laboratory Safety Measures Must Be Commensurate with the Level of Risk These Laboratories Present", "paragraphs": ["In any workplace building\u2014regardless of the nature of its activities\u2014there  are safety features to protect the physical safety of workers.

In general, the building codes enable (1) personnel to safely  evacuate and (2) rescue personnel or firefighters to perform their jobs. By  definition, additional hazards beyond those anticipated by standard  building codes potentially exist in high-containment laboratories (BSL-3  and BSL-4), and they are addressed in BMBL. However, according to CDC  and NIH, BMBL is only advisory.", "BMBL contains principles and guidelines, but the document does not  provide specific detail on how functional requirements are to be translated  into design solutions. According to our experts, there have been instances  where modifications to laboratories were required after construction to  achieve the necessary compliance. A more active, early, and continuing  dialogue between builders, operators, and regulators may be beneficial in  avoiding such waste and is especially relevant where tax dollars are  committed to the creation or upgrading of high-containment laboratories.", "Because BMBL addresses issues relating to maintaining the containment  of biological agents to protect both workers and the wider public, its  guidelines are potentially more restrictive than the building codes.  According to our expert panel, a clear and unambiguous set of standards  stating the various capabilities that are required to maintain the integrity  of all high-containment laboratories is necessary. Such a set of standards  will need to integrate building codes with the BMBL provisions or  amendments thereto. These standards should be national\u2014not subject to  local interpretation\u2014and address the possibility that one or more  emergency or backup systems may fail. Most importantly, any set of  scenarios aimed at maintaining containment integrity must be empirically  evaluated to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adequate oversight of any  nearby activities\u2014such as adjacent construction with its potential to  compromise buried utilities\u2014must also be taken into consideration when  evaluating the safety measures required to manage the risks of high- containment laboratories.", "The CDC\u2019s BSL-4 laboratory was designed with multiple layers of  electrical power so that if primary power failed, a secondary source of  power would be in place for continuity of operations. Failure to monitor  the system\u2019s integrity, however, compromised the ability of either power  source to support critical operations. The power outages at CDC  demonstrate a need to create understanding throughout the organization  that effective biosafety involves layers of containment and, furthermore,  that the loss of any one layer is serious even though the remaining layers,  as intended, do maintain containment. Thus, procedures are required to  regularly assess the functional integrity of every layer of containment and  to initiate immediate corrective actions as required.

The investigation found that (1)  monitoring and testing for the preventive maintenance of pipe work for  the drainage system was not a regular practice on-site and (2) a  contributing factor might have been a difference of opinion over  responsibilities for maintenance of a key pipe within the drainage system.", "High-containment laboratories are expensive to build and expensive to  maintain. Adequate funding for each stage needs to be addressed.  Typically, in large-scale construction projects, funding for initial  construction comes from one source, but funding for ongoing operations  and maintenance comes from another.

The U.K. government undertook a review of the regulatory framework  governing work with animal pathogens that resulted in a November  2007 report. The government accepted all the report\u2019s  recommendations, which included (1) moving regulation of work with  animal pathogens from Defra to HSE and (2) developing a single  regulatory framework covering work with human and animal  pathogens based on the model provided by the Genetically Modified  Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000. This framework adopts  a risk-based approach to regulation. 2.  The Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) was amended in April  2008 to give inspectors increased powers, including the power to serve  improvement and prohibition notices on entities (called duty holders  in the U.K.) to remedy poor standards in such areas as containment  and management. At the same time, HSE entered into an agency  agreement with Defra to inspect premises where work with SAPO  agents is carried out before Defra issues licenses; the license  conditions are based on recommendations from HSE. Furthermore,  HSE inspectors investigate any accidents and also proactively inspect  facilities to ensure compliance with the license conditions. 3.  Both organizations at Pirbright (Institute for Animal Health (IAH) and  Merial) had their licenses amended or withdrawn following the  outbreak. The IAH license was amended to allow diagnostic work (in  the epidemiology building) and a limited amount of research in the  arbovirology building. No animal work has been licensed to date,  although new animal house facilities are nearing completion, and work  may be licensed later this year.  4.  All the drainage systems on-site have been tested and relined, and a  new dual containment system has been laid to connect laboratories to  a refurbished heat treatment plant. This new system is not yet  operational, although it is in the final stages of commissioning. In the  meantime, no laboratory or manufacturing effluent is discharged to the  relined drainage system unless it has been heat treated by autoclaving  (IAH) or been through a validated heat treatment cycle (Merial). The  only effluent going to the drain and to the final chemical treatment  plant is shower water, which should not contain virus as all activities  are carried out in cabinets or in enclosed systems. 5.  A newly refurbished building on the IAH has recently been licensed to  allow small scale research on a number of SAPO 4 viruses. 6.  Merial was fully relicensed following amendments to its procedures  and joint Defra and HSE inspections. The new licenses are more  detailed than the original versions and impose many more license  conditions on the company. 7.  No enforcement action has been taken against either organization  following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

Accordingly, facilities are  specialized and cannot easily be converted from one function to another.  Medium- to long-term advance planning for the appropriate capacity levels  is therefore essential, as is knowledge of existing capacity. Such advance  planning needs to take into account the (1) projected future balance  between biodefense and more traditional public health work, (2) the  specific infectious disease problems and targets that the expansion is  meant to address, and (3) targets for the laboratory expansion\u2019s timetable  or benchmarks as to when specific capacities need to be available. We  were unable to identify any governmentwide strategic evaluation of these  issues for high-containment laboratories.", "Furthermore, since no single agency is in charge of the current expansion,  no one is determining the associated aggregate risks posed by the  expansion. As a consequence, no federal agency can determine whether  high-containment laboratory capacity may now be less than, meet, or  exceed the national need or is at a level that can be operated safely.", "If an agency were tasked or a mechanism were established with the  purpose of overseeing the expansion of high-containment laboratories, it  could develop a strategic plan to (1) ensure that the number and  capabilities of potentially dangerous high-containment laboratories are no  greater or less than necessary, (2) balance the risks and benefits of  expanding such laboratories, and (3) determine the type of oversight  needed.", "Such an agency or mechanism could analyze the biothreat problems that  need to be addressed by additional BSL-3 and -4 laboratories, the scientific  and technical capabilities and containment features that such laboratories  need to have, how the laboratories should be distributed geographically,  and how the activities of the laboratories would be coordinated to achieve  intended goals.", "Standards for several key issues have not been developed. The agency or  mechanism responsible for overseeing the expansion of high-containment  laboratories could also be responsible for coordinating with the scientific  community to develop guidelines for high-containment laboratory design,  construction, and commissioning and training standards for laboratory  workers; providing definitions for exposure; developing appropriate  inventory control measures; and providing guidance on the most efficient  approach to personnel reliability programs.", "The oversight agency or mechanism could also address issues related to  the ongoing funding needs of high-containment laboratories. While NIAID  has provided funding to build RBLs and NBLs, these laboratories are  expected to compete for funding from NIH to sustain their research. It is  unclear what will happen to these facilities, their trained personnel, and  their technology if no such funding is available. Further, as these facilities  and other high-containment laboratories age, adequate funding sources  must be identified for upgrades and maintenance, or the risks that they  pose may outweigh their benefits.", "Once laboratories have been commissioned and begin operating,  continuing maintenance and testing/validation programs are needed to  ensure that operating standards and regulatory compliance are  maintained. As facilities age, the costs of such programs will rise and are  likely to consume an increasing proportion of budgets. Although this  affects federal, industrial, and academic laboratories, the impact is likely  to be greatest on academic laboratories. Although federal laboratories are  subject to annual funding, they tend to have programs that have long-term  commitments and are not usually subject to major changes even if  principal investigators (scientists) relocate. Industrial laboratories exhibit  similar stability of operations once they are committed to projects and  programs. In all these cases, maintenance budgets are less tied to funding  for research than are those of academic laboratories, which are highly  dependent on research grant funding to support both infrastructure  maintenance as well as research programs. Indeed, the two activities may  compete for available money. Relocation of a principal investigator who is  the recipient of research grant funding can create problems for the  institute in maintaining the laboratory facilities. Given the high costs of  creating high-containment laboratories, consideration also needs to be  given to the issue of their maintenance and support as distinct from  funding for research activity.", "The four incidents at USAMRIID, TAMU, CDC, and Pirbright exemplify a  number of failures of systems and procedures that are meant, in  combination, to maintain the biosafety of high-containment laboratories to  protect laboratory workers and the public.

Facilities must have standard operating procedures, training and  proficiency requirements, medical surveillance, emergency preparedness  procedures (including advance notification to local, state, regional, and  federal emergency response personnel), hazard labeling, disposal and  maintenance controls, and protective equipment for all work with agents. 3.  Quarterly inspections for biosafety level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 laboratories  and monthly inspections for BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories must be  conducted. 4.  All mishaps must be reported and investigated. Medical surveillance of all  workers present must begin immediately after a mishap. 5.  Access control procedures were required to keep people not needed to  operate biological laboratories from entering. 6.  Federal, state, and local laws must be obeyed when transporting agents.  7.  Components that contract out biological defense work must prepare  written procedures that set guidelines for facilities, safety, inspections, and  risk analysis. They were also required to monitor contractor performance  in meeting safety requirements, which includes pre-award inspections,  annual inspections of BSL-3 facilities and semiannual inspections of BSL-4  facilities, documentation of safety training programs, designation of an  individual responsible for safety, and storage and disposal procedures.  Contractors working at BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities must prepare a plan for  controlling laboratory mishaps.  8.  Facilities must have published safety plans and monitoring procedures that  they coordinated with federal, state, and local emergency services and  practiced with emergency groups. An occupational health program,  including medical surveillance examinations, was also required. 9.  The regulations also set out operational requirements, including laboratory  techniques, based on biosafety level, and emergency procedures, such as  establishing evacuation procedures and an emergency alarm system. 10. Facilities must abide by personal protective equipment requirements  (based on biosafety level), decontamination and disposal requirements and  shipping restrictions, and facility specifications based on biosafety level  and engineering controls.", "These regulations are located at 32 C.F.R., parts 626 and 627. Army  pamphlet 385-69 also prescribes the minimum safety criteria and technical  requirements and is used in conjunction with these regulations.  Additionally, since USAMRIID was designated a \u201crestricted area\u201d in 1995, a  National Agency Check was also required for general unescorted access  for all staff. The USAMRIID Special Immunizations Clinic provided  baseline medical and occupational health evaluations of fitness to work in  the laboratories and provided vaccines. Annual medical interviews,  physical exams, and laboratory reassessments were conducted for changes  in health, medication, and duties.", "According to information provided to us by USAMRIID, security clearance  was not and is not required to work in high-containment laboratories, and  having a security clearance did not by itself allow access to high- containment laboratories. In 2001, there was no centralized requirement  for inventory control and accountability. Individual scientists maintained  their own stocks and accountability.", "CDC\u2019s regulations in 2001 (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.6) focused on the transfer of  select agents and thus did not focus on personnel security or insider risk  or inventory control of select agents. While Army regulations required that  the consequences of realistic worst case scenarios be examined, insider  risk was not considered in such examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: CDC\u2019s Integrated Approach to Biocontainment at High-Containment Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on the draft report, HHS officials stressed the importance  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) integrated  \u201cthree-legged approach\u201d to biocontainment at high containment  laboratories.  They provided the following technical details of their  biocontainment experiences.      \u201cAccording to CDC officials, monitoring one-pass directional airflow  through negatively pressurized containment zones, enclosed and  separated by airtight doors and structure, with HEPA filtration on both the  supply side (one HEPA filter) and the exhaust side (two HEPA filters),  along with robust Operations and Maintenance protocols (O&M) provides  a sound facility design and construction component for CDC\u2019s \u2018three- legged\u2019 approach to biocontainment.  This approach, which is described in  Section II of the BMBL, stresses that laboratory practice and technique is  the most important element of a comprehensive  containment strategy, in  conjunction with appropriate safety equipment (as a primary barrier) and  facilities design/construction and engineering  (as a secondary  containment barrier). CDC maintains that while directional airflow and  negative pressure in BSL-4 laboratories is a critical engineering  component of a normal \u2018safe\u2019 operating environment, engineering systems  do fail from time-to-time, for various reasons.    \u201cIn the event of a loss of power to the supply and exhaust fans and  controls that maintain negative pressure conditions in CDC\u2019s BSL-4  laboratories, the laboratories go to a \u2018static pressure\u2019 status, whereby  secondary containment is maintained by the airtight door gaskets, airtight  construction of interior walls, floors, and ceiling within the BSL-4  laboratory block, and because the HEPA filters on the supply side  and  exhaust ducts are functionally impermeable to air for certain periods of  time under static pressure conditions. In effect proper design,  construction and O&M render the CDC BSL-4 laboratories into airtight  boxes during a complete loss of normal and standby power during these  events.  Containment was also preserved because CDC\u2019s laboratorians are  properly trained in safe laboratory practices and procedures, and BSL  equipment and safety protocols (primary barriers) functioned as intended.   Equipment within the BSL-4 laboratories include biological safety  cabinets, centrifuges, and heavy-duty personal protective suits (i.e., \u2018space  suits\u2019).   \u201cIn the lightning and bird strike incidents outlined above ,  secondary engineering controls failed due to temporary construction- related impacts, rather than typical operations conditions, and all but UPS- generated life safety required power was lost in B  18. However,  because CDC had appropriated and effective laboratory practice and  safety equipment and practices in place, and because a static pressure  condition had been maintained (as a secondary barrier), the chance of an  accidental release of dangerous pathogens into the environment so as to  cause a significant risk to CDC workers or the surrounding community did  not exist.    \u201cAccording to CDC officials, the lightning and bird strike incidents are not  typical of O&M-related incidents that CDC has experienced over the years  since they are directly related to the intense construction activities at the  Roybal Campus that have been ongoing since approximately 2000, and are  expected to largely conclude in approximately 2011. The construction  activities are the execution of the Agency\u2019s 10-Year Master Plan to replace  the many 50-year old buildings, including laboratories and infrastructure  at the Roybal and Chamblee Campuses.  CDC date  indicates that  even with the lightning and bird strike incidents, the Roybal Campus  electrical distribution system has had a  99.9997 percent reliability rate, or  approximately 10 hours of documented down-time due to power outages  during 78,840 hours of total run time (2000-2008). CDC expects to reduce  electrical system downtime once construction activities have ceased.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s responses to the Department of Health and  Human Service\u2019s (HHS) comments in a letter dated July 20, 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We agree with HHS. Our report acknowledges that no executive or  legislative mandate currently requires any agency to gather this  information and we are making a recommendation in this regard. 2.  We agree that instituting new regulatory reporting requirements about  the location of all BSL-3 laboratories could create a burden on private  sector laboratories and would require new federal resources.    3.  Our report did acknowledge information from CDC officials stating  that at the time of both incidents, the new BSL-4 facility was not fully  operational and that no agents were inside the facility. However, we  believe that CDC is missing the point. Given that grounding cables  were cut, it is apparent that the building\u2019s integrity as it related to  adjacent construction was not adequately supervised.  CDC officials  stated that standard procedures under building codes did not require  monitoring of the integrity of the new BSL-4 facility\u2019s electrical  grounding.  This incident highlighted the risks inherent in relying on  standard building codes to ensure the safety of high-containment  laboratories\u2014as there are no building codes and testing procedures  specifically for those laboratories.  We agree with CDC that high- containment laboratories include a three-legged and multi-tiered  approach to containment. However, to have a fully safe system of  containment, any failure of one tier or one of the legs needs to be  rapidly identified and corrected. Our focus in this incident was on  CDC\u2019s power system and lessons that can be learned for other high- containment labs. 4.  We modified the language in our report to note that a loss of power  could have serious consequences under certain circumstances. 5.  While we agree that critical differences, purposes, and functions  differentiating code-required emergency power and legally required  standby power are important when planning and designing electrical  distribution systems for biological laboratories and other science  buildings, this does not materially affect our findings. 6.  We disagree with CDC that the titer should be at least four times higher  than the baseline level to be considered an exposure.  Most  importantly, any increase in titers involving an agent that is being  worked on at a laboratory should be taken seriously and investigated.", "The laboratory safety aspect of antibody titers is clearly different from  those that apply to a general clinical situation.  The increase in titers  may indicate natural exposure to the agent (depending on the agent  and location of the lab) or result from inconsistencies associated with  laboratory testing.  Most serological assays for select agents are not  commonly conducted in clinical laboratories and are primarily  performed in research laboratories.  As such, these assays may not be  properly controlled and validated.  Assay-to-assay variation may be  high, especially if experience is limited.  Additionally, such assays are  not particularly robust unless baseline specimens are available for  comparison testing and serum samples are collected within relatively  short time frames (for example, 3 to 6 months).   7.  We agree with HHS that national goals may change over time.", "Therefore, it is important that the strategic evaluation of high- containment laboratories be undertaken periodically.  We have  modified our recommendation to include periodic evaluation. 8.  Our report recommends that a single entity be charged with  governmentwide strategic evaluation of high-containment laboratories.  While we agree that there are several challenges, having a single  agency would facilitate a coordinated response. 9.  We agree that future evaluations of laboratory capacity and supply  should examine the needs of the clinical laboratories related to their  high-containment capacity.  However, knowing the number of  laboratories is a key requirement to making such evaluation effective. 10. We disagree. We believe that national standards contribute to ensuring  that all high-containment laboratories meet minimum standards.   National standards are valuable not only in relation to new laboratory  construction but also in ensuring compliance for periodic upgrades.   We agree that BMBL provides guidance on design and construction;  however, the guidance does not provide standards that must be  adhered to.  While sharing lessons learned can be beneficial to meeting  standards, it is not an adequate substitute for the standards themselves.   If existing laboratories do not meet national standards, we believe that  these laboratories need to be brought into compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sushil Sharma, Ph.D., DrPH  (Assistant Director), Amy Bowser, George Depaoli, Terrell Dorn, Jeff  McDermott, Jean McSween, Jack Melling, Ph.D., Corey Scherrer, Linda  Sellevaag, and Elaine Vaurio made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Biological Research: Observations on DHS\u2019s Analyses Concerning  Whether FMD Research Can Be Done as Safely on the Mainland as on  Plum Island GAO-09-747.
