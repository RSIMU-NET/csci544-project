In July 2007, GAO reported that PBGC's governance structure needed improvements, and asked Congress to consider expanding the board of directors to include additional members. GAO also recommended that the board develop policies and mechanisms consistent with corporate governance practices, and develop formal guidelines to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the board chair, members, their representatives, and the director. On the basis of that work, this report addresses (1) the steps PBGC has taken to improve policy direction and oversight and (2) how Congress applies oversight to PBGC and what other oversight mechanisms exist for government corporations. GAO reviewed PBGC's new corporate bylaws and the structure and reporting requirements of selected government corporations. GAO also interviewed PBGC and Department of Labor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although PBGC's board has strengthened the corporation's governing bylaws, the three-member board of directors is still limited in its ability to provide policy direction and oversight to PBGC. In implementing our earlier recommendation, the board revised the corporation's bylaws to more clearly define the roles and responsibilities of PBGC's board members, representatives, director, and senior management. PBGC also contracted with a consulting firm to provide a background report to assist the board in its review of alternative corporate governance structures, including restructuring the board of directors as GAO suggested in 2007. However, because of its small size, the board has not been able to develop procedures and mechanisms to monitor PBGC's operations, such as standing committees, which are mechanisms used by other government corporations. PBGC may also be exposed to challenges as the board, its representatives, and the director will likely change with the upcoming presidential transition in January 2009. While PBGC management has experienced a partial leadership change in recent years and provides operational and financial information to those newly appointed, PBGC Inspector General and GAO reports have recently identified additional financial and operational challenges facing the corporation. This additional information could help the new board members better understand the vulnerabilities and challenges facing the corporation. PBGC is subject to routine congressional oversight, but certain other government corporations have other types of reporting requirements in place--such as congressional notifications and reporting protocols for their advisory committees--to ensure effective communication exist between the corporations and Congress. Congressional oversight of PBGC in recent years has ranged from formal committee hearings to investigations and studies conducted by its congressional support agencies. For example, since 2002, PBGC officials have testified 19 times before several different committees on issues such as the status of its financial condition. Further, GAO, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Service have issued a variety of reports and testimonies on PBGC financial and operational matters. However, PBGC does not have reporting requirements applied to other government corporations for providing additional information to Congress. For example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Commodity Credit Corporation are required to notify Congress prior to conducting certain financial transactions. The advisory committee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation formally reports to its board of directors, while the Export-Import Bank of the United States' advisory committee formally reports to its board and Congress each year on matters related to their respective organizations. In addition, the advisory boards of other government entities with retirement-related responsibilities--such as the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board--provide reports to their overseeing bodies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures the pension  benefits of 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30,000  employer-sponsored pension plans.

The Secretary has historically delegated the responsibility for  administering PBGC to an executive director. The Pension Protection Act  replaced the chair of the board as PBGC\u2019s administrator with a Senate- confirmed director. The corporation is also aided by a seven-member  Advisory Committee appointed by the President to represent the interest  of labor, employees, and the general public. This committee has an  advisory role, but has no statutory authority to set PBGC policy or conduct  formal oversight. PBGC also has an Office of Inspector General that  reports to the board through the chair.

Because of their responsibilities and the small size of the  board, it is difficult for the board to establish and manage oversight  mechanisms, such as the use of standing committees\u2014which are common  mechanisms used by both government and private corporate boards.  According to board officials, the board representatives, assisted by their  staff, undertake some of the oversight functions that could be conducted  by standing committees. Other government corporations, such as the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the National Railroad Passenger  Corporation (Amtrak), have established standing committees to conduct  certain oversight functions.

The  director\u2019s testimony discussed the possible effects such defaults would  have on the defined benefit pension industry and the financial position of  the corporation.

For example, in April 2008, CBO reported that PBGC\u2019s  investment policy is likely to produce higher returns over the long run, but  noted the new strategy increases the risk that PBGC will not have  sufficient assets to cover retirees\u2019 benefit payments when the economy  and financial markets are weak.

The Millennium Challenge  Corporation is required to formally notify the appropriate congressional  committees 15 days prior to the allocation or transfer of funds related to  the corporation\u2019s activities. The Commodity Credit Corporation is subject  to a similar requirement, which obliges the Secretary of Agriculture to  alert the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate  and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives prior to  making adjustments to a certain price support program.

These examples demonstrate how  Congress has required additional reporting requirements for certain  activities conducted by government corporations. While PBGC generally  has no requirements to formally notify Congress prior to taking significant  financial or operational actions, PBGC officials said that they informally  notify Congress prior to certain policy shifts. For example, in fiscal year  2008, PBGC officials met with congressional staff before modifying the  investment policy to decrease the corporation\u2019s fixed-income asset  investments. In addition to its annual reporting requirements, PBGC is  required to report proposals for certain premium rate revisions, including  reasons for such revisions, to specific congressional committees; however,  these premium rate revisions are not considered effective until 30 days  after enactment of a law approving them.", "Like other government corporations, PBGC has an advisory committee.

Unlike  PBGC\u2019s advisory committee, the advisory boards or committees of other  government corporations\u2014such as the Export-Import Bank and FDIC\u2014 are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and some submit  formal reports to their board chair and directors (see table 2). In contrast,  PBGC\u2019s advisory committee is not subject to the Federal Advisory  Committee Act. According to PBGC officials, the corporation is exempt  because of the proprietary nature of its work.

In addition to government corporations, some government  agencies with retirement-related responsibilities\u2014such as the Social  Security Administration (SSA), the Railroad Retirement Board, and the  Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board\u2014have advisory committees  as part of their governance structures, which annually report to their  respective overseeing bodies.
