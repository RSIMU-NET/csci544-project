First, the U.S. government designates terrorists and blocks their assets and financial transactions and supports similar efforts of other countries. Second, intelligence and law enforcement efforts include operations, investigations, and exchanging information and evidence with foreign counterparts. Third, U.S. agencies work through the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to help set international standards to counter terrorist financing. Fourth, the U.S. government provides training and technical assistance directly to vulnerable countries and works with its allies to leverage resources. The U.S. government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the delivery of counter-terrorism financing training and technical assistance to countries vulnerable to terrorist financing. Specifically, the effort does not have key stakeholder acceptance of roles and procedures, a strategic alignment of resources with needs, or a process to measure performance. First, the Department of Treasury does not accept the Department of State leadership or the State-led Terrorist Financing Working Group's (TFWG) procedures for the delivery of training and technical assistance abroad. While supportive of the Department of State's role as coordinator of TFWG efforts, the Department of Justice officials confirmed that roles and procedures were a matter of disagreement. Second, the U.S. government does not have a clear presentation and objective assessment of its resources and has not strategically aligned them with its needs for counter-terrorist financing training and technical assistance. Third, the U.S. government, including TFWG, lacks a system for measuring performance and incorporating results into its planning efforts. The Treasury faces two accountability issues related to its terrorist asset blocking efforts. First, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) reports on the nature and extent of terrorists' U.S. assets do not provide Congress the ability to assess OFAC's achievements. Second, Treasury lacks meaningful performance measures to assess its terrorist designation and asset blocking efforts. OFAC is in the process of developing more meaningful performance measures aided by its early efforts to develop an OFAC-specific strategic plan. Officials stated that OFAC's new performance measures will be completed by December 1, 2005, and its strategic plan will be completed by January 1, 2006; however, they did not provide us with documentation of milestones or completion dates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the United States and its allies  quickly recognized the urgent need to detect, dismantle, and deter terrorist  financing networks around the world.

Terrorist financiers operate more easily in countries with systems that  enable them to hide their efforts without difficulty.

While actual terrorist operations require only  comparatively modest funding, international terrorist groups need  significant amounts of money to organize, recruit, train, and equip new  adherents and to otherwise support their activities.", "Simply, the financing of terrorism is the financial support, in any form, of  terrorism or of those who encourage, plan, or engage in it. Some  international experts on money laundering continue to find that there is  little difference in the methods used by terrorist groups or criminal  organizations in attempting conceal their proceeds by moving them  through national and international financial systems. These experts simply  define the term \u201cmoney laundering\u201d as the processing of criminal proceeds  to disguise their illegal origin in order to legitimize their ill-gotten gains.  Disguising the source of terrorist financing, regardless of whether the  source is of legitimate or illicit origin, is important to terrorist financiers.

For example, in October 1999, the Security Council adopted UN  Security Council Resolution 1267, which called on all member states to  freeze the assets of the Taliban, and in December 2000, the Security Council  adopted Resolution 1333, imposing targeted sanctions against Osama bin  Laden and al Qaeda. Then, in response to the attacks of September 11,  2001, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1373, which required all  UN member states to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic  resources of persons who commit or attempt to commit, participate in, or  facilitate terrorist acts. Later in January 2002 the UN Security Council  adopted Resolution 1390, which consolidated the sanctions contained in  Resolutions 1267 and 1333 against the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, and al  Qaeda. In July 2005, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1617, which  extends sanctions against al Qaeda and the Taliban and strengthens  previous related resolutions. The UN has listed over 300 individuals and  over 100 entities for worldwide asset blocks. Additionally, State\u2019s Bureau of  International Organization Affairs ensures designations related to al Qaeda,  the Taliban, or Osama bin Laden are made worldwide obligations through  the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee and helped to craft  and aided the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and  assisted in the creation of the UN Counterterrorism Committee to oversee  its implementation. The United States has also participated in bilateral  efforts to designate terrorists. For example, as of July 2005, the United  States and Saudi Arabia jointly designated over a dozen Saudi-related  entities and multiple individuals as terrorists or terrorist supporters,  according to State.", "U.S. agencies including the Departments of Homeland Security (Homeland  Security), Justice, State, and Treasury, and other law enforcement and  intelligence agencies have implemented an interagency process to  coordinate designating terrorists and blocking their assets.

According to State, its Office of the  Coordinator for Counterterrorism is charged with directing, managing, and  coordinating all U.S. government agencies\u2019 efforts to develop and provide  counter-terrorism financing programs. The NSC established the State-led  interagency TFWG to coordinate the delivery of training and technical  assistance to the countries most vulnerable to terrorist financing. These  countries are known as priority countries of which there are currently  about two dozen. According to State\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for  Counterterrorism, foreign allies inundated the U.S. government with  requests for assistance; therefore, TFWG developed a process to prioritize  the use of limited financial and human resources. Although other  vulnerable countries may be assisted through other U.S. government  programs as well as through TFWG, according to State, based on NSC  guidance, overall coordination is to take place through the TFWG process.  (See appendix III for TFWG membership and process.) TFWG schedules  assessment trips, reviews assessment reports, evaluates training proposals,  and assigns resources for training.

Methods include training courses, presentations at  international conferences, the use of overseas regional U.S. law  enforcement academies or U.S.-based schools, and the placement of  intermittent or long-term resident advisors for a range of subject areas  related to building effective counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering  regimes. For example, Justice provides technical assistance on drafting  legislation that criminalizes terrorist financing and anti-money laundering.  Treasury\u2019s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) provides assistance to  strengthen the financial regulatory regimes of countries.

According to State  officials, efforts to share identified priorities and coordinate assistance by  the major donor countries took a step forward at the June 2003 G-8 Summit  with the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Action Group, of which  the United States is a member. The Counter-Terrorism Action Group has  partnered with the FATF, providing that organization with a list of countries  to which its members are interested in providing counter-terrorism  financing assistance, so that the FATF could assess their technical  assistance needs.

According to State  officials, State leads the U.S. effort to provide counter-terrorism financing  training and technical assistance to all countries the U.S. government  deems vulnerable to terrorist financing. State bases its position on  classified NSC documents focused primarily on TFWG, State documents,  and authorizing legislation. Treasury, an agency that also funds as well as  provides training and technical assistance, asserts that State overstates its  role; according to Treasury, State\u2019s role is limited to coordinating other U.S.  agencies\u2019 provision of counter-terrorist financing training and technical  assistance in commonly agreed upon TFWG priority countries, and that  there are numerous other efforts outside of States\u2019 purview. Justice, an  agency that provides training and technical assistance and receives funding  from State, states that it respects the role that State plays as the TFWG  chairman and coordinator and states that all counter-terrorism financing  training and technical assistance efforts should be brought under the  TFWG decision-making process. While supportive, Justice\u2019s statement  demonstrates that the span of State\u2019s role lacks clarity and recognition in  practice. Two senior Treasury OTA officials said they strongly disagree with  the degree of control State asserts over decisions at the State-led TFWG  regarding the delivery of training and technical assistance. According to a  Treasury Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC) Senior Policy  Advisor who attends TFWG, in practice the TFWG process is broken and  State creates obstacles rather than coordinates efforts. According to  officials from State\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who  chair TFWG, the only problems are the lack of Treasury\u2019s TFFC and OTA  officials\u2019 acceptance of State\u2019s leadership over counter-terrorism financing  efforts and separate OTA funding.", "Legislation authorizing the Departments of State and Treasury to conduct  counter-terrorism financing training and technical assistance activities  does not explicitly designate a lead agency. State derives its authority for  these activities from the International Security and Development  Cooperation Act of 1985, which mandates that the Secretary of State  \u201ccoordinate\u201d all international counter-terrorism assistance. Treasury\u2019s  primary authority for its assistance programs derives from a 1998  amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which authorized the  Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State and  the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, to  establish a program to provide economic and financial technical assistance  to foreign governments and foreign central banks. This provision further  mandates that State provide foreign policy guidance to the Secretary of the  Treasury to ensure that the program is effectively integrated into the  foreign policy of the United States.", "State and Treasury officials also disagree on procedures and practices for  the delivery of counter-terrorism financing training and technical  assistance. State cited NSC guidance and an unclassified State document  focusing on TFWG as providing procedures and practices for delivering  training and technical assistance to all countries. Treasury officials told us  that the procedures and practices were only pertinent to the TFWG priority  countries and that there is no formal mandate or process to provide  technical assistance to countries outside the priority list. Moreover, Justice  officials told us that having procedures and practices for TFWG priority  countries that differ from those for other vulnerable countries creates  problems. This issue is further complicated by the lack of consistent and  clear delineation between the countries covered by TFWG and other  vulnerable countries also receiving counter-terrorism financing and anti- money laundering assistance funded through State and Treasury. Treasury  officials told us that TFWG procedures and practices are overly structured  and impractical and have not been updated to incorporate stakeholder  concerns and that the overall process does not function as it should. State  and Treasury officials cited numerous examples of disagreements on  procedures and practices. For example:   State and Treasury officials disagree on the use of OTA funding and  contractors. According to Treasury officials, OTA funding should  primarily be used to support intermittent and long-term resident  advisors, who are U.S. contractors, to provide technical assistance.  According to State officials, OTA should supplement State\u2019s program,  which primarily funds current employees of other U.S. agencies.", "State, Justice, and Treasury officials disagree on whether it is  appropriate for U.S. contractors to provide assistance in legislative  drafting efforts on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism  financing laws. State officials cited NSC guidance that current Justice  employees should be primarily responsible for working with foreign  countries to assist in drafting such laws and voiced strong resistance to  use of contractors. Justice officials strongly stated that contractors  should not assist in drafting laws and gave several examples of past  problems when USAID and OTA contractor assistance led to problems  with the development of foreign laws. In two examples, Justice officials  stated that USAID and OTA contractor work did not result in laws  meeting FATF standards. In another example, Justice officials reported  that a USAID contractor assisted in drafting an anti-money laundering  law that had substantial deficiencies and as a result Justice officials had  to take over the drafting process. According to OTA officials, their  contractors provide assistance in drafting laws in non-priority countries  and OTA makes drafts available to Justice and other U.S. agencies for  review and comment and ultimately the host country itself is  responsible for final passage of a law that meets international  standards.", "Treasury and State officials disagree on the use of confidentiality  agreements between contractors and the foreign officials they advise.  State officials said OTA\u2019s use of confidentiality agreements impedes U.S.  interagency coordination. State officials said the issue created a  coordination problem in one country because a poorly written draft law  could not be shared with other U.S. agencies for review and resulted in  the development of an ineffective anti-money laundering law. Moreover,  State officials said the continued practice could present future  challenges. However, according to Treasury officials, this was an  isolated case involving a problem with the contract and they said they  have taken procedural steps to ensure the error is not repeated.", "State and Treasury officials disagree on the procedures for conducting  assessments of country\u2019s needs for training and technical assistance.  Moreover, Treasury stated that their major concern is with State\u2019s  coordination process for the delivery and timing of assistance.  According to TFWG procedures for priority countries, if an assessment  trip is determined to be necessary, State is to lead and determine the  composition of the teams and set the travel dates. This is complicated  when a vulnerable country becomes a priority country. For example, in  November 2004 Treasury conducted an OTA financial assessment in a  nonpriority frontline country and subsequently reached agreement with  that country\u2019s central bank minister to put a resident advisor in place to  set up a FIU. However, in May 2005, State officials denied clearance for  Treasury official\u2019s visit to the country, which has created a delay of 2.5  months (as of the end of July 2005). Treasury officials provided  documentation to show that State was aware of their intention to visit  the country in November 2004 to determine counter-terrorism and  financial intelligence technical assistance needs, the official leading the  segment of work was part of a larger on-going OTA effort in country, and  that Treasury kept TFWG informed of the results of OTA\u2019s work and  continuing efforts. State officials expressed concern that the country  had recently become a priority country. According to State TFWG  officials, Treasury work needed to be delayed until a TFWG assessment  could be completed.

Further,  neither the U.S. government nor TFWG has made a systematic and  objective assessment of the full range of available U.S. and potential  international resources.

State primarily transmits its  training and technical assistance funds to other agencies while Treasury  primarily employs short and long term advisors through personal service  contracts.

Specifically, as a portion of funds that OTA has  obligated for financial enforcement related assistance between fiscal years  2002 and 2005, OTA has obligated approximately 11 percent to priority  countries. State officials said that they welcomed more OTA participation  in priority countries as part of the mix of applicable resources; however,  they questioned whether OTA consistently provides high-quality assistance.

First, these measures  are not specific to terrorist financing. Two of the three measures do not  separate data on terrorists from data on other entities such as drug  traffickers, hostile foreign governments, corrupt regimes, and foreign drug  cartels, though OFAC officials acknowledged that they could have reported  the data separately. Second, Treasury officials said that progress on asset  blocking cannot simply be measured by totaling an amount of blocked  assets at the end of the year, as the amounts may vary over the year as  assets are blocked and unblocked. Third, Treasury has not developed  measures to track other activities and benefits related to terrorist  designations and asset blocking. For example, according to Treasury  officials, Treasury\u2019s underlying research to identify terrorist entities and  their support systems is used to aid U.S. financial regulators, law  enforcement, and other officials.

Measuring effectiveness in  terms of deterrence can be very difficult, in part because the direct impact  on unlawful activity is unknown, and in part because precise metrics are  hard to develop for illegal and clandestine activities. According to Treasury  officials, measuring effectiveness can also be difficult because many of  these efforts run across U.S. government agencies and foreign governments  and are highly sensitive. Treasury\u2019s annual report and strategic plan,  however, do not address the deterrent value of designations or discuss the  difficulties in measuring its effectiveness.

It is useful to note that  Treasury repeatedly placed the focus of efforts for improvement on priority  countries and, as noted in its technical comments, does not recognize  State\u2019s leadership over the delivery of training and technical assistance  other than to priority countries.

DOJ agrees with the  observation that the Treasury Department does not accept the State Department\u2019s  leadership or the procedures. . . .\u201d   \u201cJustice officials confirmed that roles and procedures were a matter of dispute.\u201d It would  be more accurate to replace dispute with disagreement.\u201d", "GAO response: Justice made these two comments concerning the  statement in the draft report that \u201cJustice officials confirmed that roles  and procedures were a matter of dispute.\u201d  We added language to show  that Justice is supportive of State\u2019s role as coordinator of TFWG efforts  and substituted the word \u201cdisagreement\u201d for \u201cdispute\u201d when stating  that \u201cJustice officials confirmed that roles and procedures were a  matter of disagreement.\u201d", "2. \u201cThe draft report references that AFMLS   stated that \u201cthe Department of State\u2019s leadership role is limited to its chairmanship of  TFWG\u2026\u201d To be clear, this statement was not made to suggest that the TFWG be limited to  priority countries, but rather that differing standards on procedures (particularly with DOJ  leadership role in legislative drafting) for priority countries and vulnerable countries creates  problems.\u201d", "GAO response:  In response to this point, we removed the report\u2019s  reference to AFMLS and noted that Justice officials told us that having  procedures and practices for TFWG priority countries that differ from  those for other vulnerable countries creates problems."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State\u2019s letter  dated October 3, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. State noted in its comments that it does not believe the report  accurately portrays the overall effectiveness and success of the  Administration\u2019s counter-terrorism finance programs. While a number  of comments suggested including information indicative of the  successes of agency efforts to address terrorist financing abroad, much  of this information is outside of the scope of this report. However, we  have made a number of changes in response to these comments. First,  we have added information on the accomplishments of U.S. agencies to  the report. For example, we added information on the number of needs  assessment missions conducted and the number of countries receiving  training and technical assistance. Second, we have adjusted our first  objective to clarify that we are providing an overview of U.S. agencies'  efforts to address terrorist financing abroad. Third, as we note in other  comments, we have adjusted the title of the report to better reflect the  focus of our work. 2. State commented that it has an integrated strategic plan which is  evidenced through classified NSC Deputies Committee documentation  and the Department of States\u2019 Office of the Coordinator for  Counterterrorism\u2019s Bureau Performance Plan. We reviewed the NSC  Deputies Committee documentation, which includes minutes, an  agreement, and conclusions-- all of which serve as the NSC guidance  for the TFWG. We also reviewed the performance plan, which includes  the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism\u2019s objectives and  performance measures for counter-terrorist financing programs and  provides some performance indicators, such as the number of  assessments and training plans completed. Although some aspects of a  strategic plan for delivering training and technical assistance are  included in these documents, we do not agree that this guidance and  performance plan includes the elements necessary to constitute an  integrated strategy for the coordination of the delivery of training and  technical assistance abroad. In addition to not having a fully integrated  strategy on paper, the NSC guidance lacks clarity, particularly regarding  coverage of non-priority countries. The guidance also lacks familiarity  and clear buy-in among the pertinent levels of agencies. As a result, the  documents did not guide the actions of the agencies in actual practice.  3. State commented that \u201cif the country team, interagency and host  government agree on an implementation plan, TFWG determines the  necessary funding for State to obligate to each agency with the  appropriate expertise.\u201d State added that it carefully monitors and can  account for all of the funding Congress has appropriated for training  programs coordinated through the TFWG, as provided in a classified  report. Our report did not specifically address TFWG-reported  obligations and expenditures, as this information focusing on priority  countries was classified. Our report focused on the lack of  transparency in the overall amount of funds available for all counter- terrorism training and technical assistance programs within State and  the Treasury. Because funding is embedded with anti-money laundering  and other programs, the U.S. government does not have a clear  presentation of the budget resources that State and Treasury allocate  for training and technical assistance to counter-terrorist financing as  differentiated from other programs. Although various officials told us  that funding for counter-terrorism financing training and technical  assistance is insufficient, the lack of a clear presentation of available  budget resources makes it difficult for decision-makers to determine  the actual amount that may be allocated to these efforts.  4. We do not agree with State\u2019s comment that TFWG has been very  diligent in developing methods to measure its success. As of July 2005,  the U.S. government, including TFWG, did not have a system in place to  measure the results of its efforts to deliver training and technical  assistance and to incorporate this information into integrated planning  efforts. Our report acknowledges that an interagency committee was  set up to develop a system to measure results and other efforts were  undertaken to track training and technical assistance; however,  according to agency officials, these efforts have not yet resulted in  performance measures.  5. Based on our review of NSC and other documents provided by State,  the U.S. government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the  delivery of training and technical assistance. The classified document  serving as an interagency agreement lacks clarity as well as familiarity  and buy-in from all agencies and levels of leadership within TFWG,  particularly Treasury. The NSC guidance was agreed to at the deputy  level, and we found that many of the working level staff were not  familiar with the guidance or the interpretation of the guidance and  Treasury staff clearly did not have the same interpretation as State  staff. 6. State noted that there are established methods to resolve disputes that  arise through the interagency process and it is rare that the TFWG  process cannot resolve issues. While there are guidelines for resolving  disputes, in practice there are long-standing disagreements that have  not been resolved. Based on discussions with agency officials and  review of documentation, our report provides examples of long- standing disagreements that have not been resolved such as the use of  contractors and procedures for conducting assessments of country\u2019s  needs for training and technical assistance.  7. State commented that it is the primary responsibility of the TFWG to  coordinate all training and technical assistance and notes the existence  of formal supporting documents. State commented that while it does  not believe additional formal documents are necessary, if a  Memorandum of Agreement concerning counter-terrorism financing  and anti-money laundering training and technical assistance were to be  developed, State commented that it should include all agencies  involved in providing training and technical assistance. Our review as  well as Treasury\u2019s technical comments clearly shows that Treasury  does not accept State\u2019s position that TFWG\u2019s primary responsibility is  to coordinate all counter-terrorist financing training and technical  assistance abroad. Treasury limits this role to priority countries. Based  on our review of NSC and other documents provided by State, the U.S.  government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the delivery of  training and technical assistance. The classified document, which  according to State serves as an interagency agreement, lacks clarity,  familiarity, and buy-in from all levels of leadership within TFWG,  particularly Treasury. State and Treasury both fund and support U.S.  government anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing  training and technical assistance programs, and Treasury also provides  considerable training and technical assistance abroad through  contractors and U.S. government employees. It is important that their  programs and funding are integrated to optimize results. Other agencies  are important stakeholders as they are recipients of this funding and  support and would benefit from improved coordination between these  two agencies. 8. State comments that our recommendation to the Secretary of the  Treasury regarding Treasury\u2019s annual Terrorist Assets Report to  Congress was incomplete because it makes no mention of State\u2019s role  in blocking assets. Specifically we recommend that Treasury provide  more complete information on the nature and extent of asset blocking  in the United States in its annual Terrorist Assets Report to Congress.  We did not incorporate the Secretary of State into this recommendation  because the scope of our request for our third objective focused solely  on the accountability issues Treasury faces in its efforts to block  terrorists\u2019 assets. State also expressed disappointment that our report  did not include details on State\u2019s role in terrorist designations. While  our report provides an overview of how U.S. government agencies use  designations to disrupt terrorist networks, we recognize that State has  an important role and added language to provide more detail on State\u2019s  role in targeting individuals, groups, or other entities suspected of  terrorism or terrorist financing.", "9.", "In response to agency comments, we have revised the title of the report  to focus on our key recommendation. 10. The scope of our second objective was to examine U.S. efforts to  coordinate the delivery of training and technical assistance to  vulnerable countries. The effort does not have key stakeholder buy-in  on roles and practices, a strategic alignment of resources with needs, or  a system to measure performance and incorporate this information into  its planning efforts. According to agency officials, the lack of effective  leadership leads to less than optimal delivery of training and technical  assistance to vulnerable countries. Without a system to measure  performance, the U.S. government and TFWG cannot ensure that its  efforts are on track. 11. Although this report is based on unclassified information, GAO  reviewed all unclassified and classified information provided by State  in support of TFWG efforts. We believe that findings, conclusions, and  recommendations accurately portray the interagency process.  Moreover, we reviewed and incorporated additional information  provided by State subsequent to issuing our draft to the agencies for  comment to ensure that all available information was assessed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  letter dated October 5, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Treasury notes in its comments that the report falls short in describing  the comprehensive efforts of the U.S. government efforts to combat  terrorist financing abroad. While a number of comments suggested  including information indicative of the successes of agency efforts to  address terrorist financing abroad, much of this information is outside  of the scope of this report. However, we have made a number of  changes in response to these comments. First, we have added  information on the accomplishments of U.S. agencies to the report. For  example, we added that Treasury has coordinated bilateral and  international technical assistance with the FATF and the international  financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International  Monetary Fund, to draft legal frameworks, build necessary regulatory  and institutional systems, and develop human expertise. Second, we  have adjusted our first objective to clarify that we are providing an  overview of U.S. agencies' efforts to address terrorist financing abroad.  Third, as we note in other comments, we have adjusted the title of the  report to better reflect the focus of our work. 2. Treasury suggests that the title of the draft report be modified to be  consistent with the primary focus of the report. We agree and have  revised the title of the report to focus on the key recommendations.  3. Treasury states that the report does not accurately characterize  Treasury\u2019s role in managing the U.S. government\u2019s relationship with  international financial institutions. We recognize that Treasury plays an  important role and added more examples of Treasury\u2019s relationship  with international financial institutions as provided in Treasury\u2019s  technical comments. For example, we added Treasury\u2019s relationship  with an intergovernmental body --the Financial Action Task Force-- in  setting international standards for anti-money laundering and counter- terrorism financing regimes. In addition, we added mentions of  Treasury\u2019s relationship with the Asian Development Bank, IMF and the  World Bank.  4. Treasury comments that the report focuses on the difficulties and  differences arising from the interagency process to coordinate training  and technical assistance to combat terrorist financing abroad and fails  to give due credit for the successes that have been achieved through  unprecedented interagency coordination. Our report concludes that the  U.S. government lacks an integrated strategy to coordinate the delivery  of training and technical assistance because key stakeholders do not  agree on roles and practices, there is not a clear presentation of what  funding is available for counter-terrorism financing training and  technical assistance, and a system has not been established to measure  performance and incorporate this information into its planning efforts.  Our report notes that, according to agency officials, the lack of  effective leadership leads to less than optimal delivery of training and  technical assistance to vulnerable countries. However, we have  included some interagency accomplishments such as numbers of  assessments in our description of training and technical assistance  efforts under objective 1. To best provide evidence of the effectiveness  of the U.S. government efforts, the U.S. government should continue to  develop a system to measure performance and incorporate this  information into its planning efforts.", "5.", "In its comments, Treasury states that the report\u2019s third objective on  accountability issues appears somewhat incongruous in a report  dedicated to U.S. counter-terrorism training and technical assistance.  Our requesters asked us to address specific issues related to U.S.  efforts to combat terrorist financing abroad, including accountability  issues Treasury faces in its efforts to block terrorists\u2019 assets held under  U.S. jurisdiction, particularly with regard to the Treasury\u2019s annual  Terrorist Assets Reports. 6. We reviewed the revised text provided by Treasury for our report\u2019s third  objective on accountability issues the Department faces in its efforts to  block terrorists\u2019 assets held under U.S. jurisdiction. We noted that we  already cover many of Treasury\u2019s points in our report. However, in  some cases we incorporated technical information to help clarify the  challenges the department faces in assessing the impact of terrorist  designation activities. In addition, we updated the report to reflect the  most current status of Treasury\u2019s efforts to establish performance  measures for OFAC. Additionally, we acknowledge that the language in  the mandate for the Terrorist Assets Reports did not explicitly design  the reports as an accountability measure of the Office of Foreign Assets  Control\u2019s effectiveness in identifying and blocking terrorist assets;  however, nothing in the statutory language or in the congressional  intent underlying the mandate precludes Treasury from compiling and  reporting information in the manner in which we have suggested in this  report. Furthermore, we believe that inclusion of comparative  information and additional explanation regarding significant shifts  between years will enhance program reporting and congressional  oversight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": ["\u201cThe second paragraph of this section states, \u201cFirst, although the Department of State  asserts that it leads the overall effort to deliver training and technical assistance to all  vulnerable countries, the Department of Treasury does not accept State in this role.\u201d  This  statement should be clarified to reflect that while Treasury does acknowledge State\u2019s role, it  believes that State\u2019s function is necessarily one of coordination. State\u2019s role in this process is  not to actually \u201cdeliver\u201d assistance. Rather, Treasury believes that State\u2019s role is  coordinating each USG agency\u2019s personnel and expertise to allow them to deliver the  needed training in commonly agreed upon priority countries. Treasury also acknowledges  that the draft report is helpful in pointing out that this coordination can and should be  improved to facilitate more effective delivery of assistance in priority countries.\u201d \u201cThe first paragraph contains the following statement \u201cAccording to the Department of  State, its Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism is charged with directing,  managing, and coordinating all U.S. government agencies\u2019 efforts to develop and provide  counter-terrorism financing programs.\u201d This statement is inaccurately overbroad, as  Treasury (and likely other government agencies) has developed numerous counterterrorist  financing programs to advance the core strategic aims identified in the 2003 NMLS [National  Money Laundering Strategy].

The report, based upon the input  of numerous government agencies, provides a snapshot of the known assets held in the  United States by terrorist-supporting countries and terrorist groups at a given point in  time. These numbers may fluctuate during each year and between years for a number of  policy-permissible reasons. The amount of assets blocked under a terrorism sanctions  program is not a primary measure of a terrorism sanctions program\u2019s effectiveness, and  countries that have been declared terrorist supporting, and whose assets are not blocked  by a sanctions program, are already wary of holding assets in the United States.\u2019\u201d", "GAO response: We noted Treasury\u2019s position on this recommendation  in our report.
