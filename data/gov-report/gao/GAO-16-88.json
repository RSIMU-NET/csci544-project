For example, the Strategy fully addressed asset visibility goals and objectives, and roles and responsibilities for overseeing its strategy, as required by the mandate. However, the Strategy did not fully address elements such as including an estimate of costs associated with executing its asset visibility implementation plans. In October 2015, DOD published its 2015 Strategy for Improving DOD Asset Visibility (2015 Strategy ) in which it more fully addressed 4 of the 5 elements that were partially addressed in the 2014 Strategy. For example, the 2015 Strategy fully addresses steps DOD is taking to facilitate collaboration with industry to capture best practices, as required by the mandate. However, with the 2015 Strategy , DOD has not fully addressed the cost estimates element for three of its 2014 implementation plans as GAO recommended in January 2015. DOD officials said that they did not include the cost estimates for three of the implementation plans because the funding for these plans was embedded within the overall program funding and in these cases components could not isolate detailed cost estimates. DOD officials said they plan to amend their guidance before the next update to the Strategy, expected in fall 2016, to instruct the components on how to explain and document such cases.", "DOD has also taken other actions as GAO recommended in May 2012 that GAO was required to assess with respect to asset visibility. For example, DOD's 2014 Strategy established milestones for implementing Item Unique Identification (IUID) to better track assets. In its 2015 Strategy , DOD updated these milestones. However, it is not always clear what progress DOD has made against all of the milestones set in its 2014 Strategy . For example, the milestones associated with updating automated information systems in the 2015 Strategy do not reflect progress made to date for each of the military services. GAO has previously reported that milestones provide decision makers with the information they need to assess progress and estimate realistic completion dates. If the updates to the Strategy do not clarify what progress DOD has made in meeting its previous milestones, the utility of these milestones will be limited. Officials agreed and commented they plan to take further action in the next update to the Strategy to ensure that progress that has been made is more easily understood. Finally, DOD's 2014 Strategy contains 22 implementation plans, which outline initiatives intended to improve DOD's asset visibility. GAO reported in January 2015 that 6 of those 22 plans had been implemented but that it was not clear how the plans linked to the goals and objectives in the Strategy . Since it issued the 2014 Strategy , DOD has implemented an additional 10 of its original 22 implementation plans, and has added information to its 2015 Strategy linking each of the ongoing plans to the overarching goals and objectives in the 2015 Strategy . By creating a clear link between the goals and objectives in the Strategy and implementation plans, DOD should be better positioned to monitor progress toward the implementation of its initiatives and achievement of its overarching goals and objectives for asset visibility."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made recommendations to DOD in its prior work to strengthen asset visibility.

DOD\u2019s goal and challenge are to deliver the right  items in the right quantities to the right place at the right time and at the  right cost. Supply chain management encompasses the processes and  systems for accomplishing this goal. Because of long-standing  weaknesses in DOD\u2019s supply chain management, we have designated it  as a high-risk area. In February 2013, we reported that limitations in  asset visibility\u2014including the visibility of assets in transit\u2014make it difficult  to obtain timely and accurate information on the assets that are present in  the theater of operations. DOD defines asset visibility as the ability to  provide timely and accurate information on the location, quantity,  condition, movement, and status of items in its inventory, including assets  in transit. One of the tools that DOD plans to use to improve asset  visibility is a technology called Item Unique Identification (IUID). This  technology allows DOD to assign a unique number to an individual item  and then use that unique number to manage that item in a variety of  logistics processes. In September 2015, the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics issued DOD\u2019s  updated Instruction on IUID to establish policy and assign responsibilities  for the process of uniquely identifying assets to enable asset  accountability and life-cycle management. DOD\u2019s January 2014 Strategy  for Improving DOD Asset Visibility states that \u201cto achieve a seamless and  effective supply chain, DOD needs to have end-to-end visibility of its  assets from acquisition to disposal and all points between. Further,  maintaining visibility of these assets is critical to ensure that DOD meets  its stated goals and provides support to the warfighter.\u201d", "The Fiscal Year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  required DOD to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy and  implementation plans for improving asset tracking and in-transit visibility,  including 11 elements that were specified in the act. For example, the act  called for DOD to include in its strategy and plans elements such as goals  and objectives for implementing the strategy and milestones and  performance measures for gauging results. The NDAA also included a  provision that GAO assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s strategy and  accompanying implementation plans: include the 11 statutory elements;  incorporate, as appropriate, industry best practices related to automated  information and data-capture technologies for asset tracking and in-transit  visibility; effectively execute the department\u2019s efforts to implement Item  Unique Identification (IUID); and contain initiatives that align to DOD\u2019s  overarching asset tracking and in-transit visibility goals and objectives  and that have been implemented. In October 2014, DOD submitted to  Congress its Report to Congress on the Strategy to Improve Asset  Tracking and In-Transit Visibility in satisfaction of its mandate. DOD\u2019s  2014 report incorporated its 2014 Strategy for Improving DOD Asset  Visibility and accompanying implementation plans, which DOD refers to  as Supporting Execution Plans (SEP). We refer to the 2014 strategy  document, implementation plans, and 2014 report collectively as the 2014  Strategy. DOD subsequently updated its asset visibility strategy and  implementation plans in October 2015 (2015 Strategy).", "To assess the extent to which DOD satisfied its mandate, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy against each of the 11 statutory elements.

When the documents did not explicitly reflect any part of an  element, we determined that the element was \u201cnot addressed.\u201d As the  updated strategy was released during our assessment of the 2014  Strategy, we reviewed the 2015 Strategy to determine changes made  between 2014 and 2015. This report discusses the extent to which DOD\u2019s  2014 Strategy and implementation plans address the items specified in  the mandate. We discussed with officials from the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration the elements  that we determined were partially addressed in the 2014 Strategy and  reviewed the 2015 Strategy to understand any ongoing efforts to address  the elements more fully.", "To determine what steps DOD has taken to incorporate industry best  practices related to automated information and data-capture technologies  and to implement Item Unique Identification (IUID), we reviewed DOD\u2019s  2014 Strategy to identify the information DOD included about industry  best practices and IUID. We also reviewed the 2015 Strategy and  discussed with DOD officials how the department collaborates with  industry to identify and incorporate best practices. In September 2015, we  attended the annual Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) in DOD  Symposium, where DOD officials, government leaders, business  executives, and academics within the AIT industry gathered to discuss  how industry technology users implement AIT to achieve higher returns  on investment and how technology is being used to improve asset  visibility.", "Finally, to determine what progress DOD has made in implementing its  2014 Strategy\u2019s implementation plans and in aligning those plans with its  overarching goals and objectives for asset tracking and in-transit visibility,  we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy\u2019s plans and discussed with the  components the initiatives they had implemented or were implementing to  improve asset visibility. We also reviewed updates to those plans that the  components had provided to the Asset Visibility Working Group.  Additionally, to understand what plans were identified subsequent to the  issuance of the 2014 Strategy, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy and  discussed with officials the current status of all of DOD\u2019s implementation  plans.

Further, we found that DOD\u2019s ability to track and  share IUID data across components was hampered because the data  were not fully integrated into the components\u2019 enterprise information  systems. DOD had not developed complete, integrated master schedules  for integrating IUID DOD-wide and within the components\u2019 systems. In  2012, we recommended several actions, including that DOD (1) develop  quantifiable goals and milestones for marking its legacy items that would  allow it to track progress toward those goals and (2) develop or revise  master schedules for integrating IUID technology into the components\u2019  Enterprise Resource Planning Systems.

We found that four of the five elements that were partially  addressed in the 2014 Strategy are fully addressed in the 2015 Strategy.  Specifically, in its 2015 Strategy, DOD fully addresses a description of key factors external to DOD and beyond its control  that could significantly affect achievement of the long-term goals  contained in the strategy; steps to be undertaken to facilitate collaboration with industry  designed to capture best practices, lessons learned, and any relevant  technical matters; a description of how improved asset tracking and in-transit visibility  could enhance audit readiness, reduce counterfeit risk, enhance  logistical processes, and otherwise benefit DOD; and an operational security assessment designed to ensure that DOD  assets are appropriately protected during the execution of the strategy  and implementation plan.", "For example, DOD has added detailed discussion to its 2015 Strategy  regarding the steps it is taking to collaborate with industry to capture best  practices, lessons learned, and any relevant technical matters, including  examples of where that collaboration led it to incorporate commercial  automated information and data-capture technologies. The 2015 Strategy  discusses DOD\u2019s migration of active Radio Frequency Identification  (RFID) from a proprietary communication standard protocol to an  international standard to increase competition and lower costs and its  partnership with a satellite tag provider to improve cargo tracking and the  security of containerized cargo, to enable advanced cargo tracking.  Additionally, DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy explains how IUID information will,  among other things, support \u201clogistics support decisions,\u201d reduce the  introduction of counterfeit parts into the supply chain, and support the  achievement of clean audit opinions on DOD\u2019s financial statements.  Further, the 2015 Strategy contains criteria to assist DOD in determining  the operational risk associated with the loss (damage, pilferage, etc.) of  parts and equipment, to include determining which DOD assets require a  higher level of security and management using IUID marking.", "One statutory element\u2014an estimate of the costs associated with  executing the plan, and the sources and types of resources and  investments, including skills, technology, human capital, information and  other resources, required to meet goals and objectives\u2014remains partially  addressed in DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy. The 2015 Strategy calls for the  components to consider items such as manpower, materiel, and  sustainment costs when documenting cost estimates for the  implementation plans. However, our review of the 2015 Strategy showed  that three of the implementation plans do not include cost estimates. We  recommended in our January 2015 report that DOD include information  about which elements were used in developing cost estimates in  subsequent updates to the strategy and accompanying implementation  plans. Further, we reported in our February 2015 High Risk report that  these cost estimates are important to ensure that DOD has the  information it needs to make well-informed decisions about asset visibility,  including setting budget priorities. Officials from the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration told us that  the components did not include the cost estimates for the three  implementation plans, pointing out that the funding for these plans is  embedded within the overall program funding and it is impossible for the  components to estimate the portion of total program funding associated  with the plans. For example, two of the three plans that did not contain  cost estimates are intended to enhance the capability of the Global  Combat Support System\u2013Joint (GCSS-J) to provide asset visibility and  are funded by overall program funding for the GCSS-J rather than funding  for the individual asset visibility implementation plans. Component  officials argue that it is therefore impossible to isolate the costs  associated with these implementation plans. We understand that the  components may fund these initiatives from total program funding; and  therefore, may not estimate the costs associated with the plan. However,  without any idea of the cost associated with these plans, the components  may be unable to determine the return on investment associated with  them. We continue to believe DOD should follow its direction provided in  the 2015 Strategy and require the components to estimate the costs  associated with its implementation plans intended to improve asset  visibility, as we have previously recommended. In October 2015, officials  stated that DOD plans to provide direction in the next annual update to  the Strategy on how to explain and document these cases, although they  commented that there will be cases where the components may not be  able to isolate the costs associated with an implementation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Provided Limited Information in the 2014 Strategy on Its Collaboration with Industry but Addressed the Issue More Fully in Its 2015 Strategy", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy contained limited  information on DOD\u2019s efforts to collaborate with industry to identify and  incorporate best practices.

Additionally, as discussed in  DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy, DOD worked with commercial partners to  incorporate passive RFID to improve the accuracy of its inventory and  decrease processing time for new recruits at Lackland Air Force Base.  In some cases, the 2015 Strategy discusses results achieved from this  collaboration in terms of the performance metrics for the initiatives. For  example, DOD reported testing the application of passive RFID at  Lackland Air Force Base, which it found improved its inventory accuracy  and reduced the time for processing recruits by over 50 percent. DOD  also reported working with a commercial provider to improve cargo  tracking and the security of containerized cargo.  Specifically, DOD  reports that by using an industry-proven process where the logistics  provider\u2014industry\u2014owns the tracking system; DOD is able to track cargo  in a more affordable way. Key practices for effective collaboration call for  agencies to, among other things, develop mechanisms to monitor,  evaluate, and report on results of their collaborative efforts.

This problem  is not unique to IUID, as evidenced by our March 2014 report on  ammunition where we found the automated information systems used by  the military services to manage and maintain accountability for DOD\u2019s  ammunition inventory have limitations that affect their ability to facilitate  efficient management of conventional ammunition, including that the  systems cannot directly exchange ammunition data with each other.  Specifically, we found that several of the systems involved in DOD\u2019s  overarching Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system were not being  implemented on schedule and on budget.

Specifically, DOD\u2019s goal is for the components to share IUID data across  many of their individual IT systems, and DOD-wide, between  components. In order to accomplish enterprise-wide data sharing of this  data, DOD officials stated that the components intended to use certain IT  systems referred to as ERP systems. Absent successful integration of  ERP, DOD is getting limited use from its IUID information, as only a few  systems are able to recognize and use IUID data.", "On September 3, 2015, DOD issued an update to its Instruction 8320.04,  Item Unique Identification Standards for Tangible Personal Property. We  reviewed the updated DOD Instruction 8320.04, which includes a decision  tree that is intended to assist DOD components in determining which  items should be IUID marked based on criteria such as whether the item  is susceptible to counterfeiting.

For example, by sharing unique item  identification data across the components\u2019 IT systems, DOD could follow  equipment as it moves between components. In addition, a component  could use these data in its IT systems to more quickly identify items that  require higher amounts of maintenance. DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy includes  updated milestones for IUID marking and schedules for updating  automated information systems by component for fiscal years 2015  through 2019 (the 2014 Strategy includes schedules for fiscal years 2013  through 2017). However, it is not always clear what progress DOD has  made against the original milestones set in its 2014 Strategy. Specifically,  while DOD\u2019s milestones for IUID marking in the 2015 Strategy include  goals for percentages of items marked for all of the components, it is not  clear what percentage of items have been marked to-date for each of the  services. For example, while the Navy shows goals for the percentage of  items it would like to have IUID marked by fiscal year 2018 and beyond, it  does not show what percentage of items have been marked against that  goal. Similarly, the milestones for updating automated information  systems do not show progress made to-date. DOD officials agreed that it  is not clear what progress has been made in meeting the milestones for  fiscal years 2013 and 2014 for updating the military services\u2019 automated  information systems and have added legends to the milestone charts and  language in the Strategy to clarify the progress that has been made.  However, in comparing the milestones in the 2014 Strategy and those in  the 2015 Strategy, we are still unable to determine which of DOD\u2019s  milestones for IUID marking and updating automated information systems  have been achieved.", "We have previously concluded that milestones provide decision makers  with the information they need to assess progress and estimate realistic  completion dates. In May 2012, we recommended that DOD establish  quantifiable interim milestones for IUID marking of legacy items, which  would allow DOD to track progress toward its goals for IUID marking.  We also recommended that DOD develop or revise integrated master  schedules for the integration of IUID technology within the components  ERP systems. While DOD\u2019s establishment of milestones for its IUID  implementation efforts is a positive step, the utility of those milestones will  be limited if it is unclear with each update of the Strategy what progress  DOD has made in achieving its previous milestones and how that is  affecting timelines in its 2015 Strategy. We discussed the milestones with  officials to determine whether further updates were planned to make it  more apparent what progress had been made against its 2014 milestones  for IUID marking and automated information system updates, and officials  agreed it was not altogether clear what progress had been made against  the IUID milestones, particularly those associated with updating  automated information systems. In an attempt to add clarity, DOD revised  its IUID milestones for automated information system updates in the 2015  Strategy to reflect progress made by the Army and Marine Corps in  updating their systems to read and share IUID data. The officials stated  they are committed to further revising the milestones to provide insight on  the progress that has been made in meeting interim milestones for  integrating IUID data into DOD\u2019s automated systems. DOD officials  commented in October 2015 that they will continue to capture IUID  progress and plan to update the format for the automated information  systems milestones to ensure that progress that has been made is more  easily understood."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Continues to Implement Many of the Initiatives Identified in Its 2014 Strategy, and Has Identified New Initiatives in Its 2015 Strategy While Linking Them to Its Overarching Goals and Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Since issuing its 2014 Strategy, DOD has implemented 16 of its original  22 implementation plans included in its 2014 Strategy. However, DOD did  not link its implementation plans with the 2014 Strategy\u2019s overarching  goals and objectives. DOD added eight new implementation plans to its  2015 Strategy and linked each of these plans to the 2015 Strategy\u2019s  overarching goals and objectives. Aligning agency-wide goals and  objectives with strategies to achieve those goals and objectives is a key  practice that could increase the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s efforts to improve  asset visibility. Further, leading practices to promote successful data- driven performance reviews include ensuring alignment between agency  goals, program activities, and resources.", "DOD identified, in its 2014 Strategy, 22 implementation plans, which  outline initiatives intended to improve asset visibility. The 2014 Strategy  states that implementation plans detailing new initiatives identified by the  components will be included in future versions of the Strategy. The  Strategy also contains overarching goals and objectives for improving  asset visibility. In January 2015, we found that 6 of the 22 implementation  plans included in DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy had been implemented. For  example, in 2014, U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM)  implemented a plan intended to create an integrated system for asset  visibility information that is included in transportation and supply data  systems and is now being used to enhance asset visibility. According to  DOD, this new integrated system provides users with a single portal for  viewing integrated supply and transportation data, making it possible to  support virtually any business process with improved asset visibility.", "We reported in January 2015 that the 2014 Strategy calls for components  to identify at least one metric for assessing the implementation of each of  its plans that are intended to improve asset visibility. However, the 2014  Strategy did not require that metrics developed for the plans link back to  the goals or objectives in the 2014 Strategy, and we found that it was not  clear whether the metrics link to the goals and objectives. Without  creating a clear link between the goals and objectives in the 2014  Strategy and the plans intended to implement the 2014 Strategy, it will be  difficult for DOD to assess progress toward realizing its goals and  objectives. Therefore, we recommended that DOD ensure that the linkage  between the performance measures for the individual plans and the goals  and objectives outlined in the 2014 Strategy is clear. DOD concurred with  our recommendation.", "Subsequent to issuance of its 2014 Strategy, DOD implemented an  additional 10 of the 22 original plans. For example, the U.S. Marine  Corps\u2019 Blount Island Command has implemented long-range passive  RFID for visibility and accountability of items, resulting in improvements  including an increased range for \u201creading\u201d an item\u2014from up to 30 feet to  up to 240 feet\u2014and reduced inventory cycle times from 12 days to 10  hours. Additionally, the Joint Staff has implemented its plan to develop in- transit visibility capabilities within the Global Combat Support System- Joint (GCSS-J), a web-based logistics program that was developed to  provide logisticians with visibility and decision support tools to effectively  plan and execute joint logistics support for current and future operations.", "According to DOD, GCSS-J has dramatically improved functionality over  the last several program releases to access and visualize logistics  information. Also, after the release of the most recent software version,  users graded GCSS-J as having exceeded their expectations with a 96  percent customer satisfaction rating.", "While the 2014 Strategy introduced 22 implementation plans intended to  improve asset visibility, the 2015 Strategy introduced additional plans.  Specifically, DOD has added eight new implementation plans to its 2015  Strategy. For example, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Global Enterprise Tracking  initiative uses real-time location system technology to track aircraft and  critical assets and is expected to reduce the time required for these  assets to get through depots. Additionally, the Non-Nodal In-Transit  Visibility plan is expected to improve combat effectiveness by providing  near real-time visibility of sustainment cargo and confirmation of delivery  of the cargo to tactical units. An overview of the initiatives included in  DOD\u2019s 2014 and 2015 Strategies and implementation plans is included at  appendix I of this report.", "The 2015 Strategy also includes matrices that link each of DOD\u2019s ongoing  implementation plans to the Strategy\u2019s overarching goals and  objectives. Additionally, measures of performance and effectiveness have  been identified for each plan. For example, the measure of performance  for the Navy\u2019s passive RFID plan for the Littoral Combat Ship is to  conduct a technical assessment and one of its measures of effectiveness  is to reduce inventory workload by 50 percent. By creating a clear link  between the goals and objectives in the Strategy and the implementation  plans intended to implement the Strategy, as well as identifying measures  of performance and effectiveness, DOD should be better positioned to  monitor progress toward the implementation of its plans and achievement  of its overarching goals and objectives for asset visibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.

We refer to the 2014 strategy  document, implementation plans, and 2014 report collectively as the 2014  Strategy. We performed a content analysis in which two analysts  independently reviewed DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy and compared the  information in these documents with the 11 statutory elements and  assessed the extent to which DOD had addressed each required  element. Any initial disagreements in the coding were discussed and  reconciled by the analysts. The analysts then tallied the responses to  determine the extent to which the reporting elements were addressed.  We determined that DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy \u201cfully addressed\u201d an element  when the documents described the entire element and \u201cpartially  addressed\u201d an element when the documents described some, but not all,  parts of that element. When the documents did not explicitly reflect any  part of an element, we determined that the element was \u201cnot addressed.\u201d  We discussed with officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration any elements that we  determined were partially addressed, to understand any efforts under way  to address the elements more fully. We also discussed with officials from  the Joint Staff, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), U.S. Transportation  Command (TRANSCOM), and each of the military services their roles in  the development of DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy. DOD subsequently updated  its asset visibility strategy and implementation plans in October 2015  (2015 Strategy). To understand enhancements made to the 2014  Strategy, including any efforts to more fully address those elements that  were partially addressed, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy and  discussed with officials future plans for addressing those items not fully  addressed in the 2015 Strategy.", "To determine what steps DOD has taken to incorporate industry best  practices related to automated information and data-capture technologies  and to implement Item Unique Identification (IUID), we reviewed DOD\u2019s  2014 Strategy to identify the information DOD included about industry  best practices and IUID. We did not identify industry best practices that  exist relating to automated information and data-capture technologies, but  rather assessed whether or not DOD\u2019s 2014 Strategy discussed the  department\u2019s efforts to collaborate with industry and any examples of  where this collaboration has resulted in industry involvement in the  department\u2019s plans to improve asset visibility. We also discussed with  DOD officials how the department collaborates with industry to identify  best practices and any work DOD has under way to enhance the  discussion in the 2015 Strategy of its efforts to collaborate with industry.  Further, in September 2015, we attended the annual Automatic  Identification Technology (AIT) in DOD Symposium, where DOD officials,  government leaders, business executives, and academics within the AIT  industry gathered to discuss how industry technology users implement  AIT to achieve higher returns on investment and how technology is  working to improve asset visibility. Additionally, we discussed with officials  efforts under way to update the 2014 Strategy and Instruction 8320.04 to  address weaknesses we had previously identified and reviewed the  September 2015 DOD Instruction 8320.04, Item Unique Identification  (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property, to determine what  updates had been made.
