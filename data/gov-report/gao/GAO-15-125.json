Most of these consolidations either combined a number of grant programs used for specific activities (such as Shelter Plus Care), known as categorical grants, into a broader categorical grant, such as the Continuum of Care (CoC) program or established a Performance Partnership, which offers additional flexibility in using funds across multiple programs but maintains accountability for meeting certain performance measures. Block grant approaches to consolidation prior to 1990 combined programs for broad purposes, such as work assistance. The more recent approaches, referred to as hybrid, often combine categorical grant programs and emphasize strong performance standards and accountability. Hybrid approaches can improve the efficiency of grant administration and may reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.", "State and local government actions. State and local officials in the three case study consolidations GAO selected for review relied on existing grant management structures and established relationships to facilitate implementation of the grant program consolidations. In the Transportation Alternatives (TA) program the impact of the consolidation was delayed by states and local officials' reliance on carryover funds from predecessor grant programs while these funds were still available. Officials reported both benefits and challenges ranging from administrative flexibility such as lack of central oversight by states, lack of or inaccurate performance data, and conflicting reporting requirements.", "Lessons to consider. The key to any grant program consolidation initiative is identifying and agreeing on goals\u2014such as improved grant administration and changed programmatic outcomes\u2014and to design and plan for successful implementation, according to findings from the case studies and prior GAO reports. Grant consolidations offer the opportunity to improve grant administration by expanding the opportunities of narrowly targeted grants and by reducing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. Consolidation initiatives that answer key questions can provide a data-driven consolidation rationale and show stakeholders that a range of alternatives has been considered. These evaluations should include responses to key questions such as the following: What are the goals of the consolidation? What opportunities will be addressed through the consolidation and what problems will be solved?", "GAO's prior work found that few executive branch agencies regularly conduct in-depth program evaluations to assess their programs' impact. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as the focal point for overall management in the executive branch, plays a key role in improving the performance of federal grant programs and has developed or contributed many tools to encourage improvements to federal grants and program performance.

Block grants reduced the federal role in several domestic  assistance areas and gave states discretion to determine needs, set priorities, and fund  activities within broadly defined areas.

Two factors that we  have previously concluded as important for effectively reporting on grant  performance are high-quality performance measures and performance  data. Adding to the complexity of grants management, grant programs  are typically subject to a wide range of accountability requirements (under  their authorizing legislation or appropriation) and implementing  regulations so that funding is spent for its intended purpose. Congress  may also impose increased reporting and oversight requirements on  grant-making agencies and recipients. In addition, grant programs are  subject to crosscutting requirements applicable to most assistance  programs.", "Performance accountability challenges persist in the selected case  studies, in part because of statutory, regulatory, or administrative program  requirements were present in the predecessor programs, and that  continued unchanged in the consolidation implementation.

The experiences of state and local officials  responsible for grant accountability and consolidation implementation  suggest opportunities for Congress and the executive branch to improve  the development and the implementation of accountability mechanisms  when designing grant program consolidations. For example, building  accountability into newly proposed grant program consolidations is an  important but difficult task\u2014one requiring trade-offs between federal and  state control over program finances, activities, and administration.  Designing accountability provisions provides an opportunity to consider  the potentially conflicting objectives of increasing state and local flexibility,  attaining certain national objectives, and improving reporting,\u2014which  together, leads to better outcome and impact evaluations. Depending on  their focus, evaluations may examine aspects of program consolidation  (such as performance measurements or program reporting) or factors in  that program\u2019s environment that may impede or contribute to the  consolidation\u2019s success. Alternatively, evaluations may assess a  consolidation\u2019s effects beyond its intended objectives, or may estimate  what would have occurred in the absence of the consolidation, in order to  assess the net impact.

For  example, state or local officials in three states (Colorado, Florida, and  Massachusetts) identified duplicative reporting requirements for homeless  assistance grants. In addition, multiple homelessness grants are available  from multiple federal agencies: each offers similar services to similar  beneficiaries, and each has its own grant life cycle (i.e., separate grant  awards, applications, and reporting requirements).fragmentation of services and overlap is partly a result of a program\u2019s  statute and partly result of programs evolving to offer services that meet  the varying needs of recipients.

This is because federal programs may not  always include service providers with expertise and experience in  addressing the needs of homeless people and because these  programs may lack incentives that encourage mainstream service  providers to serve this population. Also, the fragmented nature of  federal mainstream programs can create barriers to providing a  coordinated set of services that addresses the multiple needs of  homeless people.

Program evaluations typically examine processes,  outcomes, impacts, or the cost effectiveness of federal programs.  Evaluation can play a key role in program planning, management, and  oversight by providing feedback on both program design and execution to  program managers, legislative and executive branch policy officials, and  the public. However, as our prior work found few executive branch  agencies regularly conduct in-depth program evaluations to assess their  programs\u2019 impacts or to learn how to improve results. Program  evaluations that use the key questions identified are also important when  programs are being considered for consolidation.  Such analysis is likely  to result in more effective and improved outcomes of a consolidation.   Annually, through the President\u2019s budget process and congressional  budget justification, agencies have the opportunity to present Congress  with the rationale for a program consolidation proposal, such as a  business case analysis. The congressional budget justification can be  used to support a grant program consolidation proposal. For example, the  fiscal year 2012 DOJ congressional budget justification recognized the  potential for consolidation by stating that \u201cwhenever possible, the  President\u2019s Budget proposes to consolidate existing programs into larger,  more flexible programs that offer state, local, and tribal grantees greater  flexibility in using grant funding and developing innovative approaches to  their criminal justice needs.\u201d", "In carrying out its mission, OMB provides general guidance to federal  agencies, assesses the effectiveness of programs, and ensures that  budget requests are consistent with regulations and presidential  priorities.

Consolidations can reduce, have no impact on, or  even increase fragmentation, overlap, and duplication of related grant  programs that are not included in the consolidation. In seeking to avoid  increasing unnecessary fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, it is  critical that federal policy-makers consider what other programs or  funding streams exist in related areas and what the impact of the  consolidation on these is likely to be. Even if no changes in these other  programs are undertaken, design of the consolidation can affect the  interaction with other programs and funding streams.", "As we have previously reported, consolidation initiatives can be complex,  costly, and difficult to achieve.
