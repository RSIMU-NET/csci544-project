In the  Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, Congress declared that the completion of  a \u201cNational System of Interstate and Defense Highways\u201d was essential to  the national interest. The act called for new system design standards, began  an accelerated construction program, established a new method for  apportioning funds among states, and set the federal government\u2019s cost  share for Interstate construction projects at 90 percent. At the same time,  the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 introduced a dedicated source for federal  highway expenditures, providing that revenue from certain federal motor  fuel and other motor vehicle related taxes be credited to the Highway Trust  Fund. The federal government, from 1954 through 2001, invested over $370  billion on Interstates through apportionments to the states, more than on  any other class of road. Today, FHWA, within DOT, administers a variety of  federal highway programs supported by the trust fund\u2014collectively  referred to as the Federal-Aid Highway Program.", "The Interstate Highway System, as it came to be known, has particular  design characteristics. Its roads are generally divided highways with at  least four lanes of traffic and wide shoulders. The Interstate avoids  intersections by having other roads pass over or under it, and it has access  control\u2014that is, vehicles generally join or leave the flow of traffic by a  limited number of access or exit ramps. (See fig. 2.) Certain characteristics  were meant to facilitate military movement, such as the requirement for 16  feet of clearance under bridges that pass over Interstate highways. A  distinctive red, white, and blue shield denotes Interstate highways.", "The Interstate Highway System, as of 2000, extended over 46,000 miles in  length and 209,655 lane miles. In 1991, Congress provided final funding for  the completion of the Interstate System. From 1990 through 2000,  Interstate mileage grew by about 3.1 percent, or 1,405 miles in length, or  11,491 lane miles during the decade. Growth occurred primarily in urban  areas. Overall, urban mileage climbed by 1,885 miles, or 16.2 percent,  during this period, while rural Interstate mileage declined by 480 miles, or  1.4 percent. (See fig. 3.) Some of the urban mileage gain occurred as new  road mileage expanded the system. The rest occurred as urban boundaries  grew to take in Interstate highway miles that were originally in rural areas.", "According to FHWA, Interstate highways are a principal part of an overall  network of roads throughout the nation. The Interstate System composes  29 percent of the estimated 161,000-mile National Highway System (NHS)  designated by Congress in 1995. The NHS also includes other arterial roads  of national interest. The entire Interstate Highway System is also part of the  Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET), an approximately 61,000-mile  network of roads designated as important to the U.S. military.", "Currently, both the federal government and states fund the construction  and maintenance activities on the Interstate Highway System. Each year,  billions of dollars are provided to the states for the construction and repair  of highways through various highway programs. Under one such  program\u2014the Interstate Maintenance Program (IM)\u2014federal funds  support projects for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, or reconstructing  portions of the Interstate System. Those projects generally require a 10  percent state match, while projects on other classes of roads generally  require a 20 percent match. Under certain circumstances, states may  transfer funds among various highway programs. For example, subject to  certain limitations, states may transfer IM funds to other programs and use  them on other classes of roads (with a 20 percent match). Similarly, states  may also transfer funds from other funding categories to their IM program  and use them for qualifying projects on Interstate highways. The Interstate  Maintenance Discretionary Program provides funding for the kinds of  projects funded under the IM program. In addition, Bridge Discretionary  Program funds can be used on Interstate bridges. FHWA solicits candidates  for the discretionary programs and selects projects for funding from  applications. Finally, the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation  Program provides funds for states to replace or rehabilitate deficient  highway bridges located on any public road, including the Interstate  System.", "In 1991, we reported on Interstate conditions. In that report, we raised  concerns about the poor condition of Interstate highways and about  FHWA\u2019s oversight of them. Among other things, we suggested that the DOT  report to Congress on the levels of investment required for Interstate  maintenance and on the progress being made to achieve adequate  maintenance.

By 1992, states were also reporting pavement data with a more  objective statistic called the International Roughness Index. In 1993, FHWA  adopted the roughness index as a required statistic for reporting pavement  conditions on Interstates. States needed new measuring devices to adopt  the International Roughness Index.

We selected states for our survey development  phase to provide perspectives from a variety of geographic areas and from  states with various types of weather, population patterns, and other factors  that affect Interstate planning. Each of the four pretests consisted of a visit  with state officials by our staff to ensure that (1) questions were readable  and clear, (2) terms used were clear, (3) the survey did not place undue  burden on state governments that would result in a lack of cooperation,  and (4) the survey was independent and unbiased in its point of view.  Appropriate changes were incorporated into the final survey based on our  pretesting. In addition to our pretesting, we discussed our questionnaire  with an official at FHWA headquarters and representatives of the AASHTO  in Washington, D.C. We incorporated comments from these discussions, as  appropriate.", "To determine which officials should receive our survey, we used AASHTO\u2019s  Reference Book to identify the appropriate state officials. We verified our  selection by contacting FHWA division officials in most of the 52 locations.  During the return period, an unprecedented terrorist incident occurred on  September 11, 2001. Although it is possible that the responses completed  after this date may have differed from those received beforehand, our  analysis of the question of the role of the Interstates in moving military  personnel and equipment shows that answers did not differ for these two  time periods. We received the last survey included in our analysis on  November 21, 2001.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed historical Federal-Aid  Highway Program data obtained from FHWA, which discussed why the  Interstate System was developed and the roles Congress, FHWA, DOD, and  states played and how they have evolved into the current roles. We also  interviewed FHWA and DOD staff about their roles and identified current  federal requirements related to the Interstates. Finally, we examined  federal apportionments to the states for Interstates as well as other  activities.", "For our third objective, we analyzed FHWA\u2019s obligation of funds for  Interstate-related projects. We also reviewed outlays from all levels of  government for Interstate-related projects, as reported by states on an  annual basis.", "For the fourth objective, we used the responses to our survey described  previously. To compare conditions of Interstate highways to other classes  of roads as well as obtain trend information on Interstate highway  conditions, we reviewed DOT\u2019s published data on actual highway  conditions and its forecasts of potential future conditions. To learn how  officials assess Interstate highway conditions in their states, we  interviewed officials in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, North Dakota, and  Pennsylvania. We selected these states to obtain perspectives from a  variety of regions with various types of weather, population differences,  and other factors that affect Interstate planning.", "In addition, to determine the current condition of the Interstate System in  terms of congestion, we relied on a number of measures reported by  FHWA. We requested FHWA to obtain Texas Transportation Institute  analysis of congestion levels on Interstate highways in comparison with  other classes of roads. We also reviewed DOT\u2019s Bureau of Transportation  Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau data on factors related to congestion  trends. Furthermore, to assess safety, we reviewed data from the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s Fatality Analysis Reporting  System, and FHWA data on trends in fatality rates and number of fatalities.", "To address the last objective, we analyzed state survey responses and  discussed the factors with state and FHWA officials during our site visits,  as necessary. We focused on factors such as demographic changes or  changes in traffic, but we did not focus on the influence of federal funding  through the existing Federal-Aid Highway Program on state\u2019s decisions  about their investment in Interstate roads and bridges. To examine states\u2019  plans for Interstate investment, we asked states to provide information on  their planned costs for their Interstate highways in our survey. We reviewed  states\u2019 written plans for investment in Interstate highways and other roads.  Again, we also visited the five states mentioned earlier to obtain more  detailed information on their planning. Additionally, we interviewed FHWA  division officials to obtain a general overview of FHWA\u2019s approach to  assisting states with their Interstate System plans.", "We conducted our review from March 2001 through April 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey of States\u2019 Views on the Future of the Interstate System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Planning Processes", "paragraphs": ["States must meet specific planning requirements set forth by federal law. In  addition, state transportation agencies may face state-level requirements.  Within these requirements, states develop plans to allocate available funds  throughout their transportation systems.", "Federal law requires each state to develop at least two planning  documents\u2014a 20-year Statewide Transportation Plan and a short-term  Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) that covers at least  3 years. The STIP should include a list of proposed projects that is  financially constrained\u2014that is, projects that can be built with estimated  revenues. States must submit their proposed STIPs to FHWA and the  Federal Transit Administration for joint approval at least every 2 years;  however, the STIPs may be amended at any time, subject to federal  approval.", "Some states also have policies or laws that direct the use of their funds.  These directives are taken into consideration when planning projects. For  example, Florida officials are concerned about the safety and preservation  of the current system. First, the state addresses safety in all their  transportation projects. Next, it is the state\u2019s policy to preserve the existing  system before spending anything on new construction. In addition, Florida  law requires that at least 50 percent of the amount of new funds available  for capacity construction must go towards the state\u2019s Intrastate system.  Also, in Arizona, according to a statewide agreement, 50 percent of the  funding available to the Arizona Department of Transportation must be  spent on state highway projects within the Phoenix and Tucson  metropolitan areas, and the remaining 50 percent must be spent on state  highway projects outside these two metropolitan areas.", "To develop these planning documents and maintain their Interstate  highways, states use a variety of planning approaches. For example,  Florida has a complex system relying on policies, measurable objectives,  and performance monitoring to make its investment decisions. Florida  officials develop a 20-year long-range policy plan. Based on this 20-year  plan, they develop a 10-year program and resources plan containing  program funding levels given estimated revenues. Finally, the officials  develop and update annually a 5-year list of projects. To help select specific  projects that meet their goals, Florida officials use decision support  software to consider a multitude of data, including pavement condition  surveys, biennial bridge inspections, routine maintenance, safety data, and  analyses of congestion levels. Arizona is revising its long-term planning  process. In the meantime, Arizona is using an interim process to develop its  5-year construction program.", "To identify states\u2019 plans to meet Interstate needs over the next few years,  we asked states to provide information on the level of funding directed  toward the Interstates.

We surveyed  the states about the tools they were using to relieve congestion and the  tools\u2019 usefulness. Although we identified below some of the tools  mentioned on our survey, based on our case study states, we found that  different tools may be more effective in one state than in another. For  example, adding lanes may be a useful tool to deal with congestion for  states with relatively low population density; however, this tool may not be  useful for states with relatively high population densities\u2014particularly in  their urban areas, where the ability of adding lanes is limited since many  urban areas have the maximum number of lanes that will fit into available  space.", "States reported using a variety of tools and varied in their assessment of the  tools\u2019 usefulness.
