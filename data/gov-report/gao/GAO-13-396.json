The Navy has achieved mixed progress to date developing CVN 78's critical technologies, such as a system intended to more effectively launch aircraft from the ship. In an effort to meet required installation dates aboard CVN 78, the Navy has elected to produce some of these systems prior to demonstrating their maturity--a strategy that GAO's previous work has shown introduces risk of late and costly design changes and rework, and leaves little margin to incorporate additional weight growth in the ship. In addition, progress in constructing CVN 78 has been overshadowed by inefficient out-of-sequence work, driven largely by material shortfalls, engineering challenges, and delays developing and installing critical technology systems. These events are occurring in a constrained budget environment, even as lead ship costs have increased by over 22 percent since construction authorization in fiscal year 2008--to $12.8 billion. Additional increases could follow due to uncertainties facing critical technology systems and shipbuilder underperformance.", "The Navy's strategy for providing timely demonstration of CVN 78 capabilities is hampered by post-delivery test plan deficiencies, Joint Strike Fighter aircraft delays, and reliability shortfalls affecting key ship systems. Additional risk is introduced due to the Navy's plan to conduct integration testing of key systems with the ship at the same time as initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E). This strategy will constrain opportunities to implement timely, corrective actions if problems are discovered with key ship systems. In addition, significant discoveries during IOT&E could delay demonstration of ship capabilities. The Joint Strike Fighter, intended to operate with the carrier, has faced delays, and there is the likelihood of costly retrofits to the ship to accommodate the aircraft after CVN 78 is delivered to the Navy. But even after the ship commissions, several key ship systems will continue to face significant reliability shortfalls that will likely increase costs to the government and limit the ship's mission effectiveness. The extent of these limitations will not be known until after IOT&E. GAO contemplated making a recommendation to delay CVN 78 commissioning until the ship successfully completes IOT&E. However, based on additional information provided by DOD, GAO decided not to include this recommendation in the report.", "The Navy and shipbuilder are implementing process improvements aimed at reducing the cost of the follow-on ship, John F. Kennedy (CVN 79), ahead of the main construction contract award for that ship, currently planned for September 2013. CVN 79 is to be of nearly identical design to CVN 78. The shipbuilder plans to employ a new, more efficient build strategy, but remaining technical and design risks with the lead ship could interfere with the Navy's ability to achieve its desired cost savings for CVN 79. These uncertainties also affect the soundness of the Navy's current CVN 79 cost estimate, which is optimistic.

These  improvements include the following:  increased sortie generation rates for the aircraft being deployed from  the carrier, a near threefold increase in electrical generating capability,  increased operational availability, and increased service life margins for weight and stability to support future  configuration changes to the ship over its expected 50-year service  life.", "To facilitate these capability and efficiency gains, the Navy is developing  13 new, critical technologies for installation on Ford-class carriers. For  example, the ship includes a new electromagnetic aircraft launch system  (EMALS) to propel aircraft off the ship, an advanced arresting gear to  recover the aircraft, and an improved anti-aircraft missile system. It also  includes a new dual band radar, which integrates two radars operating on  different frequency bands to provide air traffic control, ship self-defense,  and other capabilities. Other technologies are intended to improve the  ship\u2019s propulsion, supply (replenishment), water generation, and waste  disposal systems.", "Aside from their own intrinsic capabilities, these technologies are also  intended to permit the Navy to implement favorable design features into  the ship. Key design features include an enlarged flight deck; a smaller,  aft-positioned island with fewer rotating radars than Nimitz-class carriers;  and a track-based, flexible infrastructure system that allows ship  compartments to be easily reconfigured to support changing missions  over time.

Initially, the Navy employed an evolutionary  acquisition strategy, with technology improvements planned to be  introduced gradually with each successive carrier. The Navy established  the CVN(X) program in 1998 in support of this concept. Under the  CVN(X) program, introduction of new technologies would be spread over  three ships, beginning with the final Nimitz-class carrier, CVN 77, which  was authorized in fiscal year 2001 to begin construction, and continuing  over two, new design CVN(X) class carriers. In 2002, however, DOD  decided to restructure the CVN(X) program (renamed as CVN 21) and  accelerated plans for introducing new technologies on the first ship of the  new class. To support this acceleration, in 2004 the Navy increased its  planned research, development, test, and evaluation funding for the  program from $2.3 billion to $4.3 billion.Navy named the lead ship of the program (CVN 78) Gerald R.

Fixed-price incentive contracts  place increased risk on the contractor, which generally bears some  responsibility for increased costs of performance, including full  responsibility once the contract\u2019s ceiling is exceeded. These contracts  include a negotiated target cost, target profit, and a formula for sharing  the risk of cost overruns between the buyer and the seller (sometimes  referred to as a shareline). Upon completion of performance, if the costs  incurred by the contractor have exceeded the target cost, then application  of the formula results in the contractor receiving a profit that is less than  the target profit, and may result in a net loss for the contractor.

Cost estimates are necessary for many reasons: to support decisions  about funding one program over another, to develop annual budget  requests, to evaluate resource requirements at key decision points, and  to develop performance measurement baselines. The management of a  cost estimate involves continually updating the cost estimate with actual  data as they become available, revising the estimate to reflect changes,  and analyzing differences between estimated and actual costs. The Navy  completed its initial life cycle cost estimate for CVN 78 in 2004, which  largely underpinned initial budget requests for that ship.

In essence, knowledge supplants risk over time.  In this approach, developers make investment decisions on the basis of  specific, measurable levels of knowledge at critical junctures before  investing more money and advancing to the next phase of acquisition.  Shipbuilding programs are no exception. As we have previously reported,  leading commercial ship buyers and shipbuilders retire program risks,  including technology risk, prior to signing a contract. Demonstrating the  maturity of critical technologies\u2014by testing representative prototypes in  realistic environments\u2014is a key component to reducing these risks.", "DOD uses technology readiness levels (TRL) to describe the maturity of  critical technologies in programs. Technologies with TRLs below 6 are at  a stage of development where only components or a basic proof of  concept of the system have been validated. Technologies developed into  representative prototypes and successfully tested in a relevant  environment meet requirements for TRL 6. Technologies developed into  actual system prototypes (full form, fit, and function) and tested in an  operational environment meet requirements for TRL 7. We have  previously reported that TRL 7 constitutes low risk for starting a product  development and, for shipbuilding programs, should be achieved for  individual technologies prior to detail design contract award.  Consequently, our assessment of CVN 78 technologies refers to  technologies that have reached TRL 6 and TRL 7 as approaching  maturity and as mature, respectively. Technologies exceeding TRL 7  represent actual systems that have been proven to work in final form and  under expected (TRL 8) or actual (TRL 9) mission conditions.

These technologies are  currently at TRL 7 or higher and were mature even before the CVN 78  contract award for detail design and construction. However, other critical  technologies were immature at contract award and still must undergo  extensive testing before reaching maturity. These technologies moved  through development with lower-than-desired levels of knowledge and  subsequently faced technical, design, and production challenges. For  example, three systems integral to the ship\u2019s ability to execute its mission  assignments\u2014the volume search radar, advanced arresting gear, and  EMALS\u2014were immature at CVN 78 detail design and construction  contract award in 2008. These systems continue to experience  disruptions in development and delays in the land-based testing that is  needed to assess their levels of maturity. In contrast to the knowledge- based approach used by leading commercial ship buyers, the Navy, in an  effort to meet required installation dates aboard CVN 78, elected to  produce these systems prior to demonstrating their maturity. More  information about the status of these three critical technologies follows:", "Volume search radar: Prior to the CVN 78 detail design contract  award, the Navy had only built, tested, and integrated prototype  components of the volume search radar in controlled laboratory  environments. As we previously reported, these tests revealed  deficiencies related to key components of the radar. Under the  Navy\u2019s 2008 program schedule, the volume search radar was to be  developed and tested as part of the Zumwalt-class destroyer program  and was expected to approach maturity following land-based testing  in fiscal year 2009. The radar would then participate in combat system  integration testing with the other major component of the dual band  radar, the multifunction radar, and eventually demonstrate maturity as  part of Zumwalt-class destroyer at-sea testing in fiscal year 2014. In  2010, however, to reduce Zumwalt-class construction costs, the Navy  removed the volume search radar from the destroyer program and  suspended remaining land-based testing, leaving key Ford-class  testing requirements unaddressed. The Navy subsequently  transferred remaining development work to the Ford class program  and planned to resume land-based testing in fiscal year 2012 using an  actual production unit of the radar\u2014but contracting delays pushed the  start of this testing out to fiscal year 2013. As a result of this delay,  and the Navy\u2019s desire not to slow down the current radar installation  schedule for CVN 78, remaining land-based testing will be completed  in fiscal year 2014, 4.5 years later than originally planned, using a less  capable developmental radar array than the actual production  configuration that will be installed on CVN 78. The Navy has also  scheduled shipboard testing beginning in fiscal year 2016 to complete  additional volume search radar testing not executed on land. This  testing schedule increases the risk that discovery of problems with the  system will trigger costly design changes and rework aboard the ship.", "Advanced arresting gear: Prior to CVN 78\u2019s detail design contract  award, the advanced arresting gear completed early verification tests  to prove out the system\u2019s concept, along with some component  testing. Under the Navy\u2019s 2008 program schedule, this system was  scheduled to execute the following land-based testing program: (1)  extended reliability testing in fiscal year 2009 to demonstrate  integration of high risk subcomponents and produce reliability growth  data; (2) environmental qualification testing between fiscal years 2009  and 2011, which would verify the system\u2019s suitability; (3) jet car track  site testing\u2014where the system arrests jet-engine-propelled vehicles  that travel down a railway with different physical loads and speeds\u2014 between fiscal years 2010 and 2011 to validate the system\u2019s full range  of performance; and (4) runway arrested landing site testing between  fiscal years 2011 and 2012, which would verify aircraft compatibility  and performance with the system. Progress has proven slower than  anticipated, however. Deficiencies affecting five major components,  plus software, have contributed to several redesigns of the system  since 2007. Most recently, the Navy and its contractor redesigned and  remanufactured the energy absorbing \u201cwater twister\u201d components of  the system, which turned out to be costly, time consuming processes  that have delayed installation of these units aboard the ship.  Consequently, the Navy has delayed the start of runway arrested  landing site testing\u2014required to mature the advanced arresting gear  technology\u2014until fiscal year 2014. Under this revised testing  schedule, the Navy now expects to complete land-based  developmental testing, 2.5 years later than initially planned, by fiscal  year 2015\u2014after it has installed the full system aboard CVN 78.", "EMALS: Unlike the other critical technologies discussed above, this  system was approaching maturity prior to the CVN 78 detail design  contract award because the Navy had built and tested competitive  prototypes of the system as part of the contractor selection process  for EMALS development in 2004. Under the Navy\u2019s 2008 program  schedule, land-based testing for the system was scheduled to occur  between fiscal years 2008 and 2011. However, technical issues  affecting the EMALS power interface and conversion systems, among  other deficiencies, have slowed progress. The Navy\u2019s 2012  development schedule calls for land-based testing to continue into  fiscal year 2014, which, upon completion, the Navy expects will  mature the EMALS technology. In the meantime, however, significant  numbers of EMALS components have already been produced,  delivered to the shipbuilder, and installed on CVN 78\u2014even though  the functional requirements, performance, and suitability of the system  remain unproven.", "Although the Navy has encountered land-based testing delays totaling 2.5  to 4.5 years each for the volume search radar, advanced arresting gear,  and EMALS critical technologies, it has elected to not adjust the CVN 78  construction schedule to compensate for these delays. As a result, the  Navy and its shipbuilder are constructing CVN 78 with less knowledge  about the ship\u2019s critical technologies than it deemed appropriate at  contract award in 2008. As the disparity between land-based testing and  construction schedules persists\u2014or worsens\u2014the Navy faces significant  risk of unbudgeted cost growth arising from technical discoveries late in  construction. Figure 3 illustrates changes to the CVN 78 construction  schedule and to land-based testing programs for critical technologies that  have been incurred since the 2008 detail design and construction contract  award.", "Since the CVN 78 contract was awarded in 2008, the Navy and  shipbuilder have made progress stabilizing and completing the Ford-class  design. The Ford class represents the first time that the shipbuilder has  used a 3D, computer-aided design product model to generate the design  of an entire aircraft carrier. The product model generates a detailed  design, allowing engineers to visualize the arrangement of spaces and  systems. The design is also fed into a simulated 3D environment that  allows engineers, planners, and construction workers to validate the  design and build strategy by conducting virtual \u201cwalkthroughs.\u201d These  tests validate elements of the design prior to construction, thereby  avoiding potentially costly rework.", "In our work on shipbuilding best practices, we found that achieving design  stability before start of fabrication is a key step that leading shipbuilders  and ship buyers follow to ensure their vessels deliver on-time, within  planned costs, and with planned capabilities. Leading commercial firms  assess a ship design as stable once all basic and functional design  activities have been completed. Basic and functional design refers to two- dimensional drawings and 3D computer-aided models (when employed)  that fix the ship\u2019s hull structure; set the ship\u2019s hydrodynamics; route all  major distributive systems including electricity, water, and other utilities;  and identify the exact positioning of piping and other outfitting within each  block of the ship. At the point of design stability, the shipbuilder has a  clear understanding of the ship structure as well as electrical, piping, and  other systems that traverse individual blocks of the ship. To achieve  design stability, shipbuilders need suppliers (also called vendors) to  provide complete, accurate system information prior to beginning basic  design. This vendor-furnished information describes the exact dimensions  of a system or piece of equipment going into a ship, including space and  weight requirements, and also requirements for power, water, and other  utilities that will have to feed the system.", "In designing and constructing a new ship, the Navy seeks to preserve \u201cservice life  allowances\u201d\u2014room for weight growth after the vessel enters service\u2014in order to provide  room to take on new, heavier equipment over the ship\u2019s life cycle.

To date, several of these design  changes have related to EMALS configuration changes, which have  required electrical, wiring, and other changes within the ship. Although the  Navy reports that these EMALS-related changes are nearing completion,  it anticipates additional design changes stemming from remaining  advanced arresting gear development and testing. In total, over 1,200  anticipated design changes remain to be completed (out of nearly 19,000  planned changes).

Typically, an  optimal construction sequence includes designing and building the ship  from the bottom up, maximizing the work completed in shipyard shops,  and minimizing tasks performed when the ship is already in the water,  which tend to be costlier than tasks completed on land. As a general  shipbuilding rule, the earlier a particular task can be performed in the  production plan, the fewer labor hours it will consume. The sequence is  outlined in the shipbuilder\u2019s integrated master schedule, which links all of  the detailed construction tasks based on key event dates.", "By comparison, progress constructing CVN 78 has been constrained by  inefficient out-of-sequence work driven largely by material shortfalls,  engineering challenges, and delays developing and installing certain  critical technology systems (provided by the Navy to the shipbuilder for  installation). These outcomes are consistent with those experienced by  other Navy shipbuilding programs that began lead ship constructions prior  to maturing critical technologies, stabilizing their designs, or both. Key  examples of construction issues with the CVN 78 include the following:", "Material shortfalls: CVN 78 has experienced significant shortages of  developmental valves throughout the ship due to delayed vendor  deliveries. These valves are crucial for installing the ship\u2019s chilled  water system, which provides air conditioning and cooling for  electronic systems, as well as other distributive piping systems. To  mitigate the impact of valve delinquencies, the shipbuilder installed  temporary metal spool pieces in place of missing valves in order to  continue construction work for piping systems. Installing the valves  later, out-of-sequence, required additional labor hours to complete.  According to shipbuilding representatives, their vendor base for valves  did not have sufficient experience developing and manufacturing new  Navy ship system valves, and consequently encountered difficulties  meeting Navy and shipbuilder specifications. To improve vendor  performance, the shipbuilder provided on-site engineering and  procurement assistance. The shipbuilder reports that suppliers have  now delivered over 90 percent of the required valves and that most of  the spool piece installations have been replaced with actual valves.", "Engineering challenges: The shipbuilder\u2019s use of HSLA 65 thin steel  plating for ship decks\u2014intended to reduce weight in the ship\u2019s  design\u2014excessively warped and flexed during construction, which  contributed to lower than desired levels of pre-outfitting and additional  disruption to build processes. In an effort to compensate for the  warping and flexing, the shipbuilder erected scaffolding around ship  blocks to secure the assemblies. This scaffolding facilitated some pre- outfitting improvements, but produced corresponding cost increases  and schedule delays. In addition, ship welders experienced  substantial difficulty early on working this new plate steel because it  was thinner than what had traditionally been used on aircraft carriers.", "The Navy and shipbuilder have also experienced other engineering  challenges, including late delivery of accurate construction drawings and  instructions to shipworkers. In many instances, the shipbuilder produced  construction drawings\u2014derived from the ship\u2019s 3D product model\u2014that  lacked sufficient detail necessary for efficiently installing critical  components within the ship.

Instead of  being built in one piece in the yard and hoisted into place as originally  envisioned, arresting gear components will be installed in sequence,  including through a hole cut in the flight deck. This strategy has  caused additional work and interfered with the construction of other  ship features in some areas, such as duct work and cabling. Further,  late dual band radar equipment deliveries have required the  shipbuilder to cut open previously closed areas of the ship to allow  loading of equipment. Additional delays, as well as rework or retrofits  on installed components, remain possible as these developmental  systems continue to progress through testing.", "The construction inefficiencies suffered by CVN 78 have only recently  begun to materialize in the form of schedule delays.

Executing  these plans requires completion of certain shipbuilding activities prior to  the scheduled launch date. For example, the establishment of the chilled  water system\u2014necessary to support the ship\u2019s energization of the  electrical distribution system for launch\u2014is several weeks behind  schedule. As launch gets delayed, so, too, does the shipbuilder\u2019s post- launch test program for key systems.

Most notably, in 2010, the Navy negotiated firm fixed-price  contracts for production of these systems for CVN 78. According to the  Navy, these contracts have helped cap cost growth for these systems and  have incentivized more timely deliveries to the shipyard. While EMALS is  farther along in development than both the dual band radar and advanced  arresting gear systems, all have experienced significant cost growth, and  costs are likely to increase, given the remaining work needed to fully  develop, test, and integrate the systems on CVN 78. This potential for  additional cost growth is also apparent based on the Navy\u2019s experience  with the most recent Nimitz-class carrier, CVN 77. That ship experienced  cost growth during its system integration, even though that effort  employed mostly nondevelopmental systems.", "Aside from the risk of cost growth stemming from the integration of critical  technology systems into the ship, the shipbuilder\u2019s cost and schedule  performance under the detail design and construction contract suggests  additional overruns are looming. Our review of the contractor\u2019s earned  value management data for the program indicates that shipbuilder cost  pressures remain high and additional costs are likely, especially as key  developmental items are integrated onto the ship. We reviewed 18  months of earned value management data for the CVN 78 ship program  during the period of July 2011 through December 2012. During this time,  the shipbuilder increased its estimate of the number of labor hours  required to construct CVN 78 from 44.4 million to 47.3 million.  Consequently, the shipbuilder\u2019s budgeted cost grew substantially, from  $4,758 million to $5,266 million (an increase of $508 million).analysis shows that, as of December 2012, the contractor was forecasting  an overrun at contract completion of over $913 million. This cost growth is  attributable to the shipbuilder not accomplishing work as planned.

Previously, the CVN 78 program office planned to  rely on developmental testing of individual systems as a means to  establish confidence in the interoperability of capabilities ahead of  IOT&E\u2014a strategy assessed as high risk by DOD and Navy operational  testers. Earlier testing of developmental systems with one another\u2014 above and beyond testing individual systems separately\u2014is beneficial  and can provide earlier demonstration of interoperability and combined  capabilities, including measured performance against ship requirements  ahead of IOT&E. Under the integrated testing approach, for example, the  dual band radar will be required to conduct near-simultaneous air traffic  control and self-defense operations, using both the multifunction radar  and the volume search radar.

However, in 2012,  the Navy modified its live-fire testing plans for the Ford class, citing  resource constraints facing the lead ship, and deferred this testing to the  first follow-on ship, CVN 79. The Director, Operational Test and  Evaluation disagreed with this proposed strategy, expressing concern that  delaying the testing to CVN 79 would cause a 5- to 7-year delay in  obtaining data critical to evaluating Ford class survivability and would  preclude timely modification of subsequent ships.

Reliability also drives life cycle costs related to manning, repairs, and  sparing. When systems demonstrate low reliability, they can risk costing  more than planned and not delivering the intended capability to the  warfighter.

Together, these requirements are intended to position the Navy  to field more capability in the fleet at a lower operating cost. At present,  however, the Navy projects that the dual band radar, advanced arresting  gear, EMALS, and advanced weapons elevators will all fall well short of  their required reliability rates ahead of CVN 78 IOT&E. High reliability is a  key attribute that underpins the contributions that these systems are  intended to make toward Ford-class sortie generation rates and manning  levels.", "For the advanced arresting gear and EMALS, the Navy has outlined  reliability growth curves, which illustrate the anticipated positive  improvement in system reliability in future years due to implementation of  corrective actions to system design, operation or maintenance  procedures, or manufacturing processes. However, developmental testing  to date has demonstrated that reliability for both of these systems was  much lower than the Navy initially estimated. This shortfall has  undermined the effectiveness of the Navy\u2019s initial reliability improvement  plans. In response to these realities, the Navy crafted new curves for  each system, which assumed lower reliability at the start. However, these  more realistic starting points were offset by more optimistic assumptions  about the pace of reliability gains in coming years. Therefore, the revised  reliability growth curves project (1) sharp increases in system reliability in  coming years and (2) achievement of required reliability levels within  roughly the same amount of time as under initial plans\u2014scenarios that  may not be underpinned by sound methodologies. According to Navy  officials, reliability growth projections for the advanced arresting gear and  EMALS technologies are generated using a DOD growth planning  methodology\u2014called the Duane methodology\u2014coupled with historical  aircraft data from relevant points in development. However, DOD\u2019s  handbook on reliability growth management notes certain drawbacks to  the Duane methodology, including with how growth curves are calculated  within that model. Specifically, Duane\u2019s assumptions about the rate of  reliability growth, which date back to 1981, have since been shown to be  unrealistic. Further, Duane\u2019s methodology for estimating regression  makes no allowance for variation. Subsequently, the handbook outlines  several alternative models to Duane to use when projecting reliability  growth for a system.", "The validity of the Navy\u2019s updated growth curves is further undermined by  recent reliability data on the advanced arresting gear and EMALS, which  show continued underperformance against growth estimates. Although  these technologies are assessed as approaching maturity (TRL 6), as  discussed above, TRL criteria do not account for reliability performance.  The Navy measures advanced arresting gear and EMALS reliability in  terms of the average number of arrestments and launches, respectively,  that the systems can complete prior to failing. The total number of  arrestments and launches that these two systems complete over time are  referred to as cycles. Figures 7 and 8 highlight the Navy\u2019s reliability  growth projections, and current reliability performance, for the advanced  arresting gear and EMALS technologies. As the figures show, neither of  these systems is scheduled to reach its required rate of reliability until  many years after CVN 78 is scheduled to complete IOT&E.", "While the Navy also anticipates reliability growth testing for the dual band  radar and advanced weapons elevators, program officials have not yet  completed plans for demonstrating this growth. Further, Navy officials  stated that reliability requirements for these two systems continue to  evolve, noting, in particular, that reliability metrics for the dual band radar  were recently invalidated based on evolving analysis from their subject  matter experts. As a result, the planned reliability of each system at key  points, including CVN 78 IOT&E, is unknown. For the dual band radar,  however, Navy program officials state that they are collecting reliability  data during first unit production and factory testing\u2014a phase that typically  produces high failure rates over limited run times. Additional data  collection opportunities for dual band radar include land-based testing,  shipyard testing, and post-delivery testing and trials for CVN 78.  According to Navy officials, data collected during shipboard testing will  support a reliability assessment of the dual band radar.", "In addition, the ship itself has operational availability requirements that  are linked to the reliability performance of its individual systems, such as  EMALS and the advanced arresting gear. The projected reliability  shortfalls for these key systems\u2014even under the Navy\u2019s optimistic  assumptions\u2014could delay CVN 78\u2019s planned entry into IOT&E in 2017.  The Navy\u2019s draft test and evaluation master plan for the program  identifies various entrance criteria that it must meet before initiating  IOT&E. In particular, these criteria include a requirement that testing and  analysis demonstrate that the ship\u2019s reliability will meet or exceed  program requirements. The criteria further stipulate that adequate  reliability data be available (or planned) to enable evaluation of current  versus predicted reliability growth progress. During land-based and  shipboard developmental testing, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Developmental Test and Evaluation will conduct  assessments that consider testing progress to date as well as the risks  associated with the ship\u2019s capability to meet operational suitability and  effectiveness goals (including reliability). These assessments will be  based, in part, on the IOT&E entrance criteria outlined in the program\u2019s  test and evaluation master plan. Ultimately, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics will make the  determination as to CVN 78\u2019s readiness for IOT&E.", "Because of the development and testing delays and reliability deficiencies  affecting key systems, CVN 78 will likely face operational limitations that  extend past commissioning and into initial deployments. Thus, the ship  will likely deploy without meeting its key sortie generation rate and  reduced manning requirements. In the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2010, Congress gave the Navy a temporary waiver that  lowered the statutory requirement for the minimum number of operational  aircraft carriers from 11 to 10 during the period between the then-planned  inactivation of the USS Enterprise (CVN 65) and commissioning into  active service of CVN 78, currently planned for March 2016. The  temporary waiver granted to the Navy on its number of operational aircraft  carriers ends on the date that CVN 78 is commissioned into the fleet.  However, because of the magnitude of its operational deficiencies, it is  unlikely that CVN 78 will adequately fill the capability gap created by the  inactivation of CVN 65 for some time. For example, between February  and June 2011, CVN 65 aircraft completed flight operations in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom that totaled 2,970 combat missions and a  99.1 percent sortie completion rate. Further, of the 112 days that the  ship was on station for these operations, only 18 days were consumed  performing maintenance.", "Until the ship completes IOT&E, the full scope of CVN 78\u2019s operational  limitations remains unclear.

However, as  part of its fiscal year 2013 budget, the Navy revisited this strategy and  requested congressional authority to extend Ford-class construction  funding, including for CVN 79, across 6 years for each ship. Congress  approved this strategy change as part of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. As table 4 illustrates, this  strategy allows the Navy to request less funding in the near term for CVN  79 construction, but also reflects a $1.1 billion increase in cost as  compared to the fiscal year 2012 budget estimate for the ship. According  to CVN 78 program officials, roughly half of this increase is a direct result  of the increased build duration, whereas the remaining half is attributable  to (1) design, construction, and critical technology system pricing changes  and (2) shipyard and supplier base effects, including growth in overhead  and inflation estimates.", "The Navy\u2019s decision to fund CVN 79 construction over 6 years was  coupled with a decision to increase the build time for the ship as  compared to CVN 78. According to the Navy, it will use the additional  time to improve CVN 79\u2019s construction sequence and implement cost  reduction initiatives. Further, Ford class shipbuilders report that the  increased time afforded to CVN 79 construction provides additional  opportunities to apply lessons learned from lead ship construction. The  Navy expects the combined savings from these actions to more than  offset the increased costs associated with extending the funding of the  ship by 2 years.

Generally, the earlier  work can be sequenced in the build process, the more efficiently it can be  completed. As we have previously reported, shipbuilders often describe a  general \u201c1-3-8\u201d rule where work that takes 1 hour to complete in a  workshop takes 3 hours to complete once the steel panels have been  welded into blocks, and 8 hours to complete after a block has been  erected and/or after the ship has been launched.", "Although the Navy and shipbuilder expect CVN 79\u2019s design to be virtually  the same as that of the lead ship\u2014another step toward improving follow- on ship outcomes\u2014remaining developmental and design risks in the  program could undermine the actual realization of cost savings.

One key component of the CVN 79 cost estimate is a Navy assumption  that 15 percent fewer labor hours will be required to construct the follow- on ship as compared to the lead ship. This estimate is also underpinned  by expectations that the shipbuilder\u2019s current level of performance will  persist between now and lead ship delivery. Further, the Navy\u2019s budget  for CVN 79 is predicated on even higher performance gains than those  forecast in the cost estimate\u2014notably, 20 percent fewer labor hours in  construction as compared to CVN 78. Yet, as we previously detailed, the  Navy\u2019s understanding of the costs required to construct and deliver CVN  78 remains incomplete.

A fixed-price incentive contract provides for adjusting  profit and establishment of a final contract price by application of a  formula (sometimes referred to as a shareline) based on the relationship  of total final negotiated cost to total target cost. A fixed-price incentive  contract includes a ceiling (maximum) price that constrains the  government\u2019s exposure to potential cost growth. For CVN 79, the Navy\u2019s  request for proposal stipulated a 120 percent (of target cost) ceiling price  and a 50/50 cost shareline between the government and the contractor  (shipbuilder) for cost increases above target cost, although final contract  terms are subject to change pending completion of negotiations between  the government and shipbuilder.", "Because the Ford-class shipbuilder represents the only domestic entity  capable of constructing, testing, and delivering nuclear-powered aircraft  carriers, the government\u2019s contract negotiating position is compromised.  Contracting in this sole source environment, the government lacks the  leverage it would have in a competitive environment to negotiate lower  costs or capability enhancements. Similarly, the shipbuilder\u2019s proposed  price will not be influenced by competition and, as such, is likely to  account for the remaining technical and design risks facing the Ford class  program. For example, in a previous solicitation for Littoral Combat Ship  constructions, potential shipbuilders submitted proposals which were  priced significantly higher than the Navy\u2019s expectations. Even in light of  the competition in this case, contractor officials stated that the fixed-price  terms the Navy sought prompted a forthright assessment of remaining  program risks\u2014including technical, design, and funding uncertainties\u2014 and subsequent pricing of that risk in their proposals. Alternatively, Navy  officials report that the CVN 79 shipbuilder could propose to remove high- risk items from the contract\u2019s shareline or move to renegotiate the  planned cost-sharing terms altogether. For example, in Zumwalt-class  destroyer contract negotiations, the Navy and its shipbuilder reached  agreement to remove work from the scope of the lead ship\u2019s construction  contract and to include a special incentive fee associated with  construction and delivery of the ship\u2019s innovative, composite-material  deckhouse, which had never before been manufactured."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Navy awarded a multibillion dollar contract for detail design and  construction of CVN 78 in 2008, even in light of substantial technology  development risks and an overly optimistic budget.

Although the ship is now more than half  constructed, and promises significant capability increases over existing  carriers, it is still grappling with land-based testing delays and system  reliability deficiencies for critical government-provided technologies, a  high-risk operational testing strategy, potentially unachievable  performance requirements, and cost estimating uncertainties. Further  complicating matters, the Navy is attempting to manage these challenges  within an operational environment that is pressuring it to deliver CVN 78  to the fleet with haste.", "Congress granted the Navy a temporary waiver from the requirement to  have 11 operational aircraft carriers in the fleet. Under the terms of the  waiver, the waiver period ends at the planned CVN 78 commissioning in  March 2016. As it stands, the Navy will not be positioned to deliver a fully  capable ship at that time. For example, recent Navy decisions to  introduce shipboard integration testing after lead ship delivery will provide  valuable insights and facilitate identification of any deficiencies of  integrated ship systems. However, because of the overlapping timing of  this testing with IOT&E\u2014as well as with deferred developmental tests for  ship systems\u2014the Navy will not have time to incorporate potentially  significant results of the testing before CVN 78 likely deploys. Further,  reliability shortfalls facing key Ford-class systems cloud the Navy\u2019s ability  to forecast when, or if, current sortie generation rate and manning  requirements for the ship will be met\u2014analysis that could inform  decisions on cost and requirements trade-offs in the program, both within  DOD and by Congress.", "As the Navy looks ahead to its planned detail design and construction  contract award for CVN 79, it will be important to avoid repeating the  mistakes of the past. Staying within budget will require the Navy to retire  significant technical risks mainly by completing land-based testing for  critical technologies before negotiating a contract with the shipbuilder.  The results of this important testing will allow the government and  shipbuilder to gain clearer insights on the capabilities of each system and,  subsequently, better position the government to avoid paying a costly risk  premium within the planned, fixed-price incentive contract. Further, the  Navy\u2019s current CVN 79 cost and budget estimates are overly optimistic in  that they do not take into account remaining developmental and design  risks with the lead ship. A more realistic assessment of CVN 79 costs  would put the government in a better negotiating position, even within the  existing sole source environment.

While DOD  agreed that seeking requirements relief from the Joint Requirements  Oversight Council is a potential long term solution if certain systems do  not meet stated capabilities, it disagreed that a cost-benefit analysis is  needed within 30 days of CVN 78 commissioning. In its comments, DOD  stated that it does not anticipate major requirements changes for the ship  and offered that the most cost-effective path forward in the program is to  complete construction of the existing design. However, DOD noted that  after measuring CVN 78 warfighting capabilities through planned  developmental and operational testing and following lead ship delivery, it  intends to identify mitigations for any systems that do not meet stated  capabilities, which could include seeking requirements relief from the  Joint Staff. Under DOD\u2019s proposed approach, the process of  measurement and mitigation would conceivably extend into 2020, when  CVN 78 is scheduled to complete IOT&E. This strategy is unnecessarily  concurrent\u2014particularly since the Navy has already identified several  significant, long-term limitations that will face the ship. We believe the  knowledge gained from developmental testing\u2014coupled with additional  study and evaluation leading up to CVN 78 delivery in 2016\u2014would  provide a strong foundation for conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the  ship\u2019s current required capabilities. Waiting until IOT&E is completed may  be too late to make effective tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and  performance. Further, such analysis could provide a sound basis for  investment decisions related to CVN 80, prior to that ship\u2019s planned detail  design and construction contract award in late 2017.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to update the Ford class  program\u2019s test and evaluation master plan prior to delivery of CVN 78.  DOD cited its current efforts to update the program\u2019s test and evaluation  master plan as being responsive to our recommendation. According to  DOD, the revised plan is expected to include three phases of land-based  developmental testing followed by two phases of integration testing for  shipboard systems. The first integration testing phase is scheduled to  commence three months prior to CVN 78 delivery, to be followed by the  second integration testing phase beginning in 2017. Although DOD  expressed confidence that its planned testing strategy would provide  ample time for developmental and integration testing prior to operational  testing, it did not directly address our recommendation related to ensuring  that sufficient time is allotted to complete certain land-based testing  activities that have been deferred to sea prior to beginning integration  testing. Further, the extent to which additional testing will be deferred to  sea remains unknown, as it hinges on land-based developmental testing  outcomes leading up to CVN 78 delivery in 2016. Consequently, DOD\u2019s  current update of the test and evaluation master plan will be structured  around assumptions about future land-based testing outcomes that may  or may not come to fruition.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to adjust the planned  post-delivery test schedule for CVN 78 to ensure that system integration  testing is completed prior to entering IOT&E. In its comments, DOD  presented a plan under which warfare and non-warfare systems will  separately complete integration testing prior to entering into their  respective operational testing phases. However, this plan shows that  when non-warfare system operational testing is scheduled to begin,  integration testing of the warfare systems will be just past halfway  complete. As we point out in our report, concurrency in integration and  operational test schedules will constrain opportunities for the Navy to  implement any needed corrective actions stemming from problems  identified in the integration testing. Further, given the strong linkage  between non-warfare and warfare systems, this overlap poses risk to the  test program. For instance, ship warfare systems such as the dual band  radar, EMALS, and advanced arresting gear require cooling and power  from non-warfare systems aboard the ship. Subsequently, until these  warfare systems are fully integrated and developmentally tested with the  non-warfare systems upon which they rely, the Navy cannot be confident  that the ship is ready to enter IOT&E.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendation to defer the CVN 79 detail  design and construction contract award until land-based testing for  critical, developmental ship systems is completed. In its comments, DOD  responded as if we had recommended a total work stoppage for CVN  79\u2014a drastic measure inconsistent with our recommendation. As we  noted in this report, the Navy has contracted for construction preparation  activities for this ship since 2009. That ongoing contract provides a  vehicle for continuing limited CVN 79 construction work into the future\u2014 while allowing time for land-based testing activities to regain traction and  retire risks\u2014and precludes any need for a detail design and construction  contract in the near term. In its response, DOD noted that an extension of  the CVN 79 construction preparation contract would require use of fiscal  year 2014 funds for additional bid and proposal efforts. In response to our  further inquiry on this matter, the Navy stated the costs would be on the  order of $5-10 million and acknowledged there are no known legal or  regulatory impediments to a limited extension of the construction  preparation contract.  According to the Navy, under an extension of the  construction preparation contract, building and outfitting of structural units  and the procurement of materials could continue. Retiring remaining risks  in land-based testing will improve the Navy and shipbuilder\u2019s ability to  assess the likely CVN 79 costs before the planned detail design and  construction contract is awarded. We continue to believe that, in light of  the existing sole source environment for aircraft carrier construction, a  delay in awarding the CVN 79 detail design and construction contract\u2014by  extending the construction preparation contract\u2014would improve the  government\u2019s negotiating position for the ship.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to update the Navy\u2019s  CVN 79 cost estimate on the basis of actual costs and labor hours  associated with CVN 78 construction. We recommended that this update  take place following deferral of the CVN 79 detail design and construction  contract award\u2014an action DOD did not agree to take, as discussed  above. Nonetheless, DOD stated that it plans to have an updated  independent cost estimate prepared by the Office of Cost Assessment  and Program Evaluation ahead of the CVN 79 detail design and  construction contract award. According to DOD, this cost estimate will  take into account actual costs and labor hours associated with CVN 78  construction.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation on delaying the  commissioning of CVN 78 that was included in the draft report that we  sent to DOD for comment. We made the decision to remove this  recommendation based on information DOD provided about unintended  consequences associated with delaying the commissioning of the ship,  including potential issues related to how a noncommissioned ship would  operate effectively within the Navy\u2019s chain of command. The intent of the  draft recommendation was to highlight the operational limitations that will  be associated with the ship when it is commissioned, but DOD noted in its  response that the ship will not be designated operationally ready until  testing and trials are completed\u2014an estimated 34 months after delivery.  Until the ship is judged operationally ready, it will lack the ability to  conduct assigned operations for which it is designed.", "Further, DOD disagreed with our finding that, when it is commissioned,  CVN 78 will have significant operational limitations due to the expected  reliability rates of key technologies, including EMALS, advanced arresting  gear, dual band radar, and advanced weapons elevator systems. DOD  stated that these systems are designed and engineered to be highly  reliable. However, DOD did not address the significant evidence we  present in this report demonstrating that these systems are projected to  experience reliability deficiencies well into future years. For instance, the  Navy now estimates that the advanced arresting gear and EMALS will not  demonstrate their minimum required reliabilities until 2027 and 2032,  respectively. High reliability from these and other ship systems is key to  enabling the Ford class to achieve its planned capabilities. DOD also  outlined the Navy\u2019s disagreement with our findings related to the effect  that land-based testing delays have had on the development of certain  critical technologies within the Ford-class program. The response asserts  that our report overstates the cost, schedule, and technical risks  associated with these delays. According to the response, the system  designs for EMALS, advanced arresting gear, and dual band radar have  progressed to the point where the Navy expects that any future changes  will be internal to each system and independent of the ship interface. As a  result, the Navy concludes that the ship\u2019s design is stable. We disagree.  As we have documented in this report, the Navy\u2019s knowledge deficit about  these systems is evidenced by the significant land-based testing delays  that EMALS, advanced arresting gear, and volume search radar (a dual  band radar component) have encountered. Tests to date have uncovered  a multitude of deficiencies that the Navy did not anticipate when it  developed its CVN 78 and CVN 79 construction schedules. These  outcomes have prompted Navy decisions to produce the systems prior to  achievement of stable designs\u2014a strategy that risks costly retrofits and  rework aboard CVN 78 before and after ship delivery. In light of the  considerable testing scope that remains for each of these developmental  technologies, we do not share the Navy\u2019s confidence that all future design  changes to these systems will be independent of the overall ship design.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Navy.
