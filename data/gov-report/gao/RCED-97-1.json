That satellite system and one to provide safety and rescue at sea were developed and implemented by governments that joined together to form INTELSAT and the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat). The success of these systems helped foster rapid technological advances that enhanced private companies\u2019 ability to successfully construct, launch, and operate commercial communications satellite systems of their own."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basic Concepts of Satellite Communications Systems", "paragraphs": ["The world-famous physicist and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke is credited with conceptualizing, in 1945, plans that showed how three objects orbiting the earth at different locations 22,300 miles above the equator could distribute radio signals that could reach anywhere on earth. A dozen years later, in the Cold War environment of the 1950s, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, to the amazement and concern of much of the rest of the world. Although the United States soon successfully launched its own first satellite\u2014Explorer I, on January 31, 1958\u2014it was not until the 1960s that establishing worldwide satellite communications became a major U.S. goal.", "The process for communicating through a satellite is based on the transmission of radio signals on specified frequencies from a station on earth to a satellite orbiting the earth. These specified frequencies, or segments of the radio spectrum, are designated for different uses of the airwaves. The satellite receives the signal, amplifies it, and returns it to one or more receiving stations on earth. The sending and receiving earth stations may be fixed or mobile.", "Satellites rotate around the earth at different heights and in different orbiting patterns. The most widely used practice today for commercial satellite communications is a geostationary orbit. (See fig. 1.1.) At a height of 22,300 miles and at a location above the earth\u2019s equator, a geostationary satellite orbits the earth at a rate that makes it appear stationary over the same location on the earth\u2019s surface; this positioning allows a ground station antenna to remain pointed at one location in the sky, and the satellite can be tuned into the same earth stations all the time. Current technology enables about 120 to 180 geostationary satellites to orbit the earth using the same radio frequency without being too close to one another to cause technical interference.", "Satellites enjoy some important advantages in comparison to other means of communicating. Because satellites do not rely on the use of land-based wire, cable, or microwave facilities, earth stations can be placed almost anywhere. Furthermore, the cost of satellite communications is the same regardless of distance\u2014whether the transmission covers 200 or 10,000 miles. Another important characteristic of satellite communications is that one satellite can send signals to many different locations on earth at the same time; one geostationary satellite, for example, can send signals to as much as a third of the earth\u2019s surface all at once. This is particularly useful in television/video service.", "However, satellites also have some disadvantages. For example, voice transmissions from a geostationary satellite are delayed about a half-second because of the distance the radio signals must travel. These delays may also produce an echo. Furthermore, the orbital slots and the radio frequencies available for different kinds of satellite services are limited. International coordination of the use of these resources is required to prevent technical interference among different satellites operating in the same frequency band. Finally, some risk is involved in achieving a successful launch and orbit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Telecommunications Services", "paragraphs": ["Satellites can provide any kind of telecommunications service\u2014from basic telephone service and mobile telephone service; to AM and FM radio and television broadcasts; to computer networking. They have played a significant role in video conferencing and private communications networks for multinational companies. As shown by the broadcast of the moon landing in 1969, satellites are a useful vehicle for transmitting special events and news stories, live and worldwide. The advent of small portable earth stations (for example, satellite \u201cdishes\u201d) less than 3 feet wide has enabled affordable television transmissions from satellites directly into the home. Satellites have also fostered the development of planned mobile personal communications services. As with other satellite services, recent technological developments have reduced the size and cost of the mobile handsets and thereby increased their convenience and desirability. Personal communications service, which is similar to cellular phone service but has a global service area, aims to provide an individual with a single telephone number for voice, data, and facsimile transmissions worldwide.", "While underwater cables have always competed against satellites in providing international telephone service, advances in the capacity and capabilities of fiber-optic cables in the 1980s have made this method of transmission increasingly more important. Fiber-optic cables, where available, have become the medium of choice for international telephone service because they provide, relative to satellites, a higher-quality voice service. Over the last decade, there has been a massive increase in the amount and capacity of transoceanic fiber-optic cables. Satellites, however, currently can provide certain kinds of services not currently available with fiber-optic cables."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Continuum From Government Regulation to Competition in Telecommunications", "paragraphs": ["As telephone service developed in most countries, governments either operated the phone company or, as was the case in the United States, authorized one highly regulated firm to provide most domestic and international service. Because telecommunications was traditionally so closely aligned with governments, it was used as a vehicle for promoting a variety of social goals in many, if not most, countries. For example, in the United States and elsewhere, certain aspects of telephone service, such as long-distance service, were priced higher than the cost of producing them in order to price others, such as basic local service, below cost. Furthermore, in many countries, revenues from telephone service have been used to subsidize the postal service.", "When INTELSAT and Inmarsat were established, the member governments put in place a number of protections to encourage the development of their satellite systems. In essence, the intergovernmental organizations were created as international monopolies, though domestic and other systems were allowed under certain conditions. Such an arrangement is unlike a competitive market, which typically involves a significant number of firms providing a product, prices based on costs, easy entry by new firms, and a lack of collusion among firms. Even when there are few firms operating in a market, the ideal competitive outcomes can be achieved if new firms can enter\u2014or threaten to enter\u2014easily.", "The tight control of telecommunications by national governments has been easing in some cases. U.S. policymakers, for example, determined some time ago, that not all aspects of telephone service were best provided by one producer, so some markets were opened up to competitors. Recently, some other countries, too, began privatizing their telecommunications markets. However, there are still many countries, particularly in the developing world, that retain tight control over telecommunications.", "In the United States, recent efforts to promote domestic telecommunications services include the enactment of major legislation that, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), will lessen regulation in order to reduce prices, increase the quality of services, and encourage the rapid deployment of new technologies through more competition. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104, Feb. 8, 1996) makes sweeping changes affecting all consumers and telecommunications service providers. The law aims to ultimately open all domestic telecommunications markets to competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Interested in fostering competition in not only domestic but also international telecommunications, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation asked us to (1) describe the institutional framework for providing international communications satellite services; (2) determine if any elements of the framework may hinder competition and, if so, how; and (3) identify some key options for resolving any competitive issues identified.", "To meet our objectives, we reviewed the relevant statutes, regulations, and intergovernmental agreements.

We also obtained information from the industry coalition Alliance for Competitive International Satellite Services (ACISS), as well as representatives of several other satellite companies operating, licensed to operate, or applying for licensing to establish their own satellite systems.", "The most direct way of determining if a market is competitive is to look at the relationship between the prices that a firm charges its customers and the firm\u2019s costs, to determine if the company is charging large markups. Because price and cost data for satellite services are not generally available or readily usable, we used other important indicators of the competitiveness of this market, such as the number of firms providing the services and the difficulty or ease with which new firms can begin providing services. As a result, while we cannot firmly conclude that any particular market in which INTELSAT provides services is or is not competitive, we can offer indications of the degree of competition. Still, that information must be augmented by other important information, such as the degree to which owners of INTELSAT are also owners of some alternative systems.", "In examining competition, we analyzed data, including ownership information, on domestic, regional, and other satellite systems, which we obtained from (1) Dailink Satcoms, Ltd., in Virginia, and (2) Design Publishers, Inc., in California. We also relied on discussions with a selection of U.S.-based companies that use international communications satellite services, including broadcasters and multinational corporate users.

It appeared at that time that the most effective way to develop, implement, and operate a commercial communications satellite system that could serve all nations of the world would be through a consortium of nations joined together in an intergovernmental organization. Therefore, at the initiative of the United States and COMSAT, INTELSAT was established, first through an interim agreement in 1964 and finally, in 1973, by an intergovernmental agreement with other countries.", "Under the 1973 agreement, INTELSAT\u2019s purpose is to design, develop, implement, and operate a global commercial communications satellite system. Its prime objective is to provide international commercial satellite communications on a nondiscriminatory basis to all areas of the world. INTELSAT\u2019s rates are nondiscriminatory in the sense that for a given service, they are the same no matter where they are provided across the world. However, a given service may have a series of rates that vary depending on the amount of the service purchased or the length of the contract. Therefore, INTELSAT generally does charge lower rates to larger and more permanent customers.", "Currently, INTELSAT has 139 member countries and operates 24 satellites that provide voice, data, and video communications.

Each member government appoints a signatory, usually a telecommunications agency or company with government ownership; the signatories are the investors in and the agents for the satellite system. Users within each country purchase INTELSAT satellite capacity from their country\u2019s signatory; although more than 70 countries now allow direct purchase and direct billing from INTELSAT, they may allow this kind of access only to designated companies, according to an INTELSAT representative.

These three agencies are responsible for, among other things, issuing instructions to COMSAT in its role as the U.S. signatory to the intergovernmental organizations. The agencies decide together, with input from COMSAT, what position to pursue in the organizations\u2019 meetings and how COMSAT should vote. The FCC also regulates U.S. companies providing domestic and international telecommunications services. In this regard, the FCC approves COMSAT\u2019s funding of INTELSAT and Inmarsat. The FCC also regulates the prices COMSAT charges its customers and its rate of return on its investment in the intergovernmental organizations. Other agencies, such as the departments of Justice and Treasury and offices within the Executive Office of the President, participate in formulating U.S. policy on INTELSAT and Inmarsat through an interagency coordinating committee that includes the State and Commerce departments and the FCC.", "The FCC\u2019s regulatory policies affecting international satellite communications are evolving over time from ones designed to ensure the commercial viability of INTELSAT and Inmarsat to ones in support of worldwide competition. For many years, the United States did not authorize the use of any other U.S. satellite systems besides INTELSAT\u2019s and Inmarsat\u2019s to provide commercial international satellite communications\u2014although under the 1962 act, the creation of other systems was not precluded if required to meet unique governmental needs or if deemed to be in the national interest. In early 1981, the FCC authorized use of U.S., Canadian, and Mexican domestic satellites for transborder communications within guidelines established by the executive branch. In 1983, several companies filed applications with the FCC to establish satellite systems to compete with INTELSAT\u2019s. In response, in 1984 President Reagan issued Presidential Determination No. 85-2, which stated that the President had determined that separate international communications satellite systems were required in the national interest. Two conditions were placed on the proposed satellite systems by the executive branch: (1) that the companies not be permitted to provide services that interconnected with the public networks and (2) that they consult with INTELSAT pursuant to obligations under the intergovernmental agreement. The latter provision required the companies to provide INTELSAT with information about their business plans in order to clear the consultation process.", "In implementing the President\u2019s decision, the FCC issued regulations that initially precluded other companies from competing with INTELSAT\u2019s service that connected to a country\u2019s public networks\u2014principally international telephone service. That restriction was intended to ensure that new companies did not cause INTELSAT significant economic harm, thereby safeguarding INTELSAT\u2019s financial integrity. According to an FCC official, such a restriction was deemed necessary to gain approval from INTELSAT, which was actively opposing competition. As a result, companies focused on services they were allowed to provide, primarily international private communications networks and international television/video service. Over time, INTELSAT made a series of determinations that separate satellite systems providing increasing levels of services would not cause it significant economic harm. According to a State Department official, INTELSAT\u2019s changes resulted from U.S. pressure. In response to those changes, the FCC has been incrementally lifting the restrictions on the services other companies may provide and, pursuant to the executive branch\u2019s goal, plans to remove by January 1, 1997, all restrictions on international satellite services that connect to the public networks.", "Similarly, to help INTELSAT flourish, even in the face of competition from transoceanic cables, in 1971 the FCC issued a guideline that required reasonable parity in the use of cables and satellites by AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph) on its transatlantic routes. Later, in 1988, that policy was eliminated, in part because INTELSAT no longer needed the guaranteed level of use of its satellites. Likewise, in 1966, earth stations located in the United States that were serving INTELSAT\u2019s system were required to be owned half by COMSAT. In 1984, the FCC removed that restriction in order to benefit users by increasing their options and creating competitive pressures on rates. The FCC also required COMSAT to price its satellite and earth station services separately to help foster competition in the operation of earth stations.", "Most recently, the FCC\u2019s policies have been designed primarily to assist U.S. companies competing to establish their own satellite systems serving the international market.

We found that competition developed differently in two primary markets for international communications services. In the market for international telephone service, where various policies impeded U.S. satellite firms from providing service, competition emerged primarily from an alternative medium: fiber-optic cables. In the international television/video market, the restrictions on satellite systems were less pronounced.

These representatives told us that countries have carried out restrictions in a variety of ways, including (1) authorizing earth stations only if they serve INTELSAT\u2019s satellites, (2) assessing prohibitively high tariffs on the smaller earth stations often used by private satellite systems, (3) prohibiting alternative systems\u2019 interconnection with the countries\u2019 telephone network, and (4) denying or restricting access to necessary radio spectrum within the countries for the transmission of satellite signals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Faster Access to Orbital Positions", "paragraphs": ["As intergovernmental organizations, INTELSAT and Inmarsat have enjoyed faster access to ITU\u2019s registration of scarce geostationary satellite orbital locations.

For basic telephone service between two countries well served by fiber-optic cables, for example, INTELSAT\u2019s overall share of satellite capacity may overstate its dominance because the figure does not take into account the service by fiber-optic cables.

INTELSAT would have no institutional ownership, and the signatories collectively would be limited to owning no more than 20 percent after a transition period.", "For companies competing against the affiliate, this approach toward restructuring could address most of the disadvantages they may face; it could also address the disadvantages that some INTELSAT members feel burdened by in their quest to compete. The United States\u2019 expectation is that the relative independence of the affiliate, owing to its 80-percent ownership by entities other than INTELSAT members, will reduce the incentive countries have had to grant preferential market access to INTELSAT while excluding or impeding potential competitors. Also, because the affiliate would be a commercial company with publicly traded shares and subject to the laws and regulations of an individual country, it would not possess the privileges and immunities or other benefits of an intergovernmental organization, although the remaining immunity of the intergovernmental organization may make enforcement difficult. It would also be subject to the same disclosure requirements of the consultation process that other companies must undergo. Furthermore, an affiliate unencumbered by an intergovernmental decision-making structure could be free of INTELSAT\u2019s obligations to provide universal service at nondiscriminatory prices and could more readily respond to the needs of a rapidly changing market.", "Minimal ownership by signatories could reduce the incentive that regulatory authorities have to favor any INTELSAT affiliates over other companies. However, according to officials at the State and Commerce departments, the FCC, and the National Economic Council and representatives of COMSAT, INTELSAT members are unlikely to accept the creation of more affiliates, and the United States is encountering strong resistance to the 20-percent limit on signatories\u2019 combined ownership. A Commerce Department official explained that while competition is an important goal of the United States, it is not a priority with many other members of INTELSAT. Developing countries, in particular, are concerned about maintaining some form of INTELSAT to ensure its original mission of providing universal service at nondiscriminatory prices. The U.S. proposal would retain an intergovernmental organization to ensure the fulfillment of INTELSAT\u2019s original mission.", "The degree of ownership by INTELSAT and its signatories during a transition, combined with the length of that transition, raises some concerns about the extent to which this kind of restructuring approach could enhance competition. Under the U.S. proposal, INTELSAT would own the affiliate for possibly 1 or 2 years, pending the conclusion of the first public sale of shares, during which at least 60 percent of shares is to be sold. The initial sale of shares would be under the auspices of an international team of underwriters, who may judge that selling the shares during the first year may not be a prudent business decision. They have the option of delaying the initial sale for up to a second year. However, underwriters may have a financial incentive to sell the shares as soon as possible.", "The remaining shares would be distributed among INTELSAT\u2019s signatories. As much as 2 years could pass before the sale of another 20 percent of the shares would be expected. Thus, all members of INTELSAT may continue to have an incentive to favor the affiliate over other companies potentially for as much as 3 or 4 years, at a time when other companies are trying to enter the market and establish themselves as viable providers.", "While the United States\u2019 approach to restructuring would create an affiliate that would neither possess the advantages of an intergovernmental organization nor bear the burdens currently felt by INTELSAT, the intergovernmental organization that would remain after the creation of the affiliate presents different issues. To the extent that a residual intergovernmental organization owns assets and provides services, companies competing with it will still face some of the competitive disadvantages, and the intergovernmental organization will still retain some of its burdens.", "With the private sector poised to compete, ACISS has proposed a restructuring for INTELSAT that would allow retaining an intergovernmental organization and would create at least two affiliates. That proposal would restrict a signatory\u2019s investment to only one of the affiliates, not both. ACISS members hope that this proposal would result in additional market access for other private companies because signatories may find that to do business with certain other countries, they will have to allow entry into their domestic markets by the INTELSAT affiliate in which they have not invested; the need to allow both affiliates into their markets may induce countries to widen access to other entrants. This proposal has not been presented within INTELSAT for consideration. ACISS has stated that it would prefer to leave the existing structure intact until the option of having multiple affiliates becomes acceptable.", "Until INTELSAT decides about restructuring and its particulars, the extent to which restructuring will resolve hindrances to competition is unclear. The organization will consider its restructuring at meetings currently scheduled for October and December 1996, and possibly February 1997, with the goal of adopting a restructuring plan in April 1997, when member governments will gather for their biannual meeting.", "Inmarsat. Inmarsat has also been considering restructuring to help it meet the challenges of a changing market. The main approach under consideration would create a private company and retain a residual intergovernmental organization to ensure that Inmarsat\u2019s goals of safety and rescue at sea are met. Under discussion within Inmarsat is whether or not to transfer all satellites to the private company, leaving the residual intergovernmental organization not as a direct provider but as an entity that would oversee whether the private company met contractual obligations concerning safety and rescue and other public service obligations. Creating a private company could potentially resolve many of the competitive issues raised by the structure of an intergovernmental organization, especially if all of Inmarsat\u2019s satellites were transferred to the company rather than retained by any intergovernmental organization and signatories\u2019 ownership was limited. However, the benefits of creating a private company and transferring assets to it may be reduced if the private company were to merge with Inmarsat\u2019s existing affiliate, ICO Global Communications Limited (ICO), because ICO is primarily owned by Inmarsat and its signatories. And this approach may not resolve any advantages ICO itself may have because of its ownership structure, as discussed in our July report.", "The United States recently presented to Inmarsat a position paper setting forth changes that the United States would like to see before it could accept the restructuring plan being considered. The United States is seeking two fundamental goals through a restructuring of Inmarsat: (1) guaranteeing the provision of global maritime distress and safety services and (2) enhancing competition by ensuring fair market access and a level playing field for all providers of mobile satellite services. In its position paper, the United States discussed nine areas of concern that could impair competition and suggested remedies, including the following: (1) that contractual arrangements with a restructured Inmarsat are the best way to guarantee safety and rescue services, (2) that \u201csignificant\u201d external investment is critical to fair competition globally because of governments\u2019 current ownership interests in many Inmarsat signatories, and (3) that structural separation between a restructured Inmarsat and ICO is important in order to prevent dominance of the market by a convergence of interests between the two entities. The United States also proposed a draft amendment to the Inmarsat agreement that would commit all Inmarsat member governments to provide nondiscriminatory access to their markets for all satellite services and service providers. ACISS, too, believes that it is critical for a restructured Inmarsat and ICO to be separate in order to establish a competitive market.", "According to FCC and Commerce Department officials, Inmarsat members were generally uninterested in the U.S. views discussed in the position paper and are more interested in, among other things, greater government ownership of a restructured Inmarsat than the United States would like to see, and less, if any, investment by entities besides signatories. To resolve some of these differences as Inmarsat considers restructuring options, meetings have been scheduled for October and December 1996. Inmarsat\u2019s current goal is to adopt a restructuring plan in 1997.", "According to COMSAT representatives, ICO has just incorporated into its organizing documents a set of competitive principals, many of which were approved by Inmarsat in 1994 at the urging of the United States. COMSAT believes that these competitive principles will ensure that ICO does not inhibit competition in land-based mobile services. ACISS stated that these competitive principles are not binding on ICO\u2019s individual signatory owners, who frequently control market access for their countries.", "The Effect on Market Access. Although changing the intergovernmental status of INTELSAT and Inmarsat could address most of the competitive issues raised earlier, ultimately, the key to ensuring competition is the ability of competing companies to obtain access to markets. While the U.S. proposal for restructuring INTELSAT is receiving serious consideration and while its ultimate goal is to induce countries to open their markets, it can do so only indirectly by lessening the incentive that countries have to grant access to INTELSAT in lieu of potential competitors. Although the United States supports an amendment to the Inmarsat agreement to guarantee nondiscriminatory market access, the amendment has generated little interest within Inmarsat."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Other Options for Increasing Market Access", "paragraphs": ["Other options for increasing market access are pursuing multilateral negotiations and using access to the U.S. market as leverage in getting other countries to provide access to theirs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multilateral Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["One option that could focus specifically on the issue of increasing market access around the world is direct negotiations with other countries to remove barriers. Bilateral negotiations alone could take a long time to produce useful results in a sufficient number of countries to facilitate competition in international satellite services, especially for global systems. But the United States is currently engaged in multilateral negotiations under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO), an international forum for addressing trade issues, including trade in services. These negotiations are dealing with the issue of opening countries\u2019 markets in basic telecommunications services. The United States has participated since the talks began in 1994 and originally offered to open all of its basic telecommunications markets except direct access to INTELSAT\u2019s and Inmarsat\u2019s capacity and cable landing rights. When an agreement has been reached, each country will provide to all WTO members the market access it offered, including to members that make no concessions at all. According to FCC officials, however, a country may exclude a type or category of services from this general extension of benefits.", "The original deadline for reaching agreement was April 30, 1996. However, because a sufficient number of high-quality offers from other countries were not presented (specifically, other countries offered only limited, if any, market access), the United States forged a consensus to extend the deadline for agreement to February 15, 1997. Between January 15, 1997, and February 15, 1997, new offers and changes in current offers will be allowed. The United States hopes to encourage new and better offers from other countries through discussions with them prior to the new deadline.", "The results of the WTO negotiations, however, could affect U.S. influence in discussions within INTELSAT and Inmarsat on restructuring approaches, according to FCC officials, who note that control over access to the U.S. market gives the United States some leverage in achieving its goals in the restructuring of the intergovernmental organizations. According to these officials, if the WTO negotiations are successful and include satellite services (and the United States does not except them from the general extension of benefits), then the U.S. market will be opened for the satellite service suppliers of all WTO members. According to those officials, because the international satellite organizations are not organized under the laws of any single country, they may not necessarily gain access to a specific country\u2019s market through the results of the WTO negotiations. However, these officials note that the intergovernmental organizations as well as any private affiliates may gain access to the U.S. market through the WTO negotiations if the organizations or affiliates are considered to be organized under the laws of their host country or the country in which they are at least nominally incorporated. If the WTO negotiations fail or do not include satellite services, then access to the U.S. market by foreign-licensed satellite systems, including those of any affiliate of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, would be governed by regulations proposed by the FCC setting forth the conditions under which it would allow, and could deny, access to the U.S. market, as discussed below.", "Members of ACISS consider the WTO negotiations to be the most important forum for opening foreign markets; they view them as a more effective approach for gaining market access than any unilateral action.

As part of a broader review of its regulations to enhance competition, the FCC is proposing to permit non-U.S.-licensed companies to serve the U.S. market to the extent that U.S.-licensed systems are allowed to serve the applicant\u2019s home market and some or all of its other markets. The agency\u2019s decisions would also take into account other considerations about the public interest. The FCC hopes that a desire to gain access to the large U.S. market will give nations sufficient incentive to open their own markets to competition from other systems.", "In commenting on the proposed regulatory changes, COMSAT stated that the FCC\u2019s proposed approaches for evaluating the openness of other markets presumes them to be anticompetitive and could foster a backlash against U.S.-licensed companies. COMSAT also noted that with so few orbital positions available for serving the U.S. market, there may not be enough slots open to provide an incentive to a foreign country to abandon its own protective domestic policies. Under the proposed regulatory changes, COMSAT, as the sole provider of INTELSAT and Inmarsat satellite services in the U.S. market, would lose the opportunity to provide services of any new affiliates created by the intergovernmental organizations unless those affiliates passed the FCC\u2019s evaluation of their home market\u2019s openness.", "Several private satellite companies that compete, or will be competing, with INTELSAT and Inmarsat, supported the FCC\u2019s approach to ensuring effective market access. For example, one U.S. satellite company commented to the FCC that the proposed regulations should lead to lower prices, better service, and enhanced access for U.S. companies to other countries\u2019 markets. However, the company cautioned that the proposed regulations as applied to international satellite services alone would not facilitate access to the vast majority of other nations\u2019 markets because few countries are in a position to participate in the U.S. satellite market.
