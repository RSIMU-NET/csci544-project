NNSA expects to approve such baseline estimates for the other three\u2014including the two largest subprojects\u2014by the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. NNSA also plans to validate the estimates by then through an independent cost estimate.", "NNSA, however, has not developed a complete scope of work, life-cycle cost estimate (i.e., a structured accounting of all cost elements for a program), or integrated master schedule (i.e., encompassing individual project schedules) for the overall uranium program, and it has no time frame for doing so. In particular, it has not developed a complete scope of work for repairs and upgrades to existing buildings in which NNSA intends to house some uranium processing capabilities and has not done so for other key program elements. For example:", "The scope of work for a portion of the upgrades and repairs will not be determined until after fiscal year 2018, when NNSA expects to conduct seismic and structural assessments to determine what work is needed to address safety issues in existing buildings.", "NNSA has developed an initial implementation plan that roughly estimates a cost of $400 million over the next 20 years for the repairs and upgrades, but a detailed scope of work to support this estimate is not expected to be fully developed except on an annual basis in the year(s) that immediately precedes the work.", "Because NNSA has not developed a complete scope of work for the overall uranium program, it does not have the basis to develop a life-cycle cost estimate or an integrated master schedule. Successful program management depends in part on developing a complete scope of work, life-cycle cost estimate, and an integrated master schedule, as GAO has stated in its cost estimating and schedule guides. In previous work reviewing other NNSA programs, GAO has found that when NNSA did not have a life-cycle cost estimate based on a complete scope of work, the agency could not ensure its life-cycle cost estimate captured all relevant costs, which could result in cost overruns. The revised cost estimate that NNSA is developing for the new UPF will be an essential component of a life-cycle cost estimate for the overall program. However, for other program elements, NNSA has either rough or no estimates of the total costs and has not set a time frame for developing these costs. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve an entity's objectives, and among other characteristics, such information is provided on a timely basis. Without setting a time frame to complete the scope of work and prepare a life-cycle cost estimate and integrated master schedule for the program, NNSA does not have reasonable assurance that decision makers will have timely access to essential program management information\u2014risking unforeseen cost escalation and delays."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NNSA set a time frame for completing the scope of work, life-cycle cost estimate, and integrated master schedule for the overall uranium program.

To transform uranium ore into a form that can  be used for these purposes, uranium goes through a number of steps that  include mining, conversion, and enrichment. Conversion is the process of  converting mined natural uranium to a gas that can be used for  enrichment, and enrichment is the process of separating uranium-235\u2014 the form, or isotope, that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts  of energy in nuclear reactors and weapons\u2014from much of the uranium- 238, the form more prevalent in natural uranium, to increase the  concentration of uranium-235. The National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), an agency within the Department of Energy  (DOE), is responsible for meeting national needs for enriched and  depleted uranium (a byproduct of the enrichment process) in support of  the nuclear weapons stockpile and the Navy, as part of NNSA\u2019s broader  nuclear security missions. Enriched uranium is processed, for example,  into components that support the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile and  re-processed when components eventually need to be replaced.  However, some of NNSA\u2019s uranium processing facilities\u2014located at the  Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and built in  the 1940s and 1950s\u2014are outdated and deteriorating, according to  NNSA and DOE officials and documents. In addition, DOE\u2019s Office of  Inspector General reported in November 2016 on NNSA\u2019s aging uranium  infrastructure, which the office found poses risks to NNSA\u2019s ability to meet  its missions in the future.", "In 2004, NNSA initiated plans for the construction of a new Uranium  Processing Facility (UPF), a more modern facility that would consolidate  Y-12\u2019s uranium processing capabilities into a single facility. NNSA\u2019s  efforts to modernize its uranium capabilities, however, have experienced  scope of work changes, cost increases, and schedule delays. As we have  previously found, NNSA has experienced ongoing problems in contract  and project management, including its modernization of uranium  processing capabilities, which have resulted in our designating these  activities as at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. In June 2012, the  Deputy Secretary of Energy approved $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion in funding  to build the UPF. One month later, the UPF contractor concluded that the  UPF\u2019s processing equipment would not fit into the UPF facility as  designed. Concerned about cost growth and budget constraints for  construction of the facility, NNSA\u2019s Acting Administrator in 2014 directed  that a peer review team be established to develop and recommend an  alternative approach to meet specific NNSA objectives. In April 2014, the  peer review team recommended that NNSA develop an integrated  uranium program to include construction of a new, smaller UPF with  fewer capabilities; infrastructure repairs and upgrades for existing Y-12  facilities; and further development of certain technologies that are  planned for eventual use within Y-12\u2019s new buildings and existing  facilities.", "Since 2014, NNSA has planned for the modernization of its uranium  processing capabilities under the auspices of a broader uranium program.

These sites include laboratories, production plants,  and a test site.", "Of NNSA\u2019s eight sites, the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee  is the primary site with enriched uranium processing capabilities. Y-12\u2019s  primary mission is processing and storing uranium, processing nuclear  fuel for the U.S. Navy, and developing technologies associated with those  activities, including technologies for producing uranium-related  components for nuclear warheads and bombs. Construction of the 811- acre Y-12 site began in 1943 as part of the World War II-era Manhattan  Project. Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium processing and storage capability is  primarily housed in the following buildings:", "Building 9212: This building was constructed in 1945, at the end of  World War II, and includes a number of support and storage facilities  related to uranium purification and casting. According to a 2016  report from the DOE Office of Inspector General, all of the various  support and storage facilities of Building 9212 contain radioactive and  chemical materials in sufficient quantities that an unmitigated release  would result in significant consequences. These facilities do not meet  current safety requirements for such facilities in that they cannot  withstand a seismic event, high wind event, or aircraft crash. The  shutdown of Building 9212 operations that have the highest nuclear  safety risk at Y-12 is a key NNSA uranium program goal. Because of  these risks, according to NNSA officials, NNSA has substantially  reduced the risks from high-hazard materials, such as enriched  uranium in organic and aqueous solutions, with a focus on materials  located in Building 9212. As such, according to these officials, the  remaining material at risk in Building 9212 has been reduced to a  level significantly below the facility\u2019s administrative limit, and NNSA is  implementing a four-phase exit strategy to systematically phase out  mission dependency on Building 9212. The exit strategy includes  actions necessary to remove material hold-up, complete all process  relocations, transition personnel to the UPF, and complete post- operations cleanout of the facility, among other things, according to  NNSA officials.", "Building 9215: This building was constructed in the 1950s and  consists of three main structures. Specific activities in Building 9215  include fabrication activities, such as metal forming and machining  operations for highly enriched uranium, low-enriched uranium, and  depleted uranium. NNSA and others, such as the Defense Nuclear  Facilities Safety Board, have raised concerns about the future  reliability of the building, particularly as the amount of deferred  maintenance in Building 9215 has steadily increased over the past  several years. According to NNSA officials, NNSA\u2019s contractor has  hosted a series of technical evaluations that identified and prioritized  needed infrastructure investments over the next 15 years, including  within Building 9215, that are intended to ensure facility reliability  through the 2040s. NNSA is reviewing these initial proposed  investments.", "Building 9204-2E: This building, constructed in the late 1960s, is a  three-story, reinforced concrete frame structure. Operations in this  building include the assembly and disassembly of enriched uranium  components with other materials. Also, according to NNSA officials,  radiography capabilities have been successfully relocated out of  Building 9212 and installed in Building 9204-2E. The design used for  this facility predates modern nuclear safety codes.", "Building 9720-82 (also called the Highly Enriched Uranium  Materials Facility): This building became operational in January  2010. Built to current safety standards, the facility provides long-term  storage of enriched uranium materials and accepts the transfer of  some legacy enriched uranium from older facilities. According to  NNSA officials, as part of the uranium program NNSA transferred 12.3  metric tons of enriched uranium to this facility in fiscal year 2015, 9.8  metric tons in fiscal year 2016, and anticipates transferring 6 metric  tons in fiscal year 2017.", "According to NNSA documents, Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium operations have  key shortcomings including (1) an inefficient workflow, (2) continually  rising operations and maintenance costs due to facility age, and (3)  hazardous processes that could expose workers to radiological  contamination. To address these shortcomings, NNSA developed plans  to replace aging infrastructure at Y-12 and relocate key processing  equipment without jeopardizing uranium production operations. The first  solution, proposed in 2004, envisioned relocating Y-12\u2019s main uranium  processing equipment into a new UPF. NNSA planned to construct this  single, consolidated facility that would be less than half the size of  existing facilities; reduce costs by using modern processing equipment;  and incorporate features to increase worker protection and environmental  health and safety. In 2007, NNSA estimated the UPF would cost from  $1.4 billion to $3.5 billion to design and construct. In June 2012, the  Deputy Secretary of Energy approved an updated cost estimate range for  the UPF of from $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion. However, by August 2012, the  UPF contractor concluded that the uranium processing and other  equipment would not fit into the UPF as designed.", "In 2014, because of the high cost and schedule concerns of a solution  focused solely on constructing new buildings, NNSA prepared a high- level strategic plan for its uranium program that is now focused on  ceasing operations in building 9212 through a combination of new  construction, infrastructure investments in existing facilities, upgrades to  and relocation of select processing technologies, and improved inventory  management. This strategy includes replacing certain 9212 capabilities,  with continued operation of 9215 and 9204-2E, and removing a  considerable amount of the scope of work that had been included in the  original UPF plan (as the functions performed in Buildings 9215 and  9204-2E are no longer included within the UPF project).

The policy also states that program officials should translate the \u201cneed\u201d in  the Mission Need Statement into initial top-level requirements addressing  such concerns as performance, supportability, physical and functional  integration, security, test and evaluation, implementation, and quality  assurance. The policy states that experience has shown that a formal  process resulting in an agreed-upon definition of requirements for new  systems, new capabilities, and updates or enhancements to systems is a  prerequisite to proceeding to system or capability design.

In July 2014, NNSA  appointed a uranium program manager to integrate all of the uranium  program\u2019s elements. According to NNSA uranium program officials and  documents, uranium program elements include  construction of the new UPF;  repairs and upgrades to existing facilities; uranium sustainment activities for achieving specific uranium  production capabilities and inventory risk reduction (the strategic  placement of high-risk materials in lower-risk conditions); depleted uranium management; and  technology development, deployment, and process relocation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Best Practices for Program Cost and Schedule Estimating", "paragraphs": ["In March 2009, we published a cost estimating guide to provide a  consistent methodology that is based on best practices and that can be  used across the federal government for developing, managing, and  evaluating capital program cost estimates. The methodology outlined in  the guide is a compilation of best practices that federal cost estimating  organizations and industry use to develop and maintain reliable cost  estimates throughout the life of a government acquisition program.", "According to the cost estimating guide, developing accurate life-cycle cost  estimates has become a high priority for agencies in properly managing  their portfolios of capital assets that have an estimated life of 2 years or  more. A life-cycle cost estimate provides an exhaustive and structured  accounting of all resources and associated cost elements required to  develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular program. According to  the guide, a life-cycle cost estimate can be thought of as a \u201ccradle to  grave\u201d approach to managing a program throughout its useful life. This  entails identifying all cost elements that pertain to the program from initial  concept all the way through operations, support, and disposal. A life-cycle  cost estimate encompasses all past (or sunk), present, and future costs  for every aspect of the program, regardless of funding source. According  to the guide, a life-cycle cost estimate can enhance decision making,  especially in early planning and concept formulation of acquisition, as well  as support budget decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and  investment decisions. The guide also states that a credible cost estimate  reflects all costs associated with a system (program)\u2014we interpret this to  also mean that it must be based on a complete scope of work\u2014and the  estimate should be updated to reflect changes in requirements (which  affect the scope of work). Because of the inherent uncertainty of every  estimate due to the assumptions that must be made about future  projections, once life-cycle costs are developed it is also important to  continually keep them updated, according to the guide.", "We also published a schedule guide in December 2015\u2014as a companion  to the cost estimating guide\u2014that identifies best practices for scheduling  the necessary work. According to the schedule guide, a well-planned  schedule is a fundamental management tool that can help government  programs use funds effectively by specifying when work will be performed  in the future and measuring program performance against an approved  plan. Moreover, an integrated master schedule can show when major  events are expected as well as the completion dates for all activities  leading up to these events, which can help determine if the program\u2019s  parameters are realistic and achievable. An integrated master schedule  may be made up of several or several hundred individual schedules that  represent portions of effort within a program. These individual schedules  are \u201cprojects\u201d within the larger program. An integrated master schedule  integrates the planned work, the resources necessary to accomplish that  work, and the associated budget, and it should be the focal point for  program management. Furthermore, according to the schedule guide, an  integrated master schedule constitutes a program schedule that includes  the entire required scope of work, including the effort necessary from all  government, contractor, and other key parties for a program\u2019s successful  execution from start to finish. Conformance to this best practice\u2014that  the schedule should capture all activities or scope of work\u2014logically  leads to another key schedule best practice: the sequencing of all  activities. This best practice states that activities must be listed in the  order in which they are to be carried out and be joined with logic.  Consequently, developing a complete scope of work or knowing all of the  activities necessary to accomplish the project\u2019s objectives is critical to  adhering to these best practices. In other words, a schedule is not  complete and reliable if significant portions of the scope of work are not  yet developed or are still uncertain, including over the longer term.", "In prior reports from February 2014, November 2014, and August 2016,  we included recommendations concerning NNSA\u2019s development of life- cycle cost estimates or an integrated master schedule for certain projects  and programs, as called for in our cost estimating and schedule best  practice guides.

Our November 2010 report also concluded  that because all of the technologies being developed for construction of  the new UPF would not achieve optimal levels of readiness prior to  project critical decisions, NNSA might lack assurance that all technologies  would work as intended. The report further stated that this could force the  project to revert to existing or alternate technologies, which could result in  design changes, higher costs, and schedule delays.

For example, NNSA\u2019s October 2014 revision of  program requirements for construction of the new UPF resulted in the  following changes:", "NNSA modified the processing capability for casting uranium initially  intended for construction of the new UPF, which then allowed the  agency to scale back certain capabilities envisioned for the facility,  potentially reducing project costs.", "NNSA significantly simplified processing capabilities and reduced  critical technologies needed for construction, due to the reduction in  the scope of work for the new UPF from the 10 technologies the  agency planned to use prior to 2014 to 3, according to program  officials. NNSA officials told us that this change was needed to help  control escalating costs and technical risks.", "NNSA integrated graded security and safety factors into the new UPF  design, which resulted in cost savings and schedule improvement for  the UPF project, according to agency officials.", "According to NNSA\u2019s fiscal years 2017 and 2018 budget requests, NNSA  expects to approve formal scope of work, cost, and schedule baseline  estimates for construction of the new UPF as the designs for the Main  Process and Salvage and Accountability Buildings subprojects\u2014the two  largest subprojects\u2014reach at least 90 percent completion, which is  consistent with DOE\u2019s order on project management for construction of  these types of facilities.", "According to NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 and 2018 budget requests,  construction of the new UPF will occur in distinct phases, by key  subproject.

For  example, according to the board\u2019s February 2015 letter to NNSA,  earthquakes or structural performance problems in Buildings 9215 and  9204-2E could contribute to an increased risk for structural collapse and  release of radiological material. NNSA officials said they have not fully  developed the long-term scope of work to address the safety issues that  the board confirmed because much of this work depends on the results of  upcoming seismic and structural assessments the agency expects to be  conducted in or after fiscal year 2018. According to these officials, the  need for these assessments was not apparent until after 2014, when  NNSA decided to rely, in part, on aging existing facilities to meet uranium  program requirements. NNSA then had to adjust plans in alignment with  the new circumstances that required repairs and upgrades to these  facilities. According to NNSA program officials, the planned infrastructure  repairs and upgrades will address many, but not all, of the safety issues  identified by the board. For example, NNSA program officials stated that  they do not expect building 9215, which it expects to be in operation  through the late 2030s, to meet all modern safety standards even with  planned upgrades. NNSA officials also stated that planned upgrades  have not been finalized and will focus on the upgrades that balance cost  and risks.", "Other aspects of the scope of work for repairs and upgrades have been  developed but may not be stable because NNSA continues to review and  adjust program requirements that affect the scope of work. For example,  during our examination of how NNSA established uranium purification  requirements, NNSA program officials told us that they identified a more  accurate program requirement for purified uranium that increased the  required annual processing throughput capability for purified uranium  from 450 to 750 kilograms. As a result, in August 2016, NNSA program  officials told us that NNSA will need to add to the capacity of the  equipment to be installed in Building 9215 to convert uranium that  contains relatively high amounts of impurities, such as carbon, into a  more purified form\u2014increasing the scope of work for this upgrade. The  uranium program manager told us that, in an effort to make the  requirement more accurate, NNSA changed its approach to determining  the requirement so that it relied less on historical data and more on data  on the purification levels of uranium inventories on hand, among other  considerations. This program manager also told us that accurate and  stable program requirements establish the basis for the infrastructure and  equipment that will be needed to meet program goals, such as processing  uranium for nuclear components necessary to meet nuclear weapons  stockpile needs.
