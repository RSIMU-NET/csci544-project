In fiscal year 1996, about $656 billion of federal tax receipts and $458 billion in federal spending were automatically linked to price changes measured by the CPI. The CPI tracks prices for a fixed \u201cmarket basket\u201d of goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Since 1940, BLS has made major revisions to the market basket about once a decade to reflect changes in what consumers buy.", "This report responds to your request that we examine certain questions surrounding the issue of revising the market basket more often. As agreed with your office, rather than evaluating possible alternatives to the CPI\u2019s basic formula or examining the whole process of making major revisions to the CPI, we focused on the market basket\u2019s expenditure weights and whether they could be updated between major revisions to the CPI.Historically, the expenditure weights have been changed only during major CPI revisions. Unlike in a major revision, the principal task in an update would be to change\u2014make more current\u2014the expenditure weights that had been determined during the last major revision. In a revision, BLS has usually changed (1) the CPI\u2019s geographic areas and housing samples, which reflect where consumers live and buy goods and services; (2) the computer systems for processing these data; and (3) the expenditure weights of the market basket items.

These purchases are for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation, medical care, entertainment, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Only expenditures made by consumers are captured in the CPI.", "The CPI is used by the federal government, businesses, labor organizations, and private citizens. According to BLS, the CPI is used as an economic indicator of inflation; an escalator for wages, income payments, and tax brackets; and a deflator of selected economic statistical series. For example, through collective bargaining contract negotiations in 1996, 1.7 million workers had their wages raised on the basis of changes in the CPI. As a result of changes in prices as reported in the CPI in 1996, 43.5 million Social Security beneficiaries and 25.8 million food stamp recipients had their benefits increased for inflation in 1996.", "According to BLS, to construct the CPI, the prices of more than 94,000 items are collected each month (e.g., margarine sold in tubs, sticks, or squeeze bottles) and aggregated into 206 \u201citem strata\u201d (e.g., fats and oils). In making the monthly calculations, according to BLS, weights are used to give proportionate emphasis for price changes of one item in relation to other items in the CPI.", "According to BLS, two sets of weights are computed from different sources of information. BLS computes one set of weights from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) data. These weights, which are the focus of this report, are used to aggregate the 206 item strata into the overall index number for the CPI. In this report, we refer to this first set of weights as \u201cexpenditure weights.\u201d", "The second set of weights is derived primarily from information taken from the Point-of-Purchase Survey (POPS). These weights, which we term \u201cpoint-of-purchase weights\u201d in this report, are used to combine the prices of the 94,000 items into the 206 item strata. In other words, the point-of-purchase weights are used to aggregate the prices of the individual items into the 206 item strata and provide the base to which the expenditure weights are applied to calculate the CPI.", "The two sets of weights are updated at different time intervals. BLS began to publish the CPI regularly in 1921 and has changed expenditure weights only when making major revisions to the CPI. These major CPI revisions occurred in 1940, 1953, 1964, 1978, and 1987; another revision is scheduled for 1998. BLS instituted the POPS in 1978. All of the point-of-purchase weights are scheduled to be updated over a 5-year period, according to BLS.", "The CPI is often referred to as a cost-of-living index and is used to reflect the cost of living to adjust, for example, federal income tax brackets and some federal payments. Although some elements of the CPI reflect cost-of-living concepts, the CPI was not designed to be a cost-of-living index. As usually defined, a cost-of-living index would be broader in coverage than an index that is based on consumer expenditures. BLS has said through the years that the CPI is not a cost-of-living index. To date, the federal government has not developed a comprehensive cost-of-living index.", "In 1961, the Price Statistics Review Committee (hereafter called the Stigler committee for its chairman, George Stigler) recommended that the conceptual framework of the CPI be modified to represent a cost-of-living index. It also supported comprehensive revision of CPI weights at least once every decade and suggested that the more volatile categories of CPI weights be updated at least once every 5 years. The BLS Commissioner in 1961 agreed that the CPI should be revised every 10 years. Although the Commissioner agreed with the suggestion to update CPI weights more often, he cited some obstacles that he thought, at the time, would preclude BLS from doing so. We discuss these obstacles later in this report in the section on BLS\u2019 reasons for not updating expenditure weights more often.", "In reporting to Congress in December 1996, the Boskin commission said its overarching recommendation was that BLS establish a cost-of-living index as its objective in measuring consumer prices. The Boskin commission concluded that the CPI overstates inflation because of four sources of bias: substitution bias, new products bias, quality change bias, and new outlets bias. The commission further subdivided substitution bias into what it termed lower-level bias and upper-level bias. The lower-level bias concerns the aggregation of the prices of the individual items, and the upper-level bias concerns the 206 item strata, which are the subject of this report.", "To address upper-level substitution bias, the Boskin commission recommended that the fixed market basket CPI be abandoned and replaced with two new formulas that would enable the CPI to more closely reflect the cost of living. One formula, according to the commission Chairman, would be a true superlative index; the other formula would be a modified superlative index. A superlative index, by definition, would continually change the market basket to reflect current consumer spending. BLS has requested funding for fiscal year 1998 to continue the fixed market basket CPI and to publish a CPI with a superlative index formula in 2002. Since the fixed market basket CPI would continue to be published, the discussion on how frequently to update the expenditure weights is pertinent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To obtain opinions on updating the CPI expenditure weights more often, we asked two former BLS officials and eight others who were knowledgeable about the CPI how often the weights should be updated. The eight other individuals had conducted research in connection with the CPI: four of the eight individuals were members of the Boskin commission, two were academicians, one was employed by a major economic research institution, and one was a member of the Stigler committee. (App. I describes how we selected these eight individuals.) To obtain information on the practices followed by other industrialized countries in updating their consumer price indexes, which also addresses our first objective, we obtained information from BLS and from publications of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Canadian government on how often G-7 countries update their CPIs.", "To estimate the cost to BLS of updating the expenditure weights for the CPI on a 5-year cycle, we asked BLS to provide us with certain actual and estimated cost data. We asked BLS to provide us with the costs associated with the 1987 revision and the projected costs for the 1998 revision. In addition, we asked BLS for its estimate of what the costs would have been to update the CPI in 1992 and its estimate of what the cost might be to update the CPI in 2003. We did not specify to BLS what assumptions to make or what items to include or exclude in estimating the costs for 1992, 1998, and 2003. We also did not evaluate the reasonableness of BLS\u2019 assumptions or estimates. BLS provided us with costs for the 1987 revision and estimated costs for the 1998 revision and a 2003 update of the CPI. BLS suggested that the cost for a 1992 update could be derived by deflating the cost of the 2003 update, which we did with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) price index.", "To estimate the dollar effect on the federal budget if the expenditure weights for the CPI were updated on a 5-year cycle, we obtained assistance from BLS and CBO, which analyzes budget-related issues and provides cost estimates for legislative proposals to Congress. We asked BLS to provide a range\u2014an upper percentage point and a lower percentage point\u2014of the possible change that would occur to the CPI with a 5-year update.", "We asked CBO to estimate the effect that a 5-year update of the CPI would have on the federal budget, assuming no other changes in tax or spending levels and no other changes in the economy. To do this, we asked CBO to use BLS\u2019 lower and upper estimates of change and the midpoint of these estimates. To illustrate the effect of a 5-year update that would begin in 2003, we asked CBO to make projections for the years 2003 through 2007 as it normally would and then to do a reestimation after adjusting for the effects of a 5-year update.", "CBO\u2019s policy is to provide projections for current and future years, but not to provide estimates for past years. For that reason, we estimated how the federal budget might have been affected if the expenditure weights had been updated in 1992, which was 5 years after the 1987 major revision. In making our estimates, we used CBO\u2019s estimates for 1998 through 2007 to backcast to 1992. In doing so, we assumed that the trend that was used for the years 1998 through 2007 could be reasonably applied to the years 1993 through 1998. We discussed the methodology we used in making the estimates with CBO officials, and they said that the methodology we used and the results we obtained were reasonable.", "In connection with impact on the federal budget, as requested by your office, we asked the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to estimate the effect a change in the CPI would have on the average benefit paid to retired workers. To make the estimate, we asked SSA to use the midpoint of BLS\u2019 range of possible change that would occur to the CPI with a 5-year update. Using that midpoint percentage point and economic assumptions used in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 1998 Budget, SSA estimated the change in the average monthly benefit check for retired workers, beginning with December 2003, which would be payable in January 2004, and continued through December 2007.", "To identify and assess why updates to the CPI weights have been spaced 10 years or so apart since 1940, we talked with present and past officials of BLS and obtained their views on the reasons for this spacing. We also reviewed the 1961 congressional testimony of a BLS Commissioner in which he addressed the subject of BLS\u2019 timetable for revising the CPI. In our assessment, we (1) collected and analyzed information on past comparisons between indexes that applied old and new expenditure weights, (2) obtained information on how BLS collects its source data for the CPI, (3) reviewed BLS budget information to ascertain BLS\u2019 plans for future changes in its indexes, and (4) compared the estimated costs and benefits of a 5-year update to place an update in practical perspective.", "In our assessment, most of the comparisons between indexes with old weights and indexes with new weights probably reflected differences that were not due to changes in the expenditure weights alone. Some of the indexes we used were produced by BLS for \u201coverlap\u201d periods. When major revisions to the CPI were made, BLS calculated two indexes for several months. One index used the weights that had been in effect before the revision, and the second index used the new weights that were created for the revision. However, during a revision, many factors can and do change. For example, the geographic locations where data are collected are changed to some extent as are the items of goods and services in the market basket. Therefore, the differences that may result from comparing the two indexes may be due to several factors, and the effects of changes to the expenditure weights cannot be isolated from the effects of other changes to the index data.", "With this knowledge, we treat the differences as indicators of the effects of an update of the expenditure weights because an update of the weights is unlikely to occur in isolation from the other factors that are associated with revisions. For example, a 1992 update would have most likely incorporated a market basket that was based on different geographic areas than the areas that were used in the 1987 revision because, in 1986, changes were made in the geographic locations where expenditure data were collected. Such geographic changes are associated with major revisions.", "In addition to overlap studies, we examined the effect of the age of weights with indexes that were calculated with alternative base-year periods. For example, comparisons were made of the official CPI\u2019s 3-year base of 1982 through 1984 with alternative 3-year base periods (i.e., 1987 through 1989). In these and other comparisons, we applied an economic concept that is based upon economic literature that suggests that an index is more accurate if the expenditure weights used to compute it represent, as much as practical, current consumer spending. However, in our review of economic literature, we did not identify any theoretical guidance on how often (e.g., 5 years as compared with 10 years) expenditure weights should be updated. (See app. I for more information about our objectives, scope, and methodology.)", "As previously reported in this section, this report includes, and often relies on, estimates and comparisons prepared by BLS, CBO, or SSA. We did not verify the computerized data that the agencies used in producing these estimates and comparisons. Verification, in our opinion, would have been impractical because it would have been costly and time consuming. In addition, the estimates and comparisons were within the scope of activities that BLS, CBO, and SSA normally perform. Therefore, we used their estimates and comparisons.", "The results we obtained are intended to contribute to the discussion of how often the CPI should be updated, but they are not intended to represent all future effects of shortening the updating cycle. Neither is our work intended to evaluate a change in the basic formula that could address substitution bias in the CPI. The point of shortening the updating cycle would be to have the CPI reflect, as closely as practical, the current spending patterns of consumers, regardless of whether the index is pushed upward or downward.", "We did our work in Washington, D.C., between November 1996 and July 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Labor, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or their designees.

One official told us that the POPS should be rotated more frequently, which would affect point-of-purchase weights.

The other former official, a previous BLS Commissioner, noted that doing an update more frequently than every 5 years would be too often.", "We also spoke with a former member of the Stigler committee and four members of the Boskin commission. The former Stigler committee member said that updating the CPI only every 10 years was entirely too infrequent. However, he gave low priority to updating the expenditure weights more often because he believed that getting new consumer items into the CPI and accounting for product improvement were more important. The four members of the Boskin commission also said that the expenditure weights for the market basket should be updated more frequently than every 10 years. However, the members regarded more frequent updating as only one step to improving the CPI. The Boskin commission recommended abandoning the fixed market basket aspect of the CPI and adopting a true superlative index formula and a modified superlative index formula to account for changing market baskets.", "The spirit of the Boskin commission\u2019s recommendations, according to its Chairman, was for the CPI to be more current in order to reflect what is occurring in the economy. He said that if there were no change in existing products or no new products in the economy, then updating the expenditure weights would be the only step that would need to be taken. However, the economy is changing, with new products and product improvements occurring constantly. Therefore, more frequent updating was only a step toward what should be done to improve the CPI. He said BLS should be in a permanent revision mode. Because different aspects of the CPI interact with each other, a change in the expenditure weights would complement other steps that could be taken, such as changing the POPS sample more often than every 5 years, increasing the size of the CEX, and using estimation methods to adjust for changes in the quality of items in the CPI.", "Two of the three remaining members of the Boskin commission with whom we spoke told us that the expenditure weights should be updated more frequently than every 5 years. The other member, citing concern about resource constraints faced by BLS, gave preference to providing financial support to implement the Boskin commission\u2019s recommendations to improve the CPI, rather than funding a more frequent update of the market basket.", "The remaining three individuals we spoke with also supported a more frequent update than about every 10 years as a more accurate way to track inflation. One of them said that doing so would not necessarily lead to lower measures of inflation.", "In addition, although we did not interview the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, we noted that he stated in a speech, in March 1997, that there was a bias problem in the CPI given the failure to change the expenditure weights more often than about every 10 years. However, a representative of the Federal Reserve, in commenting on a draft of this report, said that although the Federal Reserve Chairman has said that out-of-date weights are a source of bias in the CPI, the Chairman does not endorse merely updating them more frequently. He said that the Chairman has testified before Congress in support of changes recommended by the Boskin commission, and that the payoff of departing from a fixed-weight structure of the CPI is likely to be much more important in improving the accuracy of the CPI than more frequent updating of expenditure weights alone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Practices of Other Industrial Countries", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, the United States is one of the seven leading industrial countries\u2014the G-7\u2014that have met to coordinate economic and monetary policy.

According to BLS, the estimated cost to update the expenditure weights in 2003 would be $3.1 million over a 3-year budget period. BLS reported that the 1987 major revision cost $47 million over 5 years.

These excluded activities include using recent decennial census data to reselect geographic areas and housing samples used in the CPI\u2019s surveys; evaluating, replacing, and updating CPI data processing systems; and recategorizing the items in the CPI market basket. The activities that BLS included in its estimated cost to update the expenditure weights included changing the weights of the items in the market basket, redefining the item strata in a limited way, and including any new items as a result of the limited redefinition of the item strata.

In making these estimates, both we and CBO assumed that there were no other changes in tax or spending levels and no other changes in the economy during the periods under review.", "BLS said the historical evidence suggests that shifting to a 5-year update of the market basket weights could reduce the annual rate of growth of the CPI by between 0 (zero) and 0.2 percentage point. Although CBO does not backcast, using a method discussed with it, we estimated that an update in 1992 would have reduced the federal budget deficit between $0 and $32.4 billion over the 6-year period until the implementation of the upcoming 1998 revision. According to CBO, an update in 2003 could increase the projected budget surplus between $0 and $20.2 billion over a 4-year period.", "Using estimates provided by CBO for an annual 0.1 percentage point reduction in CPI growth and assuming no other changes in policy or the economy, we estimated that the federal deficit would have been reduced by a cumulative total of $16.2 billion over the 6 years following an update in 1992. According to CBO, an update in 2003 in which CPI growth would be reduced annually by 0.1 percentage point and assuming that nothing else changed, the projected federal budget surplus would be increased by a cumulative total of $10.8 billion over the 4 years following the update.

However, implementation of the POPS still does not address the expenditure weights for the 206 item strata that remain fixed until the entire market basket is revised. A 5-year rotation in the POPS does improve the CPI in terms of keeping item samples current and introducing new goods, which also updates the point-of-purchase weights every 5 years.

In 1961, the then BLS Commissioner testified before a congressional committee that there was no evidence to support more frequent weight updates, and he cited a need for additional research.", "The preponderance of the data we reviewed does not support BLS\u2019 statement, as stated currently or in 1961, that there is insufficient empirical evidence to support the need for more frequent updating of expenditure weights. In his 1961 testimony, the then Commissioner cited three studies on which he based his conclusion, and each study covered a different group of years between 1925 and 1939. For the first two periods, the old weights produced less of a decline in prices than the new weights. For the last period, the old weights produced more of an increase in prices than the new weights. The differences between the indexes produced by the old and new weights were 0.1 percentage point, 1.2 percentage point, and 0.1 percentage point, respectively.", "In 1953, BLS revised the CPI and updated the expenditure weights. It applied the new weights to January through June 1953 consumer price data. In response to a presidential request, BLS also applied the weights used in the 1940 revision to the January through June 1953 price data. The index with the old weights showed an annual understatement of inflation of 0.5 percentage point in comparison with the index using the new weights. In his 1961 testimony, the BLS Commissioner explained that the 1953 comparisons were different from those previously described for 1925 through 1939. The differences that were found in the studies for the earlier years basically reflected changes in expenditure weights. He noted that the comparisons for the 1953 revision reflected factors, such as changes in cities in the CPI, in addition to expenditure weight changes.", "As shown and analyzed in appendix III, additional empirical evidence has become available since 1961 that also indicates that the measurement of inflation is affected by the age of the expenditure weights. For example, BLS estimates that when the upcoming 1998 revision is introduced, CPI growth will be lowered by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage point. In addition, we reviewed historical data from overlap studies in which BLS continued calculating the CPI with both the old and new weights for 6 months following a major revision. Although it is impossible to identify exactly to what extent other factors contributed to the differences, indexes produced by the old weights overstated inflation in comparison to those indexes produced by the new weights in the 1964 and 1987 overlap comparisons. The reverse was true in 1978, but that difference may have been due to a fundamental change in BLS procedures associated with the implementation of the POPS.", "Additional BLS studies of indexes that examine the effects of the age of expenditure weights include comparisons of indexes that were calculated with alternative 3-year base periods in which BLS compared the official CPI\u2019s 3-year base period of 1982 through 1984 with alternative 3-year periods since then. For example, the analysis for an update with a 1987 through 1989 base averaged 0.11 percentage point lower over a 5-year period than an index with the 1982 through 1984 base years. As a result of our examination of these and other BLS studies, we concluded that the best available evidence indicates that indexes with newer weights reduce the growth of the CPI by about 0.1 percentage point per year.", "Although theoretical guidance is not available on all facets of updating expenditure weights, such as exactly when to update, economic literature suggests that an index is more accurate if the expenditure weights used to compute it represent, as much as practical, current consumer spending. In addition, the Stigler committee in 1961 provided a commonsense principle on when to revise the weights: a revision is necessary when the weight base has changed appreciably. On the basis of the statements of individuals with whom we talked (see discussion of these views on pp. 11 to 13) and the CPI weight comparisons we reviewed (previously presented in this subsection and in greater detail in app. III), there is sufficient reason to believe that the weight base had changed appreciably before major revisions to the CPI.", "The BLS Commissioner pointed to using common sense and a cost-benefit analysis to provide guidance on how often to update the weights. At the time of the Stigler committee\u2019s report in 1961 and until the early 1970s, the CPI was used in a very limited way in the federal sector to index federal programs for the effects of inflation; the first large income program to be adjusted with the CPI was civil service retirement payments in 1962. Therefore, changes in the CPI had relatively little effect on federal expenditures and had no direct impact on federal receipts. In the 1990s, however, the federal government uses the CPI to index a much broader set of programs, including federal income tax brackets and certain federal payments, that directly affect a larger share of the population and a much larger volume of federal receipts and expenditures. These uses, in our view, provide a commonsense basis for making the index a more accurate reflection of what consumers are buying in a rapidly changing economy.", "Updating the expenditure weights more often appears to be supported from a cost-benefit standpoint as well. BLS estimated that it would cost $3.1 million over 3 years to update the expenditure weights in 2003. If the growth in the CPI decreased by 0.1 percentage point per year, CBO estimates show that this would lead to a cumulative total of a $10.8 billion increase in the projected budget surplus over the 4 years after the update.However, regardless of the effect on the budget, the point of doing an update outside of a major revision would be the increased value of having the CPI reflect, as closely as practical, the current spending patterns of consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["Funding for past major revisions has not always been easy to obtain.

A former BLS Commissioner with whom we spoke also identified funding as a problem. She said that funding for past major revisions was held up either within the Department of Labor, by OMB, or in the appropriations process.", "Even before the tenure of this former Commissioner, obtaining funds to revise the CPI was apparently a problem. In 1961, the then BLS Commissioner, in testifying before a congressional committee, explained that under the then present practice, revisions to the CPI were undertaken only when BLS was successful in convincing the Bureau of the Budget\u2014now OMB\u2014and Congress that there was an urgent need to bring the CPI up to date.", "BLS also has had difficulty in obtaining funds, apart from a major revision for improvements to the CPI in the early 1990s.

The current Commissioner said that, until the institution of the continuing CEX that allowed BLS to decrease the number of units surveyed and to make the CEX an ongoing program, an update of the weights every 5 years would have been costly because it would have required a special CEX. However, a continuing CEX program has been established, and, from a practical perspective, the first possible 5-year update of the weights using CEX data would have been in 1992, which is 5 years after the first CPI revision (1987) that used the continuing CEX data.", "The need to have the CPI reflect geographic movement of the population as measured by the decennial census was cited by BLS officials as a reason to make a major revision every 10 years.

In commenting on a draft of this report, the BLS Commissioner said that since superlative indexes can be published only with a representational lag because of the lack of current-period expenditure as well as price data, their use in the CPI is precluded. The CPI, she said, is produced monthly and revised only in unusual circumstances.", "Although BLS plans to begin publication of a superlative formula index in 2002, BLS officials stated that they also plan to continue to publish the fixed market basket CPIs. Therefore, those who use the CPI for escalation purposes would have to choose among the published CPIs, including the fixed market basket CPI.", "In addition, the federal government\u2019s use of the CPI is legislatively tied to the fixed market basket concept in some instances. For example, the U.S. tax code specifically identifies the use of the CPI-U for automatic inflation adjustments of federal income tax brackets and deductions for personal exemptions. Therefore, unless otherwise changed by legislation or unless BLS named its superlative index the CPI-U, the fixed market basket CPI would be used in these programs.", "The Boskin commission recommended that BLS replace the fixed market basket CPI with two new index formulas as follows: (1) an index that would be updated annually and revised historically to incorporate measurement improvements and (2) a monthly index that would be based on a \u201ctrailing\u201d 2- or 3-year average of CEX data. According to the Chairman of the Boskin commission, the annual index would use a true superlative index formula, whereas the monthly index would use a modified superlative index formula.

The Commissioner said that true superlative indexes cannot be produced in \u201creal time,\u201d or monthly, because they require current expenditure data, which are impossible to collect and process on a monthly basis. In July 1997, another BLS official told us that the superlative index that BLS plans to publish in 2002 may be (1) an annual number with a 2-year lag that, for example, would reflect inflation for the year 2000 or (2) a current measure that would be subject to revision as more current expenditure data become available. According to the BLS official, this second measure would not be considered a true superlative index until the more current expenditure information was incorporated.", "Although BLS has not decided on the construction of a superlative index, one approach or index formula it is considering is referred to as a Fisher Ideal superlative index. As explained in appendix IV, two different index values are combined to produce a Fisher Ideal superlative index. One of the two index values is based on the Laspeyres index formula, which is the formula used to produce the official CPI. In other words, values from the CPI\u2019s fixed market basket would be inputs to the Fisher Ideal index.

In August 1997, in commenting on a draft of this report, the BLS Commissioner said BLS was developing a new updating policy.

That clearly was the view of the Stigler committee in 1961 and of the Boskin commission in 1996.", "One step that BLS could take to advance that concept is to update the expenditure weights of the CPI more often than only during major revisions to the CPI. The current practice of updating weights only as part of a revision means that it is 10 years or more between updates of the expenditure weights; this appears too long to achieve a reasonable representation of current consumer spending. The BLS Commissioner said that she intuitively believed that 10 years between updates was too long. The two former BLS managers and eight CPI researchers with whom we spoke all believed that, conceptually, the weights should be updated more often than every 10 years. According to a BLS official and published information, other G-7 countries update expenditure weights more often than every 10 years.", "However, BLS has held for some time that, although 10 years between updates may seem inappropriate, there is no strong empirical evidence that suggests a connection between the age of the weights and the measurement of inflation. Our examination of BLS data, however, showed that the age of expenditure weights affects the measure of inflation. Although the data are not perfect and do not isolate the effects of using outdated expenditure weights, comparisons of price indexes employing BLS data with old and new weights indicate that price indexes computed with more current weights were always different than indexes computed with older weights. This result has been the case going back to comparisons made for the first revision in 1940. In addition, comparisons generally tend to show lower rates of inflation with indexes using newer weights.", "There are also reasons for making certain that the expenditure weights are, as much as practical, reflective of current consumer spending. Since 1962, the CPI has been legislatively connected to adjusting some benefit payments for inflation and more recently to adjusting federal tax brackets. As a result, any overstatement or understatement of inflation by the CPI can have a major impact on the federal budget. For example, if, beginning in 2003, CPI growth were annually reduced by 0.1 percentage point and all policies and the economy remained unchanged, CBO estimates that the federal budget surplus over the 4 years following 2003 would be cumulatively $10.8 billion higher.", "We recognize that gaining financial support for revising or improving the CPI has been a problem at times. We cannot predict the ease or difficulty BLS might have in getting funds to update the weights more often (e.g., $3.1 million over 3 years that BLS estimated it would need for an update in 2003).", "We also recognize that adjusting the weights more often does not have the highest priority among all commentators on the CPI. For example, the Boskin commission would rather see BLS replace the fixed market basket CPI with various types of superlative indexes. However, even if BLS published a superlative index, which it plans to do, the updating of the weights more often would remain significant because BLS does not view superlative indexes as replacements for the fixed market basket CPI. It plans to continue to publish the long-standing fixed market basket CPI. In addition, since BLS is still trying to address basic conceptual issues in designing the superlative-type index that it plans to publish in 2002, the uncertainty surrounding this planned index suggests to us that making the fixed market basket index as current and accurate as possible should be done."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that, as long as a fixed market basket CPI is published, the Commissioner of BLS should update the expenditure weights of the CPI\u2019s market basket of goods and services more frequently than every 10 years to make it more timely in its representation of consumer expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We sent a draft of this report to the Secretary of Labor, the Chair of CEA, the Director of OMB, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and requested comments from them or their designees.

However, the Commissioner said neither economic theory nor empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of any particular update interval. She said that BLS needs to consider carefully what frequency will yield the most accurate CPI and best support the many uses of the index. There are, she said, a number of practical questions related to developing a new updating policy that BLS must address. BLS is currently studying these questions but, she said, the ultimate decision rests largely on commonsense judgment. Finally, the Commissioner emphasized that BLS will not evaluate potential changes to calculating the CPI on whether they raise or lower the measured rate of price change. Rather, BLS will evaluate potential changes on whether they produce a more accurate index.  We agree with the Commissioner\u2019s statement that potential changes to the CPI should be predicated on whether they produce a more accurate index. The Commissioner was silent as to whether the new policy would direct an expenditure weight update between major revisions, which have been every 10 years or so. Although we cannot say exactly how often the expenditure weights should be updated, the evidence we reviewed suggested that updating only once every 10 years or so was insufficient.

However, OMB believed that BLS should consider more frequent updating in context with other potential improvements. The Associate Director pointed out that substitution bias would remain in a Laspeyres-type index even with more frequent updating of expenditure weights. The CPI is a Laspeyres-type index.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s designee, the Assistant Director and Chief of the Economic Activity Section, Division of Research and Statistics, said in a July 31, 1997, letter (see app. VIII) that the draft report addressed a very important public policy issue. He said that more frequent updating of the expenditure weights would be desirable absent other actions to improve the CPI\u2019s accuracy. However, other changes to the CPI, such as those recommended by the Boskin commission, may do more to improve the CPI\u2019s accuracy. He said our recommendation for more frequent updating seemed to be only a \u201csecond-best\u201d solution, which the Federal Reserve did not endorse. The \u201cfirst-best\u201d solution, he said, is for BLS to depart from the fixed-weight structure of the CPI. \u201cEconomic theory provides an elegant rationale for the use of superlative index formulas . . . to provide approximations to a cost-of-living index. . . . The unfortunate limitation of superlative formulas is that their calculation requires current-period expenditure as well as price data, so superlative indexes can be published only with a lag.

Both cited one estimate (0.04 percentage point reduction) from a February 1997 research paper written by a BLS official to support their concern. We believe we have not overstated the potential effect. We report that a 5-year update of the expenditure weights could reduce the CPI\u2019s rate of growth by between 0 (zero) and 0.2 percentage point per year. This range was estimated by BLS on the basis of historical evidence, which was provided in this February 1997 research paper. BLS has raised no second thoughts to us about the reasonableness of this range. For example, BLS did not question the range in commenting on our draft report. As we report in appendix III, the BLS research paper provided a number of different point estimates that are based on regression analyses, overlap comparisons, and other studies. The regression analysis from which the 0.04 percentage point estimate was derived found evidence of a small effect\u2014rather than no effect\u2014on measured inflation.

Of these eight individuals, one was a member of the Stigler committee; four were members of the Boskin commission; one had developed a superlative index theory that BLS was considering in connection with the CPI; and two had studied the Boskin commission\u2019s report. These latter three researchers were recommended to us by the Boskin commission members we interviewed or others because their views were neutral or differed from the Boskin commission\u2019s position on the amount of bias in the CPI. We also reviewed public statements made by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System concerning the frequency of updating the CPI. To obtain information on the practices followed by other industrialized countries in updating their consumer price indexes, which also addresses our first objective, we obtained information from BLS and from publications of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Canadian government on how often the G-7 countries update their CPIs.", "To estimate the cost to BLS of updating the CPI on a 5-year cycle, our second objective, we asked BLS to provide us with certain actual and estimated cost data. We asked BLS to provide us with the costs associated with the last major revision of the CPI, which took place in 1987, and the projected costs for the 1998 revision. In addition, we asked BLS for its estimate of what the costs would have been to update the CPI in 1992 and its estimate of what the cost might be to update the CPI in 2003. In other words, we asked BLS to provide cost data for a prior revision (1987), a planned revision (1998), and two updates (1992 and 2003). The interval between 1992 and 1998 is 6 years rather than 5 years, but that difference was unavoidable given that a major revision is scheduled for 1998. We did not specify to BLS what assumptions to make or what items to include or exclude in estimating costs for 1992, 1998, and 2003. We did not evaluate the reasonableness of BLS\u2019 assumptions or estimates.", "BLS provided cost data for the 1987 revision, the upcoming 1998 revision, and a 2003 update. BLS suggested that the cost for a 1992 update could be derived by deflating the cost of the 2003 update. For this conversion, we compared the Object Class 11 index published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is used to adjust pay categories, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) price index as determined by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is used to adjust all other budget categories. We found minor differences between using the two deflators and chose to use the GDP price index, which, in comparison to the Object Class 11 deflator, led to a slight overstatement of the cost and, in reference to our cost-benefit comparison, provided a conservative estimate.", "To address our third objective\u2014estimate the dollar effect on the federal budget if the CPI weights were updated on a 5-year cycle\u2014we obtained assistance from BLS and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). We asked BLS to estimate whether the CPI would go up or down as the result of a 5-year update. More specifically, we asked BLS to provide a range\u2014an upper percentage point and a lower percentage point\u2014of the possible change that could occur to the CPI with a 5-year update.", "To gauge the reasonableness of estimates that BLS provided, we compared them with the results of BLS\u2019 overlap studies of old and new weights during the first 6 months of major revisions and other BLS studies that examined the impact of more frequent updates. The results of these comparisons are reported in appendix III.", "We then asked CBO to estimate the effects that a 5-year update of the CPI in 2003 would have on federal outlays, revenues, debt service, and the overall budget, assuming no other changes in tax or spending levels and no other changes in the economy. To do this, we asked CBO to use BLS\u2019 lower and upper estimates and the midpoint of these estimates of change in the CPI that would result from a 5-year update. To illustrate the effect of a 5-year update that would begin in 2003, we asked CBO first to apply its standard projections for the years 2004 through 2007; the results represented CBO\u2019s baseline. CBO then made additional projections for the years 2004 to 2007 to account for changes in the CPI as estimated by BLS for a 5-year update, and we compared these projections against CBO\u2019s baseline. To adjust the CPI for the effects of a 5-year update of the expenditure weights, CBO reduced its estimated CPI by 0.2 percentage point, which BLS had estimated could be the upper estimate of change in the CPI from a 5-year update. The difference between the baseline and the adjusted CPI estimates was reported by us as the upper estimate of the dollar effect of a 5-year update on the federal budget. Similar estimates and calculations were made with the midpoint\u20140.1 percentage point\u2014of BLS\u2019 estimate. No further estimates and calculations from the baseline were necessary to account for BLS\u2019 lower estimate of change, which was 0 (zero).", "We also reported these estimates in footnote 23 of this report in 1997 constant dollars by applying the GDP price index. We calculated the 1997 constant-dollar amounts using the GDP price index. Dollar amounts for years other than the base year (1997) were adjusted for the effect of inflation with the GDP price index. These adjustments had the effect of increasing the amounts for the years before 1997 and of decreasing the amounts for the years after 1997.", "CBO would provide projections for current and future years but not provide estimates for past years. Therefore, after discussion with CBO, we estimated how the federal budget deficit might have been affected if the expenditure weights were updated in 1992. In making our estimates, we assumed that there were no other changes in tax or spending levels and no other changes in the economy for 1992 through 2007. We also assumed that the economic trend that was found for the years 1998 through 2007 could be reasonably applied to the years 1993 through 1998.", "We first replicated CBO\u2019s estimates for outlays and revenues that are affected by the CPI for 1998 through 2007 from projections for the relevant categories published in CBO\u2019s Economic and Budget Outlook in January 1997. We then asked CBO to follow the previously described methodology and to make estimates of a 0.1 percentage point reduction in the CPI beginning in 1997 and 2002. We also replicated CBO\u2019s estimates of a 1.0 percentage point change in the CPI on the federal deficit that was published in January 1997 and adjusted the estimates to represent a 0.1 percentage point reduction. We then compared the effects of these two estimates on revenues and outlays and found significant differences in the revenue estimates that were due to rounding rules for tax revenues. We chose to use CBO\u2019s published 1.0 percentage point estimates that were adjusted to represent a 0.1 percentage point reduction rather than those that were calculated for us by CBO because the published 1.0 percentage point estimates that were adjusted to represent a 0.1 reduction provided a more conservative estimate, as well as a smooth trend. The effects from the adjusted 1.0 percentage point reduction were then applied to the outlay and revenue totals that are affected by changes in the CPI in each year from 1993 to 1998. Debt service costs were calculated from the year-to-year change in CBO\u2019s baseline debt, less the saving from changes in outlays and revenues. The current-dollar estimates derived from these calculations were adjusted with the GDP price index to 1997 constant dollars. The estimates for the 0.1 percentage point reduction were doubled to obtain estimates for a 0.2 percentage point reduction in the CPI. We met with CBO to discuss our approach, and CBO staff stated that the method and results appeared reasonable.", "In connection with the effect on the federal budget, we asked the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to estimate the effect a change in the CPI would have on the average benefit paid to retired workers. Your office had requested that we obtain this information to illustrate how a federal revenue or payment program that is adjusted periodically because of changes in the CPI might be indirectly affected by more frequent updating of the expenditure weights. To make the estimate, we asked SSA to use the midpoint of BLS\u2019 range of possible change that would occur to the CPI with a 5-year update. Using that midpoint percentage point and the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 1998 Budget assumptions, SSA estimated the change in the average monthly benefit, beginning with December 2003, which would be payable in January 2004, and continued through December 2007.", "Our fourth objective had the following two elements: (1) identify the reasons for the 10 years or so between revisions and (2) assess those reasons. For the first element, we interviewed present and past officials of BLS and obtained their views on why major updates to the CPI have been spaced about 10 years apart. Among the officials we interviewed were the present Commissioner of BLS and a former Commissioner of BLS. We also reviewed the 1961 congressional testimony of another BLS Commissioner in which he addressed the subject of BLS\u2019 timetable for revising the CPI. In our assessment of BLS\u2019 reasons, we (1) collected and analyzed information on past comparisons between indexes that applied old and new expenditure weights, which were also used to address the reasonableness of BLS\u2019 estimates under our third objective; (2) obtained information on how BLS collects its source data for the CPI; (3) obtained BLS fiscal year 1998 budget information to ascertain BLS\u2019 plans for future changes in its indexes; and (4) compared the estimated costs and benefits of a 5-year CPI update cycle obtained under our second and third objectives.", "In our assessment of past comparisons between indexes that applied old and new weights, we noted that the indexes reflect differences in addition to those directly related to changes in expenditure weights, such as conceptual changes in the structure of the market basket. These differences are a result of data limitations in that the overlap periods incorporate many factors that can be changed in a revision. With this knowledge, we treated the differences as indicators of the effect of an update of the expenditure weights because an update of the weights is unlikely to occur in isolation from the other factors that are associated with revisions. For example, a 1992 update would have incorporated a market basket that would have been based on different geographic areas because changes were made in 1986 in the geographic locations where expenditure data were collected. Such geographic changes are associated with major revisions.", "In addition to reviewing overlap studies, we examined the effect of the age of weights with indexes that were calculated with alternative base periods. For example, comparisons were made of the official CPI\u2019s 3-year base of 1982 through 1984 with alternative 3-year base periods (i.e., 1987 through 1989). In these and other comparisons, we applied an economic concept that is based upon economic literature that suggests that an index is more accurate if the expenditure weights used to compute it represent, as much as practical, current consumer spending.", "As previously reported, this report includes, and often relies on, estimates and comparisons prepared by BLS, CBO, or SSA.

In addition, the estimates and comparisons were within the scope of activities that BLS, CBO, and SSA normally perform. Therefore, we used their estimates and comparisons.", "Our work was designed to examine the importance of updating the CPI sooner than about once every 10 years. The results we obtained are intended to contribute to the discussion of how often the CPI should be updated but are not intended to represent all future effects of shortening the updating cycle.

The Director said that the goods and services in the PCE do not all correspond to those in the CPI on a one-to-one basis and that, in adjusting items in the PCE, BEA uses many different price indexes in addition to the CPI.", "The BEA Director said he was more concerned with the potential effect of an experimental CPI that BLS began publishing in April 1997. To address lower-level substitution bias, BLS is using a different formula on an experimental basis to aggregate the 94,000 items for which prices are collected each month into the 206 item strata. (See footnote 14 in the background section of this report.) This experimental index does not involve the subject of this report\u2014weighting the 206 item strata for aggregation. The Director said that if and when BLS introduces this change on a permanent basis, changing the aggregation of items at the lower level is more likely to affect BEA\u2019s work than changing the frequency of expenditure weights of the CPI. 2.We agree with the clarifications that OMB suggested and have made them throughout the report. The changes make clear that the 0.1 percentage point and the 0.2 percentage point are each an annual reduction in the growth of the CPI, and that the estimates of the effect of such reductions on the federal budget are cumulative totals. 3.The dollar estimates that CBO provided to us and that were included in our draft report factored in the rounding rules for income tax brackets. As suggested by OMB, we discussed with CBO whether it should provide additional estimates without these rounding rules. In essence, the CBO staff with whom we spoke said that setting aside the rounding rules would not produce estimates that differed much from the estimates in the draft.", "According to the staff, the rounding rules would affect which year departed from the trend over the number of years studied, but the cumulative dollars over those years would not change. For that reason, we did not ask CBO to produce additional estimates; therefore, the estimates that appeared in the draft report also appear in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Federal Reserve\u2019s letter dated July 31, 1997."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.We agree with the Federal Reserve\u2019s comment that the recent paper by Shapiro and Wilcox supported the conclusion in the Greenlees paper that more frequent updating of expenditure weights will not reduce upper-level substitution bias. However, there was a certain data limitation identified in the Greenlees paper, which is probably applicable to the Shapiro and Wilcox paper. This data limitation raised questions in our minds about the conclusions Greenlees and Shapiro and Wilcox drew from their comparisons derived from these data. Each paper compared a price index that was based on 1982 through 1984 expenditure data with a price index that was based on 1986 and later expenditure data. We believe that what Greenlees identified as a potential explanation for the contrasts between the two price indexes\u2014the incorporation of the 1980 census-based geographic samples into the CEX in 1986\u2014could have also affected the Shapiro and Wilcox results, which was a factor their paper did not consider. We should also point out as well that BLS, for purposes of this report, estimated that the growth in the CPI could be reduced from 0 to 0.2 percentage point per year with a 5-year update of expenditure weights. In addition, Shapiro and Wilcox indicated that the trends they found in their research study were not the trends they expected. Referring to these as \u201celusive empirical puzzles,\u201d they called for additional research in this area of bias in the CPI. 2.We talked with BEA\u2019s Director and its Chief Statistician about the Federal Reserve\u2019s comment concerning the revision history of its chained price index. We specifically asked about BEA\u2019s use of the \u201cLaspeyres tail\u201d in its chained price index and if BEA had any estimates that are based on its experience with this methodology that would indicate how much routine updating of expenditure weights might matter. (Since the index with the Laspeyres tail used fixed weights and the revised chained price index used a Fisher Ideal formula, which is more reflective of current consumer spending, the amount of difference between the two price indexes could indicate the level of effect that would occur with a more frequent updating of expenditure weights.)", "The Chief Statistician said that he had looked at the difference between the two price indexes and that using the Laspeyres tail appeared to have a very small effect, but he had not calculated the size of its effect apart from other factors that were also changed when the index was revised. He believed these other factors probably had made a greater contribution to the difference between the two indexes than changing the price index formula."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Consumer Price Index: Cost-of-Living Concepts and the Housing and Medical Care Components (GAO/GGD-96-166, Aug. 26, 1996).", "Economic Statistics: Status Report on the Initiative to Improve Economic Statistics (GAO/GGD-95-98, July 7, 1995).", "Economic Statistics: Measurement Problems Can Affect the Budget and Economic Policymaking (GAO/GGD-95-99, May 2, 1995).", "Prescription Drug Prices: Official Index Overstates Producer Price Inflation (GAO/HEHS-95-90, Apr. 28, 1995).", "Developing a Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (GAO/T-GGD-87-22, June 29, 1987).", "Stabilizing Social Security\u2014Which Wage Measure Would Best Align Benefit Increases With Revenue Increases?
