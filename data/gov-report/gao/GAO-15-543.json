DOD defines an insider threat as the threat that an insider will use her or his authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the security of the United States.", "House report 113-446 included a provision that GAO review DOD's antiterrorism and force protection efforts to address insider threats. This report evaluates the extent to which DOD has (1) reflected insider threat considerations in its force protection policies and other guidance, (2) shared actions that U.S. installations have taken to protect against insider threats, and (3) implemented recommendations from the official reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings. GAO reviewed official reviews from the shootings, DOD force protection\u2013related policies, interviewed agency officials, and visited eight nongeneralizable U.S. installations representing all four military services, a joint base, and different geographic locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, the Department of Defense (DOD) has made efforts to update 7 of 10 key force protection\u2013related policy and guidance documents and is taking steps to revise the remaining 3 to incorporate insider threat considerations. DOD's Fort Hood independent review recommended that the department develop policy and procedures to integrate disparate efforts to protect DOD resources and people against internal threats. GAO also found that DOD does not have a policy for when it would be appropriate for DOD military and contractor personnel to report to DOD base security officials when an individual is observed carrying a weapon on an installation, especially into a work environment. Senior DOD officials acknowledged this policy gap and agreed to take steps to address the issue.", "Officials from the eight U.S. installations GAO visited identified actions taken to protect against insider threats. However, DOD has not consistently shared information across the department about the actions it has taken. DOD has issued guidance and recommendations addressing the 2009 Fort Hood shooting stating that DOD should identify and share leading practices to enhance the department's ability to protect the force. For example, installation officials have trained response personnel on active shooter training and piloted a workplace violence risk assessment program. However, DOD is not sharing all the information about such actions because DOD officials are not consistently using existing mechanisms to share information, such as lessons-learned information systems and antiterrorism web portals. Unless the military services consistently use existing mechanisms to share information on insider threats, U.S. installations may miss opportunities to enhance the department's ability to protect the force against such threats.", "DOD has taken actions to implement the recommendations from the official reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings. However, GAO was unable to identify the number of the 79 Fort Hood recommendations that were fully implemented because DOD has received inconsistent information from the military services and has conducted limited monitoring of recommendation implementation. For example, DOD and military service officials provided differing responses to a questionnaire on the implementation status of some Fort Hood recommendations. In addition, officials from three military services stated that they generally do not monitor the implementation of the recommendations from the Fort Hood independent review at the installation level. Until DOD and the military services improve the consistency of reporting and monitoring of the implementation of recommendations, DOD will be unable to know whether the deficiencies identified in the official review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting have been addressed. With regard to the official reviews from the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting, DOD has taken initial actions towards implementing the four recommendations prioritized by the Secretary of Defense. For example, DOD issued an implementation plan that identifies milestones, timelines, and resource requirements needed to address the four recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD consistently use existing mechanisms to share information about actions taken to protect against threats, and take steps to improve the consistency of reporting and monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations from the 2009 Fort Hood review.

DOD defines an insider threat as the threat that an insider  will use her or his authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm  to the security of the United States. Two incidents on U.S. installations  drew nationwide attention about insider threats. On November 5, 2009, a  lone Army officer shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 others on- base at Fort Hood, Texas. Almost 4 years later, on September 16, 2013,  a Navy contractor killed 12 civilian employees and contractors and  wounded 4 others at the Washington Navy Yard, D.C. Insiders have  significant advantages over others who intend to harm an organization  because insiders may have an awareness of their organization\u2019s  vulnerabilities, such as loosely enforced policies and procedures, or  exploitable security measures.", "Over the years, we have completed a number of reviews related to insider  threats. Our past work in 2012 and 2013 on insider threats in Afghanistan  reported on the causes of, and safeguards against, insider attacks in  Afghanistan and highlighted the need for improved sharing of biometric  information and assessment of insider attacks. More recently, we  reported on DOD\u2019s efforts to protect its classified information and systems  from insider threats and recommended that the department identify an  insider threat program office and issue guidance that would assist DOD  components in developing and strengthening insider threat programs.  DOD concurred or partially concurred with our recommendations, stating,  among other things, that it will publish a detailed implementation plan in  2015 to assist components in implementing multiple actions required in all  insider threat programs.", "The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a  provision that we review DOD\u2019s antiterrorism and force protection efforts  to address insider threats.

We selected the 10 key policies and  other guidance because they were referenced in DOD documents  including the department\u2019s insider threat directive and the DOD  independent and internal reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013  Washington Navy Yard shootings. We also verified that these 10 policies  and other guidance are key to addressing force protection across the  department with officials within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security (OASD)  and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. We  reviewed the key policies and other guidance to determine whether DOD  had incorporated findings and recommendations from the 2009 Fort Hood  independent review related to updating department guidance or  incorporated training requirements identified in the National Insider Threat  Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat  Programs. We also reviewed DOD Instruction 5025.01, DOD Issuances  Program, to determine DOD\u2019s policies for developing and updating its  policies and guidance. We interviewed officials within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the military services (the Army, Navy, Marine  Corps, and Air Force) to obtain their perspectives on DOD force  protection policy and its application to addressing insider threats.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has shared actions that U.S.  installations have taken to protect against insider threats, we selected and  conducted site visits at eight nongeneralizable U.S. installations based on  whether an installation had a known insider attack since 2009, proximity  to other U.S. military installations where known insider attacks occurred,  military service representation, joint basing, and geographic  representation. Although findings from these eight installations are not  generalizable to all installations, they provide context about the actions  taken by these selected installations to protect against insider threats.  The installations that we selected and visited are: Fort Hood, Texas; Rock  Island Arsenal, Illinois; Washington Navy Yard, D.C.; Naval Submarine  Base New London, Connecticut; Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado;  Joint Base San Antonio, Texas; Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia;  and the Pentagon, Virginia. From these site visits, we reviewed  installation exercise information and after-action reports as well as DOD  policies and guidance on antiterrorism, force protection, and lessons  learned. We compared information gathered from installation officials on  actions taken at their respective installations to DOD guidance containing  recommendations for promoting information sharing on actions to protect  against insider threats and to federal internal control standards for sharing  information within an organization. We also interviewed officials at these  installations to discuss efforts to address insider threats at their respective  installations. In addition, we conducted interviews with officials from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence,  OASD(HD&GS), and each of the military services to identify actions that  the department and military services had taken to address insider threats,  such as identifying and sharing any actions to address insider threats.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has implemented recommendations  from the official reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013 Washington  Navy Yard shootings, we evaluated the actions that DOD components  had taken in response to reviews that either the Secretary of Defense or  Secretary of Navy tasked appropriate DOD components to take as a  result of these shootings. Specifically, for the 2009 Fort Hood shooting,  we considered the DOD independent review commissioned by the  Secretary of Defense and the service internal reviews. Similarly, we  considered the DOD internal review and the independent review\u2014both of  which were directed by the Secretary of Defense as \u201cofficial reviews\u201d for  the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting. We developed and  administered questionnaires to the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence and OASD(HD&GS) to gather their responses on  the status of implementation of the recommendations. For comparison  purposes, we administered the same questionnaires to the military  services on the implementation of the DOD independent and internal  reviews and any internal reviews that the services may have conducted,  and compared the results of these questionnaires to responses provided  by OASD(HD&GS). During this comparison, we found some  inconsistencies between questionnaire responses provided by  OASD(HD&GS) and the questionnaire responses provided by the military  services regarding the implementation of recommendations from the  official review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. We also found limitations  in the monitoring of recommendation implementation from that review and  are making a recommendation to DOD to improve monitoring. In addition,  we consulted with the DOD Office of Inspector General and the Army  Audit Agency\u2014both of which were conducting similar reviews during our  engagement. We also interviewed DOD officials, DOD working groups,  and service officials with knowledge of the recommendations and actions  that have been identified or taken to address recommendations from the  DOD independent and internal reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013  Washington Navy Yard shootings.

The results of this independent review, which were  released in January 2010, identified 79 recommendations that the  department could take to address findings associated with personnel  policies, force protection, emergency and mass casualty response, and  support to DOD healthcare providers. In response to the 2013  Washington Navy Yard shooting, the Secretary of Defense directed an  independent review and an internal review of the incident to identify and  recommend actions to address gaps or deficiencies in DOD programs,  policies, or procedures regarding security at DOD installations and the  granting and renewing of security clearances for DOD employees and  contractor personnel. Both the Washington Navy Yard independent  review and internal review were released in November 2013 and  identified actions that were intended to improve DOD\u2019s force protection  posture from insider threats. In March 2014, the Secretary of Defense  directed DOD to implement four key recommendations that were a  compilation of a number of recommendations from the Washington Navy  Yard independent review and internal review.

The Army reinitiated  its antiterrorism conference in 2015 and an Air Force official told us  that the service is considering merging antiterrorism and other force  protection issues into a mission assurance conference going forward.", "Lessons-learned information systems. The Joint Staff and each of  the military services have established information systems to  exchange information on lessons from training, exercises, and combat  operations across the department. However, military service and  installation officials told us they do not consistently use joint or military  service lessons-learned information systems. Officials told us they do  not use these systems because they believed the information within  the systems focuses more on military combat operations, there is not  a requirement to use the systems to share information on insider  threats, and there is limited time or desire to use the systems. When  we examined the joint lessons-learned information system, we found  examples of information contained in the system that installations  could use to enhance their efforts to protect against insider threats.  For example, we found two after-action reports that highlight lessons  learned on active shooter exercises conducted at two installations  within the United States.", "Antiterrorism web-based portals. The Joint Staff established an  antiterrorism web-based, secure portal in 2003 to provide a  collaborative environment for the DOD community to share  antiterrorism and force protection information with the military  services, combatant commands, and other DOD agencies. The portal  contains links to various antiterrorism organizations, communities, and  other force protection portals. However, service and installation  officials told us they either were not aware of or did not use the Joint  Staff\u2019s antiterrorism portal. Marine Corps and Army officials told us  that they use their service-specific antiterrorism portals. When we  examined the Army\u2019s antiterrorism enterprise portal we found  examples of information contained in the system that installations  could use to enhance their efforts to protect against insider threats.  For example, the Army\u2019s antiterrorism enterprise portal contained  documentation on mitigating insider threats and antiterrorism best  practices.", "DOD guidance and recommendations issued after the 2009 Fort Hood  shooting state that DOD should identify and share leading practices to  enhance the department\u2019s ability to protect the force. For example, DOD\u2019s  joint guidance on antiterrorism states that after-action reports and lessons  learned should be shared with other units and defense components.  Also, in 2014, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that  the department share innovative measures to prevent and respond to  attacks similar to those at Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard.  Further, the independent review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting  encouraged the department to identify best practices to enhance the  department\u2019s ability to protect the force. Similarly, in 2015, we reported  that DOD components did not have or use a formalized process to  develop, disseminate, and incorporate best practices and lessons learned  in their insider-threat program. According to federal internal control  standards, communication and information sharing should occur in a  broad sense with information flowing down, across, and up an  organization with management ensuring there are adequate means of  communicating with, and obtaining information from, external  stakeholders who may have a significant effect on the achievement of  goals. Unless the military services share information across the  department on insider threats by consistently using existing mechanisms,  U.S. installations may miss opportunities to enhance the department\u2019s  ability to protect the force against such threats."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Is in the Process of Implementing Recommendations from the 2009 and 2013 Official Reviews, but Inconsistent Reporting and Limited Monitoring Prevent Status Assessment", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken actions to implement the recommendations from the  official reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013 Washington Navy Yard  shootings; however, we were unable to identify the number of Fort Hood  recommendations fully implemented because DOD and the military  services had inconsistently reported this information and have conducted  limited monitoring of recommendation implementation. DOD, as well as  the Navy and Marine Corps, have also taken initial actions towards  implementing the recommendations that were tasked by the Secretary of  Defense and the Secretary of the Navy in response to the official reviews  of the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting.

For example, in response to recommendations stemming  from the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, DOD revised policies in areas such as  suspicious activity reporting, counterintelligence, and emergency  management. In September 2014, as part of its effort to address a  recommendation that DOD integrate its disparate efforts to defend  against internal threats, DOD established policy and assigned  responsibilities for a DOD insider threat program. Also, in response to a  recommendation to examine the feasibility of advancing procurement and  deployment of mass warning systems, military service officials informed  us that they were provided with additional funding to install mass  notification systems and enhanced 911 systems. In response to our  questionnaire provided to DOD and the services on the implementation of  recommendations, DOD reported the Marine Corps installed mass  notification systems at all of its installations, and the Navy and Air Force  installed the systems at over 90 percent of their installations. DOD also  reported that the Army fielded mass notification systems at locations that  provide warning to over 80 percent of Army personnel. Likewise, DOD  reported that all the services have installed enhanced 911 capabilities to  varying degrees at their installations. For example, the Marine Corps  installed enhanced 911 capabilities at all its installations, whereas the  Army has completed fielding at 18 installations covering 54 percent of its  population, and the Air Force has established enhanced 911 capabilities  at 71 installations covering 64 percent of its population. The Navy  reported that it has been hampered in fielding enhanced 911 systems at  its installations because of aging infrastructure, among other factors, but  expects to have enhanced 911 systems on its installations by September  2015.", "In December 2014, the ASD(HD&GS) directed the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Defense Continuity & Mission Assurance to visit  a sampling of installations to determine the effectiveness of policies  issued since the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. In response to this tasking, the  Deputy Assistant Secretary assembled key personnel from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense staff, to include the Under Secretaries of  Defense for Intelligence, for Personnel and Readiness, and for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Joint Staff; the military  services; and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to conduct these  courtesy visits. According to OASD(HD&GS) officials, the team completed  visits to the four selected installations\u2014Joint Base Andrews, Maryland;  Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; and  Naval Station Mayport, Florida\u2014by June 2015. In commenting on a draft  of this report, DOD stated that the Mission Assurance Senior Steering  Group plans to share best practices and lessons learned gathered from  these site visits to strengthen DOD insider threat efforts and help prevent  future tragedies such as the Fort Hood shootings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Reporting of Information and Limited Monitoring Hampers an Assessment of Fort Hood Recommendation Implementation", "paragraphs": ["DOD reported that, as of March 2015, the department had fully  implemented 73 of the 79 recommendations identified in the Fort Hood  independent review\u2014and approved by the Secretary of Defense\u2014and  was taking actions on the other 6 recommendations. However, we were  unable to confirm the number of recommendations fully implemented  because DOD and the military services were inconsistently reporting  information and had conducted limited monitoring of recommendation  implementation. Specifically, we found the following:  Inconsistent reporting of recommendation implementation.  Although DOD officials told us that as many as 73 of the 79  recommendations from the review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting had  been closed as implemented, we were unable to verify these had  been implemented because DOD and the military services provided  us inconsistent reporting of recommendations implemented. We  identified the following two factors as potentially contributing to DOD\u2019s  inconsistent reporting of recommendations implemented. First, the  military services reported the status of recommendations based on  service-level implementation rather than department-level  implementation. For example, in response to a recommendation for  the department to revise current policies and procedures to address  preventing violence toward others in the workplace, DOD closed the  recommendation as implemented by issuing a policy on workplace  violence prevention and response in January 2014. However, the  Army and the Air Force reported that they were still taking action to  address this recommendation based on the need to update their  service-level implementing policies. Second, DOD reported that it  closed recommendations that were partially under way, although the  services reported such actions as in progress. DOD reported that it  closed 10 recommendations that the military services were tasked to  lead or support on behalf of the department even though all the  military services reported they had not fully implemented the 10  recommendations. For example, DOD reported that it had closed a  recommendation that the services were to review senior medical  officers\u2019 requirements to optimize utilization and assignments. While  three services reported to us that they had implemented this  recommendation, one service reported that it had not completed  implementation. Similarly, DOD reported closing a recommendation  that the services were to update policies to reflect current DOD-level  guidance on the release of protected health information. While two  services reported to us that they had implemented this  recommendation, the other two services reported that they had not  completed implementation. Further, according to DOD officials, DOD  reported closing recommendations based on preliminary rather than  final actions taken by DOD. For example, in response to a  recommendation to improve efforts for sharing access control  information, DOD stated it was developing a new guidance document;  however, this guidance document is still in draft form and has not  gone through the Federal Register process, according to DOD  officials. Therefore, this recommendation should not have been  considered fully implemented by DOD.", "The Army Audit Agency and the DOD Inspector General cited similar  concerns in three recent reports about the reliability of the status of  Fort Hood recommendation implementation. In December 2012, the  Army Audit Agency issued a report that assessed the Army  headquarters\u2019 progress in implementing recommendations from  DOD\u2019s review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. The Army Audit  Agency concluded that the intentions of 13 recommendations  stemming from the 2009 Fort Hood shooting were not met by the  Army, and recommended that the Army reopen the recommendations  and continue to monitor implementation. A February 2015 Army  Audit Agency report, which examined whether nine selected Army  installations had sufficiently implemented 18 selected Fort Hood  recommendations, also noted that the Army may have prematurely  closed 4 recommendations in addition to the 13 recommendations  identified in the 2012 audit. The Army Audit Agency also found only  1 of 18 selected recommendations from the review of the 2009 Fort  Hood shooting was fully implemented at the nine Army installations  that the agency visited even though 11 of the 18 recommendations  had been closed by the Army. In discussions with officials from the  DOD Office of Inspector General about their ongoing review of DOD\u2019s  workplace violence prevention program, the DOD Inspector General  found that DOD has not developed a comprehensive workplace  violence prevention program, which resulted in the military services  and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency using different approaches  to address workplace violence. DOD Office of Inspector General  officials told us this occurred, in part, because DOD did not exercise  sufficient oversight to ensure the Fort Hood and Defense Science  Board recommendations were properly addressed and closed.", "Limited monitoring. We also were unable to confirm the number of  Fort Hood recommendations implemented because DOD and the  military services have conducted limited monitoring of the status of  recommendations from the review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting.  DOD has established a mechanism and process for reviewing the  status of recommendations at the department level. Specifically, the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Continuity and  Mission Assurance has convened monthly meetings for the Mission  Assurance Coordination Boards\u2019 Fort Hood Working Group to monitor  implementation of the remaining Fort Hood recommendations.  According to OASD(HD&GS) officials, the Fort Hood Working Group  provides regular briefings to the Mission Assurance Coordination  Boards\u2019 senior leaders and they discuss whether specific  recommendations should be closed as implemented or remain open  as an effort in continued progress. However, we found that DOD was  not monitoring implementation of the Fort Hood recommendations at  the military service and installation levels. Specifically, officials from  OASD(HD&GS) told us that DOD\u2014through the Mission Assurance  Coordination Boards\u2014has not been monitoring implementation of  actions from military service follow-on reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood  shooting. According to the 2013 DOD Mission Assurance Strategy  Implementation Framework, the Mission Assurance Coordination  Boards\u2019 initial objectives included ensuring completion of all Fort Hood  independent review activities as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  In 2010, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum that tasked  the ASD(HD&GS)\u2014one of two key leaders of the Mission Assurance  Coordination Boards\u2014to report on progress made by the military  services. Officials from OASD(HD&GS) told us they did not monitor  the progress of the military services\u2019 efforts to take action based on  their internal reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and that they  believed the services were in the best position to report on their  progress on implementing recommendations. However, these  officials acknowledged that the Assistant Secretary\u2019s monitoring  responsibility was never removed by the Secretary of Defense. Also,  while OASD(HD&GS) officials believe that services are in the best  position to report on their progress on implementing  recommendations, we found that the services were not consistently  monitoring the implementation of recommendations at their installation  levels. For example, service headquarters officials from three services  told us that they generally do not monitor implementation of the  recommendations from the reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting at  the installation level. As previously stated, a February 2015 Army  Audit Agency report found that the Army had prematurely closed  recommendations related to the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, based on  the Army Audit Agency\u2019s review of implementation of 18 selected Fort  Hood recommendations at nine selected installations. Officials from  OASD(HD&GS) acknowledged that periodic reports from the military  services would provide the Mission Assurance Coordination Boards  with a more complete understanding of the extent to which the military  services have implemented the recommendations from the 2009 Fort  Hood shooting.", "According to federal internal control standards, program managers need  operational data to determine whether they are meeting their agencies\u2019  goals for accountability and such pertinent information should be  identified, captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that permits  people to perform their duties efficiently. Internal control standards also  state that monitoring of internal control should assess the quality of  performance over time and ensure that the findings of reviews are  promptly resolved. Until the military services provide the Mission  Assurance Coordination Boards consistent reporting of information on the  implementation of recommendations, DOD will not be able to ensure the  reliability of its reporting on the status of the recommendations from the  official review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. Further, until the Mission  Assurance Coordination Boards and military services consistently monitor  Fort Hood recommendation implementation at the service and installation  level, DOD will be unable to know whether the deficiencies identified in  the independent review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting have been  addressed on U.S. installations. In addition, by improving consistent  reporting of information and monitoring\u2014such as through developing  criteria for consistent reporting on the progress of recommendations and  having the military services provide periodic status reports\u2014DOD will be  better positioned to provide complete and accurate information in its  report to Congress on Fort Hood recommendation implementation as  required by the Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Initial Actions to Implement Washington Navy Yard Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In response to the official reviews from the 2013 Washington Navy Yard  shootings, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy  issued memorandums directing DOD components to implement the  recommendations and provide progress reports on the status of the  recommendations. The department has taken initial actions towards  implementing the four recommendations that were tasked by the  Secretary of Defense. For example, in June 2014, DOD issued an  implementation plan that lays out major milestones, timelines,  responsibilities, and resource requirements needed to address the  findings and four recommendations. According to the implementation  plan, implementation of these four recommendations will take years to  complete. For example, the plan calls for funding and fielding of an  Identity Matching Engine for Security and Analysis system at DOD  installations through fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Nonetheless, DOD  has begun to undertake actions identified in this plan. The following are  examples of DOD\u2019s initial efforts:  In response to a recommendation to field the Identity Matching Engine  for Security and Analysis system, DOD installed the system at 127 Air  Force and Defense Logistics Agency sites as of June 2015 with plans  to roll out the system to the rest of the department through fiscal year  2019 and beyond.  In response to a recommendation to implement continuous  evaluation, the Washington Navy Yard Task Force Implementation  Plan stated that the department was going to meet this  recommendation by enhancing the throughput capacity of DOD\u2019s  existing first-generation Automated Continuing Evaluation System  while concurrently developing the system\u2019s next generation.  According to the Implementation Plan and DOD officials, the  department is piloting the enhanced first-generation system and is  developing a second generation of the system.  In response to a recommendation to create a DOD Insider Threat  Management and Analysis Center, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence has directed the Director of the Defense Security  Service to establish the center. We previously reported in June 2015  that DOD had not issued a concept of operations and other planning  documents that identify the center\u2019s actual functions, scope, level of  involvement expected from DOD components, level of DOD  involvement, depth of analysis to be completed at the center, and the  relationship between the center and the services\u2019 existing threat- analysis centers. In response to a draft of this report, DOD provided  a draft version of the concept of operations that the department plans  to publish in the summer of 2015.

Although findings from these eight installations are not  generalizable to all installations, they provide context about the actions  taken by these selected installations to protect against insider threats. In  selecting installations to visit, we developed a methodology that included  installations that experienced insider attacks since 2009\u2014Fort Hood and  Washington Navy Yard\u2014as well as a selection of installations that have  not had an attack during this period. We also included the Pentagon in  our selection of installations to visit based on it being a high-value  installation as the headquarters of the Department of Defense. We used  the Department of Defense military installations website  (www.militaryinstallations.dod.mil) as the source of information for the  universe of military installations. We determined the list of installations on  this website to be sufficiently reliable as a source of information on U.S.  installations for each of the military services for the purposes of site  selection. We based our selection of installations that have not had an  insider attack since 2009 on proximity to Fort Hood and Washington Navy  Yard and proximity to GAO office locations. In addition, we considered  military service representation, joint basing, and geographic  representation based on U.S. Census regions as additional selection  criteria. Based on these considerations, we selected five additional  installations\u2014one from each military service and one joint base\u2014to visit  from our universe of installations.

Further, we  interviewed officials at the eight selected U.S. installations to discuss their  knowledge of efforts to protect against insider threats at their respective  installations.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has implemented  recommendations from the official reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and  2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings, we evaluated the actions that  DOD components had taken in response to reviews that either the  Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Navy tasked appropriate DOD  components to take as a result of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and the  2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting. Specifically, for the 2009 Fort  Hood shooting, we considered the DOD independent review  commissioned by the Secretary of Defense and the service internal  reviews that were directed by the Secretary of Defense as \u201cofficial  reviews\u201d for the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. Similarly, we considered the  DOD internal review and the independent review\u2014both of which were  directed by the Secretary of Defense\u2014and the two Navy internal reviews  directed by the Secretary of the Navy as \u201cofficial reviews\u201d for the 2013  Washington Navy Yard shooting. In addition, we sent two separate  questionnaires about the two shootings to OASD(HD&GS) and the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. In addition, we sent  the military services copies of the two questionnaires and requested  information on the implementation status at the military service level of  each recommendation from the Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard  reviews. For each of the Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard  recommendations, DOD and the military services were asked to state  whether no actions had been taken; efforts had been taken, but the  recommendation had not been fully implemented; the recommendation  was fully implemented; or the recommendation was closed without  implementation. We compared the questionnaire responses from  OASD(HD&GS) to the responses from the military services and found  that we were unable to confirm the number of recommendations fully  implemented by DOD and the military services for the Fort Hood  independent review because they were inconsistently reporting  information and had conducted limited monitoring of recommendation  implementation. For example, DOD officials reported that as many as 73  of the 79 recommendations from the review of the 2009 Fort Hood  shooting had been closed as implemented, but this reporting was not  consistent with responses from the military services. Further, although we  reviewed these 79 recommendations and determined that the military  services were tasked to lead or support at least 16 of the Fort Hood  recommendations, DOD and military service officials provided differing  questionnaire responses on the implementation status of 10  recommendations that the military services were tasked lead or support.", "In addition to this analysis, we also reviewed the military services\u2019 internal  reviews of the incidents. We analyzed documents from and interviewed  military service officials to better understand the services\u2019 efforts to  address insider threats and the recommendations from service internal  reviews. We conducted interviews with officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, the OASD(HD&GS), the  Department of the Navy, each military service headquarters, and eight  selected U.S. installations to review the extent to which DOD has  implemented recommendations from official reviews of the 2009 Fort  Hood and 2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings. We also interviewed  officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau  of Investigation to understand the extent to which they supported DOD in  implementing recommendations from the official reviews. Finally, we  consulted with officials from the DOD Office of Inspector General and  Army Audit Agency\u2014both of whom were conducting similar reviews  during our engagement\u2014and obtained documents from those two  agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Department of Defense (DOD) and Service Reviews of the 2009 Fort Hood and 2013 Washington Navy Yard Shootings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Independent Review of 2009 Fort Hood Shooting", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, the Secretary of Defense  directed an independent review of the incident to determine whether there  were programs, policies, and procedural weaknesses within DOD that  created vulnerabilities to the health and safety of the department\u2019s  employees and their families. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense  asked the independent review panel to identify and address (1) possible  gaps, deficiencies, or both in DOD\u2019s programs, processes, and  procedures related to identifying DOD employees who could potentially  pose credible threats to themselves or others; (2) the sufficiency of DOD\u2019s  force protection programs; (3) the sufficiency of DOD\u2019s emergency  response to mass casualty situations at DOD facilities; and (4) the  response to care for victims and families in the aftermath of a mass  casualty situation.

The Secretary of Defense also directed the Secretaries of the  military departments, combatant commanders, and the heads of the other  DOD components, informed by the report of the independent review  panel, to initiate internal reviews in support of the follow-on review. These  reviews were to assess their organization\u2019s ability below the headquarters  level to identify internal threats and force protection and emergency  response programs, policies, and procedures. As directed, the military  services each produced a report based on their respective Fort Hood  internal reviews and submitted them to the Secretary of Defense for his  consideration in determining which recommendations to implement from  the independent review of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting.", "On August 18, 2010, the Secretary of Defense generally approved 79  recommendations identified in the independent review and directed the  DOD components to take specific actions associated with those  recommendations as identified in an attachment to the memorandum.  The Secretary of Defense in his August 2010 memorandum also directed  the ASD(HD&GS) to provide regular implementation progress reports to  the Secretary of Defense, not only on those measures he approved, but  also on progress by the military department Secretaries and combatant  commanders to mitigate issues identified in their independent internal  reviews. The Force Protection Senior Steering Group, which was  established in August 2010, was responsible for monitoring  implementation of the Fort Hood force protection-related  recommendations. In October 2013, the Mission Assurance Coordination  Boards assumed responsibility for monitoring recommendation  implementation from the independent review of the 2009 Fort Hood  shooting. The boards established a Fort Hood Working Group to track  and monitor the status of implementation of the Fort Hood  recommendations. The Mission Assurance Coordination Boards include  representatives from the military departments, the offices of the Under  Secretaries of Defense, the Office of the Director of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation, the Office of the DOD Chief Information Officer, the  Office of the Director of Administration and Management, the National  Guard Bureau, the combatant commands, and the Office of the General  Counsel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Internal Review and an Independent Review of the 2013 Washington Navy Yard Shooting", "paragraphs": ["In response to the September 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting, the  Secretary of Defense directed an independent review and an internal  review of the incident to identify and recommend actions to address gaps  or deficiencies in DOD programs, policies, or procedures regarding  security at DOD installations and the granting and renewing of security  clearances for DOD employees and contractor personnel. Both the  Washington Navy Yard independent review and internal review were  released in November 2013 and identified actions that were intended to  improve DOD\u2019s force protection posture from insider threats. In March  2014, the Secretary of Defense directed DOD to implement four key  recommendations that were a compilation of a number of  recommendations from the Washington Navy Yard independent review  and internal review. The Secretary of Defense tasked the Under  Secretary of Defense for Intelligence to lead a task force to develop and  coordinate an implementation plan for the four key recommendations.  The Secretary of Defense also directed the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence to study three additional recommendations from the  Washington Navy Yard independent review.
