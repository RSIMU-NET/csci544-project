FISMA authorized DHS, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to develop and oversee the implementation of compulsory directives\u2014referred to as binding operational directives\u2014covering executive branch civilian agencies. These directives require agencies to safeguard federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk. Since 2015, DHS has issued eight directives that instructed agencies to, among other things, (1) mitigate critical vulnerabilities discovered by DHS through its scanning of agencies' internet-accessible systems; (2) address urgent vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices identified by DHS; and (3) better secure the government's highest value and most critical information and system assets.", "GAO was requested to evaluate DHS's binding operational directives. This report addresses (1) DHS's process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives and (2) the effectiveness of the directives, including agencies' implementation of the directive requirements.

The process includes DHS coordinating with stakeholders early in the directives' development process and validating agencies' actions on the directives. However, in implementing the process, DHS did not coordinate with stakeholders early in the process and did not consistently validate agencies' self-reported actions. In addition to being a required step in the directives process, FISMA requires DHS to coordinate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to ensure that the directives do not conflict with existing NIST guidance for federal agencies. However, NIST officials told GAO that DHS often did not reach out to NIST on directives until 1 to 2 weeks before the directives were to be issued, and then did not always incorporate the NIST technical comments. More recently, DHS and NIST have started regular coordination meetings to discuss directive-related issues earlier in the process. Regarding validation of agency actions, DHS has done so for selected directives, but not for others. DHS is not well-positioned to validate all directives because it lacks a risk-based approach as well as a strategy to check selected agency-reported actions to validate their completion.", "Directives' implementation often has been effective in strengthening federal cybersecurity. For example, a 2015 directive on critical vulnerability mitigation required agencies to address critical vulnerabilities discovered by DHS cyber scans of agencies' internet-accessible systems within 30 days. This was a new requirement for federal agencies. While agencies did not always meet the 30-day requirement, their mitigations were validated by DHS and reached 87 percent compliance by 2017 (see fig. 1). DHS officials attributed the recent decline in percentage completion to a 35-day partial government shutdown in late 2018/early 2019. Nevertheless, for the 4-year period shown in the figure below, agencies mitigated within 30 days about 2,500 of the 3,600 vulnerabilities identified.", "Agencies also made reported improvements in securing or replacing vulnerable network infrastructure devices. Specifically, a 2016 directive on the Threat to Network Infrastructure Devices addressed, among other things, several urgent vulnerabilities in the targeting of firewalls across federal networks and provided technical mitigation solutions. As shown in figure 2, in response to the directive, agencies reported progress in mitigating risks to more than 11,000 devices as of October 2018.", "In addition, GAO reviewed DHS policies and processes related to the directives and assessed them against FISMA and Office of Management and Budget requirements; administered a data collection instrument to selected federal agencies; compared the agencies' responses and supporting documentation to the requirements outlined in the five directives; and collected and analyzed DHS's government-wide scanning data on government-wide implementation of the directives.

DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and outlined steps and associated timelines that it planned to take to address the recommendations.", "Another key DHS directive is Securing High Value Assets, an initiative to protect the government's most critical information and system assets. According to this directive, DHS is to lead in-depth assessments of federal agencies' most essential identified high value assets. However, an important performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified by these assessments does not account for agencies submitting remediation plans in cases where weaknesses cannot be fully addressed within 30 days. Further, DHS only completed about half of the required assessments for the most recent 2 years (61 of 142 for fiscal year 2018, and 73 of 142 required assessments for fiscal year 2019 (see fig. 3)). In addition, DHS does not plan to finalize guidance to agencies and third parties, such as contractors or agency independent assessors, for conducting reviews of additional high value assets that are considered significant, but are not included in DHS's current review, until the end of fiscal year 2020. Given these shortcomings, DHS is now reassessing key aspects of the program.

Identify a potential directive topic and determine the extent to which  it needs to be addressed. DHS\u2019s FNR is to identify topics for new  directives from a wide variety of sources, including technical  assessments, operational findings of cybersecurity issues, and  discussions with external partners such as the Federal CIO Council,  NIST, or OMB.

Develop a draft directive, send it to relevant stakeholders for review,  and obtain approval to issue it. After FNR officials develop the draft  directive, they are to send it to relevant stakeholders (e.g. CISA,  OMB, NIST, and the DHS Office of General Counsel) for a review of  the scope and contents of the directives. FNR staff are to incorporate  any feedback from stakeholders into the draft directive and then send  it to the CISA director for approval and issuance.  3.  Distribute the approved directive to all relevant agencies. FNR  officials are to notify agencies of the directive\u2019s issuance via an email  and a telephone call within 24 hours of the signing of the directive.

We compared these  performance reports and metrics with existing requirements found in  DHS\u2019s directives to assess whether they were aligned.", "In addition, we reviewed detailed scanning data and output from a data  analysis tool from DHS\u2019s database to determine the extent to which the  99 civilian executive branch agencies and our selected 12 agencies are  mitigating vulnerabilities on internet-accessible systems and whether or  not they are being mitigated within given timeframes.", "In addition, to analyze the implementation of email and web security  requirements, we reviewed detailed scanning data on the status of the 99  civilian executive branch agencies and our selected 12 agencies. To  assess the reliability of the scanning data and related DHS analysis that  we used to support the findings in this report, we interviewed agency  officials to determine the steps taken to ensure the integrity and reliability  of the data and reviewed relevant documentation to substantiate the  evidence obtained through interviews with agency officials. We  determined that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "We supplemented our analyses with interviews of DHS and selected  agency officials to obtain their views on the steps they have taken to  address the directives\u2019 requirements.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: List of Federal Agencies to Which Binding Operational Directives Apply", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Binding Operational Directives Process", "paragraphs": ["Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Division, the Federal  Network Resilience (FNR) is responsible for managing the process for  developing and overseeing the binding operational directives, including  coordination and implementation. The process is documented in the  department\u2019s draft Cybersecurity Division Binding Operational Directives  Process and outlines five steps and their substeps:  Step 1: Identify and Determine. This step includes three substeps\u20141.1  triggers, 1.2 business case development, and 1.3 socialization. The  identification of a directive begins with a trigger that identifies a particular  topic. The trigger may be from an administrative priority, technical  assessment, operational finding, or discussions with external entities such  as the Federal Chief Information Officer Council, National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) or a private sector organization. Once a topic is identified, FNR  officials conduct research on the topic and solicit feedback from  stakeholders.", "FNR then directs topics to the Binding Operational Directives Discussion  Group. According to the draft process, recommended members of this  group include representatives from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency (CISA) and ad hoc and external partners, such as OMB  officials, federal CIOs and chief information security officers (CISO), NIST  officials, and General Services Administration officials.", "During substep 1.1, the group should decide whether to proceed to  substep 1.2, business case development for a directives\u2019 topic. The  group maintains an online repository for proposed topics, active  directives, and topics that have been previously considered, but archived  for future use or historical documentation purposes.", "During business case development, a lead within the discussion group  researches risks, threat actors, and mitigation strategies. The group  incorporates information from subject matter experts and programs that  provide information on current threats facing agencies and mitigation  actions (e.g., Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation and EINSTEIN).", "Once drafted, the business case is sent to FNR leadership, such as the  Director and Deputy Director, for review.", "In the socialization substep 1.3, the discussion group may obtain  additional feedback through various outreach efforts or through CIO, or  CISO Council meetings.", "Step 2: Develop and Approve. This step includes two substeps\u20142.1  table top and 2.2 BOD material finalization. In step 2, FNR staff draft  the directive. A table top exercise is an optional step that FNR staff may  take to test required actions at selected agencies. As part of drafting the  directive, the FNR staff coordinates with stakeholders, such as National  Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS), OMB and  selected other agencies to develop an action plan template. This template  instructs agencies on how to track and submit their progress on a  particular directive. In addition, the team drafts a communications plan to  disseminate directive-related information to agencies and the public.  During substep 2.2, BOD material finalization, the action plan template  and communications plan are sent along with the draft directive to all  associated stakeholders (e.g. FNR, OMB, NIST, and Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) Office of General Counsel) for review. After  FNR staff incorporate any additional feedback, the draft directive package  is then sent to the CISA Director for signature and then release.", "Step 3: Distribute. This step includes three substeps\u20143.1 notification,  3.2 baseline evaluation delivery, and 3.3 begin mandatory actions.  According to FNR officials, the approval of a directive is the start of  several processes in this step. During substep 3.1, all affected federal  civilian agencies receive notification through an email and a directive  issuance call within 24 hours of the signing of the directive. In addition,  the DHS website (cyber.dhs.gov) and the OMB MAX portal may post the  directive depending on the content of the directive.", "The notification of the directive is followed with agency baseline  evaluation delivery, substep 3.2. As part of this substep, the validation  team, including representatives from NCATS, may deliver baseline  evaluations to provide agencies a better understanding of where they  stand in addressing the directive prior to issuance, depending on the  nature of the directive. In the last substep 3.3, agencies begin  mandatory actions as noted in the directive.", "Step 4: Implement and Report. This step includes three substeps\u20144.1  action plan submission, 4.2 continuous coordination, and 4.3  implementation and reporting. The step begins with FNR\u2019s  establishment of a Binding Operational Directives Implementation Team  to manage the requirements of a specific directive. This team includes a  technical lead who reviews and tracks agency plan submissions as part  of substep 4.1; a validation team whose members validate agency  compliance with the directive; and a data analyst, who is to compile all  agency-submitted action plans and draft a monthly status report.", "According to the draft process document, the validation team conducts  directive-related scans and compliance checks, and develops and  distributes scorecards that indicate agency compliance with directive  requirements. For some directives, such as BODs 16-02, 17-01, and 18- 02, DHS relied on agency self-reporting to confirm that an agency had  addressed the requirements, and the validation team did not verify  compliance. During substep 4.2 FNR staff and the affected agency  maintain continuous coordination through email and phone  conversations to address any challenges involved with implementing the  directive. Substep 4.3 implementation and reporting consists of  processes agencies may need to establish internally to address and  report on directive requirements until completion, such as points of  contact and methods of communication with FNR.", "The implementation team produces monthly status reports for FNR  leadership, such as the Director and Deputy Director, showing which  agencies have complied or not complied with directive requirements.  Based upon this information, FNR officials decide whether to escalate  instances of agency noncompliance. In addition, FNR officials stated that  they have a monthly check-in with OMB, during which they provide status  reports as well as conduct less formal weekly discussions. For Congress,  CISA produces an annual binding operational directives\u2019 implementation  report, in addition to responding to more frequent congressional  information requests. To date, DHS has submitted two congressional  reports for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. According to FNR officials, as of  September 2019, the fiscal year 2018 report is undergoing OMB review.", "Step 5: Close Out. This step includes two substeps\u20145.1 results  validation and 5.2 setting a higher bar. The draft process document  describes the following scenarios that may lead to results validation; if a  directive: (1) has been completed by all agencies; (2) is no longer  necessary because it has been revoked, suspended, or codified into law;  or (3) needs to be amended. In the first scenario, once the validation  team affirms that the requirements have been met, FNR officials are to  notify affected federal agency officials that their agencies have fulfilled all  requirements. FNR officials then draft a binding operational directive  completion letter that the Secretary of DHS or the Secretary\u2019s designee  signs. According to FNR officials, a directive does not fully close out after  the Secretary signs a completion letter, because the directive is still in  effect even after agencies have fulfilled all of the particular directive\u2019s  requirements. If a directive is revoked or amended, FNR officials draft a  letter noting the reasons for such actions which the Secretary of DHS  then signs. Agencies are expected to adhere to the newly implemented  requirement, which is how DHS describes substep 5.2, setting a higher  bar.", "Figure 1 provides the life cycle of a binding operational directive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Binding Operational Directives and Associated Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland (DHS) had issued eight binding operational  directives (BOD) as of October 2019.
