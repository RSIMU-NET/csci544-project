According to four nationally representative surveys conducted from 2005 to 2009, an estimated 20 to 28 percent of youth, primarily middle and high school-aged youths, reported they had been bullied during the survey periods. However, differences in definitions and questions posed to youth respondents make it difficult to discern trends and affected groups. For example, the surveys did not collect demographic information by sexual orientation or gender identity. The Departments of Education (Education) and Health and Human Services (HHS) are partially addressing the issue of inconsistent definitions by collaborating with other federal departments and subject matter experts to develop a uniform definition of bullying that can be used for research purposes. However, gaps in knowledge about the extent of bullying of youths in key demographic groups remain.", "According to Education, as of April 2012, 49 states have adopted school bullying laws. The laws in the 8 states that GAO reviewed vary in who is covered and the requirements placed on state agencies and school districts. For example, 6 of the states cover a mix of different demographic groups, referred to as protected classes, such as race and sex or gender, in their bullying laws, while 2 states do not include any protected classes. With respect to school districts, each of the 6 districts GAO studied adopted policies that, among other things, prohibit bullying and describe the potential consequences for engaging in the behavior. Also, school district officials told GAO that they developed approaches to prevent and respond to bullying. For example, several school officials said they implemented a prevention-oriented framework to promote positive school cultures. Both state and local officials expressed concerns about various issues, including how best to address incidents that occur outside of school.", "Federal civil rights laws can be used to provide protections against bullying in certain circumstances, but certain vulnerable groups are not covered and therefore have no recourse at the federal level. For example, federal agencies lack jurisdiction under civil rights statutes to pursue discrimination cases based solely on socioeconomic status or sexual orientation. While some state civil rights laws provide protections to victims of bullying that go beyond federal law, federal complainants whose cases are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction are not always informed about the possibility of pursuing claims at the state level.", "Three federal departments\u0097Education, HHS, and the Department of Justice (Justice)\u0097have established coordinated efforts to carry out research and broadly disseminate information on bullying to the public, including establishment of a central website and an informational campaign to raise awareness about bullying. In addition to these efforts, Education has issued information about how federal civil rights laws can be used to address bullying of protected classes of youths and is conducting a comprehensive study of state bullying laws and how selected school districts are implementing them. However, no similar information is being gathered on state civil rights laws and procedures that could be helpful in assessing the adequacy of legal protections against school bullying."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education compile information about state civil rights laws and procedures that relate to bullying, and inform complainants about state legal options; Education, HHS, and Justice develop information about bullied demographic groups in their surveys; and assess whether legal protections are adequate for these groups.

Some of these incidents  involved bullying based on personal characteristics, including race,  religion, or sexual orientation, and have also raised questions about the  role and availability of federal and state civil rights protections. Given the  dynamic and rapidly changing nature of these efforts, governments at all  levels, as well as the public, face a growing need for information about  possible legal and practical approaches to combating bullying. In this  context, you asked us to address the following questions:  1.  What is known about the prevalence of school bullying and its effects  on victims? 2.  What approaches are selected states and local school districts taking  to combat school bullying? 3.  When bullying leads to allegations of discrimination, what legal  options do federal and selected state governments have in place? 4.  How are key federal agencies coordinating their efforts to combat  school bullying?", "To identify what is known about the prevalence of school bullying and its  effects on victims, we interviewed knowledgeable federal officials,  compared estimates and methodologies of four nationally representative  surveys that captured information on bullying, and conducted a literature  review of meta-analyses on the subject of the effects of bullying on  victims.aged youths and were conducted by federal statistical agencies from  2005 to 2009. The results of the meta-analyses are not generalizable, but  represent a systematic approach to summarizing or analyzing findings  across studies included in the meta-analyses. To describe approaches  that selected states and local school districts are taking, we reviewed  relevant state bullying laws, regulations, guidance, and documents from  eight selected states and conducted interviews with state education  officials. We selected eight states\u2014Arkansas, California, Illinois, Iowa,  Massachusetts, New Mexico, Vermont, and Virginia\u2014based on the  following criteria: Each has bullying laws or regulations, and they vary  with respect to bullying definitions and enumeration of protected classes,  geographic variation, and student enrollment. Further, we selected three  states\u2014New Mexico, Vermont, and Virginia, which vary on the  characteristics listed above\u2014to review policies and guidance of six local  school districts, two in each state. School districts and schools were  selected to reflect a range of size and urbanicity (urban, suburban, and  rural), as well as racial and socioeconomic diversity.

For example, a single fight  between two youths of roughly equal power is a form of aggression, but  may not be bullying. When bullying occurs it may take many forms that  can also be associated with conflict or aggression, including physical   Notably,  harm, such as hitting, shoving, or locking inside a school locker; verbal  name calling, taunts, or threats; relational attacks, such as spreading  rumors or isolating victims from their peers; and the use of computers or  cell phones to convey harmful words or images, also referred to as  cyberbullying. Often bullying occurs without apparent provocation and  may be based on the victim\u2019s personal characteristics. For example,  youth may be bullied based on the way they look, dress, speak, or act.", "There are several federal efforts under way to bring together federal  resources that can be used to identify and address bullying. In particular,  given their focus on education, health, and safety issues, Education,  HHS, and Justice, along with other federal agencies, have been involved  in efforts to help coordinate federal resources to identify and address  bullying. Additionally, several bills have been introduced in the 112th  Congress that relate to bullying. Among the various issues addressed in  these bills are bullying policies, the collection and reporting of bullying  data, and the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation or gender identity. Some of the bills would authorize federal  grants to states and school districts for antibullying-related purposes.  Although there is not presently a federal law directly targeted to address  school bullying, several federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination  based on protected characteristics of individuals may, under certain  circumstances, be used to address particular incidents of bullying.", "With respect to states\u2019 efforts to address bullying, Education  commissioned a two-part study that examines the elements of state  bullying laws and the manner in which school districts are implementing  the laws. The first part of Education\u2019s study, issued in December 2011,  included a review of all state bullying laws and model policies in effect as  of April 2011, including those of the eight states we reviewed, as well as  policies from 20 large school districts.

However, differences in definitions and survey methods make it  difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding trends and affected  demographic groups. Our analysis and similar work from HHS\u2019s Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the sponsors of two of  the surveys, showed that the surveys vary in the way they pose questions  about being bullied and how bullying is defined, if at all.Education, the sponsor of one of the surveys, and HHS also told us that  different survey questions and definitions of bullying lead to different  results in estimates of prevalence.", "While it is clear that bullying is a serious problem, it is unclear from the  surveys the extent to which bullying affects certain groups of youths  relative to other groups. Specifically, the surveys collected information on  the percentage of youths bullied based on gender and race. However, the  information showed varying results. For example, there was no significant  difference in the percentage of boys and girls that reported being bullied,  according to two surveys, while one noted that girls were bullied at a  higher percentage. In two of the three surveys, white youths reported  being bullied at a higher percentage than African-American youths, while  one other survey found no significant difference.", "In addition, the four national surveys we identified did not consistently  collect information about other demographic characteristics, making it  impossible to determine percentages of bullying for these groups. For  example, none of the surveys collected demographic information for  youths by sexual orientation or gender identity. Researchers noted  various challenges to obtaining such information, such as some schools  may not permit questions on sexual orientation or gender identity status,  potentially resulting in a sample that would not be nationally  representative. Also, questions about sexual orientation or gender identity  may be sensitive for youth respondents to complete, and researchers  noted that such questions may not yield accurate information.  Additionally, the surveys varied in whether or not they collected  demographic information to allow for analysis based on religion, disability,  or socioeconomic status, and two of the surveys did not include any  questions asking specifically if youths had been bullied based on specific  demographic characteristics. (See table 1.)", "While federal agencies have not collected information on some  demographic groups, other researchers have attempted to fill the void.  For example, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN)  conducted a survey in the 2008-2009 school year and received  responses from more than 7,000 students between the ages of 13 and 21  who self-reported as not heterosexual. Although not nationally  representative, the results found, among other things, that 85 percent of  students who responded to the survey said they were called names or  threatened at some point in the past school year based on their sexual  orientation, and 64 percent based on their gender expression; for  example, for not acting \u201cmasculine enough\u201d or \u201cfeminine enough\u201d. Forty  percent of students who responded said they were pushed or shoved  based on their sexual orientation, and 27 percent based on their gender  expression.", "In addition to the fact that there are voids in information about  demographic groups, Education and HHS officials said that researchers  need a uniform definition to measure bullying. To better understand the  prevalence of bullying, and given the different definitions used by bullying  research instruments, CDC is leading an interdepartmental project to  develop a uniform definition of bullying for research purposes. According  to CDC officials, a report is expected to be issued in 2012 that contains a  uniform definition along with information on other data elements to  measure bullying, such as the frequency or types of bullying behavior.

Similarly, a 2010 analysis of 18 research studies found that being bullied  was linked to increased psychological issues later in life. A third  analysis, of 20 studies, published in 2011, found that being bullied was  associated with greater likelihood of being depressed later in life.", "A 2009 analysis of 11 research studies found that bullying victims had a  higher risk for such physical health outcomes as headaches, backaches,  sleeping problems, and bad appetite, as compared with their peers who  had not been bullied. Additionally, a 2010 analysis of 33 research  studies on bullying and academic achievement found that bullying is  related to concurrent academic difficulties for victims. Academic  achievement was assessed based on such measures as grade point  averages, standardized test scores, or teacher ratings of academic  achievement. Researchers have also linked bullying to increases in  behavioral problems for victims over time, such as aggression,  delinquency, and truancy.", "While researchers point out that the causes of suicide and violence are  varied and complex, bullying has been identified as one risk factor  associated with violent actions against oneself and others. For example,  one 2011 analysis of 18 studies found that gay, lesbian, and bisexual  youth were more likely to be verbally harassed and teased or physically  and sexually victimized than heterosexual youth, and more likely to  experience detrimental outcomes, such as suicidal thoughts and  attempts. According to a federally sponsored website on bullying,  specific groups have an increased risk of suicide, including American  Indian and Alaskan Native, Asian-American, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender youths. Their risk of suicide can be increased further by  bullying. Bullying has also been linked to acts of violence against others.  For example, a 2002 study by Education and the Secret Service reviewed  37 incidents of school attacks and shootings occurring between 1974 and  the end of the 2000 school year, and reported out 10 key findings that  could be used to develop strategies to address targeted school violence.

For example, the 8 states\u2019 laws that  we reviewed vary in whether and the extent to which they cover specific  demographic groups, referred to as protected classes. Five states\u2014 Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, and Vermont\u2014identify race, color,  sex or gender, national origin or nationality, disability, sexual orientation,  gender identity, and religion as protected classes.

For example, Illinois also includes as protected  classes ancestry, age, and marital status. Virginia and Massachusetts do  not include protected classes in their state bullying laws. According to  Massachusetts officials, protected classes were intentionally omitted from  the state\u2019s law to ensure that all youths were equally protected. Within  Massachusetts\u2019 state educational agency (SEA), a specific office is  designated to receive complaints, including from youths who have been  bullied for any reason, such as obesity or socioeconomic status.  Additionally, four of the states that identify protected classes\u2014Arkansas,  Illinois, Iowa, and New Mexico\u2014provide that the list of classes is not  exhaustive, so protection can be afforded to youths with characteristics  not explicitly listed.

For  example, laws in California, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia require  that SEAs develop model bullying policies as a resource for school  districts. Also, we found that while SEAs in Arkansas, California, and  Illinois are required by law to review or monitor school district\u2019s bullying  policies, the approach taken to do so is different from state to state. For  example, officials in Arkansas reported that as part of a broader effort to  ensure that school districts\u2019 policies align with federal and state laws, they  conduct on-site reviews every 4 years, and require school districts to  forward information to the Department of Education for review every year,  including information about discipline and bullying policies. Conversely,  an Illinois official reported that little meaningful oversight is occurring, in  part because of resource constraints.", "In each of the states we reviewed, the laws require school districts to  adopt bullying policies or plans, but the states differed in the specific  requirements of what must be included in these policies or plans.

For example, in five of the  six school districts we visited, central administrators or principals said  they conduct student surveys that include questions about bullying to  determine the prevalence of the behavior, and two administrators said the  surveys are used to develop strategies to address the behavior. Also,  officials from four of the six school districts said that several or all of their  schools utilize the prevention-oriented framework Positive Behavioral  Interventions and Supports (PBIS) to improve overall behavior in schools  (see text box). Additionally, several school districts and schools use  curricula that help youths develop interpersonal skills and manage their  emotions, such as Second Step, a classroom-based social skills program  for youths 4 to 14 years of age, and Steps to Respect, a bullying  prevention program developed for grades three through six. Several  central administrators and principals mentioned that antibullying-focused  events have been held at their schools, such as Rachel\u2019s Challenge and  Ryan\u2019s Story.

According to Education\u2019s Office of Special Education  Programs, PBIS steps to addressing bullying behavior at school include the following:  examining discipline data to determine, for example, the frequency, location, and  timing of specific bullying behaviors;  examining the extent to which staff members have, for example, actively and  positively supervised all students across all school settings, had high rates of  positive interactions and contact with all students, and arranged their instruction so  all students are actively engaged, successful, and challenged ; and  teaching students and staff common strategies for preventing and responding to  bullying behavior, such as intervening and responding early and quickly to interrupt  bullying behavior, removing what triggers and maintains bullying behavior, and  reporting and recording when a bullying behavior incident occurs.", "Students whose bullying behavior does not improve are considered for additional  supports.

On a  related matter, state and local officials said that it is important to train  teachers and staff to prevent, identify, and respond to bullying behavior.  However, according to these officials, because of state budget cuts and  the elimination of some federal funding that could be used for bullying  prevention activities, there is little funding available for training. State  officials specifically cited the loss of funding from Title IV, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, which  among other things could be used to prevent violence in and around  schools.

In October 2010, Education sent a letter to state and  local education officials outlining how federal civil rights laws can be  applied to bullying. The letter stated that student misconduct may trigger  school responsibilities under federal civil rights laws and provided  examples of behavior that may meet the threshold for violating the laws.  In December 2010, the department issued another letter that summarized  several key components of state bullying laws, such as specifying  prohibited behavior, development and implementation of school district  policies, and training and preventive education. As previously discussed,  following up on this letter, the department commissioned a study of state  bullying laws to determine the extent to which states and school districts  incorporate the key components into their laws and policies.

Since some  states\u2019 civil rights laws provide protection for groups not named in  applicable federal civil rights laws, collection and dissemination of such  information could assist in better understanding how these laws vary in  coverage and in the procedures states have in place for filing complaints.  For example, five states in our review\u2014California, Illinois, Iowa,  Massachusetts, and Vermont\u2014have established processes and  procedures for resolving civil rights complaints, and have empowered a  statewide organization with the authority to hold schools and school  districts accountable when discrimination is found, according to state  officials. Specifically, according to a state official, California\u2019s Uniform  Complaint Process empowers its Department of Education\u2019s Office of  Equal Opportunity to ensure compliance with state and federal civil rights  laws. California\u2019s state code also requires uniform complaint procedures  that each school district within the state must follow when addressing  complaints of discrimination against protected groups, according to a  state official. The complaint process allows up to 60 days for an  investigation and decision to be rendered at the district level, unless a  child is directly in harm\u2019s way and the school district is unresponsive, in  which case a complaint can be filed directly with the state. In Vermont,  the state\u2019s Human Rights Commission acts as an independent agency  focused solely on the protection of civil rights, and if its investigation  determines unlawful discrimination occurred, the agency assists the  parties in negotiating a settlement. Human Rights Commission officials  told us if a settlement cannot be reached, the agency may choose to take  the case to court. However, they said that this usually does not happen  because cases are generally settled. The Massachusetts Department of  Elementary and Secondary Education has a formal process called the  Problem Resolution System that handles complaints that allege a school  or a district is not meeting legal requirements for education, including  complaints of discrimination. In each of the five states with established  processes and procedures for resolving civil rights complaints, the SEAs  include information on their websites about the civil rights complaint  process, including where to file, required information, and time frames.", "According to their respective state officials, Arkansas and New Mexico  offer only limited legal options for protected classes with complaints of  discrimination based on school bullying because they lack a state entity  with the authority to investigate and hold school districts accountable for  such complaints. Although Arkansas has an Equity Assistance Center  within its Department of Education that can serve as an intermediary  between the complainant and the school district, its decisions lack the  authority to discipline a school district, according to state officials. New  Mexico has a human rights commission that receives and investigates  complaints of discrimination based on protected classes, but the  commission is focused on employment issues and does not address  discrimination complaints related to education. As a result, the state lacks  formal processes and procedures to address complaints of discrimination  stemming from instances of bullying, according to state officials.  Therefore, according to state officials from these two states, if an  individual cannot afford an attorney to file a private right of action related  to complaints of discrimination because of school bullying, the individual\u2019s  only legal option is to file a federal complaint.", "By not incorporating an assessment of state civil rights laws and  procedures into their various bullying prevention efforts, federal agencies  are overlooking a potentially important source of information. Building on  information from Education\u2019s study of state bullying laws and the letters  they issued on federal civil rights laws, information on state civil rights  laws and procedures would provide a broader and more complete  perspective of the overall coverage of federal and state efforts to prevent  and address bullying."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Students who are bullied may seek recourse through a number of  avenues\u2014local and state educational policies, state bullying laws, state  civil rights laws, or federal civil rights laws. However, the nature and  extent of protections available to them depend on the laws and policies of  where they live or go to school. Education and Justice have taken  important steps in assessing how federal civil rights laws can be used to  help combat certain instances of bullying of protected classes of youth for  which they have jurisdiction. And Education has completed a study of  state bullying laws and is conducting another study looking at how school  districts are implementing these laws. However, neither Education nor  Justice has assessed state civil rights laws and procedures as they may  relate to bullying. Many of the states\u2019 civil rights laws we reviewed extend  protections to classes of individuals beyond the groups protected at the  federal level, but states vary in the groups that are explicitly protected;  therefore, whether bullying victims have any recourse through civil rights  laws can depend on the state in which they live or go to school. Also,  states vary in their procedures for pursuing civil rights claims, which could  also affect the ability to pursue a bullying-related discrimination claim.  State civil rights laws, just like federal civil rights laws and state bullying  laws, can play an important role in addressing this important issue. More  information about state civil rights laws and procedures is a key missing  link and is needed by administration officials and decision makers alike, to  understand the potential overall legal protections available to students  who have been bullied.", "Federal claimants would also benefit from knowing that options may be  available to them at the state level. This is particularly key when cases  are dismissed at the federal level because of a lack of jurisdiction. While  Justice routinely informs individuals when their complaints are dismissed  because of a lack of jurisdiction of possible recourse under their state civil  rights laws, Education does not. Routinely making this basic information  available would be another key step in helping ensure that bullying  victims are aware of some of the legal options available to them.", "Multiple efforts to collect information about bullying have been under way  for several years; however, the prevalence of bullying of youths in certain  vulnerable demographic groups is not known. A greater effort by key  federal agencies to develop more information about the extent to which a  broader range of demographic groups are subject to bullying and bullying- related discrimination would better inform federal efforts to prevent and  remedy bullying. Understanding the prevalence of bullying by  demographic groups would help administration officials develop additional  actions targeted at the greatest areas of need.

The department stressed that its previous analysis of state  bullying laws was limited to compiling a list of statutes or regulations and  identifying key components of statutes and regulations. Further,  Education suggested that compiling information about state civil rights  laws and procedures would only be useful if kept current, and that  undergoing such a time-intensive and costly survey and review of state\u2019s  civil rights laws would not be an appropriate use of the department\u2019s  limited resources.", "We continue to believe that a one-time compilation of state civil rights  laws and procedures would be beneficial, and provide a basis, along with  other information, for analyzing the overall legal protections that are  available for vulnerable demographic groups. Such an assessment would  help determine the extent to which states are positioned to respond to  these types of civil rights complaints and to identify those instances where  certain students are left with little recourse to pursue discrimination claims  simply because of the state in which they reside or go to school. While we  appreciate the work involved in any analysis of state laws, we believe that  Education can develop a methodological approach that would limit the  scope of their work and hone in on those aspects of civil rights laws that  come into play when bullying leads to allegations of discrimination. For  example, this review could be limited to compiling basic information about  state civil rights laws, such as which protected classes are included and  whether they apply in educational settings, and may not require an  extensive analysis of state case law. In implementing a study of this type,  Education may consider approaches similar to those they used in their  previous work on state bullying laws. Alternatively, Education officials  could choose to rely on the knowledge and expertise of cognizant state  officials by conducting a survey or otherwise soliciting pertinent  information, rather than undertaking the bulk of this work themselves. We  acknowledge Education\u2019s concerns regarding keeping the information on  state civil rights laws updated and have modified language in the report  and our recommendation to clarify that this is meant to be a onetime  effort.", "Regarding our second recommendation, Education indicated that they are  considering whether to develop procedures that would inform  complainants whose complaints are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction that  they may have possible recourse under state or local laws.

However, as we point out in our  previous recommendations, more information is needed on state civil  rights laws as well as about how various demographic groups are  affected by bullying. Utilizing all of the information at their disposal,  including information we recommend be collected, Education, HHS, and  Justice could work together to assess how well the available laws and  resources address areas of need and identify measures that could be  taken to help prevent bullying. We believe that it is an important step to  assimilate information on resources and laws with research about areas  of need in order to assist federal policy makers and agency officials in  their efforts to address this important issue.
