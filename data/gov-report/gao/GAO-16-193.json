The  credit subsidy cost is equal to the net present value of estimated lifetime  cash flows to and from the government, excluding administrative costs.  For a mortgage guarantee program, cash inflows consist primarily of  premiums received from borrowers and cash outflows consist mostly of  claim payments to lenders. Credit programs have a positive subsidy cost  when the present value of estimated payments by the government  exceeds the present value of estimated premiums and other funds  received by the government (collections).

To estimate their  subsidy costs for annual appropriation requests, credit agencies estimate  the future performance of direct loans and loan guarantees. Agencies are  responsible for accumulating relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on  which to base these estimates. To estimate future credit performance,  agencies generally have models that include assumptions about defaults,  prepayments, recoveries, and the timing of these events and are based  on the nature of their credit programs. As needed, agencies also  incorporate economic assumptions provided by the President into credit  subsidy calculations. Further, OMB requires agencies to discount cash  flows using projected Treasury interest rates that are consistent with the  economic assumptions underlying the President\u2019s budget.

The total amount of guarantees outstanding  increased from less than $22 billion in 2008 to more than $100 billion in  2014.", "According to RD management, the large upward credit subsidy  reestimates for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 also were due to higher-than- expected loss amounts (claims paid to lenders after defaults) and to  changes in the estimation methodology RD used those years (discussed  later in this report). RD\u2019s financial statement auditor for federal credit  subsidy issues (credit subsidy auditor) agreed with RD management\u2019s  explanation. Cumulative loss rates (total losses divided by the dollar  volume of loans guaranteed) were especially high for cohorts guaranteed  directly before and during the early years of the 2007 through 2011  housing crisis. (In a loan cohort, losses are expected, and any losses are  offset in part or in whole by guarantee fees.) As of the end of fiscal year  2014, the 2007 cohort had the highest cumulative loss rate of any cohort  since 2000, followed by cohorts from 2006, 2005, and 2008, respectively  (see fig. 2). For example, the 2007 cohort had a cumulative loss rate of  almost 10 percent. In contrast, the 2003 cohort had a cumulative loss rate  under 3 percent at the comparable point in its life cycle (8 years) and a  cumulative loss rate of 4.7 percent at the end of 2014. The higher losses  for these cohorts may have stemmed from homeowners\u2019 inability to build  equity before housing prices declined. Borrowers who owe more on their  mortgages than their homes are worth may be more likely to default  because (1) they may not be able to sell or refinance their homes to  relieve unsustainable mortgage payments and (2) they may choose to  stop making mortgage payments to minimize losses. Furthermore, when  lenders foreclose on the borrowers, the lower home values reduce the  amount that lenders recover through sale of the properties, resulting in  higher losses for RHS.", "As shown in figure 2, cohorts guaranteed since 2010 had lower loss rates  in each year of their life cycle after the first year than all other cohorts  since 2000. For example, the 2011 cohort had a 0.3 percent cumulative  loss rate at the end of fiscal year 2014, whereas the 2000 cohort had a  1.6 percent rate at the comparable point (after 4 years). Improved  economic conditions as well as other factors contributed to the improved  performance of recent cohorts. For example, a report from USDA\u2019s Office  of the Inspector General on RD\u2019s fiscal year 2014 financial statements  noted that losses that year were lower than expected for the 2012 through  2014 cohorts as a result of stricter credit requirements RHS had  implemented in response to the housing crisis. For instance, in 2009,  RHS began requiring lenders to provide additional documentation to  waive RHS underwriting guidelines for maximum borrower debt ratios and  adverse credit histories. Also, according to an RHS official, some  lenders may have tightened credit standards more than required by RHS  as a result of the housing crisis and the risks associated with managing  defaulted loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rural Development Has Been Developing Econometric Models to Address Limitations of Its Cost Estimation Method", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Process for Estimating Credit Subsidy Costs Is Based on Historical Averages", "paragraphs": ["RD\u2014the USDA division that estimates the credit subsidy costs of RHS\u2019s  guarantee program\u2014averages historical information on loan performance  to estimate certain expected cash outflows and inflows for loan cohorts.

Previously, RD  calculated the rates by averaging the average loss and recovery rates for  all prior loan cohorts. By using total dollar amounts instead of an average  of individual loss and recovery rates, RD\u2019s method of projecting losses  and recoveries for new loans accounts for variations in the size of loan  cohorts.

RD calculates an  expected prepayment rate for each year of the new cohort\u2019s life using  data on the prepayment experience of prior cohorts in corresponding  years. RD then uses the expectations for prepayments and loan  terminations (for example, defaulted loans resulting in loss claims) to  estimate the total outstanding loan balance expected at the end of each  year of the cohort\u2019s life. More specifically, RD reduces the amount of the  estimated outstanding loan balance by the amount of prepayments and  terminations expected each year. RD calculates the annual fee revenue  using the estimated outstanding loan balance and the annual fee rates in  effect at the time the guarantees were made. Finally, RD bases its  estimate of cash flows from up-front guarantee fees on the dollar value of  loans expected to be guaranteed in the given budget year and the  guarantee fee percentage in effect.", "Then, to estimate the credit subsidy rate for a new cohort, RD runs its  cash flow projections for losses, recoveries, and fees through OMB\u2019s  credit subsidy calculator.

To calculate reestimates, RD generally uses the same historical  averages methodology that it uses to calculate the original credit subsidy  estimates for new cohorts. However, according to RD officials, for the  2013 and 2014 reestimates, RD made adjustments to this method, as  follows:  Increased loss expectations for cohorts most affected by the  housing crisis (2005 through 2008 cohorts). RD\u2019s credit subsidy  auditor found that during the housing crisis, the historical averages  method underpredicted losses for certain cohorts. To more accurately  predict losses, the credit subsidy auditor recommended that RD  assess whether it should make manual adjustments to the reestimate  calculations for cohorts most affected by the crisis. As a result of this  assessment, RD increased loss amounts used to calculate the  average loss rates for the 2005 through 2008 cohorts. RD increased  the losses by a percentage equivalent to the difference between the  defaults predicted when using the historical averages approach for  each cohort and the actual defaults experienced by each cohort in the  most recent fiscal year.", "Decreased losses for cohorts made with higher credit standards  (2009 through 2014 cohorts). In a 2012 report, RD\u2019s credit subsidy  auditor also found that the historical averages method was likely  overpredicting losses for the 2009 through 2012 cohorts. Similarly, an  RD analysis in 2014 (that did not include the 2014 cohort) showed  that this method overpredicted losses for the 2009 through 2013  cohorts. According to RD, the overprediction of losses was due to the  historical averages method incorporating the unusually high defaults  of the 2005 through 2008 cohorts into the default projections for the  more recent cohorts. In addition, the cohorts guaranteed in 2009 and  later were originated using higher borrower credit standards, which  lowered their default risk, according to RD. To reduce the  overestimation of losses for more recent cohorts, RD removed the  default data for the 2005 through 2008 cohorts when calculating  historical average loss rates for certain cohorts. For example, for the  2014 reestimate, RD removed these data from the loss rate  calculation for the 2009 through 2014 cohorts.", "Third parties that reviewed these manual adjustments found them to be  acceptable. For example, RD\u2019s credit subsidy auditors found the  adjustments to be reasonable, and OMB approved the methodology used  to calculate the reestimates.

But subsequent analysis  illustrated some limitations in making manual adjustments to the historical  averages method. During the fiscal year 2014 audit, the credit subsidy  auditor found that RD still might have been overprojecting defaults for the  more recent cohorts even with the data exclusions.

Furthermore, the  auditor said that using an econometric modeling methodology would allow  RD to improve the quality of its estimates.", "The quality of the credit subsidy cost estimates produced by RD\u2019s  econometric models will depend on many factors. In a March 2004 report  on another federal guarantee program, we found that the choice of which  variables to include in an economic model is based on professional  judgement, statistical testing, and economic theory. Excluding key  predictive variables can reduce model quality. In addition, model  validation is important to help ensure the models continue to be  appropriate for the purpose they are intended and are calculating  correctly. Further, once the models are developed, regularly updating  them is important to help ensure their continued reliability.", "In addition to estimating credit subsidy costs, RHS program management  may be able to use the econometric models for other risk-management  functions. For instance, according to federal guidance, econometric  models can be used in policy formulation to estimate how alternative  changes to policies would affect future cash flows and thereby the  subsidy cost of the guarantees. Econometric models also may allow  RHS management to conduct simulations of portfolio performance under  different scenarios of future economic conditions. For example,  management could stress test the portfolio\u2014a technique that allows  managers to measure the vulnerability of the portfolio to unexpected  losses. RHS officials told us that they plan to use the econometric  models under development to help anticipate and assess potential risk to  the program caused by changing conditions such as a future economic  downturn."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "RHS Has Not Fully Aligned Its Policies and Procedures with OMB Guidance", "paragraphs": ["RHS\u2019s policies and procedures for the guarantee program were  consistent with 19 of 26 OMB A-129 standards for managing federal  credit programs, but were not fully consistent with the other 7.

An administrative offset is an enforcement remedy that allows  for the interception of certain federal payments\u2014for example, tax  refunds\u2014to collect past-due child support. RHS policy requires court- ordered payments such as child support to be considered in assessing an  applicant\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Additionally, RHS officials said  that delinquent child support payments should be reflected in an  applicant\u2019s credit report and that it was unlikely a lender would approve  an applicant with that type of adverse credit history. However, RHS policy  does not disqualify applicants solely on the basis of delinquent child  support payments and does not address the ineligibility of applicants  subject to administrative offsets for past-due child support. Furthermore,  RHS has lacked the information needed to identify these ineligible  applicants. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) maintains a  database of individuals subject to administrative offset that federal  agencies can access through Treasury\u2019s \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d portal. However,  RHS officials acknowledged that they had not yet taken the necessary  steps to access it because they were not aware of the tool.

For example, RHS lenders and servicers are  to be subject to periodic compliance reviews conducted either on-site (at  lenders\u2019 offices) or off-site (\u201cdesk\u201d reviews). RHS\u2019s compliance review  guide contains risk factors for prioritizing the reviews. RHS policy also  requires reviews of loss claim packages to determine whether lenders  fulfilled all program obligations and, if not, whether reduction or denial of  the loss claims would be warranted.", "However, RHS does not have policies and procedures that address all  aspects of two standards for lender and servicer eligibility. First, the  circular describes the various lender and servicer eligibility criteria  agencies should publish. Although RHS published a Federal Register  notice in 2013 containing such criteria, it did not include qualification  requirements for principal officers, such as years of experience in the  mortgage industry. The notice also does not include financial and capital  requirements for lenders not regulated by a federal financial institution  regulator (referred to as nonsupervised lenders). RHS officials said they  effectively relied on the requirements of other mortgage institutions, such  as FHA and VA, because approval by these institutions is generally the  means by which nonsupervised lenders become eligible to participate in  the guarantee program. They also expressed concern that imposing  additional requirements would increase the complexity of the lender  approval process. But FHA\u2019s and VA\u2019s requirements differ and may not  be well-suited for RHS\u2019s program. For example, FHA calibrates its net  worth requirement to the amount of FHA business a lender does.  Specifically, FHA requires nonsupervised lenders to have a minimum  adjusted net worth of $1 million, plus 1 percent of their total FHA business  volume in excess of $25 million, up to a maximum required adjusted net  worth of $2.5 million. As such, FHA\u2019s requirement does not take into  account any additional risk represented by a lender\u2019s business with RHS.  In contrast, VA requires nonsupervised lenders to have a minimum  adjusted net worth of $250,000 or have at least $50,000 in working  capital, regardless of lending volume. The suitability of VA\u2019s net worth  requirement for RHS may be limited, among other things, by VA\u2019s lower  loss coverage for lenders\u2014from 25 percent to 50 percent compared with  up to 90 percent for RHS. In previously issued work, we discussed the  view of some mortgage industry observers that a lower level of loss  coverage may provide lenders an incentive to improve underwriting  quality, thus reducing the risk of default. By not specifying its own  requirements, RHS increases the potential that entities that originate and  service RHS-guaranteed mortgages may lack the experience and  financial soundness to perform these functions in a manner that protects  RHS\u2019s financial interests or lack the ability to cover any liability for  violations of RHS requirements.", "Second, the circular states that agencies should review and document a  lender\u2019s or servicer\u2019s eligibility at least every 2 years. According to RHS  officials, the agency\u2019s practice is to biennially assess the eligibility of  previously approved lenders and servicers and to maintain documentation  of eligibility in paper files. They said that they issue instructions every  other year directing staff to complete the eligibility reviews within 180  days of the issuance date. However, RHS has not established standing  written policies or guidance requiring eligibility reviews to be completed at  least every 2 years. RHS officials said they had not seen the need to  disclose the 2-year review cycle to lenders by putting it in the guarantee  program handbook. Without explicitly stating the required frequency of  eligibility reviews, RHS increases the risk of not complying with the OMB  2-year minimum standard and of guaranteeing loans originated or  serviced by ineligible lenders. For example, RHS issued the 2013  instruction more than 2 years and 7 months after the 2011 instruction,  which is not consistent with a standard of reviewing eligibility within the  minimum 2-year time frame.", "While RHS\u2019s policies and procedures did not fully comply with all the  Circular A-129 standards for managing lenders and servicers, the agency  has been taking steps to improve its lender and servicer oversight. For  example, RHS officials told us that they were taking steps to automate the  eligibility recertification process, which could facilitate implementation of a  more regular and streamlined review of lenders and servicers. In addition,  RHS has proposed regulations that would strengthen its authority to  require lenders to indemnify (compensate) RHS for loss claims on  defaulted loans that were not properly underwritten. Current regulations  authorize RHS to seek indemnification within 24 months of loan closing  when RHS concludes that the lender did not comply with the agency\u2019s  underwriting standards. In March 2015, RHS issued a proposed rule that  would increase the indemnification period to 5 years. According to RHS,  the comment period has ended, and the agency plans to issue the final  rule upon completing its review of the comments. However, the agency  did not have a specific time frame for issuing the final rule.", "In addition, in December 2015, Congress enacted legislation authorizing  the Secretary of Agriculture to grant qualified lenders the authority to  determine the eligibility of loans for RHS guarantees without RHS\u2019s prior  approval (similar to FHA\u2019s and VA\u2019s single-family mortgage guarantee  programs).

For example,  RHS produces a monthly Portfolio Performance Report that includes  national summary statistics on delinquencies, foreclosures, loss mitigation  actions, and loss claims as well as detailed loss claim data organized by  state. Senior RHS officials, including the Undersecretary for Rural  Development, the RHS Administrator, the RHS Deputy Administrator for  Single Family Housing, and the Director of the guarantee program receive  these reports. In addition, program operations are structured to separate  key functions such as approval of loan guarantees and approval of loss  claims. Furthermore, agency contracting policies and procedures  incorporate requirements concerning the retention of inherently  governmental functions and require progress reporting for advisory and  assistance services contracts.

While RD has position descriptions for individuals  involved in risk-management functions that specify duties and  responsibilities, RHS does not have written procedures for a key part  of its risk-management structure and documented lines of  communication, as required by OMB\u2019s Circular A-129.", "Specifically, since 2009 RHS has had a Credit Policy Committee  that, according to RHS officials, meets regularly to detect, discuss,  and analyze credit quality issues and address them through policy  changes. However, as we testified in May 2015, the committee  operated without policies and procedures describing its purpose,  scope, membership, or decision-making process. We also  testified that RHS had not defined the roles and responsibilities of  committee members and did not prepare minutes of meeting  discussions and results. RHS officials said they saw no need to  formalize the committee\u2019s operations when the committee was  created because the staff was small and in frequent  communication. But in November 2015, the officials told us they  had drafted a charter for the committee in response to our  findings. Without written policies and procedures, accountability  for and transparency of the credit policy committee\u2019s activities may  be limited.", "Additionally, RHS has not documented the lines of communication  between the agency components that have risk-management  functions and responsibilities. RHS\u2019s risk-management structure is  decentralized and complex. According to RHS, it involves staff in  47 state offices; the Centralized Servicing Center and National  Financial and Accounting Operations Center in St. Louis, Missouri;  and USDA headquarters. RHS has basic organizational charts for  these components that show lines of authority, but has not  codified how and what types of information should flow among the  components. Instead, they share information on a less formal  basis built on established working relationships. While we found  evidence that communication on financial, budget, and operational  matters occurs between key staff, not documenting lines of  communication increases the risk that information flows will break  down in the event that these staff transfer or retire.", "Independent oversight and control functions for risk  management, including credit and operational risks. RHS\u2019s  management structure does not fully align with OMB standards or a  congressional directive, which call for an independent risk  management function. RHS officials identified various USDA  components that perform oversight and control functions and operate  independently of guaranteed loan program staff. For example, RD\u2019s  Office of the Chief Financial Officer oversees periodic management  control reviews of the guarantee program and other programs. These  reviews, which occur every 5 years, are designed to assess the  effectiveness and efficiency of management controls, inform senior  managers of the status of operations and internal controls, and  provide solutions to reduce or eliminate any deficiencies. In addition,  the Centralized Servicing Center reviews lenders\u2019 loss claims to help  ensure that lenders complied with program guidelines before the  agency pays the claims. However, neither RHS nor RD has an  independent function specifically tasked with identifying the range of  credit and operational risks facing the guarantee program. Circular A- 129 states that agencies should strongly consider the formalization of  risk-management functions through the creation of a risk- management office led by a Chief Risk Officer. Consistent with this  recommendation, the House Committee on Appropriations directed  RD in June 2014 to \u201cexpeditiously create and fill a position of Chief  Risk Officer\u201d whose responsibility would be to manage and mitigate  the agency\u2019s financial risk. RD officials told us that in early 2015  they had created a working group to examine how to create the  position, including looking at similar efforts at other federal agencies.  But as of March 2016, RD had not established the position. RD  officials told us they expected to create and fill the position sometime  in 2016 but did not have a more detailed timeline. As a result, RD\u2019s  efforts to manage and mitigate the risks of the guarantee program  may not be as effective as they could be.", "Performance indicators and risk thresholds. Although RHS uses a  number of indicators to assess the performance of its guaranteed  portfolio, two key indicators have limitations that diminish their  usefulness and appropriateness. In addition, RHS has not established  risk thresholds for the guarantee program.", "Circular A-129 states that agencies should establish and  periodically review appropriate performance measures for their  credit programs. According to RHS officials, since 2004, they have  compared the overall delinquency and foreclosure rates for RHS\u2019s  portfolio with corresponding rates for FHA\u2019s insured portfolio of 30- year fixed-rate mortgages. RHS officials justified the performance  measures based on the similarity of the FHA and RHS mortgage  programs. Additionally, they noted that performance data on  FHA\u2019s portfolio was readily available from a mortgage industry  group. RHS has established performance goals stating that RHS  should be within a specified range of FHA\u2019s delinquency and  foreclosure rates at the end of each fiscal year. Although RHS  generally has met these goals, the performance measures are not  fully consistent with certain attributes of successful performance  measures\u2014such as objectivity and reliability\u2014that we identified in  previously issued work. The weaknesses in the performance  measures are two-fold. First, a simple comparison of two portfolios  ignores potential differences in their composition\u2014for example, in  the age and geographic distribution of loans\u2014that may influence  loan performance and make comparisons of the portfolios invalid.  FHA maintains data that can be segmented by loan cohort and  property location, which could help address some limitations of the  industry group data. Second, it implies that FHA has been  effectively managing its risk. However, FHA has at times exhibited  shortcomings in this area. For example, in a 2006 report, we found  that FHA had not developed sufficient standards and controls to  manage risks associated with the substantial proportion of FHA- insured loans with down payment assistance. Because of these  weaknesses, a performance measure that does not account for  such portfolio differences may not provide a useful and  appropriate benchmark for RHS risk management.", "Circular A-129 also states that agencies should establish risk  thresholds for their credit programs. RHS has established a risk  appetite\u2014the amount and type of risk an organization is willing to  accept in pursuit of its objectives\u2014for the single-family guarantee  program. According to RHS officials, the program\u2019s risk appetite  is expressed primarily through the goal of making each annual  cohort of loan guarantees subsidy-neutral, while keeping  guarantee fees at a level affordable to low- and moderate-income  households. However, RHS has not established associated risk  thresholds\u2014that is, target values above which risks are not  tolerated or that trigger application of additional risk controls. For  example, RHS has not developed thresholds for the magnitude of  expected losses that are acceptable at the portfolio or loan level.", "Without established risk thresholds, RHS\u2019s ability to determine  when risk levels are too high is diminished.", "Reporting of performance information in watch lists and  dashboards. RHS\u2019s performance reports were not fully consistent  with the OMB standard concerning portfolio dashboards. RHS  produces three reports\u2014one specifically called a dashboard and two  others with some characteristics of a dashboard\u2014that generally  contain the types of quantitative information identified in the OMB  guidance. However, these reports do not include a qualitative  discussion of areas meriting increased management focus, as  specified in Circular A-129. RHS officials said they orally discussed  issues warranting greater management attention in briefings and  meetings in which the reports are used. However, by not highlighting  and documenting issues for management attention in the performance  reports, RHS increases the possibility that senior managers will not  have the information necessary to address emerging risks in a timely  manner.", "The inconsistencies we identified between RHS\u2019s policies and procedures  and Circular A-129 standards\u2014both for credit program management and  the areas discussed previously\u2014occurred, in part, because RD did not  compare and align its requirements with all elements of the circular.  Circular A-129 requires agencies to periodically conduct program reviews  that assess whether credit programs are achieving policy goals while  mitigating risk and cost to the taxpayer and minimizing displacement of  private credit markets. The reviews also should identify any area where a  program is not consistent with the requirements of Circular A-129,  evaluate the effects of any deviation, and whether the deviation is still  necessary. RD officials told us that RD\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial  Officer was primarily responsible for ensuring that policies and  procedures for the guarantee program were consistent with the circular.  They said that the office began reviewing the compliance of all RD credit  programs with the circular in 2014. RD officials said they did not expect to  complete the review of the single-family loan guarantee program until  2016. RD officials added that this program review was begun on an ad  hoc basis rather than part of a schedule. Furthermore, they noted that  because of the large number of credit programs RD operates, they  intended to complete the program reviews on a rotating basis, an  approach that does not establish priorities based on risk. Federal internal  control standards state that agencies should identify risks, including by  using qualitative and quantitative ranking activities, and have controls  such as policies and procedures to address risks. At present, RD  operates 27 loan and loan guarantee programs.

Furthermore, RHS has recently been granted the  authority to give qualified lenders the ability to determine the eligibility of  loans for guarantees without RHS\u2019s prior approval. These developments  underscore the importance of complying with requirements and standards  intended to improve the reliability of cost estimates and help ensure that  risks are prudently managed. RHS has taken a number of steps to  enhance its administration of the guarantee program, including  development of an econometric model to estimate credit subsidy costs  and potentially enhance risk analysis.", "However, RHS could further strengthen its policies and procedures for  managing the guarantee program by addressing inconsistencies with  Circular A-129 standards related to applicant screening, lender oversight,  management frameworks, and risk assessment and reporting. By doing  so, the agency would help decrease the risk that ineligible borrowers  would receive guaranteed loans and that unqualified or ineligible firms  would originate or service the loans. RHS also would enhance its  capabilities to manage its expanded portfolio and strengthen its ability to  identify and mitigate risks in a timely manner.

OMB staff provided technical comments, which we  incorporated into the report. USDA provided comments in an e-mail  from the audit liaison officer in RD\u2019s Financial Management Division.", "In its comments, RD agreed with or indicated that it was taking steps to  address 5 of our 11 recommendations and neither agreed or disagreed  with the remaining 6. Concerning our recommendation to enhance  screening of loan guarantee applicants using Treasury\u2019s Do Not Pay  portal, RD noted that it did not have the resources to manually conduct  Do Not Pay searches for all loan guarantee applicants at this time  because of the large volume of applicants and the technological  limitations of the portal. RD also said that RHS staff had completed the  Do Not Pay enrollment process and were working with Treasury to begin  accessing the portal as an additional verification resource. Concerning  our recommendation to create and fill a Chief Risk Officer position as  soon as practicable, RD said it planned to hire someone for the position in  fiscal year 2016. RD stated it agreed with our recommendations to  establish standing policies and procedures governing the frequency of  lender and servicer eligibility reviews, finalize and adopt policies and  procedures for the Credit Policy Committee, and document lines of  communication among components of the risk-management structure.", "For four of the six recommendations with which RD neither agreed nor  disagreed, RD said it recognized the underlying risk implications and was  continuing to consider the recommendations. The recommendations  concern the development of qualification requirements for principal  officers of guarantee program lenders and servicers, capital and financial  requirements for nonsupervised guarantee program lenders, risk  thresholds for the guarantee program, and improved measures for  comparing RHS and FHA loan performance. For the first three of these  recommendations, RD stated that \u201cexisting requirements may currently  address  concern,\u201d but it did not cite the requirements to which it was  referring or otherwise elaborate. We maintain that existing requirements  do not address the concerns underlying our recommendations. As our  report notes, RHS effectively relies on requirements of other mortgage  institutions (such as FHA and VA) for lender and servicer approval, and  these requirements may not be well-suited to RHS\u2019s program. For  example, FHA\u2019s net worth requirement for nonsupervised lenders is  calibrated to the amount of FHA business the lender does, and the  suitability of VA\u2019s net worth requirement for RHS is limited by the  substantially lower loss coverage of VA\u2019s program compared with RHS\u2019s.  Furthermore, while it is possible that detailed analysis of FHA and VA  requirements would find them sufficient for RHS\u2019s program, RHS did not  provide any evidence that it had conducted such an analysis. Regarding  risk thresholds, while our report notes that statutory limits exist on RHS\u2019s  annual business volume and the percentage of each mortgage it can  guarantee, these limits define RHS\u2019s maximum possible financial  exposure rather than loss tolerances established by agency  management. OMB Circular A-129 requirements, including the  requirement for establishing risk thresholds, outline steps agency officials  should take to manage the risks of their credit programs.", "For the remaining two recommendations\u2014which concern identifying  areas for increased management focus in dashboard reports and  prioritizing Circular A-129 program reviews based on risk\u2014RD elaborated  on current agency practices but did not indicate whether or how it planned  to address the recommendations. RD stated that its dashboard reports  provided differing levels of detail, but also acknowledged that they  contained no specific issues for increased focus despite the existence of  program challenges identified by agency staff. Including a qualitative  discussion of areas meriting greater attention in dashboard reports would  help ensure that agency managers address emerging risks in a timely  manner. Finally, RD described its process for prioritizing programs for  Management Control Reviews. As we described in our report, these  periodic reviews are a USDA requirement designed to determine whether  necessary controls are in place and producing intended results, comply  with applicable laws and regulations, and provide solutions to reduce or  eliminate any deficiencies. While we acknowledge RHS\u2019s risk-based  process for prioritizing programs for Management Control Reviews, our  recommendation addressed program reviews required by OMB Circular  A-129. Although the two types of reviews may be complementary, the A- 129 program reviews are broader in scope than Management Control  Reviews. For example, A-129 program reviews should assess whether  programs are achieving policy goals while mitigating risk and cost to the  taxpayer and minimizing displacement of private credit markets. In  addition, they should identify any area in which a program is not  consistent with the requirements of Circular A-129, and evaluate the  effects of any deviation and if the deviation is still necessary. USDA and  RD instructions for Management Control Reviews do not include these  requirements and do not reference A-129. Using a risk-based approach  for selecting programs for A-129 program reviews, rather than the  rotational process RD previously described and that we discussed in our  report, would help RD manage its multiple credit programs in the most  effective manner. We added language to the body of our report and to our  recommendation to clarify that our focus was on risk-based selection of  programs for program reviews conducted in accordance with A-129  requirements.", "In addition, in its comments, RD concurred with our characterization of  trends in the estimated long-term costs of the guarantee program and  RD\u2019s efforts to develop an econometric model to improve the quality of  cost estimates. RD also said that, based on its preliminary analysis, the  econometric models will correct for the overestimation of future losses  that resulted from using the historical method in recent years. As a result,  RD said that it expects its 2016 credit subsidy reestimate will be a  downward reestimate. RD also provided clarification on the role of RD\u2019s  Office of the Chief Financial Officer in reviewing RHS actions to address  Office of the Inspector General audit recommendations.

We reviewed related requirements and  guidance, including the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990; the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-11 (Preparation,  Submission, and Execution of the Budget); the Federal Accounting  Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Federal Financial Accounting and Auditing  Technical Release 6 (Preparing Estimates for Direct Loan and Loan  Guarantee Subsidies under the Federal Credit Reform Act); and the  Government-wide Audited Financial Statement Task Force Subcommittee  on Credit Reform Issue Paper 96-CR-7 (Model Credit Program Methods  and Documentation for Estimating Subsidy Rates and the Model  Information Store). We examined documentation on the processes and  tools Rural Development (RD) uses to determine subsidy costs for the  guarantee program, including RD\u2019s cash flow model and technical and  other guidance associated with the model. We also reviewed  documentation of analyses RD\u2019s independent financial statement auditor  conducted on the model as part of RD\u2019s fiscal years 2012 through 2014  financial statement audits and associated findings and recommendations.  In addition, we reviewed analyses conducted by an independent  contractor in 2013 on the model\u2019s ability to predict cash flows and  associated recommendations. To obtain information about manual  adjustments made to the model for credit subsidy cost reestimates in  recent years, we interviewed officials from RD\u2019s Office of the Chief  Financial Officer, including staff from the National Financial and  Accounting Operations Center. In addition, we reviewed the contract RD  awarded for the development of an econometric model for estimating  credit subsidy costs for future budgets and interviewed RHS and RD  officials and contractor staff on their plans for and progress on developing  the model.", "To provide context for recent trends in the program\u2019s credit subsidy costs,  we analyzed RD data on the number of loans guaranteed annually from  fiscal year 1992 (the first year RHS made guarantees nationwide) through  fiscal year 2014 and the total dollar amount of outstanding guarantees  each year in fiscal years 2004 through 2014. We also analyzed RD data  on loss amounts for the fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2013 cohorts  as of September 30, 2014. Specifically, we calculated cumulative loss  rates by cohort and year from origination. The cumulative loss rates  represent the total losses at a given point in time divided by the original  dollar volume of loans guaranteed. To assess the reliability of these data,  we reviewed related documentation, including information about their  source systems and how the data were compiled. We also interviewed  RD officials knowledgeable about the data and compared them with other  data sources, where possible. We concluded that the data elements we  used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing trends in the  guarantee program\u2019s business activity, portfolio size, and loss experience.  Additionally, we obtained extracts of RHS loan-level data, including loan  and borrower characteristics and performance information, for guarantees  made in fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to confirm that RHS maintained  the types of data suitable for credit subsidy cost modeling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consistency with OMB Standards for Managing Credit Programs", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which RHS\u2019s policies and procedures were  consistent with OMB standards, we reviewed OMB Circular A-129  (Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables). We  focused on part III of the guidance, which contains a number of standards  pertinent to risk management for a loan guarantee program, including  standards for credit extension (applicant screening, loan documentation,  and collateral requirements), credit program management (management  and oversight and data-driven decision making), and management of  guaranteed loan lenders and servicers (lender and servicer eligibility,  agreements, reviews, and corrective actions). We reviewed RHS\u2019s  policies and procedures for these functions contained in regulations,  handbooks, and other guidance and documentation. These included U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) and RD policies, Federal Register  notices, regulations, and RD and RHS organizational charts and position  descriptions. They also included the guarantee program\u2019s technical  handbook, lender and servicer compliance review guides, loss mitigation  and loss claim guides, Guaranteed Underwriting System guidance,  administrative notices, unnumbered letters (a type of internal guidance),  annual reports, and portfolio performance reports. We assessed the  extent to which they were consistent with the OMB A-129 standards. For  several of the OMB standards, we identified related, sound risk  management practices cited in documents from other organizations.  These included previously issued GAO reports on risk management  frameworks, federal internal control standards, and attributes of  successful performance measures and publications from the Committee  on the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and the  International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers.", "To supplement our understanding of the OMB guidance and RHS\u2019s  policies and procedures, we interviewed OMB staff knowledgeable of the  2013 update of Circular A-129 and various USDA officials. The USDA  officials included the RHS Administrator, Deputy Administrator, and  Director of the Single Family Housing Guarantee Loan Division, as well  as staff from that division, RHS\u2019s Centralized Servicing Center, and RD\u2019s  Office of the Chief Financial Officer (which includes the National Finance  and Accounting Operations Center). These interviews typically included  representatives from an RHS contractor with responsibilities for producing  risk analytics and conducting compliance reviews of national lenders and  servicers.", "To determine what prior audits and evaluations of the guarantee program  had found, we met with USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General and reviewed  pertinent Inspector General audit reports. We also reviewed RD\u2019s 2008  and 2013 management control reviews for the guarantee program. For  both the Inspector General reports and the management control reviews,  we determined the status of recommendations made to address  deficiencies in program management and implementation. We also  reviewed nationwide summaries of RD state internal reviews, which  include the guarantee program in their scope, for fiscal years 2012  through 2014. We did not verify RHS\u2019s compliance with its own policies  and procedures or assess their effectiveness. However, the prior audits  and evaluations we reviewed included compliance testing and reviews of  information documenting RHS actions to address any recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 to March 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
