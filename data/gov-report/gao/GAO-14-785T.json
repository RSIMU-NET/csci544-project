This statement summarizes the results of GAO's past work on the oversight of high-containment laboratories, those designed for handling dangerous pathogens and emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, this statement addresses (1) the need for governmentwide strategic planning for the requirements for high-containment laboratories, including assessment of their risks; (2) the need for national standards for designing, constructing, commissioning, operating, and maintaining such laboratories; and (3) the oversight of biosafety and biosecurity at high-containment laboratories.

Since the 1990s, the number of high-containment laboratories has risen; however, the expansion of high-containment laboratories was not based on a government-wide coordinated strategy. Instead, the expansion was based on the perceptions of individual agencies about the capacity required for their individual missions and the high-containment laboratory activities needed to meet those missions, as well as the availability of congressionally approved funding. Consequent to this mode of expansion, there was no research agenda linking all these agencies, even at the federal level, that would allow for a national needs assessment, strategic plan, or coordinated oversight. As GAO last reported in 2013, after more than 12 years, GAO has not been able to find any detailed projections based on a government-wide strategic evaluation of research requirements based on public health or national security needs. Without this information, there is little assurance of having facilities with the right capacity to meet the nation's needs.", "GAO's past work has found a continued lack of national standards for designing, constructing, commissioning, and operating high-containment laboratories. As noted in a 2009 report, the absence of national standards means that the laboratories may vary from place to place because of differences in local building requirements or standards for safe operations. Some guidance exists about designing, constructing, and operating high-containment laboratories. Specifically, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories guidance recommends various design, construction, and operations standards, but GAO's work has found it is not universally followed. The guidance also does not recommend an assessment of whether the suggested design, construction, and operational standards are achieved. As GAO has reported, national standards are valuable not only in relation to new laboratory construction but also in ensuring compliance for periodic upgrades.", "No one agency is responsible for determining the aggregate or cumulative risks associated with the continued expansion of high-containment laboratories; according to experts and federal officials GAO interviewed for prior work, the oversight of these laboratories is fragmented and largely self-policing.", "On July 11, 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on the potential exposure to anthrax that described a number of actions that CDC plans to take within its responsibilities to avoid another incident like the one in June. The incident in June was caused when a laboratory scientist inadvertently failed to sterilize plates containing samples of anthrax, derived with a new method, and transferred them to a facility with lower biosecurity protocols. This incident and the inherent risks of biosecurity highlight the need for a national strategy to evaluate the requirements for high-containment laboratories, set and maintain national standards for such laboratories' construction and operation, and maintain a national strategy for the oversight of laboratories that conduct important work on highly infectious pathogens."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This testimony contains no new recommendations, but GAO has made recommendations in prior reports to responsible agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to participate in today\u2019s hearing to address  recent biosecurity incidents.

On July 1, 2014, at the Bethesda, Maryland, National  Institutes of Health (NIH), vials of potentially live smallpox (variola) virus  were unexpectedly discovered. Public attention is once again focused on  the importance of maintaining biosafety and biosecurity protocols at high- containment laboratories.", "My statement summarizes the results of our past work on the oversight of  high-containment laboratories and our preliminary assessment of the  recent incident in Atlanta. Since 2007, we have reported on several  issues associated with the proliferation of high-containment laboratories  and risks posed by past biosafety incidents. The public is concerned  about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to  dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have  disastrous consequences. Highly publicized laboratory errors and  controversy about where high-containment laboratories should be located  have raised questions about whether the governing framework,  standards, and oversight for biosafety and biosecurity measures are  adequate.", "This testimony is primarily based on GAO\u2019s past work on high- containment laboratories.

For our preliminary observations, on the June 5\u201313, 2014  biosafety incident at CDC\u2019s laboratories we interviewed CDC officials and  reviewed agency documents and scientific literature. We provided a draft  of this statement to CDC for technical review and addressed their  comments in the body of our statement where appropriate. We also  reviewed CDC\u2019s July 11, 2014, Report on the Potential Exposure to  Anthrax. The work this statement is based on was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Information about their number, location, activities, and ownership is  available for high-containment laboratories registered with CDC\u2019s Division  of Select Agent and Toxins (DSAT) or the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)  as part of the Federal Select Agent Program.

For example, we noted in our 2009 report that the  absence of national standards means that the laboratories may vary from  place to place because of differences in local building requirements or  standards for safe operations. In 2007, while investigating a power outage  at one of its recently constructed BSL-4 laboratory, CDC determined that  construction workers digging at an adjacent site had some time earlier cut  a critical grounding cable buried outside the building. CDC facility  managers had not noticed that cutting the grounding cable had  compromised the electrical system of the facility that housed the BSL-4  laboratory. It became apparent that the building\u2019s integrity as it related to  the adjacent construction had not been adequately supervised.

Although technology and improved scientific practice guidance have  reduced the risk in high-containment laboratories, the risk is not zero (as  illustrated by the recent incidents and others during the past decade).  According to CDC officials, the risks from accidental exposure or release  can never be completely eliminated and even laboratories within  sophisticated biological research programs\u2014including those most  extensively regulated\u2014has and will continue to have safety failures. Many  experts agree that as the number of high-containment laboratories has  increased, so the overall risk of an accidental or deliberate release of a  dangerous pathogen will also increase.", "Oversight is critical in improving biosafety and ensuring that high- containment laboratories comply with regulations. However, our work has  found that aspects of the current oversight programs provided by DSAT  and APHIS depend on entities\u2019 monitoring themselves and reporting  incidents to the regulators. For example, with respect to a certification that  a select agent had been rendered sterile (that is, noninfectious), DSAT  officials told us, citing the June 2014 updated guidance, that \u201cthe burden  of validating non-viability and non-functionality remains on the individual  or entity possessing the select agent, toxin, or regulated nucleic acid.\u201d", "While DSAT does not approve each entity\u2019s scientific procedure, DSAT  strongly recommends that \u201can entity maintain information on file in  support of the method used for rendering a select agent non-viable . . . so  that the entity is able to demonstrate that the agent . . . is no longer  subject to the select agent regulations.\u201d Biosafety select agent regulations  and oversight critically rely on laboratories promptly reporting any  incidents that may expose employees or the public to infectious  pathogens.

According to CDC\u2019s  report, on June 5, a laboratory scientist in the BSL-3 Bioterrorism Rapid  Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) laboratory prepared  protein extracts from eight bacterial select agents, including Bacillus  anthracis, under high-containment (BSL-3) conditions.were being prepared for analysis by matrix-assisted laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a  relatively new technology that can be used for rapid bacterial species  identification. Also, according to CDC officials that we spoke to this  protein extraction procedure was being evaluated in a preliminary  assessment of whether MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry could provide a  cheaper and faster way to detect a range of pathogenic agents, including  anthrax, compared to conventional methods and thus could be used by  emergency response laboratories. According to CDC officials, the  researchers intended to use the data collected in this experiment to  submit a joint proposal to CDC\u2019s Office of Public Health Preparedness  and Response to fund further evaluation of the MALDI TOF method   These samples  because MALDI TOF is increasingly being used by clinical and hospital  laboratories for infectious disease diagnostics.", "The protein extraction procedure was chemically based and intended to  render the pathogens noninfectious, which alternative extraction  procedures would have done using heat, radiation, or other chemical  treatments that took longer. The procedure that was used to extract the  proteins was not based on a standard operating procedure that had been  documented as appropriate for all the pathogens in the experiment and  reviewed by more senior scientific or management officials. Rather, the  scientists used a procedure identified by the MALDI TOF equipment  manufacturer that had not been tested for effectiveness, in particular, for  rendering spore-forming organisms such as anthrax noninfectious.  Following that procedure, the eight pathogens were exposed to chemical  treatment for 10 minutes and then plated (spread on plates to test for  sterility or noninfectious status) and incubated for 24 hours. According to  CDC, on June 6, when no growth was observed on sterility plates after 24  hours, the remaining samples, which had been held in the chemical  solution for 24 hours, were moved to CDC BSL-2 laboratories for testing  using the MALDI TOF technology. Importantly, the plates containing the  original sterility samples were left in the incubation chamber rather than  destroyed as would normally occur because of technical problems with  the autoclave that would have been used for destruction.", "According to CDC officials, on June 13, a laboratory scientist in the  BRRAT laboratory observed unexpected growth on the anthrax sterility  plate, possibly indicating that the sample was still infectious. (All the other  pathogen protein samples showed no evidence of growth.) That scientist  and a colleague immediately reported the discovery to the CDC Select  Agent Responsible Official (RO) in accordance with the BRRAT  Laboratory Incident Response Plan. That report triggered a response that  immediately recovered the samples that had been sent to the BSL-2  laboratories and returned them to BSL-3 containment, and a response  effort that lasted a number of days was implemented to identify any CDC  employees who might have been affected by exposure to live anthrax  spores. (The details of the subsequent actions and CDC\u2019s lessons  learned and proposed actions are described in CDC\u2019s July 11, 2014,  Report on Potential Exposure to Anthrax. That report indicates that none  of the potentially affected employees experienced anthrax-related  adverse medical symptoms.)", "Our preliminary analysis indicates that the BRRAT laboratory was using a  MALDI-TOF MS method that had been designed for protein extraction but  not for the inactivation of pathogens and that it did not have a standard  operating procedure (SOP) or protocol on inactivation. We did not find a  complete set of SOPs for removing agents from a BSL-3 laboratory in a  safe manner. Further, neither the preparing (BRRAT BSL-3) laboratory  nor the receiving laboratory (BRRAT BSL-2) laboratory conducted sterility  testing. Moreover, the BRRAT laboratory did not have a kill curve based  on multiple concentration levels.", "When we visited CDC on July 8, it became apparent to us, that a major  cause of this incident was the implementation of an experiment to prepare  protein extractions for testing using the MALDI TOF technology that was  not based on a validated standard operating procedure. acknowledged that significant and relevant studies in the scientific  literature about chemical procedures studied for preparing protein  samples for use in the MALDI TOF technology, were successful in  rendering tested pathogens noninfectious, except for anthrax. The  literature clearly recommends an additional filtering step before  concluding that the anthrax samples are not infectious. Our preliminary  work indicates that this step was not followed for all the materials in this  incident.", "Validating a procedure or method provides a defined level of statistical confidence in the  results of the procedure or method. staff did not perform sterility testing on the suspension received in March  2004.", "CDC\u2019s 2004 report further stated that \u201cResearch laboratory workers  should assume that all inactivated B. anthracis suspension materials are  infectious until inactivation is adequately confirmed [using BSL-2  laboratory procedures].\u201d These recommendations are relevant to the June  2014 incident in Atlanta but were not followed. The laboratories receiving  the protein extractions were BSL-2 laboratories, but the activities  associated with testing with the MALDI TOF technology were conducted  on open laboratory benches, not using biocontainment cabinets otherwise  available in such laboratories.", "CDC\u2019s July 11, 2014, Report on the Potential Exposure to Anthrax  describes a number of actions that CDC plans to take within its  responsibilities to avoid another incident like the one in June.
