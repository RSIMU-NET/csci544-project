S. energy needs rest heavily on ship-based imports. Tankers bring 55 percent of the nation's crude oil supply, as well as liquefied gases and refined products like jet fuel. This supply chain is potentially vulnerable in many places here and abroad, as borne out by several successful overseas attacks on ships and facilities.

GAO's review spanned several foreign and domestic ports, and multiple steps to analyze data and gather opinions from agencies and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The supply chain faces three main types of threats--suicide attacks such as explosive-laden boats, \"standoff\" attacks with weapons launched from a distance, and armed assaults. Highly combustible commodities such as liquefied gases have the potential to catch fire or, in a more unlikely scenario, explode, posing a threat to public safety. Attacks could also have environmental consequences, and attacks that disrupt the supply chain could have a severe economic impact. Much is occurring, internationally and domestically, to protect tankers and facilities, but significant challenges remain. Overseas, despite international agreements calling for certain protective steps, substantial disparities exist in implementation. The United States faces limitations in helping to increase compliance, as well as limitations in ensuring safe passage on vulnerable transport routes. Domestically, units of the Coast Guard, the lead federal agency for maritime security, report insufficient resources to meet its own self imposed security standards, such as escorting ships carrying liquefied natural gas. Some units' workloads are likely to grow as new liquefied natural gas facilities are added. Coast Guard headquarters has not developed plans for shifting resources among units. Multiple attack response plans are in place to address an attack, but stakeholders face three main challenges in making them work. First, plans for responding to a spill and to a terrorist threat are generally separate from each other, and ports have rarely exercised these plans simultaneously to see if they work effectively together. Second, ports generally lack plans for dealing with economic issues, such as prioritizing the movement of vessels after a port reopens. The President's maritime security strategy calls for such plans. Third, some ports report difficulty in securing response resources to carry out planned actions. Federal port security grants have generally been directed at preventing attacks, not responding to them, but a more comprehensive risk-based approach is being developed. Decisions about the need for more response capabilities are hindered, however, by a lack of performance measures tying resource needs to effectiveness in response."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This is a public version of a report we issued in March 2007 that contained  Sensitive Security Information related to the transportation of energy  commodities by tanker. Specific details regarding the nature of security  conditions and operations at specific ports, and specific findings related to  response plans and results of exercises that are sensitive were removed.  We worked with the cognizant agencies to ensure that this version would  not contain Sensitive Security Information. No additional audit work was  performed for the completion of this version. The conclusions and  recommendations of our March 2007 report remain generally unchanged.", "The United States economy is dependent on oil, gas, and other energy  commodities that are transported from overseas by ship. For example, in  2005, approximately 55 percent of the nation\u2019s crude oil supply\u2014one of  the main sources of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, heating oil, and many  other petroleum products\u2014and approximately 3 percent of the natural gas  supply, was imported by tanker. Daily ship-based imports of crude oil  averaged about 8.5 million barrels, or the equivalent of about four  supertankers arriving at U.S. terminals each day. In addition to crude oil,  the United States also imports highly combustible liquid energy products,  such as gasoline, jet fuel, and liquefied gases, such as liquefied petroleum  gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas is converted to  LNG by cooling it to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point it  becomes a liquid. In its liquid form, natural gas reduces to more than  1/600th of its volume as a gas, making it feasible to transport over long  distances. Daily ship-based imports of LNG now average about 1.7 billion  cubic feet, or the equivalent of two LNG tankers arriving at a U.S. port  every 3 days. This already extensive reliance on imported energy  commodities is expected to increase\u2014and for LNG, to grow substantially.  The Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2015, the amount  of crude oil imported into the United States will increase by nearly 4  percent, while the amount of imported LNG will grow more than 400  percent.", "Transporting these often hazardous commodities by sea involves a global  supply chain with many players. For energy commodities imported by the  United States, this supply chain has three main activities: loading it aboard  a ship at a foreign facility, shipping it across oceans and waterways, and  unloading it at a facility in this country. Waterborne shipments originate at  facilities in a variety of countries\u2014for crude oil, primarily in Mexico, Saudi  Arabia, Venezuela, and Nigeria, and for LNG, primarily in Algeria and  Trinidad and Tobago. Overseas facilities where tankers are loaded are  owned by the private sector, governments, or combinations of the two.  Foreign governments play a substantial role in overseeing the security of  energy export operations. Shipment of these commodities likewise  involves vessels owned by many different companies, as well as  transportation routes across international waters that no government  controls. In 2006, there were approximately 3,550 registered crude oil  tankers of 300 gross tons or more, along with 200 registered LNG tankers.  Most of these vessels are registered in countries other than the United  States, which means the United States has limited oversight authority over  these vessels\u2019 crews or condition until they enter U.S. waters. Once the  crude oil or LNG tanker arrives in the United States, it is unloaded at  terminals that may be on the Atlantic, Gulf, or Pacific coasts. LNG is  currently unloaded at one of five locations. As demand for natural gas  grows, the number of domestic LNG unloading locations is expected to  increase. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must  approve each onshore LNG terminal siting and construction application,  has already approved 11 additional terminals, and dozens more have been  proposed.", "This supply chain, while critical, is also vulnerable to disruption by  terrorists. Port facilities are inherently vulnerable, because they must  provide access by land and sea and because they are sprawling  installations, often close to population centers. Likewise, the ships that  transport these products are vulnerable because they travel on direct  routes that are known in advance and, for part of their journey, they may  have to travel through waters that do not allow them to maneuver away  from possible attacks. Since so many different players are involved,  terrorists have room to probe the supply chain for the weakest link.  Despite an often heavy security presence, terrorists have attempted\u2014and  in some cases carried out\u2014several attacks on this supply chain since  September 11, 2001. To date, these attacks have included attempts to  damage tankers or disrupt loading operations in or near overseas ports.  For example, in 2004 terrorists coordinated an attack against two offshore  oil terminals in Iraq where tankers were loading, and in 2002 terrorists  conducted a suicide boat attack against the French supertanker Limburg  off the coast of Yemen.", "Much of the international framework for protecting this supply chain and  preventing pollution from vessels is laid out in international conventions.  The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code was adopted  under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) by  the Conference of Contracting Governments to the International  Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). In accordance with the  SOLAS Convention as amended in 2002, the code establishes requirements  for contracting governments of countries where ports are located,  contracting governments of countries where ships are registered,  operators of port facilities, and operators of vessels traveling on the high  seas. Individual nations can set higher standards for facilities on their soil  and for vessels registered in that country. The United States has chosen to  set higher standards, largely through the Maritime Transportation Security  Act of 2002 (MTSA). Enacted after the September 11, 2001, attacks, MTSA  places much of the responsibility for coordinating and overseeing security  efforts with the federal government\u2014and more specifically with the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies, such as the U.S.  Coast Guard. Another international agreement developed under IMO  auspices is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution  from Ships, which entered into force in 1983 and was intended to prevent  pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or  accidental causes. Included in its provisions was pollution by oil,  chemicals, and harmful substances. In the United States, Congress passed  the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil  spill. OPA 90 addressed prevention, response, and compensation for oil  pollution from vessels and facilities in U.S. waters and the shoreline. OPA  90 greatly increased federal oversight of maritime oil transportation by  setting new requirements for vessel construction and crew licensing and  manning, mandating contingency planning, enhancing federal response  capability, broadening enforcement authority, and increasing penalties.", "In setting U.S. policy with regard to homeland security, both Congress and  the Administration have endorsed making decisions on the basis of risk\u2014 that is, on identifying critical infrastructure, determining what is most at  risk, and applying sound measures designed to make cost-effective use of  resources and funding. As groups such as the 9/11 Commission have  pointed out, no amount of money can totally insulate seaports from attack  by a well-funded and determined enemy. Managing on the basis of risk  acknowledges the trade-offs inherent in deciding how finite resources  should be spent.", "Federal actions to prevent attacks against the energy supply chain involve  coordination with the many players involved, including foreign  governments; foreign and domestic corporations that own and operate the  ships that carry energy commodities; companies that import, refine, and  market petroleum and liquefied gases; and a host of state and local  governmental agencies. At the state and local levels, fire and police  departments would be the first responders, with support from emergency  management, environmental, and transportation departments. Private  sector agencies, such as oil or gas facility terminal operators, vessel  management companies, and oil spill response organizations, would also  be involved. Finally, multiple federal agencies would also respond. In  particular, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) would have primary responsibility for leading the  response effort.", "To help evaluate how secure the maritime energy supply chain is and how  the United States would respond in the event of a terrorist attack, you  asked us to review security and safety efforts taken to date. This report  addresses three questions:    What are the types of terrorist threats to tankers carrying energy  commodities and the potential consequences of a successful attack?", "What measures are being taken to protect these tankers, and what  challenges do federal agencies face in making these actions effective?", "If a terrorist attack succeeds despite these protective measures, what  plans are in place to respond and what are the potential challenges in  responding to an attack?", "To address these objectives, we conducted a wide range of activities  overseas and in the United States. Overseas, we met with officials from the  IMO, foreign government security agencies, vessel and facility operators,  international industry associations, vessel and cargo insurers, and risk  management companies. We conducted our overseas work primarily in  five countries, which we selected for specific reasons related to their role  in the supply chain, the sophistication of their security procedures, or the  presence of key stakeholders. In the United States, we met with officials in  many federal departments and agencies, including the Departments of  Homeland Security, Defense, State, Energy, Transportation, and Justice;  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and the Environmental  Protection Agency. We met with a variety of state and local government  officials dealing with homeland security, emergency response, and law  enforcement, as well as with operators of oil cleanup organizations,  petroleum tankers, liquefied gas carriers, and their attendant unloading  facilities. We also visited field units of the U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and  Border Protection, the FBI, and a nonprobability sample of petroleum and  liquefied gas import and export facilities. In these visits we observed  security practices firsthand, and conducted interviews with officials. We  obtained and reviewed studies on the consequences of an attack, obtained  additional views from experts, and specifically convened a panel of  academic and industry experts to determine the potential consequences of  an incident involving LNG. We analyzed databases, progress reports,  regulations, and guidance documents we obtained from the Coast Guard  and Federal Energy Regulatory Administration. We obtained necessary  information from the Coast Guard to review the reliability of the  information contained in the databases used in this report. Appendix I  contains a more detailed discussion of our methodology. We conducted  our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards from April 2005 through February 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Stakeholders Are Involved in Securing the Maritime Energy Supply Chain", "paragraphs": ["Numerous international and domestic organizations play a role in the  security of maritime energy commodities. The list of stakeholders outside  the United States is quite diverse. They include international organizations,  governments of nations where tankers load or where tankers are  registered, and owners and operators of tankers or facilities (see table 1).", "On the domestic side, the U.S. Coast Guard is the lead federal agency and  is responsible for a wide array of maritime safety and security activities.  Other U.S. government agencies support the Coast Guard\u2019s maritime  security mission by addressing a wide range of issues that affect the flow  of cargo and people into the United States. State and local governments  and the private sector also have responsibilities to secure domestic ports.  Table 2 lists key federal agencies and other stakeholders on the domestic  side, together with examples of the kinds of maritime security activities  performed.", "All of these international and domestic stakeholders help to ensure the  safety and security of a global supply chain that brings energy  commodities to the United States. This supply chain spans the globe and  reaches many regions of the world. Each day, the United States imports  many different energy commodities from overseas suppliers in Africa,  Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America. Excluding  Canada, which supplies petroleum and natural gas to the United States via  pipeline, the vast majority of these varied imports arrive by tanker."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tankers Transport Energy Commodities around the World", "paragraphs": ["The various types of energy commodities require different handling  methods, and as a result, various kinds of tankers have been built to  accommodate them. An LNG carrier is designed for transporting LNG at  minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit, when gas liquefies and shrinks drastically  in volume. The cargo is transported in special tanks insulated to minimize  evaporation. LNG carriers are up to 1,000 feet long and have a draft (depth  below the water line) of 40 feet when fully loaded. The global LNG fleet is  expected to double from 200 in 2006 to over 400 by 2010. According to  industry reports, the existing fleet has completed more than 33,000  voyages without a substantial spill. Oil tankers are more numerous and  vary greatly in size. Tankers transporting crude oil from the Middle East  generally consist of Very Large Crude Carriers, which typically carry more  than 2 million barrels of oil per voyage. These ships are over 1,000 feet  long, nearly 200 feet wide, and have a draft of over 65 feet. Figure 1  shows a typical Very Large Crude Carrier. These ships are too big for most  U.S. ports and must transfer their loads to smaller tankers (a process  called lightering) or unload at an offshore terminal. At present, the United  States has only one such offshore terminal\u2014the Louisiana Offshore Oil  Port (LOOP). Most tankers transporting cargos from the Caribbean and  South America, by contrast, are smaller than Very Large Crude Carriers  and can enter U.S. ports directly.", "There are generally two enforcement systems aimed at ensuring that these  vessels are in compliance with applicable regulations, laws, and  conventions: flag state control and port state control. The flag state is the  country in which the vessel is registered. Flag state control can extend  anywhere in the world where the vessel operates. For example, a flag  state\u2019s requirements set the standards for the operation and maintenance  of all vessels flying that flag. If the flag state is a contracting government to  the SOLAS Convention, these standards are required to be at least as  stringent as those included in the ISPS Code. The port state is the country  where the port is located. Port state control is the process by which a  nation exercises its authority over foreign-flagged vessels operating in  waters subject to its jurisdiction. It is intended to ensure that vessels  comply with all domestic requirements for ensuring safety of the port,  environment, and personnel. Thus, when a foreign-flagged oil tanker  enters a U.S. port, the U.S. port state control program, administered by the  U.S. Coast Guard, becomes the primary means of marine safety  enforcement. For example, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires that all  tankers built after 1994 coming to the United States must have double  hulls\u2014that is, a two-layered hull to help prevent spills resulting from a  collision or grounding (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Commodities Originate in a Variety of Locations", "paragraphs": ["According to the Energy Information Administration, the United States  consumes more than 20 million barrels of petroleum every day.

The physical geography of the continents, for example,  forces shipping lanes to pass through certain narrow channels, or  chokepoints. There are approximately 200 such locations, but only a  handful are of strategic importance for the global energy supply (see fig.  6). A chokepoint by definition tends to be shallow and narrow, resulting in  impaired navigation and congestion from other tankers, cargo ships, and  other smaller vessels, which can impede the free and efficient flow of  goods. Moreover, several key chokepoints are surrounded by more than  one sovereign nation, resulting in a complex security environment within a  constrained physical space. Managing security in this environment  requires significant coordination among these countries to successfully  manage the security in these locations. According to the Energy  Information Administration, chokepoints are susceptible to pirate attacks  and shipping accidents in their narrow channels. In addition, chokepoints  can be blocked, mined, or rendered inaccessible by foreign naval forces,  with potentially devastating consequences for the flow of oil and goods  around the world and into the United States.", "The Straits of Hormuz and Malacca are two critical maritime shipping  chokepoints that tankers pass through regularly. The Strait of Hormuz,  which connects the oil fields of the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman  and the Indian Ocean, is the most important chokepoint in the world in  terms of the global energy supply, with about 20 percent of the world oil  supply, including 17 percent of U.S. petroleum imports passing through it.  Tankers with oil from the Persian Gulf must navigate through this  chokepoint in order to access the principal international shipping lanes  toward the United States. Another chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, links  the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean (and oil coming from the Middle  East) with the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean (and major  consuming markets in Asia). The Strait of Malacca is located among  Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and about 600 vessels pass through it  each day. Piracy and political instability in the region, especially in  Indonesia, are issues of concern for shipping operations in the strait. The  Energy Information Administration identified other important maritime  chokepoints, including the Bab el-Mandab passage from the Arabian Sea,  the Panama Canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Suez  Canal connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and the Bosporus  Straits linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.", "Besides facing vulnerabilities while in transit, vessels can be vulnerable  while moored at facilities where they are receiving or unloading their  cargoes, and the energy-related infrastructure located in ports can also be  vulnerable to attack. Vessels transiting into and out of ports and their  attendant infrastructure can be vulnerable in a number of ways. During  transit into and out of port, these vessels travel slowly, which increases  their exposure. Tankers follow timetables that are easy to track in advance  and they follow a fixed set of maritime routes. Once tankers arrive in this  country, they must wait offshore for pilots to navigate the ship channels  into many of the nation\u2019s ports.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, increased national attention  has been focused on the potential vulnerability of the nation\u2019s 361 major  seaports to terrorist attack. According to the National Strategy for  Maritime Security, the infrastructure and systems that span the maritime  domain have increasingly become both targets of and potential  conveyances for dangerous and illicit activities. GAO has previously  reported that ports are vulnerable because they are sprawling, interwoven  with complex transportation networks, close to crowded metropolitan  areas, and easily accessible. Ports and their maritime approaches,  including waterways and coastal areas, facilitate freedom of movement  and the flow of goods while allowing people, cargo, and vessels to transit  with relative anonymity. Some energy terminals are located in open seas  where they are accessible by water or air, while others are located in  metropolitan areas, along key shipping channels, or near pristine  environmental sanctuaries where they may be accessible by water, air, or  land."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Tanker Security Vulnerabilities Involves Setting Risks in the Context of Other Security and Nonsecurity Priorities", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was  widespread acknowledgement that numerous and substantial gaps existed  in homeland security.

It is improbable that any security  framework can successfully anticipate and thwart every type of potential  terrorist threat that highly motivated, well-skilled, and adequately funded  terrorist groups could perpetrate. While security efforts clearly matter,  various groups like the 9/11 Commission have emphasized that total  security cannot be bought no matter how much is spent on it. In short, the  nation cannot afford to protect everything against all threats, even within  the relatively narrow context of tanker security.

Overseas, terrorists  have demonstrated the ability to carry out at least three types of threats.  First, and of greatest concern, according to officials we spoke with, is a  suicide attack against a tanker or attendant facility. Second is a standoff  missile attack using a rocket or some other weapon launched from a  distance. Third is an armed assault by terrorists or armed bands while a  tanker is moored or in transit. There are additional types of threats,  including internal crew conspiracies and collisions with a vessel piloted by  terrorists. While attacks have so far occurred only overseas, two Coast  Guard admirals testified before Congress that malicious maritime  incursions into U.S. waters, such as immigrant or drug smuggling, occur  regularly. If an attack on a commodity tanker were successful in U.S.  waters or while docked at a U.S. unloading facility, substantial public  safety, environmental, and economic consequences could result. Public  safety and environmental consequences of an attack vary by commodity.

Several oil tankers were either docked at or in the vicinity of the  offshore terminals during the attack. Even though the speedboats  detonated prematurely and missed striking the oil tankers and the  offshore terminals, another small craft near the Khawr Al\u2019Amaya  terminal exploded when coalition forces attempted to intercept it,  killing two U.S. Navy sailors and a U.S. Coast Guardsman.

In February 2006, for example, terrorists  attempted to drive vehicles packed with explosives through the gates  of a major oil-processing facility in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern province. Al  Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed two Saudi  guards and represented the first direct assault on a Saudi oil  production facility.", "A second type of threat against tankers and attendant maritime  infrastructure is a standoff missile attack using a rocket, mortar, or rocket- propelled grenade launched from a sufficient distance to evade defensive  fire. Standoff missile attacks have been aimed at military ships in ports in  the Persian Gulf, but these kinds of attacks also represent a serious type of  threat against tankers. Terrorists launched such an attack using Katyusha  rockets in 2005, narrowly missing two U.S. naval ships moored at a  Jordanian port. Compared to suicide attacks, standoff attacks are easier to  execute, but are less likely to be as effective, according to intelligence  experts. The range, size, and accuracy of explosive projectiles used in  such an attack could vary considerably."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Armed Assaults", "paragraphs": ["Armed assaults, particularly at critical shipping chokepoints, represent a  third major type of threat to tankers along the energy supply chain,  according to the International Maritime Bureau. These attacks on tankers  and energy infrastructure have taken place where maritime security is  lacking and they have been carried out in most cases by pirates seeking to  gain control of the ship for financial gain, including petty theft and  kidnapping of crew for ransom. Pirate attacks against tankers and cargo  ships have taken place in numerous locations, including off the coast of  Somalia, in the Gulf of Guinea and Persian Gulf, and along the Strait of  Malacca. According to officials at the International Maritime Bureau, oil  tankers account for about one-quarter of all pirate attacks.

Crude oil and heavy petroleum products do not  dissipate quickly and must be removed from the water, posing a greater  environmental than public safety risk. Economic consequences of an  attack could be substantial, not so much because of the loss of a tanker or  its cargo, but because of the greater shock to the economy, particularly if  major transit routes, key facilities, or ports are closed.

The amount of heat radiated  away from a fire is related to how smoky the fire burns\u2014fires with a great  deal of smoke radiate much less heat because the dark smoke absorbs the  radiation. LNG and LPG vapor fires burn very cleanly, with little smoke,  and thus emit more heat than light petroleum product or crude oil fires.", "Besides the danger of fire, there is also a danger of explosions if LNG or  LPG vapors are ignited in a confined area, such as under a dock. If the  attack on a tanker occurred in a congested port area, an explosion could  damage infrastructure or harm people located nearby. In addition to  potential explosions of confined vapors, a particular type of explosion\u2014 called a boiling-liquid-expanding-vapor explosion\u2014can occur on tankers  that carry pressurized cargoes, such as some LPG tankers. In these  tankers, the individual tanks carrying the LPG may rupture violently if they  are compromised by heat or explosion. Since LNG is not transported in  pressurized tanks, this type of explosion is not likely to occur.", "Finally, people who come in contact with spilled refrigerated liquefied  gases could be burned due to the cryogenic (freeze) nature of the liquid.  LNG and LPG are both transported internationally in refrigerated tankers  that keep the gas so cold that it retains a liquid form. A spill of either LNG  or LPG could expose people close to the spill to the cold liquid and cause  cryogenic burns or frostbite. This is not likely to affect the public, but  could affect the crew on the tanker or other people located close to the  tanker.", "LNG and LPG spills pose little threat to the environment because they  almost entirely vaporize in a matter of minutes or hours and disperse into  the atmosphere. If an LNG or LPG spill were ignited, there could be  localized impacts on wildlife near the fire, but few other environmental  effects.", "Spills of light petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel,  can have both public safety and environmental consequences.

Consequently, light  petroleum products generally do not persist in the environment for long  unless the spill is churned by significant wave action. In that case, such  products can mix with water and will linger in the environment for much  longer periods of time. A 1996 spill highlighted the damage that can occur  when a light distillate oil is spilled in heavy wave conditions, resulting in  much of the oil mixing with water rather than evaporating. In this case, a  tank barge carrying home heating oil was grounded in the middle of a  storm near Point Judith, Rhode Island, spilling approximately 20,000  barrels of heating oil. An estimated 80 percent of the release was mixed  into the water, with only about 12 percent evaporating and about 10  percent staying on the surface of the water. The spill affected animals  and plants living on the sea bed, with an estimated mortality of 9 million  lobsters, 19.4 million clams, 7.6 million rock and hermit crabs, and 4.2  million fish.

Since these types of spills do not readily  evaporate, they can linger in the environment. Environmental cleanup of  crude oil and heavy petroleum product spills can take several years and in  some cases cost billions of dollars. According to ExxonMobil, the  company spent $2.2 billion on the Exxon Valdez cleanup. Crude oil and  heavy petroleum products can mix with water, particularly in the presence  of waves, causing small drops of water to be trapped inside the spilled oil.  This is called an emulsion and can hamper cleanup by making the spilled  oil difficult to skim off the water. This will greatly increase the volume of  the spill, since the water trapped within the oil also has to be removed. In  addition, residual oils are sometimes more dense than water, allowing  them to sink and contaminate bottom sediments. Finally, crude oil and  heavy petroleum products can coat birds and marine mammals, both  smothering the organisms and exposing them to them to hypothermia as  their feathers and fur lose the ability to insulate.", "While crude oil and heavy petroleum products evaporate, they produce  few flammable vapors. For instance, less than half of a crude oil spill and  10 percent of heavy petroleum product spills will evaporate into vapors  that could burn or explode.

One  tanker carries a small percentage of the total daily demand for a  commodity. As mentioned above, Very Large Crude Carriers typically  carry more than 2 million barrels of oil per voyage, which is about 10  percent of U.S. daily oil consumption. In most cases, the relatively small  volume in an individual tanker could be replaced with other imports or  from domestic storage. Two examples show the relatively small effect on  supply if the broader supply network is not substantially affected:    The approximately 240,000 barrels of oil released into Prince William  Sound by the Exxon Valdez represented about 20 minutes of total U.S.  oil consumption in 1989. The spill\u2019s actual disruption was somewhat  greater: According to the Department of Energy, the incident actually  resulted in an oil supply disruption of 13 million barrels of oil over 13  days, because the spill restricted tanker transport in Prince William  Sound and the volume of oil piped from the Alaskan North Slope also  had to be reduced. Still, even this 13 million barrel disruption  represented only about 18 hours of total national consumption.", "More recently, an approximately 6,300-barrel oil spill in November 2004  significantly reduced tanker traffic on a stretch of the Delaware River  for more than a week. As a result, a nearby refinery had to reduce  production of refined products because of reduced crude oil  availability. The oil spill also threatened to contaminate the water  intake system of a nuclear power plant along the river, which was  temporarily shut down. Despite these reductions in energy supply,  gasoline prices actually dropped in the days after the oil spill.", "The loss of a tanker carrying crude oil or heavy petroleum commodities  will pose additional economic costs for ship replacement and  environmental cleanup. Tankers can cost about $150 million, and the lost  cargo could cost over $100 million dollars more. The Delaware River oil  spill cleanup cost about $175 million over the course of 1 year.

A successful attack while a tanker was  docked, for example, could result in damage to a key facility. Even if a  port were not closed altogether, the Coast Guard could increase the  MARSEC level at one or more ports or industries to MARSEC 3\u2014the  highest level. The Coast Guard noted in the Federal Register that MARSEC  Level 3 will involve significant restriction of maritime operations that  could result in the temporary closure of individual facilities, ports, and  waterways, in either a region or the entire nation. Depending on the nature  of the specific threat, this highest level of maritime security may have a  considerable impact on the stakeholders in the affected ports or maritime  areas. The ability to estimate the costs to business and government for  even a short period at MARSEC Level 3 is difficult to do with any level of  accuracy or analytical confidence due to the infinite range of threats and  scenarios that could trigger MARSEC Level 3. The Coast Guard also noted  that the length and the duration of the increased security level to MARSEC  Level 3 will be entirely dependent on the scope of transportation security  incidents or disasters that have already occurred. The Coast Guard  expects MARSEC Level 3 to increase the direct costs to businesses  attributable to increased personnel or modified operations, and it also  expects indirect costs to society of the \u2018\u2018ripple effects\u2019\u2019 associated with  sustained port closures would greatly outweigh the direct costs to  individual businesses.", "The scale of these effects can perhaps be seen in several hypothetical  examples, both international and domestic.", "Strait of Hormuz.

While there are some limited alternatives for  exporting oil from the Persian Gulf without going through the strait,  these alternatives could not make entirely for the amount of oil lost by  closure of the strait. While the United States and other oil-importing  countries have reserves of crude oil that they could use to mitigate the  loss of supply from the Persian Gulf, oil could not be withdrawn fast  enough to entirely make up the lost volumes. For example, while the  U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has 688 million barrels of oil, the  send-out capacity of the reserves is only 4.4 million barrels per day.  Other countries face similar constraints. Additionally, if closure of  Hormuz lasted for an extended period of time, strategic reserves could  run out or become so low as to be unable to mitigate any additional  petroleum supply disruptions.", "Northeast United States. An attack on a key port in the northeastern  United States, such as Boston, could result in energy commodity  shortages or price spikes. For instance, the LNG facility near Boston  (in Everett, Massachusetts), is the only facility importing liquefied  natural gas in the Northeast. LNG is very important to the Northeast  during heating season because natural gas movement into the  Northeast is constrained during the winter because existing pipelines  to New England are fully utilized. A report prepared by the Power  Planning Committee of the New England Governor\u2019s Conference, Inc.,  concluded that if LNG from the Everett facility and satellite operations  elsewhere in the region is not available on a peak winter day, the region  could have insufficient gas supply to meet the needs of all customers  for space heating and some key electric generators.

Although the actual disruption in supply was relatively small,  the oil spill sent shock waves through oil markets, particularly those most  dependent on oil from the Alaskan North Slope along the West Coast. In  the first week after the oil spill, spot market prices of unleaded regular  gasoline increased $0.50 from $0.68 per gallon to $1.18 per gallon, a 74  percent increase due to fears of an extended closure of oil from the  Alaskan North Slope. In the following weeks, however, prices began to  decrease, hitting $0.99 on April 7 (2 weeks after the spill) and $0.82 on  April 14 (3 weeks after the spill). Thus as markets realized that the supply  shortage would be short lived, prices dropped sharply.

Coast  Guard guidance requires its field units to take certain actions to protect  LNG and LPG tankers in key port areas, which include high-population  areas or areas with critical infrastructure, such as bridges or refineries.  Beyond protecting LNG and LPG shipments in these key port areas, Coast  Guard field units are required to implement security activities  commensurate with the extent of critical infrastructure, extent of high- profile vessel traffic transiting through key port areas, and availability of  support of non-Coast Guard entities, such as state and local law  enforcement agencies. According to senior Coast Guard field officials with  LNG security responsibilities, LNG tanker transits have received the  greatest attention of the two, due in large part to the much greater size of  LNG tankers, the amount of hazardous cargo they are carrying, and the  public perception of the danger of LNG shipments. Many of these security  measures are now being implemented at existing LNG ports around the  country. The security measures address two phases of LNG operations,  including (1) the transit of an underway tanker through a port and (2) the  period when a tanker is moored at a receiving terminal.", "Coast Guard security activity requirements are less stringent for oil  tankers or tankers carrying many other petroleum-based products, such as  gasoline or crude oil, because they are not identified in the CDC list of  hazardous marine cargo as posing the greatest human safety risks.

Of the 19  domestic waterside petroleum facilities we visited, all were reported by  the Coast Guard to be in compliance with MTSA regulations. Examples of  steps taken include key-card access systems, closed-circuit television  cameras and sensors along fencing, hardened perimeter fencing, and  reinforced gates at most access control points. Facility operators told us  they conduct regular security drills involving emergency and terrorism  scenarios and they regularly share pertinent security information with  other participants of the Area Maritime Security Committees.

When carried out effectively,  risk management offers a way to make informed decisions about how best  to use limited resources. In the Coast Guard\u2019s case, its actions involve a  balancing act both in deciding how best to meet its various security and  nonsecurity missions agencywide, but also in weighing the pros and cons  of investing additional resources in energy commodity tanker protection  versus the wider range of other port activities that require protection. The  Coast Guard uses the requirements laid out in its guidance to establish a  port-specific security approach in which the workload varies based on  such factors as the proximity of population centers to the port area, the  extent of critical infrastructure at the port, the extent of high-profile vessel  traffic transiting through key port areas, and the availability of support  from other entities.", "Given that the resource levels of some field units have limited their ability  to achieve Coast Guard security standards, the Coast Guard has attempted  to realign its security requirements to more closely match available  resource levels. Coast Guard headquarters officials meet on an annual  basis to review new risk assessments and current Coast Guard capacity to  mitigate risk. The Coast Guard also receives recommendations from field  unit commanders for introducing tactical efficiencies into security  requirements. Over the past several years, the Coast Guard has revised its  operational security guidance in two main ways:    Revising the standards for the amount of activity required for  conducting some security activities. In August 2006 the Coast  Guard substantially reduced the types of CDC-carrying vessels that  must be escorted. The Coast Guard developed a subset list of the CDC  commodities\u2014called Especially Hazardous Cargo\u2014it determined as  posing the greatest safety and security risks. This list included both  LNG and LPG, meaning that the activities required to protect them  remain unchanged. However, for CDC commodities not included on the  Especially Hazardous Cargo list, such as vinyl chloride, escort  requirements were eliminated during normal threat conditions\u2014 MARSEC I. In all, requirements were reduced for about 20 different  CDC commodities carried in bulk.

The Coast Guard has introduced new tactical options  that Area Commanders may utilize, in some cases, to accomplish  resource intensive security activities.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s methodology used to develop the Especially Hazardous  Cargo has two substantial shortcomings, however. Our specific concerns  are as follows:    Lack of thoroughness. To identify the highest risk CDC commodities,  senior Coast Guard headquarters officials told us they reviewed  available consequence analysis assessments that had been conducted  by the Coast Guard\u2019s Special Technical Assessment Program and also  reviewed a 2004 consequence analysis of LNG by Sandia National  Laboratories. They said they also incorporated the views of persons  with expertise in CDC commodities, including Coast Guard field  officials. However, the Coast Guard did not perform consequence  assessments on many CDC commodities by the time it created the  Especially Hazardous Cargo list, and as of January 1, 2007, it still had  not done so.", "No systematic comparative analysis was conducted to identify  and prioritize the highest-consequence commodities. Coast Guard  headquarters officials acknowledged they did not conduct a relative  risk assessment of the CDC commodities. Rather, officials told us they  relied on the collective best judgment of Coast Guard experts from  field units and headquarters that had significant experience dealing  with various transportable energy and chemical commodities. By  conducting a relative risk analysis of all CDC commodities, the Coast  Guard would have had available more definitive input for determining  which CDC vessels posed the greatest risks necessitating additional  mitigation measures, which in this case would be an escort.", "The Coast Guard is taking action to address the methodological limitations  we note. Shortly after the Coast Guard released the Especially Hazardous  Cargo list, we shared our concerns with Coast Guard officials. The Coast  Guard has since begun efforts to broaden its studies of potential  consequences to include a wide range of hazardous commodities. It  contracted with the American Bureau of Shipping to perform a  comparative analysis of the consequences of an attack on vessels carrying  all commodities on the CDC list, including LNG and LPG. The product of  this analysis is to be a ranking of the relative consequences of each of the  CDC commodities. This study is scheduled to be completed in spring 2007.  Coast Guard headquarters officials told us that following this analysis, and  subject to available funding and other considerations, they may consider  adding other commodities to the comparative analysis, such as gasoline  and jet fuel.", "Going beyond the consequence analyses of hazardous commodities, the  Coast Guard has also developed a tool to compare the overall relative risk  scores of different terrorist attacks at the nation\u2019s ports. Field units are  developing risk scenarios for potential targets at their ports and possible  attack types that could be used against those targets. Using the Maritime  Security Risk Assessment Model, the units are to analyze the different risk  scenarios in relation to three key elements of risk: reported threat of  different types of attack, vulnerability of the targets (incorporating  different protective actions taken by security stakeholders), and  consequences of a successful attack (including human health, economic,  and environmental). Each risk scenario is to receive a score.

Currently the Coast  Guard is faced with providing security for vessels arriving at four domestic  onshore LNG import facilities, but the number of LNG tankers bringing  shipments to these facilities will increase considerably because of  expansions that are planned or under way. In addition, industry analysts  expect approximately 12 more LNG facilities will be built over the next  decade (see fig. 12). Consequently, Coast Guard field units will likely be  required to significantly expand their security workloads to conduct new  LNG security missions.", "Recognizing this coming increase in demand on security resources at LNG  ports, Coast Guard field units have been planning strategies to help meet  this demand. We found evidence that, in their planning efforts, Coast  Guard field units and affected locations are seeking assistance from a wide  range of stakeholders and sources. In particular, stakeholders mentioned  the following:    Manpower from state and local law enforcement. Several field  units plan to rely on state and local agencies to conduct a considerable  share of the new LNG workloads. While state and local law  enforcement agencies have generally agreed to participate in LNG  security operations, such support was largely contingent upon their  receiving funding to cover their own resource gaps. According to the  Coast Guard, at some ports, law enforcement agencies required  funding to cover new capital investments, such as additional patrol  boats, as well as operational costs such as funding for additional  manpower or fuel for the new boats.", "Financial help from facility operators. At some of the proposed  LNG ports we reviewed, facility operators were also planning to  contribute considerable financial resources to help fund new LNG  security operations. In doing so, these companies planned to fund both  operational and capital enhancement costs for state and local law  enforcement agencies that had agreed in concept to support Coast  Guard LNG security missions. At two ports where the Coast Guard had  approved security arrangements for new LNG facilities, state and local  law enforcement agencies had already developed, or were planning to  develop, a cost-sharing agreement with the facilities. For example, at  one port, a potential LNG facility operator made a commitment to fund  most of the capital enhancements and operational costs of the state  and local law enforcement agencies involved, including two patrol  boats for state agencies, two tugboats, and communications equipment.  Facility operators told us they were motivated to provide resources  because they understood that doing so was essential to ensuring final  approval of the LNG facilities. Some facility operators also told us that  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 required them to develop resource cost- sharing agreements to offset state and local government resources  used specifically for the new LNG facilities.", "Financial help through federal grants. State and local law  enforcement agencies also reported that they were relying, in part, on  federal grants to obtain additional resources. Of the 15 state and local  law enforcement agencies we contacted, 9 agencies reported applying  for Port Security Grants or Urban Area Security Initiative grants. Law  enforcement agency officials told us they planned to fund capital  enhancements with this grant funding. Among those items officials  planned to fund with their grants were new patrol boats, construction  of a new boathouse and piers, helicopters, and security cameras to be  placed along an LNG transit route.", "While port security grants and resource sharing agreements are expected  to address at least part of the resource needs of the Coast Guard\u2019s law  enforcement partners, the Coast Guard is likely to require additional  resources to fulfill its own new security responsibilities. To date, however,  field units have made little progress in obtaining additional resources.  Additionally, because federal law prohibits the Coast Guard from receiving  resources for its own use from private sector companies, the Coast Guard  cannot use resource-sharing partnerships to help fill its own resource  needs. Consequently, Coast Guard headquarters officials told us they  recognize that despite the efforts of Captains of the Port to develop local  solutions to new security demands, some field units will continue to lack  the resources necessary to meet their increasing LNG security workloads.", "Coast Guard headquarters officials told us they were considering two  general options to provide field units with the necessary resources to carry  out their new LNG security workloads. These two options are as follows:    Redistribute resources to units with new LNG activity. Coast  Guard officials told us they are considering shifting resources from  ports with surplus resources to ports with new or expanded LNG  facilities. Coast Guard headquarters officials told us, however, that they  have not yet determined which ports would, or even could, provide  these excess resources. Coast Guard\u2019s Atlantic area\u2014where most of  the new LNG activity is expected\u2014has ordered districts and field units  to report any excess resource capacity. Guided by risk management,  Coast Guard headquarters may redistribute any available excess  capacity to ports with new LNG security workloads. The earliest that  the Coast Guard could reprogram assets from within the Atlantic Area  is fiscal year 2009.", "Request new resources via budget proposals. Coast Guard officials  also reported that they may request additional funding through the  annual budget process to support the acquisition of additional boats  and personnel to conduct vessel escorts and infrastructure patrols and  the training of additional personnel.", "As of January 1, 2007, Coast Guard headquarters officials told us they had  not yet developed a plan\u2014or blueprint\u2014for how to proceed with these  two options for addressing new LNG security resource demands. The  decisions about how to proceed may involve difficult choices, because  shifting resources to this growing need could involve trimming resources  now tasked to other homeland security duties or traditional non-homeland  security missions, and because seeking more resources involves asking  Coast Guard decision makers to weigh important, but competing,  priorities. A national plan that identifies the Coast Guard\u2019s nationwide  LNG resource needs and identifies milestones and funding needs for  meeting those needs can help the Coast Guard manage its limited  resources and communicate resource needs to Congress.

While the AMSP has  served as the terrorism response plan for ports since July 2004, it contains  sensitive security information and is therefore only available to those  individuals who are considered to have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d As a result,  nonsecurity personnel, such oil spill cleanup responders, may not have  access to these plans during an emergency. For example, only 3 of the 13  ports we visited had ACPs that addressed terrorism response within the  spill plan by incorporating terrorism incident annexes or other plans.  Consequently, the ACPs may need to have explicit sections for responding  to terrorism.", "The general lack of integration in the plans carries over to the separate  spill and terrorism response communities at the port level. As previously  discussed, individual members on these committees may not know all the  members of the other committee, but a terrorist attack on a tanker would  require them to respond simultaneously. We identified only a few  examples of joint committee meetings that enabled members to interact.  For example, Coast Guard officials told us that, since September 11, 2001,  the Captain of the Port at one location has facilitated meetings between  spill response providers and local offices of emergency management and  federal and local law enforcement agencies in order to improve response  coordination among all entities. They stated that if the spill and terrorism  response communities were formally joined, response integration and  efficiency would improve. In addition, at another location, Coast Guard  officials noted, the local area training and exercise workgroup contains  members of both the spill and terrorism response committees in order to  consolidate training and exercises. Finally, in an attempt to improve  communication, the FBI established Maritime Liaison Agents (MLA) at the  ports so that all stakeholders would know the local agent in the event of  an incident. At some ports we visited the spill responders knew who the  FBI agent was and at other ports they said they did not.", "USCG guidance states that local port operators, municipalities, and public  safety agencies are expected to provide and maintain adequate disaster  response capabilities in their ports, with capability requirements likely to  vary from port to port depending on size, commodities received,  environmental considerations, relation to population, etc. Recognizing the  variability of capability requirements, the USCG has developed Critical  Success Factors (CSF) for spill response that drive a \u201cBest Possible  Response\u201d\u2014that is, a set of general goals to achieve when conducting a  comprehensive and effective response. Six particular CSF are to be  considered when developing ACPs, including (1) no public or responder  injuries, illness or deaths; (2) sensitive areas protected; (3) resource  damage minimized; (4) infrastructure damage minimized; (5) economic  impact minimized; and (6) highly coordinated law enforcement and  emergency management operations. Joint exercises can maximize the  ability of a given port to carry out a \u201cbest response\u201d in the event of an  attack on a tanker.

The MTR\u2019s goals  include increasing preparedness, identifying gaps in emergency  response capabilities, and planning for timely restoration of trade. The  project generated a response plan and a field guide for how to integrate  responses for a range of issues, such as public safety, response  coordination, recovery, and crime scene management. Stakeholders  plan to incorporate existing response plans, such as the ACP, as  annexes to the MTR. According to the FBI official involved with the  MTR planning process, the MTR serves as an effective linkage between  the spill and terrorism response sections of the National Response  Plan.", "Under the SAFE Port Act of 2006, DHS must develop interagency  operational centers by fall 2009 for port security at all high-priority  ports. The Coast Guard and the FBI are among the agencies that will be  represented at these operational centers, as will other public and  private sector stakeholders who would be adversely affected by a  terrorist attack. These centers may also include stakeholders who  would be involved in a joint spill and terrorism response. Integration  may be improved through the daily interaction of all these  stakeholders. In April 2006 testimony before the House Homeland  Security Committee, DHS\u2019s Deputy Secretary stated that physically  connecting the various agencies involved is important, and the Port of  New York and New Jersey\u2019s Manager of Port Security voiced support  for the development of joint operation centers in key U.S. ports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Port Plans to Mitigate Economic Consequences Could Be Useful", "paragraphs": ["The economic consequences of a terrorist attack on a tanker could be  significant, particularly if one or more ports are closed.

Additionally, AMSPs must include a section on crisis management and  recovery to ensure the continuity of port operations. At the time of our  review, there was no national-level guidance for use by local ports.

Some ports had large fireboats that are designed to deal with fires on  tankers, as well as firefighters trained to conduct shipboard firefighting  operations. In contrast, other energy commodity ports relied on land- based firefighting companies; these companies told us that they did not  have the training and/or the equipment to fight marine fires. See figure 17  for two examples of marine firefighting response.", "While some local ports may not be well equipped to handle marine fires,  companies operating tankers are required to provide for marine  firefighting and salvage capabilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  However, we identified several limitations associated with these  requirements:    Timeliness of response not spelled out. OPA 90 does not specify  how soon after an event either marine firefighting or salvage must  occur. Under a Coast Guard rule proposed in 2002, and not yet issued  as final, contracted marine firefighting resources generally would have  to be provided within 8 hours after notification of an event, while  salvage operations generally would have to begin within 16 hours. Even  if this rule were in force, it might not be timely enough to prevent the  vessel from sinking.", "Extent of planning for salvage varies widely. Salvage is important  for marine firefighting because a ship may sink from an attack, may be  deliberately sunk to control the resulting fire, or may be accidentally  sunk by the firefighters because they are not familiar with ship stability  issues inherent in the marine firefighting environment. In addition to  the OPA 90 requirement, the SAFE Port Act of 2006 requires the  development of salvage response plans to supplement Area Maritime  Security Plans. While all ACPs for the ports we visited contain sections  on salvage, we found that the plans varied widely in detailing salvage  responses. A 2003 National Transportation Safety Board workshop  identified potential shortfalls in local salvage planning and/or  capabilities as an issue that needed to be addressed. One reason for  capability shortfalls identified was that locally available salvage  resources may sometimes be lacking.", "If ports lack marine firefighting or salvage capabilities, we identified the  following other avenues for obtaining resources to enhance these  capabilities. However, these avenues carry limitations, mainly related to  the speed with which they could be deployed on site.", "Mutual aid agreements. Some port community members have mutual  aid agreements in place to provide assistance in emergencies. These  agreements can be industry-to-industry, municipal-to-municipal,  industry-to-municipal, or municipal-to-industry. However, these  agreements can have inherent delays in response time if needed  resources are located some distance away or require considerable time  for redeployment. For example, one refinery noted, in its site  emergency manual section for ship fire procedures, that there is a need  to evaluate whether refinery responders need to call the local fire  department and request fireboat assistance because of a 45-minute  delay in subsequent arrival of this resource. If the refinery needs to call  for additional assistance from a nearby fire department\u2019s fireboats, the  delay could be several hours, according to state fire officials.", "National Oil Spill Response Resource Inventory. Each Coast  Guard Captain of the Port has emergency contracting authority to  obtain needed resources. The National Strike Force\u2019s Response  Resource Inventory lists public and private organizations that can  provide these needed spill response resources. The Coast Guard is to  review these organizations\u2019 resources at least every 3 years to keep an  up-to-date resource list. Again, in some cases delay in getting these  needed resources to the incident location would occur.", "In addition to the differences in the availability of marine firefighting  equipment, we found that access to marine firefighting training, which is  highly specialized and different from land-based firefighting, can be  limited because of distance from a training center or lack of resources.  While a range of locations provide firefighter response training for energy  commodity fires in the marine environment, these facilities are limited and  are sometimes not located near a firefighting response organization that is  seeking this training. Some local emergency responders told us they have  not received shipboard firefighting training, which is even more  specialized than general marine firefighting, and many of the responders  we contacted identified the need for additional training. At one port we  visited, fire department officials stated that the firefighters had not  received this training but would board a burning vessel. See figure 18 for  an example of firefighters training to combat an aviation fuel fire.", "We also found differences in training for federally established procedures  outlining coordination\u2014known as the incident command system (ICS)\u2014 for responding to any incident, including terrorism. Some emergency  responders identified a lack of experience and training on this system as a  potential concern for effectively coordinating and leading a response to an  attack. The Coast Guard and fire departments are familiar with ICS  because they were using it before September 11, 2001, but law  enforcement does not have equivalent experience with it. At the ports we  visited, the local Coast Guard and firefighting responders identified  themselves as generally compliant with ICS training requirements.  Although the FBI would have jurisdictional responsibility for leading the  multiagency response to a terrorist attack on a tanker, FBI personnel did  not have to comply with ICS training requirements until December 31,  2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interoperable Communications", "paragraphs": ["At the ports we visited, officials identified the lack of fully interoperable  communications as an ongoing issue, as did many of the after-action  reports we reviewed. Spill and terrorism responders may have difficulty  coordinating their emergency response if their communications systems  are not interoperable\u2014that is, one agency\u2019s equipment may not be able to  communicate with another\u2019s. For example, according to local emergency  planners, during one port exercise in 2006 the responders used their cell  phones because of interoperability problems. This workaround may be  adequate during an exercise, an FBI official noted, but responders may not  be able to rely on the cell phone communications network during an  actual event. While interoperability is a problem for emergency responders  throughout the nation, responders in the marine environment face  additional challenges. These include the need for additional equipment  on or near ships so that radio signals can get through to the ship\u2019s hold, as  well as marine band radios for operating on water.", "Response organizations have some options to work around the problem of  interoperability. For example, the FBI can use a range of equipment to  coordinate the signals of all the various responding agencies\u2019  communications equipment, but it takes some time to make this  equipment operational because the equipment has to be brought to the  site, and each responding organization has to provide a radio to the same  location for the workaround system to function.

One potential funding source  is DHS\u2019s Port Security Grant Program. In the past, most DHS grants  awarded to ports were for terrorism prevention and detection projects  (such as fences, cameras, and security systems), rather than for response  and recovery projects, according to DHS officials. For some states that  contain ports we visited, officials who oversee grant resource distribution  also told us that only a limited number of post-incident response project  applications, such as marine firefighting assets or shipboard firefighter  training, have received grant funding.", "This emphasis on prevention and detection is changing. Recent changes in  the grant program are more likely to result in consideration of response  and recovery projects, according to DHS officials. They told us that the  DHS Port Security Grant Program is undergoing a fundamental shift from  a facility security focus to a more comprehensive approach to managing  risk within ports. The Office of Grants and Training, within the  Preparedness Directorate, is working with the Coast Guard to develop an  integrated, risk-based decision-making process for allocating grant funds  for each port area. This shift in strategy recognizes that port security  entails not only prevention and detection activities but also response and  recovery capabilities. Plans for fiscal year 2007 grant guidance will place  more emphasis on post-incident response projects, according to DHS  officials. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 likewise emphasizes a risk-based  approach for port security grants.", "To make effective judgments about such projects, performance measures  are needed to quantitatively determine the spill and terrorism resources  that should be available. Such measures help decide the extent to which a  given resource is needed to effectively conduct a response within a given  time period. At the time of our review, DHS was surveying available  emergency response capabilities within a given port, according to officials  from DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection.", "In September 2006, the New York City Fire Department Chief of  Counterterrorism and Emergency Preparedness questioned whether the  nation is prepared for an emergency and called for performance measures  that emphasized (1) capability (What can we do?), (2) capacity (How much  can we do?), (3) proficiency (How well can we perform?), and (4)  deployment (How quickly can we deploy capabilities?). As we have  previously reported, in the absence of comparable standards for  emergency responder performance, it is difficult to assess whether grant  resources will be directed effectively to reduce risk. Without such  performance measures, the federal government would not be able to  conduct an analysis, based on reducing overall risk, that could be used to  set priorities for acquiring needed response resources. Performance  measures are critical for setting priorities to effectively allocate federal  funds.", "The Captain of the Port may assist local authorities in reviewing the  adequacy of the port\u2019s overall marine firefighting and salvage capability.  Such qualitative reviews assess a range of factors related to the nature of  operations within the port. However, these assessments cannot set  priorities for addressing these shortfalls because they do not have  quantitative performance measures that would provide a way to compare  one shortfall against another to determine such priorities. Other related  assessments face the same priority-setting issues. A recent qualitative  advisory report for siting a potential future LNG facility illustrates this  problem. The assessment identified the need to send firefighters to  specialized fire schools on an annual basis to become trained in fighting  LNG fires, as well as to provide local firefighters with additional training  on hazardous materials and confined space rescue. The assessment also  identified a range of equipment procurement needs, including additional  fireboats capable of mitigating a large LNG spill on water as well as dry  chemicals and foam caches for extinguishing any resulting fire. While all  these shortfalls may need to be addressed, the assessments do not provide  a road map for setting federal funding priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The ship-based supply chain for energy commodities remains threatened  and vulnerable, and appropriate security throughout the chain is essential  to ensure safe and efficient delivery. The threats are especially strong  internationally, where the United States faces limitations in ensuring that  facilities in foreign ports are meeting security standards and in protecting  shipments in international waters. Domestically, the nexus for  strengthening security efforts rests with the U.S. Coast Guard, which has  primary responsibility for security actions in U.S. ports and waterways.  Despite considerable efforts to protect ports and the energy traffic in  them, the level of protection is not where the Coast Guard believes it  should be. At some ports Coast Guard units are not meeting their own  levels of required security activities. Growing demand for Coast Guard  resources requires that the Coast Guard take action on several fronts. In  adjusting security standards to take into account its limited resources, the  Coast Guard needs to assure itself and other stakeholders that its  adjustments are based on a careful assessment of risk. This process has  begun with the Coast Guard\u2019s ongoing assessment of risks associated with  all CDC commodities, and since this assessment is already under way, we  do not see a need to make a recommendation in this case. The results of  that study, and of any comparative analysis that includes hazardous  materials not on the CDC list, will be important in a careful and  dispassionate analysis for ensuring that available resources are deployed  in such a way that commodities receive protection commensurate with the  relative risks involved. This is especially important with the expected  growth in LNG imports. Similarly, we believe that the results of the risk  analyses stemming from use of the Maritime Security Risk Assessment  Model will be important in determining how field units can best make use  of security resources at their ports. With the ability to compare different  targets and different levels of protection offered by security stakeholders,  the model should allow the Coast Guard to take a more complete  accounting for the various risks at U.S. ports. These two efforts are vital  inputs that are needed to ensure an accurate reflection of security risks to  tankers and the ports that receive them.", "Local Coast Guard units have been active in preparing for the coming  growth in LNG shipments, engaging with local law enforcement agencies  as a means to augment Coast Guard resources. The assistance the Coast  Guard already receives from state and local law enforcement is vital for  many units as they try to meet security activity requirements with limited  resources. Coast Guard headquarters, however, needs to do more to help  these local efforts. More specifically, it needs to begin centralized planning  for how to address resource shortfalls across many locations. As LNG  facilities continue to multiply, the resulting increase in workload will  affect some Coast Guard units but not others, necessitating a centralized  response as well as a port-specific one. It is important for the Coast Guard  to begin this centralized planning soon, when attention can also be paid to  assessing the options for partnering with state or local law enforcement  agencies to ensure appropriate security. This broader planning is  important for ensuring a proper distribution of resources to best meet the  Coast Guard\u2019s diverse responsibilities.", "In the event of a successful attack on an energy commodity tanker, ports  would need to provide an effective, integrated response to protect public  safety and the environment, conduct a terrorism investigation, and restore  operations in a timely manner. Consequently, clearly defined and  understood roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders who would need  to respond are needed to ensure an effective response. Operational plans  for the response, among the various levels of government involved, should  be explicitly linked. As we have reported previously, it is essential that  these roles and responsibilities be clearly communicated and understood.  Furthermore, while we recognize that ports may have exercise priorities  other than responding to a terrorist attack on a tanker, we believe that  combined spill and terrorism response exercises should be considered and  pursued in ports that are considered to be at risk. In addition, national- level guidance has generally suggested that ports plan for mitigating the  economic consequences of an attack. In implementing the post-incident  recovery portions of the SAFE Port Act, DHS has an opportunity to  provide specific guidance for how ports could plan for lessening  potentially significant economic consequences, particularly if an attack  results in a port closure. Finally, DHS has just begun to focus more on  providing funding for response resources through the Port Security Grant  program. However, DHS cannot be assured that it will appropriately target  funding to the projects that most reduce overall risk because it has not  developed quantitative performance measures. These measures would  allow DHS to set priorities for funding on the basis of reducing overall  risk.

We agree that there are other dangerous cargoes  and it is logical for the Coast Guard to review them holistically in targeting  its resources to where the risks are greatest. On the basis of its comments,  the Coast Guard plans to examine the risk caused by dangerous  commodities, and to take a number of steps to allocate resources. We will  monitor the Coast Guard\u2019s actions to see if these actions, collectively or in  combination with a plan, allow it to optimally allocate its limited resource  to meet growing security requirements along with its various other mission  needs.

It  also stated that the Coast Guard, in partnership with CBP, is currently  engaged in a broad effort to improve maritime recovery planning.

They both stated, however,  that the NRP itself already serves as the basis for integrating such  response planning, and the FBI did not concur with the need to develop a  separate operational plan. As we have noted in prior reports, effective  planning and coordination require the development of detailed operational  plans for response. While the NRP serves as a strategy-level doctrinal  document, it is not an operational plan. We remain concerned that an  intentional attack on an energy commodity tanker in a U.S. port may not  be met by the best possible response without such a plan to direct the  specific circumstance when both the spill and terrorism response sections  of the NRP must be integrated and implemented simultaneously. Without a  detailed operational plan for this situation, effective and efficient law  enforcement investigation and environmental consequence mitigation may  be hindered. As we have recently reported, the implementation of the NRP  following Hurricane Katrina identified concerns with coordination within  and between federal government entities using the NRP. Further, the  October 2005 draft version of the MOTR called for DHS and DOJ to  develop specific, detailed supporting operational plans for their  responsibilities, in close consultation with other departments and  agencies. However, this requirement was dropped from the October 2006  final version of the MOTR. As a result, no detailed operational plans exist  for the situation described in the response section of this report.

DHS said that while these  efforts must be coordinated they need not be an amalgamation. It stated  that there are opportunities for this coordination at the local committees  that are responsible for planning terrorism and spill response and because  the Coast Guard serves as chair for both committees, coordination already  occurs. In its comments FBI listed exercises that combined terrorism and  spill response. It also stated that local Maritime Liaison Agents were  specifically directed to engage agency partners to ensure integration of  FBI response. While these actions are beneficial for increased integration,  there is no direct link between the actual local terrorism plan and spill  response plan.

These decisions should take place in the context of an agency\u2019s strategic  plan that includes goals and objectives that are clear, concise, and  measurable.", "Risk assessment, a critical step in the approach, helps decision makers  identify and evaluate potential risks so that countermeasures can be  designed and implemented to prevent or mitigate the effects of risk. Risk  assessment is a qualitative and/or quantitative determination of the  likelihood of an adverse event occurring and the severity, or impact, of its  consequences. Risk assessment in a homeland security application often  involves assessing three key elements\u2014threat, criticality, and  vulnerability:    A threat assessment identifies and evaluates potential threats on the  basis of factors such as capabilities, intentions, and past activities.", "A criticality or consequence assessment evaluates and prioritizes assets  and functions in terms of specific criteria, such as their importance to  public safety and the economy, as a basis for identifying which  structures or processes are relatively more important to protect from  attack.", "A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses that may be exploited  by identified threats and suggests options to address those weaknesses.", "Information from these three assessments contributes to an overall risk  assessment that characterizes risks on a scale such as high, medium, or  low and provides input for evaluating alternatives and management  prioritization of security initiatives.", "The next two steps involve deciding what mitigation measures to adopt.  Alternatives evaluation considers what actions may be needed to address  identified risks, the associated costs of taking these actions, and any  resulting benefits. This information is provided to agency management to  aid in completing the next step\u2014selecting alternative actions best suited  to the unique needs of the organization.", "The final step in the approach involves implementing the selected actions  and evaluating the extent to which they mitigate risk. This involves  developing criteria for monitoring the performance of these actions and  follow-up to ensure that these actions are effective and reflect evolving  risk.", "Risk management has received widespread support from Congress, the  President, and the Secretary of Homeland Security as a tool that can help  set priorities and inform decisions about mitigating risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Federal Bureau of Investigation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Jonathan Bachman, Jason  Berman, Steven Calvo, Jonathan Carver, Frances Cook, Frank Chase  Cook, Amy Higgins, David Lysy, Jean McSween, Erica Miles, Jobenia  Odum, Josh Ormond, Janice Poling, Franklin Rusco, Peter Singer, Carol  Shulman, Stan Stenerson, Barbara Timmerman, James Turkett, JimWells,  and Margaret Wrightson made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Maritime Security: The SAFE Port Act: Status and Implementation One  Year Later.
