EHR interoperability is the ability of systems to exchange electronic health information with other systems and process the information without special effort by the user, such as a health care provider. These initiatives' efforts include creating guidance related to health data standards, encouraging the adoption of certain health data standards or policies that facilitate interoperability, and operating networks that connect EHR systems to enable interoperability. The initiatives varied in a number of other ways, including the types of electronic systems the initiatives are working to make interoperable, the cost of their products or services, the geographic area served, patient use of the products or services, and their organizational structures. For example, GAO found that while some initiatives are making their products or services available at no cost, others are charging a fee for their products or services based on the type of entity using the product or service (e.g., individual physician or hospital) or the amount of data exchanged. Similarly, over half of the initiatives were using varying approaches to facilitate patient access to and control over their health information. The majority of the initiatives GAO selected are still in the process of developing, or encouraging others to adopt, their products or services. Most of the initiatives' products or services were not widely available at the time of GAO's review, but initiative representatives anticipated greater availability of their products or services in the next 2 years.", "Stakeholders and initiative representatives GAO interviewed described five key challenges to achieving EHR interoperability, which are consistent with challenges described in past GAO work. Specifically, the challenges they described are (1) insufficiencies in health data standards, (2) variation in state privacy rules, (3) accurately matching patients' health records, (4) costs associated with interoperability, and (5) the need for governance and trust among entities, such as agreements to facilitate the sharing of information among all participants in an initiative. Representatives from the 18 initiatives GAO reviewed said they are working to address these key challenges using different approaches. Each key challenge is in the process of being addressed by some initiatives. To move interoperability forward, initiative representatives noted, among other issues, that providers need to see an EHR system as a valuable tool for improving clinical care.", "The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Electronic health record (EHR) interoperability is viewed by many health  care stakeholders as a necessary step toward transforming health care  into a system that can achieve goals of improved quality, efficiency, and  patient safety.

ONC has stated that EHR interoperability is key to its vision of enabling  every individual and his or her health care providers to access the health  information they need in a useful electronic format when and how they  need it. Although ONC has reported nationwide progress on the extent to  which providers can exchange health information among different data  systems and organizations, it has also reported that interoperability  remains limited due to, among other things, electronic health information  not being sufficiently structured or standardized, a lack of financial  motives, and misinterpretation of existing laws governing the sharing of  health information.", "In its January 2015 draft \u201cInteroperability Roadmap,\u201d ONC identifies  critical actions for public and private sector stakeholders to take to enable  nationwide interoperability of electronic health information in the near  term.

We defined nonfederal  initiatives as projects or programs outside of the federal government that  are intended to facilitate EHR interoperability related to the provision of  clinical care (as opposed to research). Our goal was not to identify all  interoperability initiatives, but rather to develop a list that included a  variety of initiatives working to facilitate EHR interoperability. We obtained  feedback from ONC to determine the completeness and accuracy of our  list and then judgmentally selected initiatives for our review. From our  initial list of 39 initiatives, we selected 18 for review that were frequently  mentioned by stakeholders we interviewed, and reflected a range of  approaches. We interviewed representatives from these 18 initiatives to  obtain detailed information about each initiative, including information  about each initiative\u2019s governance structure, funding, product  development status, timeline, and extent to which the initiative will enable  interoperability (e.g., among different providers and types of health  information to be made interoperable).

We asked initiative representatives about the  extent to which their initiatives are taking steps to address these key  challenges, as well as any other challenges related to EHR  interoperability. When available, we obtained relevant documentation  from initiatives, such as bylaws, governance documents, or technical  plans, to learn more about the extent to which the selected initiatives are  addressing or have plans to address key challenges related to EHR  interoperability. We also asked representatives from the 18 initiatives to  discuss other actions that may be needed to move interoperability  forward.", "The initiatives we reviewed were selected judgmentally; therefore, any  information gathered from our interviews cannot be generalized.

EHRs ideally make information available instantly and securely to  authorized users. An EHR can contain the medical and treatment history  of a patient, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization  dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results. An  EHR can also give a provider access to evidence-based tools for making  decisions about a patient\u2019s care and can automate certain workflows.  EHR system software is typically purchased by providers (such as  physicians, hospitals, and health systems) from vendors that develop the  systems. When EHR systems are interoperable, information can be  exchanged\u2014sent from one provider to another\u2014and then seamlessly  integrated into the receiving provider\u2019s EHR system, allowing the provider  to use that health information to inform clinical care.", "HHS and others view EHR system interoperability as a necessary step  toward transforming health care into a system that can achieve goals of  improved quality, efficiency, and patient safety. For example, use of  interoperable EHR systems could better enable health care providers to  view results from diagnostic procedures conducted by other providers  to avoid duplication; evaluate test results and treatment outcomes over time regardless of  where the care was provided to better understand a patient\u2019s medical  history;  share a basic set of patient information with specialists during  referrals and receive updated information after the patient\u2019s visit with  the specialist to improve care coordination;  view complete medication lists to reduce the chance of duplicate  therapy, drug interactions, medication abuse, and other adverse drug  events; and  identify important information, such as allergies or preexisting  conditions, for unfamiliar patients during emergency treatment to  reduce the risk of adverse events.", "Health data standards are technical requirements used to, among other  things, facilitate health information exchange and interoperability of  systems, including EHR systems. Such standards consist of terminology  and technical specifications that, when adopted by multiple entities,  facilitate the exchange and interoperability of health information. Health  data standards include, for example, standardized language for  prescriptions and laboratory testing. Standards define how information is  packaged and communicated from one entity to another, setting the  language, structure, and data types required for integration between the  systems. Standards generally have been developed by nonfederal  standard development organizations and are accompanied by  implementation guides, which can help ensure that standards are  implemented uniformly. Consistent implementation of the standards by  the vendors that build and sell EHR systems and by providers who use  these systems is necessary for interoperability.", "The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs are intended to  help increase the adoption and meaningful use of EHRs by providing  incentive payments for providers\u2014that is, certain hospitals and health  care professionals such as physicians\u2014who participate in Medicare and  Medicaid, and later imposing payment adjustments, also referred to as  penalties, on those Medicare providers that do not meet meaningful use  requirements for a program year. Within HHS, ONC and the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) develop the programs\u2019  requirements. CMS establishes specific requirements providers must  meet to qualify for incentive payments. Some of these requirements  include the exchange of health information, which is a component of  interoperability. ONC identifies health data standards and technical  specifications for EHR systems and certifies EHR systems used by  providers in the program to help ensure that providers implement a  system that offers a minimum level of technological capability,  functionality, and security.

Providers  may also be subject to additional state privacy rules, which can be more  stringent than HIPAA requirements or standards. For example, states can  set requirements around default practices for health information  exchange. Specifically, states that require patients to \u201copt-in\u201d to health  information exchange do not allow the sharing of health information  unless patients affirmatively consent to share health information.

According to some stakeholders, some  standards allow EHR systems to use different formats and terminology  when exchanging data. However, this resulting variability prevents the  receiving system from processing the information and properly integrating  it into the patient record; in other words, the systems are not  interoperable.

Some states require additional patient  consent when exchanging such information. A representative from one  initiative explained that current digital methods for exchange do not  provide assurance that sensitive information is protected in accordance  with privacy rules. According to this initiative representative, the sensitive  information that is subject to more stringent privacy rules could be  inadvertently aggregated with other health information and exchanged  without the patient\u2019s consent, thereby violating privacy rules.

This challenge exists  because many EHR systems use demographic information, such as a  patient\u2019s name and date of birth, to match different health records for a  given patient held by different providers. As we previously reported,  demographic variables do not always yield accurate results because, for  example, there could be more than one patient with the same  information. In addition, providers may not collect and use the same  demographic variables for matching. For example, one initiative  representative explained that a recent effort to achieve interoperability  with another organization stalled because the other organization relies on  a patient\u2019s social security number for patient matching, but the initiative  does not collect social security numbers for its patients.
