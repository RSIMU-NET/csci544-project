The Air Force began OCX development in 2010 prior to completing preliminary development reviews in contrast with best acquisition practices. It accelerated OCX development in 2012 to meet optimistic GPS III satellite launch timeframes even as OCX development problems and costs grew, and then paused development in 2013 to address problems and resolve what it believed were root causes. However, as the figure below shows, OCX cost and schedule growth have persisted due in part to a high defect rate, which may result from systemic issues.

Even so, the military services are unlikely to have sufficient knowledge to make informed procurement decisions starting in fiscal year 2018 because operational testing that provides valuable information about MGUE performance will not be complete until fiscal year 2019.", "The current GPS constellation has proven to be much more reliable than the Air Force predicted when GAO last reported on it in 2010. Given delays to OCX, the Air Force has prepared contingency plans for sustaining the GPS constellation, but these plans may not deliver the full range of GPS capability. Initial M-code capability will not be available until OCX delivery in mid-2019 at the earliest and full M-code capability is likely at least a decade away\u2014once the services are able to deploy MGUE receivers in sufficient numbers.

A milestone B review is an important point  in a program where requirements and resources\u2014that is, technology,  design, time, and funding\u2014should be properly matched to make sure the  program can be executed as planned. The Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&L) approved the Air  Force\u2019s request in January 2010 to award the OCX development contract  prior to milestone B. The Air Force and USD AT&L decided to award the  contract early for several reasons. First, the Air Force believed that the 3- year competitive technology development effort from 2007-2010, where  two contractors (Northrop Grumman and Raytheon) worked on proof-of- concept prototypes for OCX, successfully demonstrated initial  functionality and reduced risk. Second, the Air Force wanted to reduce  the costs of carrying two contractors through PDR. Finally, the Air Force  and USD AT&L believed that splitting efforts between two contractors was  slowing progress on the program, and decided that down-selecting to one  contractor prior to milestone B would help accelerate OCX completion.  According to Raytheon officials, a contributing factor was the need to  align OCX development with that of GPS III development, the  development contract for which was awarded 21 months earlier, in May  2008.", "In addition, prior to development start, the program did not complete a  PDR\u2014which assesses the maturity of the preliminary design and  confirms that the system is ready to proceed into detailed design with  acceptable risk. As GAO\u2019s best practices work has shown, PDR is a  critical step at which customer needs are balanced with available  resources. Programs that are launched prior to completing a preliminary  design tend to experience more problems compared to programs where  launch occurs after completing a preliminary design. Figure 6 below  depicts how programs generally have better outcomes when they are  launched after conducting relatively more detailed systems engineering:  particularly, completing a preliminary design before formally launching.  Programs launched after only completing a notional design\u2014a general  concept, unconstrained by resources, of what the product will look like  and what it might be capable of\u2014often experienced problems and  needed more time or money than had been estimated at program launch.", "OCX program office and Raytheon officials stated that certain OCX  requirements were not well understood at the time of contract award. In  particular, Raytheon officials stated that the company did not understand  the extent to which it would be required to implement Information  Assurance (IA) requirements until as late as 2013, 3 years after beginning  OCX development. The purpose of IA, also referred to as cybersecurity,  is to ensure that DOD systems can resist and continue to operate during  cyber-attacks by managing risks and implementing safeguards. OCX was  required to be compliant with the DOD directive that prescribes IA  policies, responsibilities, and procedures, among other things, for DOD  information technology and defense components. In light of increasing  cyber threats and given that satellite ground systems are the most  vulnerable components to potential attacks, the Air Force plans for OCX  to have an improved IA capability over the current GPS control system.  According to program and Raytheon officials, OCX is going to be one of  the first large-scale programs within DOD to fully implement IA  requirements. In addition, Raytheon officials described cybersecurity  threats as continuously evolving, and that both Raytheon and the Air  Force have had to adapt their interpretation over time of how to meet IA  requirements on OCX development to address changing threats.", "Program office and Raytheon officials noted that past DOD acquisition  programs routinely waived some of the IA requirements in prior programs,  and that Raytheon entered OCX development with the expectation that  some IA requirements would be waived as in the past. According to  Raytheon officials, at the time OCX development began, neither the Air  Force nor Raytheon had the experience\u2014and therefore, the knowledge\u2014 of developing such a complex IA-intensive program. Given the  importance of GPS to the military and civil communities and with the  increase in cybersecurity threats, the Air Force did not waive any IA  requirements for OCX. Consequently, Raytheon found that it had greatly  underestimated the cost and time to meet these requirements.

However, at PDR, Raytheon did not prepare\u2014and the Air  Force did not assess\u2014a preliminary design for the entire OCX system  because Raytheon followed an iterative software development process  unlike the traditional, \u201cwaterfall\u201d software development process. An  iterative approach is a common industry practice that consists of  developing software in a series of iterations and blocks, where developers  go through multiple cycles of breaking down requirements, and designing,  coding, and integrating software. By contrast, in the traditional waterfall  approach the system is fully designed before coding and testing follow in  a linear sequence. In theory, an iterative approach allows for a balanced  and efficient use of resources when developing complex systems.  Smaller iterative development cycles\u2014as opposed to a lengthy, linear,  waterfall development process\u2014allow for capabilities to more easily be  added incrementally, lessons learned to be incorporated, and early  integration testing to be conducted to minimize cost and schedule risk. To  achieve this, effective systems engineering\u2014the process of deriving and  allocating requirements for individual software iterations\u2014is key. The Air  Force, acknowledging Raytheon\u2019s use of an iterative approach in late  2010, tailored its preliminary design review criteria\u2014which originally were  based on a traditional, waterfall approach\u2014to only review the two  iterations completed by Raytheon at that point. For the remaining six  iterations, Raytheon had only completed the initial allocation of  requirements at a high level. However, as Raytheon encountered  problems in software development, it began deferring difficult work to later  iterations.", "Raytheon was experiencing difficulties developing OCX, but the Air Force  presented optimistic assessments of progress to USD AT&L. By October  2011, an independent OSD-chartered review team\u2014one of a series of  independent reviews\u2014warned of severe software development problems,  particularly with mounting deferred work, ineffective integration testing,  and overestimated software productivity rates, and predicted a 15 to 19  month delay to block 1 delivery. According to an official with USD AT&L,  these independent assessments are designed to identify program cost,  schedule, and performance risks and provide feedback to the program  manager and the milestone decision authority. The official further noted  that the assessments were considered helpful, but essentially nonbinding  advice from department experts to the program manager. The  independent team followed up in February 2012 for a more detailed  assessment of OCX and predicted a higher, 24-month slip to block 1.  However, at the annual GPS enterprise review (AGER) with USD AT&L in  April 2012, the Air Force acknowledged the software issues but projected  a shorter, 11-month delay citing various corrective actions already taken,  including greater oversight. This projection proved to be overly optimistic.  In light of the challenges experienced to that point, at the April 2012  AGER, USD AT&L postponed the scheduled milestone B decision for  OCX and directed the program to return for a formal Defense Acquisition  Board (DAB) review within 120 days and to report on progress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Accelerated OCX Development to Meet Optimistic GPS III Satellite Launch Time Frames Even as OCX Was Experiencing Problems", "paragraphs": ["In the midst of mounting OCX problems, the Air Force disrupted the  ongoing software development effort. As it became apparent that OCX  block 1 would not be ready in time to support the then-projected launch  time frames of the first GPS III satellite (August 2015 and May 2014  respectively), USD AT&L directed the Air Force in January 2011 to  separate out development of the satellite launch and initial testing portion  of the block 1 software. Dubbed block 0, this subset of software is to  contain the capabilities needed to launch and test the initial GPS III  satellites. The Air Force modified the OCX contract in January 2012 to  implement this change, which included bringing forward IA capabilities  originally scheduled for later iterations. Block 0 is a temporary measure  because the Air Force anticipated that some GPS III satellites would need  to be launched before the entirety of block 1 was to be developed. Block  0 does not allow the GPS III satellites to be incorporated into the overall  GPS constellation and used by the military or civil community\u2014which  requires block 1 implementation. Further, this decision to accelerate the  GPS III launch and test capability was based on Air Force assessments  of GPS III progress that appeared overly optimistic, as GAO found at the  time. Nevertheless, according to Raytheon officials, the creation of block  0 and acceleration of some software capabilities caused it to have to  revamp the OCX software development plan 2 years into development\u2014 not in accordance with best practices in software development, which call  for stabilizing requirements and design prior to coding. Our prior work in  this area shows that too many changes to requirements can result in  additional, sometimes unmanageable risk.", "Meanwhile, Raytheon continued to struggle with developing OCX,  specifically with implementing IA requirements. The contractor was overly  optimistic in its initial estimates of the work associated with incorporating  open source and reused software, and, according to the Air Force, did not  appear to follow IA screening or software assurance processes as  required, for example, incorporating open source software without  ensuring that it was IA-compliant. The Air Force stated that it was not  aware that Raytheon\u2019s software assurance processes were not in  compliance with the OCX software development plan until it performed an  audit of Raytheon\u2019s secure coding process in August 2012. According to  Raytheon officials, however, the development contract did not specifically  address the extent that open source software had to be scanned for IA  compliance. Nevertheless, this led to significant rework and added cost to  remediate the security vulnerabilities and meet IA standards. In addition,  Raytheon\u2019s systems engineering was incomplete, resulting in an inability  to build code as planned and work being consistently deferred to later  iterations. The Air Force noted that it became aware of these systems  engineering issues early in development and took some corrective  actions such as defining the completion of certain components; however,  these actions were focused only on high-priority OCX components.", "Nevertheless, in July 2012, the Air Force presented a positive progress  report at the mandated DAB review, stating essentially that all technical  issues had been identified and mitigated, the design fully validated, and  an executable and realistic schedule put in place after a thorough internal  examination of the program. While the program stated that sufficient  margin had been incorporated into the cost and schedule estimates, the  program\u2019s estimates for block 1 delivery\u2014between February and October  2016\u2014were still optimistic compared to the time frames (November 2016  to March 2017) forecast by the independent team in October 2011.

In addition,  DCMA reported as early as August 2013 that the Air Force and Raytheon  were going to soon begin an over target baseline (OTB) process where  DOD determines that contract budgets are unrealistic and formally  increases the program\u2019s budget. An OTB is intended to allow for more  realistic budget and work estimates and, therefore, more meaningful  performance measurement against the updated budget.", "However, at the September 2013 AGER, the Air Force again presented  an optimistic assessment of the program to USD AT&L, stating that OCX  was on track to meet milestone B cost and schedule estimates, IA  challenges had been identified, and key metrics had been established to  ensure progress. The program projected just a 2-month delay to block 1  (to December 2016).", "Meanwhile, the Air Force noted that an excessive amount of rework was  occurring at the time, and it directed Raytheon in November 2013 to  pause development and complete a greater level of systems engineering  for block 1. In December the Air Force and Raytheon began an OTB  process to identify root causes and corrective actions and establish  revised cost and schedule goals for OCX, and notified USD AT&L that  block 1 delivery was likely to slip by approximately 9 months, to  September 2017.", "The OTB concluded in June 2014, and identified root causes, many of  which were similar to those identified at previous AGERs and  independent assessments: incomplete systems engineering, inadequate  process discipline, and IA implementation difficulties due to complexity. At  this point, the Air Force\u2019s estimate of the program\u2019s development cost had  grown to $1.7 billion\u2014about 6 percent more than the milestone B  estimate and nearly twice the initial contract estimate in 2010. The Air  Force also added a total of 2 years to the program over its estimate at the  September 2013 AGER with block 1 delivery moved to November 2018.", "Despite the ongoing problems with OCX development, the Air Force,  faced with the statutory deadline to deliver M-code capable receivers\u2014 and consequently, OCX support for M-code\u2014by fiscal year 2018, added  some uncertainty to the OCX development plan. The Air Force agreed  with Raytheon during the OTB to concurrently develop a portion of block  2 M-code capability during the block 1 effort; however, the Air Force  noted in technical comments on a draft of this report that Raytheon is  under no contractual obligation to do so. Complicating matters, the Air  Force made significant updates to M-code signal requirements in 2014,  contributing to additional OCX requirements changes. At the time of  contract award in 2010, the Air Force had only developed a preliminary  M-code specification, and it took time for the Air Force to fully mature M- code requirements and specify the functionality required of OCX.  According to Raytheon officials, this had a significant effect on the IA  requirements and design of certain components of OCX."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The OCX Contractor Has Continued to Struggle with OCX Development and a Realistic, Executable Schedule Is Not Yet Evident", "paragraphs": ["The OCX program\u2019s path forward following the conclusion of the OTB  process in June 2014 depended on resolving certain problems in order to  meet revised cost and schedule targets.

By October 2014, just 4 months after the OTB,  DCMA reported that the defect resolution rate was unsustainable,  needing a continual increase in cost and schedule, with the trend likely to  continue. In addition, DCMA found that the majority of defects were  identified during the later phases of software development at which point  it is harder and much more expensive to resolve than if found earlier.  Latest available DCMA reports, as of May 2015, showed that Raytheon  had yet to bring the defect rate within planned levels. Raytheon officials  noted in early July 2015 that the defect discovery rate and backlog have  been greatly reduced as OCX prepares to begin testing on iteration 1.5.  However, data on the number of defects open and resolved show that the  defect backlog as of July 2015 was still more than three times that  predicted in February 2015. In addition, DCMA has pointed out that the  test activities will likely identify new defects, potentially increasing the  backlog further. DCMA further noted that the current defect backlog  consists of more complex and difficult defects, which will require  considerable effort to close compared to those resolved so far.", "The persistently high defect rate for OCX may be a result of as-yet  unidentified systemic issues.

For example, Raytheon has had difficulty establishing consistent software  development environments\u2014the computer infrastructure including  hardware, operating systems, and databases\u2014across the OCX program.  Developers built each of the environments with different hardware and  operating system versions and settings. According to Raytheon officials,  this was partly because the Air Force\u2019s requirements called for multiple  tailored environments to save on hardware costs, but that this drove  complexity and posed technical difficulties to Raytheon. This meant that  the contractor could not deploy a given software build onto all the  environments without a lot of rework\u2014and consequently, time and  expense. Following the June 2014 OTB, the Air Force and Raytheon  reported that they had taken steps to correct this issue, such as using  automated tools to ensure consistency. However, latest available data, as  of May 2015, showed that inconsistent environments were still  contributing to a high defect rate and consequent cost growth and delays.  Raytheon noted that it had greatly reduced the amount of time required to  deploy software builds onto a given environment to 3 days as of July  2015; however, this was still well short of the 1-day limit called for by the  October 2014 independent review.", "Another example of undisciplined processes at Raytheon is its peer  review process. DCMA reported in a November 2014 audit that peer  reviews\u2014shown by our prior work to be a crucial quality assurance  component of software development\u2014were inconsistent and less  effective than planned. The OCX software development plan identifies  peer reviews as an integral part of the software development process, the  main purpose of which is to identify and report defects in software  artifacts\u2014work products such as code, software class libraries, and  design models\u2014as early as possible in the development life cycle.  Effective peer reviews depend, in part, on clear instructions, compliance,  and standards, as well as consistent processes. DCMA reported  Raytheon having problems with all of these items. In its audit, DCMA  noted that the work instructions were often unclear, contradictory, or  contained loopholes; many peer reviews were non-compliant with the  work instructions; and a high percentage of reviews were held \u201cvirtually\u201d  where users review artifacts independently instead of during a formal, in- person meeting as presumed in the OCX software development plan.  DCMA concluded that the quality of the peer review process was  questionable because peer-reviewed software artifacts resulted in an  abnormally high number of defects being discovered later.

As  of the latest available data, from February 2015, Raytheon\u2019s productivity  rate had increased above the rate achieved for 1.5 but was roughly only  half the forecast increase because of continued difficulties, increasing risk  that OCX delivery will be further delayed. According to DCMA, the  program has had a history of being overly optimistic with forecasting  schedules, for example, using data from Raytheon\u2019s prior experience on  other programs that have consistently proven inaccurate when applied to  OCX, and assuming efficiencies based on learning curves which have not  materialized due to staff turnover, process changes, and poor retention of  lessons learned from past development difficulties. This tendency of  overestimating software productivity rates was noted as far back as  October 2011 as part of an independent OSD-led assessment that  highlighted several OCX development problems. Raytheon noted that  corrective actions were taken as part of the OTB, such as revalidating  and completing systems engineering, establishing a common  environment infrastructure, and validating IA implementation during block  0 tests will result in software productivity improvement for iterations 1.6  and beyond beginning in 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USD AT&L May Not Have Adequate Insight into OCX Progress", "paragraphs": ["USD AT&L may not have adequate insight into the full extent of OCX  development problems given the Air Force\u2019s consistently optimistic  assessments of the program\u2019s progress.

DOT&E also  expressed concerns about OCX delays in a memorandum sent to USD  AT&L in early November 2014, citing the negative effect of those delays  on the Air Force\u2019s ability to deliver overall GPS capability. In addition,  DOT&E called the Air Force\u2019s schedules for the overall GPS enterprise,  including that of OCX, \u201cinaccurate, implausible, and incoherent\u201d given  OCX development difficulties to date.", "Nevertheless, at the ensuing fiscal year 2015 AGER that was held in  November 2014, the Air Force acknowledged additional development  difficulties but noted that OCX systems engineering was improving and  would lead to better software development in the future. At that time, the  OCX program office forecast block 1 completion in August 2019\u2014a delay  of 9 months over the OTB estimate, but optimistic compared to the  independent review\u2019s assessment. One month later, in December 2014,  the Air Force presented its official update for the program and forecast a  block 1 completion date of July 2019. It also estimated that contract costs  had grown to nearly $2 billion\u2014representing cost growth of 16 percent in  just 5 months over the OTB estimate, and more than 120 percent over  initial contract estimates in 2010.", "Following the November 2014 AGER, in December 2014, USD AT&L  expressed concern about the continued deterioration in the cost  performance of OCX and stated that the program\u2019s trajectory must be  corrected. USD AT&L directed the Air Force to provide by January 2015 a  \u201cdeep dive\u201d program review of OCX focused on the status of and ways to  improve program execution. At this review, which occurred in February  2015, the Air Force acknowledged the program\u2019s volatile cost and  schedule history and that the contractor\u2019s schedules were aggressive  relative to the risk and amount of work remaining. However, the Air Force  also highlighted signs that program execution was stabilizing and noted  that it had reduced program risk to medium-low by including an additional  $331 million and 3 months above contractor estimates. To address USD  AT&L\u2019s directive to detail OCX\u2019s path forward and key decision points  should OCX continue to sustain cost and schedule growth, the Air Force  established a process whereby it would closely monitor key software  development events roughly every 6 months beginning in July 2015 and  report any deviations from cost performance to the Air Force\u2019s senior  acquisition executive as well as to USD AT&L as needed.", "While the closer monitoring of key software development events provides  USD AT&L with opportunities to spot cost growth on a more timely basis  than at the annual AGERs, there is little reason to believe that OCX  systemic problems have been adequately addressed. Notwithstanding the  Air Force\u2019s optimistic report to USD AT&L in February 2015, additional  OCX cost growth is quite likely. First, our analysis of detailed earned  value data from November 2013 through November 2014 showed that the  program office significantly underestimated the anticipated cost of  resolving the risks that could affect OCX development and may have also  significantly underestimated the extent of risks. Second, DCMA\u2019s  reporting of earned value performance for the program shows a sustained  deterioration in program cost and schedule performance immediately  following the OTB\u2014where cost and schedule variances were reset to  zero in order to begin measuring performance against the new baseline.  Cost and schedule variances measure the differences in expectations  between the value of work accomplished in a given period with the value  of the work expected in that period. Negative variances indicate that the  program is either overrunning cost or performing less work than planned;  conversely, positive variances indicate the program is either underrunning  cost or performing more work than planned. Figure 7 below shows the  cumulative cost and schedule variances from October 2013 through last  available data as of May 2015, and how the OCX program has been both  overrunning cost and performing less work than planned immediately  after the OTB concluded. While the OTB process completed in June  2014, the program formally reset the cost and schedule baselines at the  end of July.", "Further, DCMA\u2019s June 2015 analysis forecast that OCX costs were likely  to increase to $2.15 billion based upon, among other things, the higher  than expected defect rate and poor comprehension of requirements by  Raytheon. From November 2014 through last available data as of May  2015, Raytheon depended on shifting between approximately 100 and  180 additional staff than planned to resolve defects, slowing work on later  iterations. According to DCMA, Raytheon will likely need even more staff  in the future to maintain schedule, and, consequently, incur additional  cost growth. The Air Force\u2019s current schedule estimates, forecasting  block 1 completion in July 2019, are still optimistic by at least a year  compared to the October 2014 independent team\u2019s assessment that  block 1 will most likely be delivered in November 2020. Figure 8 below  summarizes the differences in Air Force estimates for the total number of  months to complete block 1 and those predicted by independent reviews.", "In addition, our prior work on space acquisitions has shown that  unrealistic estimates of the achievability of planned schedules, among  other things, directly contributed to unrealistic cost estimates and,  consequently, distorted management decisions, increased risks to  mission success, and virtually guaranteed program delays. By contrast,  senior leaders in successful organizations in the commercial sector  actively encouraged program managers to share bad news about their  programs. These organizations took pains to ensure program estimates  are complete and accurate. Based on the persistently high software  defect rate, continued undisciplined processes, lower than expected  software productivity rates, the downward trend in cost and schedule  performance following the OTB, and lack of realism in Air Force  depictions of OCX progress, root causes do not appear to have been  adequately addressed or perhaps even fully identified.

As part of that work, we also found that a knowledge deficit early in a  program can cascade through design and production, leaving decision  makers with less knowledge to support decisions about when and how  best to move into subsequent acquisition phases that commit more  budgetary resources.

The Air  Force stated that a CDR was unnecessary because, among other things,  detailed design work normally approved at CDR was completed for  MGUE\u2019s PDR in September 2014 and hardware and software designs  and cost, schedule, and performance risks typically reviewed at CDR  were assessed as part of that PDR. It also anticipated other events would  cover and go beyond the purpose of a CDR, including a compatibility  certification process to ensure MGUE receiver cards were compatible  with the GPS satellite signal; security validation to ensure contractors\u2019  designs met security certification criteria; initial and final verification  reviews to assess product maturity and deficiencies; and utilizing multiple  contractors with multiple designs from which the military services can  choose to meet their requirements.", "However, the MGUE program carries design-related risks that would  typically be revisited within the CDR context. An April 2015 assessment of  the MGUE PDR by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for  System Engineering noted, for example, that some security and  information assurance design details were not addressed as part of PDR  and had been deferred to the security verification review scheduled to  finish in late summer/early fall 2015. The Undersecretary\u2019s office also  pointed out that the refinement of security countermeasures may result in  later design changes. In addition, the office stated that MGUE PDR  interface designs with the military services\u2019 lead platforms may not be  rigorous enough to account for implementing those designs across  various operating environments.", "Moreover, it is unclear whether MGUE designs meet the military services\u2019  requirements. According to Army program officials, the Army has  identified a set of performance gaps for ground and aviation receiver  cards between the MGUE program\u2019s technical requirements document  and Army operational requirements, including power and thermal  incompatibility issues between the ground receiver card and the platform  the cards are to support. The MGUE program said that it is unaware of  any data showing the ground cards do not meet power and thermal  requirements; analysis shows the cards meet service requirements for  power as captured in MGUE\u2019s capability development document; the  power and thermal issues may be caused by the host platforms rather  than the ground cards; and as such, the lead platform program offices  would need to make modification to their power supplies or platforms to  resolve the issues. Army officials, in contrast, said that the MGUE  capability development document does not contain specific power  consumption limits and that the Air Force\u2019s GPS Directorate had recently  changed power limitations by unilaterally editing the MGUE technical  requirements document, against significant objection by the Army.

The Air Force said that  testing on surrogate platforms is intended as early risk reduction activity  rather than emulation of lead platform environments. Additionally, it stated  that it plans to conduct subsystem-level integration on lead platforms prior  to system-level integration, and that these efforts also would provide the  military services with further information to asses MGUE performance.", "Some of the military services, however, believe that the integration  activities to date have been more limited than indicated by the Air Force  and that they are now responsible for more of the MGUE development  effort than indicated earlier in DOD policy. Army officials stated, for  example, that the MGUE program began initial contact with the DAGR D3  program office in fiscal year 2014, but that integration with the DAGR  D3/Stryker per se has not yet started due to lack of MGUE devices for  platform integration. Instead, they said, \u201cfit check\u201d tests were conducted in  early 2015 and showed the DAGR D3 is unable to provide sufficient  power to two of the three MGUE contractors\u2019 ground receiver cards. The  officials also said that the Army planned to perform thermal testing with  the DAGR D3/Stryker, but such testing has not yet been executed due to  lack of MGUE devices. They emphasized that they have begun planning  for MGUE procurement but cannot initiate actual procurement at the start  of fiscal year 2018 for several reasons, including the need to modify as- built MGUE devices to close performance gaps, resolve power and  thermal issues by either modifying one MGUE card design or the  integration on some 100 platforms; and developing and implementing a  means for MGUE and the currently-fielded Selective Availability Anti- Spoofing Module GPS receiver to coexist and interact in the field. In  addition, both Army and Navy officials stated that, based on their  understanding of DOD\u2019s 2006 policy on GPS user equipment and  procurement, the Air Force was to develop MGUE to production-ready  status. They noted that, in order to bring MGUE to true production-ready  status, their respective military services will need to do further  development after the Air Force completes its MGUE development effort.", "Moreover, the demonstrations and risk reduction activities that the Air  Force points to may not establish MGUE performance to the extent that  the Air Force believes. For example, DOT&E\u2014the DOD independent test  authority charged with ensuring a program\u2019s operational testing confirms  operational effectiveness and suitability in combat use\u2014expressed  serious concerns about the Air Force\u2019s characterization of the results from  one of the past demonstrations. In a November 2014 memorandum to  USD AT&L, DOT&E emphasized that the Air Force had overstated MGUE  development maturity and that the demonstrations to-date had achieved  more mixed results than the Air Force indicated. DOT&E noted, for  example, that the testing with the Army\u2019s Raven did not use final  development models; had employed a limited subset of realistic threats;  successfully flew its intended flight pattern in just 7 out of 51 attempts;  and that none of those flights was conducted in the presence of electronic  jamming. It went on to say that developmental activity with the Raven  should in no way be construed as having the level of rigor of operational  testing or even formal developmental testing. Furthermore, Army program  officials stated that the Army\u2019s lead platform had been changed from the  Raven to the DAGR D3/Stryker not only because the Army does not  intend to procure additional Ravens but also because the Raven does not  adequately stress the capabilities of the ground receiver card.", "In addition, DOT&E concluded in its 2014 memorandum that MGUE  cannot be considered effective until it is successfully integrated on host  platforms. According to a DOT&E official, subsystem integration does not  guarantee proper integration into a larger system and may not necessarily  demonstrate integration and performance in the intended operational  environment\u2014particularly in light of the fact that the MGUE test strategy  is inherently risky in that only 4 lead platforms are designated to represent  the operating conditions for over 100 platforms service-wide. He also  emphasized\u2014as did DOT&E\u2019s 2014 memorandum \u2014that DOD has found  integration historically challenging.", "Our prior work on integration and testing has also shown that integration  is a common risk in system development, and that commercial firms  reduce risk by capturing design and manufacturing knowledge early.  Our previous work pointed out, for example, that systems integration  problems can occur even though the various components performed  successfully on previous systems. We have found, in illustration, that the  Air Force\u2019s C-17 aircraft program intended to use current, available, and  proven technology to minimize development costs and structure a low  technical risk effort but that the integration of technologies was a major  engineering and management task that eventually contributed to  significant cost increases. In addition, we have also determined that it is  during integration and testing that problems are likely to be found.  Furthermore, as we pointed out in a 2000 study of best acquisition  practices for testing among commercial firms, test weaknesses invariably  cause negative program outcomes, such as cost increases, schedule  delays, or performance shortfalls. Our work on best commercial  acquisition practices also shows that such negative outcomes can be  avoided by accumulating knowledge prior to beginning production. In a  2002 study of best commercial practices, for example, we found that  leading commercial firms reduce program risk by demonstrating fully- integrated prototypes prior to making production decisions. Such  demonstrations, we determined, help the firms decide when to make the  transition from product development to production and to ensure that  transition is smooth.", "The military services can postpone procuring MGUE if they lack sufficient  knowledge about MGUE design and performance after fiscal year 2017.  They can, as provided by the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2011, request a waiver of such procurement. Specifically, the  Secretary of Defense may waive this limitation upon a determination that  suitable M-code capable user equipment is either not available or DOD  does not require that user equipment be capable of receiving M-code  from GPS.

However, the modified  ground system would operate GPS III satellites as current legacy GPS  satellites, thereby not utilizing all the capabilities on the new satellites.  Moreover, this approach would increase the risk that several IIIs may be  launched before they can be fully tested with OCX. Delays to OCX  delivery also mean that M-code functionality\u2014which requires OCX block  1 to be fully enabled\u2014is not scheduled to be deployed until 2019 at the  earliest, and likely for another decade or more until the military services  can widely deploy modernized MGUE receivers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Air Force Has Found Ways to Extend the Life of the GPS Constellation", "paragraphs": ["The performance standards for (1) the standard positioning service  provided to civil and commercial GPS users, and (2) the precise  positioning service provided to military GPS users, commit the U.S.  government to at least a 95 percent probability of maintaining a  constellation of 24 operational GPS satellites. In September 2010, we  reported that delays to the launch of the GPS III satellites\u2014originally  projected to begin in April 2014\u2014could affect the long-term probability of  maintaining the minimum constellation size. Based on satellite reliability  data provided by the Air Force, we had predicted that, for example, a 2- year delay in the production and launch of the first and all subsequent  GPS III satellites would reduce the guaranteed size of the constellation  (at the 95 percent confidence level) to about 18 satellites by around fiscal  year 2018.", "Since our 2010 report, the launch availability date for the first GPS III  satellite has, in fact, slipped by about 3 years, to May 2017, mainly due to  development difficulties with its navigation payload. Moreover, as  discussed earlier, the delivery of OCX block 1\u2014required to operate the  IIIs\u2014has been delayed by about 4 years, to mid-2019. However, the 3- year delay in GPS III\u2019s delivery has not resulted in a predicted significant  reduction in the size of the GPS constellation largely because the  expected life of the existing generations of GPS satellites has risen  dramatically. Figure 10 below displays the probability of maintaining a 24- satellite GPS constellation as a function of time based on March 2014  satellite reliability data and launch schedules\u2014the latest date for which a  complete set of approved parameters is available. The launch schedule  has been adjusted to reflect the successful launches of four GPS IIF  satellites through June 2015.", "The expected lifetimes of the GPS IIR and IIR-M satellites\u2014the types of  satellites that currently comprise the majority of the current  constellation\u2014have risen dramatically since our 2010 report, from 14.8  and 10.5 years, respectively, to 20.4 and 17.5 years, respectively. This  increase in expected lifetime is due mainly to the Air Force\u2019s  implementation of a modified charging procedure that will prolong the life  of the satellites\u2019 batteries. Spacecraft batteries\u2014like all other  rechargeable batteries\u2014are subject to cycle life, that is, they can only be  charged and discharged so many times before they will not charge  efficiently anymore. Because satellite batteries were predicted to be one  of the primary life-limiting components of these satellites, the Air Force  developed and tested a procedure in 2012 to reduce the battery charge  rates during certain times of the year. The Air Force estimated that this  new procedure would increase the expected lifetimes of the IIR and IIR-M  satellites by 1 to 2 years. Based on recent telemetry data, the new  procedure has proved successful. In 2014, the Air Force announced  that this modified battery charging procedure has added, in aggregate, 27  additional years of operational life to the GPS IIR and IIR-M satellites.  Moreover, according to Air Force representatives, additional information  suggests that this estimate is probably conservative, and that the next  formal review of satellite reliability data will likely reveal an additional  increase in the expected life of the IIR satellites. Because these satellites  form the mainstay of the current GPS constellation, and because most of  them are still expected to be operational in 2017, when the first GPS III  satellite is planned to be available for launch, an increase in the expected  life of these older satellites significantly improves the Air Force\u2019s ability to  meet the 24-satellite performance standard despite the 3-year slip in GPS  III and 4-year slip in OCX.", "The expected lifetimes of the GPS IIA satellites\u2014the oldest version of  GPS satellites on orbit\u2014have also risen since our 2010 report, from 16.5  years to 19.7 years, due to positive trends in on orbit performance.  However, the effect of this increase on the Air Force\u2019s ability to meet the  24-satellite performance standards is less significant than the effect of the  IIR/IIR-M life expectancy increase. The current constellation availability  analysis assumes each of these satellites is only available to replace  other satellites in the unlikely event of a large number of satellite failures  until OCX is operational. Because OCX is not expected to be capable of  operating the IIA satellites, the analysis assumes that any remaining IIA  satellites would be turned off by July 2019, the date that OCX is  scheduled to be required to be ready to transition to operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional OCX Delays Could Affect Constellation Availability", "paragraphs": ["Despite the delays to GPS III and OCX, the GPS constellation is  expected to meet the constellation size requirement if OCX block 1 is  available by July 2019 as needed.

The launching of M-code capable satellites has been stretched  over a much longer period than originally envisioned because of delays to  the IIF, III, OCX, and MGUE programs.

However,  by any measure, OCX development has been mired in development  difficulties resulting in steady cost growth and schedule delays. Moreover,  despite a 7 month pause ending in mid-2014, OCX has yet to turn the  corner on resolving the problems that have affected the program since  development began in 2010. Independent observers such as OSD-led  teams, DCMA, and DOT&E have raised red flags about the effectiveness  of the Air Force\u2019s oversight and Raytheon\u2019s ability to deliver promised  outcomes. The Air Force has compounded matters by consistently  presenting overly optimistic assessments about OCX progress\u2014 demonstrating a pattern of marginalizing warnings about OCX delays  presented by independent assessors, likely because their assessments  are considered advisory in nature. Driving towards unrealistic timeframes  is compounding the program\u2019s inability to meet stated cost and schedule  goals. Five years into what was originally estimated to be a 5-year effort,  OCX is still roughly 5 years away from completion. Without  comprehensively identifying systemic causes for OCX problems, DOD  cannot have high-confidence cost and schedule estimates for OCX. The  Air Force and Raytheon have noted that OTB corrective actions will begin  paying off in early 2016 as block 1 development resumes in earnest. But  given the lack of success in prior attempts to turn the program around, the  Air Force could benefit from external expertise and guidance on what is  necessary to address systemic issues.", "Since the enactment of the statute directing DOD to generally procure  only M-code capable user equipment after fiscal year 2017, the Air Force  has struggled to deliver a MGUE acquisition strategy that would allow the  military services to comply with that direction. As it stands now, the Air  Force essentially truncates its MGUE development work and hands the  result of its efforts off to the military services to continue development on  their respective platforms. At the point the Air Force provides funds to the  military services for them to acquire and test MGUE, it also transfers the  onus of the development work to the military services\u2019 shoulders because  MGUE development cannot be considered complete until the cards work  in the lead platforms. Unfortunately, the military services will absorb an  added development burden because the Air Force plans to transfer its  work without conducting design and performance assessments that could  help the services decide the extent to which the cards are ready to  integrate and test and how much additional work they will need to do  before beginning to procure the cards.", "Fortunately, many GPS satellites now on orbit have served the nation  particularly well by working considerably longer than expected. Even so, it  cannot be presumed that they will continue to do so. Therefore, it is  critical that the modernized GPS III, OCX, and MGUE development  efforts succeed sooner rather than later. Of those three programs, OCX is  now the pacing item for modernization due to its many past delays and  probable future delays.
