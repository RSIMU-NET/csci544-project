Unfortunately, except for the 2007 Statement of Social Insurance, GAO was again unable to provide assurance on the reliability of the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government (CFS) due primarily to certain material weaknesses in the federal government's internal control. GAO has reported that unless these weaknesses are adequately addressed, they will, among other things, (1) hamper the federal government's ability to reliably report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, and other related information; and (2) affect the federal government's ability to reliably measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs and activities. This testimony presents the results of GAO's audit of the CFS for fiscal year 2007 and discusses the federal government's long-term fiscal outlook."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the 11th consecutive year, three major impediments prevented GAO from rendering an opinion on the federal government's accrual basis consolidated financial statements: (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. In addition, financial management system problems continue to hinder federal agency accountability. Although the federal government still has a long way to go, significant progress has been made in improving federal financial management. For example, audit results for many federal agencies have improved and federal financial system requirements have been developed. In addition, GAO was able to render an unqualified opinion on the 2007 Statement of Social Insurance. Further, for the first time, the federal government issued a summary financial report which is intended to make the information in the Financial Report of the U.S. Government (Financial Report) more accessible and understandable to a broader audience. It is important that this progress be sustained by the current administration as well as the new administration that will be taking office next year and that the Congress continues its oversight to bring about needed improvements to federal financial management. Given the federal government's current financial condition and the nation's long-term fiscal challenge, the need for the Congress and federal policymakers and management to have reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance information is greater than ever. Information included in the Financial Report, such as the Statement of Social Insurance along with long-term fiscal simulations and fiscal sustainability reporting, can help increase understanding of the nation's long-term fiscal outlook. The nation's long-term fiscal challenge is a matter of utmost concern. The federal government faces large and growing structural deficits due primarily to rising health care costs and known demographic trends. Simply put, the federal government is on an imprudent and unsustainable long-term fiscal path. Addressing this challenge will require a multipronged approach. Moreover, the longer that action is delayed, the greater the risk that the eventual changes will be disruptive and destabilizing. Finally, the federal government should consider the need for further revisions to the current federal financial reporting model to recognize the unique needs of the federal government. A broad reconsideration of issues, such as the kind of information that may be relevant and useful for a sovereign nation, could lead to reporting enhancements that might help provide the Congress and the President with more useful financial information to deliberate strategies to address the nation's long-term fiscal challenge."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am most pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2007 and  2006.

These  weaknesses are discussed in more detail in appendix II, including the  primary effects of the material weaknesses on the accrual basis  consolidated financial statements and on the management of federal  government operations. These other material weaknesses were the federal  government\u2019s inability to    determine the full extent to which improper payments occur,  identify and resolve information security control weaknesses and manage  information security risks on an ongoing basis, and    effectively manage its tax collection activities.", "Further, our audit report discusses certain significant deficiencies in  internal control at the governmentwide level. These significant  deficiencies involve the following areas:    preparing the Statement of Social Insurance for certain programs, and    monitoring and oversight regarding certain federal grants and entities that  offer Medicare health plan options.", "Individual federal agency financial statement audit reports identify  additional control deficiencies which were reported by agency auditors as  material weaknesses or significant deficiencies at the individual agency  level. We do not deem these additional control deficiencies to be material  weaknesses at the governmentwide level.", "Regarding agencies\u2019 internal controls, in December 2004, OMB revised  OMB Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal  Control, which became effective for fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2006,  agencies began to implement the more rigorous requirements of the  revised OMB Circular No. A-123, which include management  identification, assessment, testing, correction, and documentation of  internal controls over financial reporting for each account or group of  accounts, as well as an annual assurance statement from the agency head  as to whether internal control over financial reporting is effective.", "OMB recognized that due to the complexity of some agencies,  implementation of these new requirements may span more than 1 year.  Accordingly, certain agencies have adopted multiyear implementation  plans. According to OMB\u2019s Federal Financial Management Report for  2007, 16 of the 24 CFO Act agencies have performed assessments required  by OMB Circular No. A-123 for all key processes, while the remaining 8  CFO Act agencies are phasing in implementation of the requirements by  testing a portion of the key processes and providing plans for testing the  remaining processes within 3 years. Also, according to that report, to  achieve its strategic goal of improving effectiveness of internal control  over financial reporting, OMB has developed priority actions that include  updating guidance, as necessary, based on lessons learned from agencies\u2019  implementation of the circular.

Since the first financial statement audit of a  major DOD component was attempted almost 20 years ago, we have  reported that weaknesses in DOD\u2019s business operations, including  financial management, not only adversely affect the reliability of reported  financial data, but also the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of its  operations.", "DOD continues to dominate GAO\u2019s list of high-risk programs designated as  vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, bearing  responsibility, in whole or in part, for 15 of 27 high-risk areas.

Congress  clearly recognized, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2008, the need for executive-level attention in ensuring that DOD  was on a sustainable path toward achieving business transformation. This  legislation codifies Chief Management Officer (CMO) responsibilities at a  high level in the department\u2014assigning them to the Deputy Secretary of  Defense\u2014and establishing a full-time Deputy CMO and designating CMO  responsibilities within the military services. However, in less than a year,  our government will undergo a change in administrations, which raises  questions about the continuity of effort and the sustainability of the  progress that DOD has made to date. As such, we believe the CMO  position should be codified as a separate position from the Deputy  Secretary of Defense in order to provide full-time attention to business  transformation over the long term, subject to an extended term  appointment. Because business transformation is a long-term and complex  process, we have recommended a term of at least 5 to 7 years to provide  sustained leadership and accountability.", "Importantly, DOD has taken steps toward developing and implementing a  framework for addressing the department\u2019s long-standing financial  management weaknesses and improving its capability to provide timely,  reliable, and relevant financial information for analysis, decision making,  and reporting, a key defense transformation priority. Specifically, this  framework, which is discussed in both the department\u2019s Enterprise  Transition Plan (ETP) and the Financial Improvement and Audit  Readiness (FIAR) Plan, includes the department\u2019s Standard Financial  Information Structure (SFIS) and Business Enterprise Information System  (BEIS).

Based on  our analysis of the \u201cMaterial Difference Reports\u201d for fiscal year 2007, we  noted that a significant number of CFOs were unable to adequately explain  the differences with their trading partners or did not provide adequate  documentation to support responses. For both fiscal years 2007 and 2006,  amounts reported by federal agency trading partners for certain  intragovernmental accounts were not in agreement by significant amounts.  In addition, a significant number of CFOs cited differing accounting  methodologies, accounting errors, and timing differences for their material  differences with their trading partners. Some CFOs simply indicated that  they were unable to explain the differences with their trading partners  with no indication when the differences will be resolved.

This shows that  irrespective of these unqualified \u201cclean\u201d opinions on the financial  statements, many agencies still do not have reliable, useful and timely  financial information with which to make informed decisions and ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis.", "The modernization of federal financial management systems has been a  long-standing challenge at many federal agencies. As shown in figure 1,  auditors reported that 13 of the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 systems did not  substantially comply with one or more of the three FFMIA requirements  for fiscal year 2007. This compares with 17 agencies for fiscal year 2006.  Although the number of agencies reported as not substantially compliant  has declined, the federal government\u2019s capacity to manage with timely and  useful data remains limited, thereby hampering its ability to effectively  administer and oversee its major programs.", "For fiscal year 2007, noncompliance with federal financial management  systems requirements was the most frequently cited deficiency of the three  FFMIA requirements. One of the federal financial management systems  requirements is for agencies to have integrated financial management  systems. Based on our review of the fiscal year 2007 audit reports, we  identified the lack of integrated financial management systems to be one  of the six problem areas for the 13 agency systems that are reported as not  being substantially compliant with FFMIA. Figure 2 summarizes these six  areas and the number of agencies with problems reported in each area.", "The lack of integrated financial management systems typically results in  agencies expending major time, effort, and resources, including in some  cases, hiring external consultants to develop information that their  systems should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis. In  addition, nonintegrated systems are more prone to error which could  result in information that is not reliable, useful, or timely. Figure 2 also  shows that auditors for 11 CFO Act agencies had reported the lack of  accurate and timely recording of financial information as a problem in  fiscal year 2007. Accurate and timely recording of financial information is  essential for effective financial management. Furthermore, the majority of  participants at a recent Comptroller General\u2019s forum on improving  financial management systems agreed that financial management systems  are not able to provide, or provide little, information that is reliable,  useful, and timely to assist management in their day-to-day decision  making, which is the ultimate goal of FFMIA.", "Participants at the forum also discussed current financial management  initiatives and the strategies for transformation of federal financial  management. To reduce the cost and improve the outcome of federal  financial management systems implementations, OMB continues to move  forward on a key initiative\u2014the financial management line of business  (line of business), by leveraging common standards and shared solutions.  OMB anticipates that the line of business initiative will help achieve the  goals of improving the cost, quality, and performance of financial  management operations. OMB and the Financial Systems Integration  Office have demonstrated continued progress toward implementation of  the line of business initiative by issuing a common governmentwide  accounting classification structure, financial services assessment guide,  and exposure drafts of certain standard business processes. However, as  we previously recommended, OMB needs to continue defining standard  business processes. A critical factor for success will be ensuring that  agencies cannot continue developing and implementing their own  stovepiped systems. Failure to do so may require additional work, increase  costs to adopt these standard business processes, and further delay the  transformation of federal financial management systems.", "In a January 2008 memo, OMB recognized the risks associated with  nonstandardized processes and updated its guidance on the line of  business. Current plans are for the Financial Systems Integration Office to  continue developing business standards and incorporate them into  software requirements and permit agencies and shared service providers  to utilize only the certified products as configured. Along with these  changes, continued high-priority and sustained top-level commitment by  OMB and leaders throughout the federal government will be necessary to  fully and effectively achieve the common goals of the line of business and  FFMIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nation\u2019s Long- Term Fiscal Challenge", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenge is a matter of utmost concern. The  federal government faces large and growing structural deficits due  primarily to rising health care costs and known demographic trends. There  is a need to engage in a fundamental review of what the federal  government does, how it does it, and how it is financed. Understanding  and addressing the federal government\u2019s financial condition and the  nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenge are critical to maintain fiscal flexibility  so that policymakers can respond to current and emerging social,  economic, and security challenges.", "While some progress has been made in recent years in addressing the  federal government\u2019s short-term fiscal condition, the nation has not made  progress on its long-term fiscal challenge. However, even this short-term  deficit is understated: It masks the fact that the federal government has  been using the Social Security surplus to offset spending in the rest of  government for many years. If the Social Security surplus is excluded, the  on-budget deficit in fiscal year 2007 was more than double the size of the  unified deficit. For example, Treasury reported a unified deficit of $163  billion and an on-budget deficit of $344 billion in fiscal year 2007.", "While the federal government\u2019s unified budget deficit has declined in  recent years, its liabilities, contingencies and commitments, and social  insurance responsibilities have increased. As of September 30, 2007, the  U.S. government reported in the 2007 Financial Report that it owed (i.e.,  liabilities) more than it owned (i.e., assets) by more than $9 trillion.  Further, the Statement of Social Insurance in the Financial Report  disclosed $41 trillion in social insurance responsibilities, including  Medicare and Social Security, up more than $2 trillion from September 30,  2006.", "Information included in the Financial Report, such as the Statement of  Social Insurance along with long-term fiscal simulations and fiscal  sustainability reporting can help increase understanding of the federal  government\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook. Over the next few decades, the  nation\u2019s fiscal challenge will be shaped largely by rising health care costs  and known demographic trends. As the baby boom generation retires,  federal spending on retirement and health care programs\u2014Social Security  and Medicare, and Medicaid\u2014will grow dramatically.", "The future costs of Social Security and Medicare commitments are  reported in the Statement of Social Insurance in the Financial Report. We  were able to render an unqualified opinion on the 2007 Statement of Social  Insurance\u2014a significant accomplishment for the federal government. The  statement displays the present value of projected revenues and  expenditures for scheduled benefits of social insurance programs. For  Social Security and Medicare alone, projected expenditures for scheduled  benefits exceed earmarked revenues (i.e., dedicated payroll taxes and  premiums) by approximately $41 trillion over the next 75 years in present  value terms. Stated differently, one would need approximately $41 trillion  invested today to deliver on the currently promised benefits not covered  by earmarked revenues for the next 75 years.", "Table 1 shows a simplified version of the Statement of Social Insurance by  its primary components.", "Although these social insurance commitments dominate the long-term  outlook, they are not the only federal programs or activities that bind the  future. GAO developed the concept of \u201cfiscal exposures\u201d to provide a  framework for considering the wide range of responsibilities, programs,  and activities that may explicitly or implicitly expose the federal  government to future spending. In addition to the social insurance  commitments, the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposures include about $11  trillion in liabilities reported on the Balance Sheet, $1 trillion of other  commitments and contingencies, as well as other potential exposures that  cannot be quantified. So beyond dealing with Medicare and Social  Security, policymakers need to look at other policies that limit the federal  government\u2019s flexibility\u2014not necessarily to eliminate all of them but to at  least be aware of them and make a conscious decision to reform them in a  manner that will be responsible, equitable, and sustainable.", "Long-term fiscal simulations of future revenues and costs for all federal  programs offer a comprehensive assessment of the federal government\u2019s  long-term fiscal outlook. Since 1992, GAO has published long-term fiscal  simulations of what might happen to federal deficits and debt levels under  varying policy assumptions. GAO\u2019s simulations\u2014which are neither  forecasts nor predictions\u2014continue to show ever-increasing long-term  deficits resulting in a federal debt level that ultimately spirals out of  control. The timing of deficits and the resulting debt buildup varies  depending on the assumptions used. For example, figure 3 shows GAO\u2019s  simulation of the deficit path based on recent trends and policy  preferences. In this simulation, we start with the Congressional Budget  Office\u2019s (CBO) baseline and then assume that (1) all expiring tax  provisions are extended through 2018\u2014and then revenues are brought to  their historical level as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) plus  expected revenue from deferred taxes\u2014(2) discretionary spending grows  with the economy, and (3) no structural changes are made to Social  Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.", "Over the long term, the nation\u2019s fiscal challenge stems primarily from  rising health care costs and, to a lesser extent, the aging of the population.  Absent significant changes on the spending or revenue sides of the budget  or both, these long-term deficits will encumber a growing share of federal  resources and test the capacity of current and future generations to afford  both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s commitments.", "Figure 4 looks behind the deficit path to the composition of federal  spending. It shows that the estimated growth in the major entitlement  programs leads to an unsustainable fiscal future. In this figure, the  category \u201call other spending\u201d includes much of what many think of as  \u201cgovernment\u201d\u2014discretionary spending on such activities as national  defense, homeland security, veterans health benefits, national parks,  highways and mass transit, and foreign aid, plus mandatory spending on  the smaller entitlement programs such as Supplemental Security Income,  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and farm price supports. The  growth in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on debt held  by the public dwarfs the growth in all other types of spending. A  government that in one generation does nothing more than pay interest on  its debt and mail checks to retirees and some of their health providers is  unacceptable.", "The federal government\u2019s increased spending and rising deficits will drive  a rising debt burden. At the end of fiscal year 2007, debt held by the public  exceeded $5 trillion. Figure 5 shows that this growth in the federal  government\u2019s debt cannot continue unabated without causing serious  harm to the economy.  In the last 200 years, only during and after World  War II has debt held by the public exceeded 50 percent of GDP.", "But this is only part of the story. The federal government for years has  been borrowing the surpluses in the Social Security trust funds and other  similar funds and using them to finance federal government costs. When  such borrowings occur, Treasury issues federal securities to these  government funds that are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.  government. Although borrowing by one part of the federal government  from another may not have the same economic and financial implications  as borrowing from the public, it represents a claim on future resources  and hence a burden on future taxpayers and the future economy. If federal  securities held by those funds are included, the federal government\u2019s total  debt is much higher\u2014about $9 trillion as of the end of fiscal year 2007.", "As shown in figure 6, total federal debt increased over each of the last four  fiscal years.", "On September 29, 2007, the statutory debt limit had to be raised for the  third time in 4 years in order to avoid being breached; between the end of  fiscal year 2003 and the end of fiscal year 2007, the debt limit had to be  increased by about one-third. It is anticipated that actions will need to be  taken in fiscal year 2009 to avoid breaching the current statutory debt limit  of $9,815 billion.", "A quantitative measure of the long-term fiscal challenge measure is called  \u201cthe fiscal gap.\u201d The fiscal gap is the amount of spending reduction or tax  increases that would be needed today to keep debt as a share of GDP at or  below today\u2019s ratio. The fiscal gap is an estimate of the action needed to  achieve fiscal balance over a certain time period such as 75 years. Another  way to say this is that the fiscal gap is the amount of change needed to  prevent the kind of debt explosion implicit in figure 5. The fiscal gap can  be expressed as a share of the economy or in present value dollars.", "Under GAO\u2019s alternative simulation, closing the fiscal gap would require  spending cuts or tax increases equal to 6.7 percent of the entire economy  over the next 75 years, or about $54 trillion in present value terms. To put  this in perspective, closing the gap would require an increase in today\u2019s  federal tax revenues of about 36 percent or an equivalent reduction in  today\u2019s federal program spending (i.e., in all spending except for interest  on the debt held by the public, which cannot be directly controlled) to be  maintained over the entire period.", "Policymakers could phase in the policy changes so that the tax increases  or spending cuts would grow over time and allow people to adjust. The  size of these annual tax increases and spending cuts would be more than  five times the fiscal year 2007 deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP. Delaying  action would make future adjustments even larger. Under our alternative  simulation, waiting even 10 years would require a revenue increase of  about 45 percent or noninterest spending cuts of about 40 percent. This  gap is too large for the federal government to grow its way out of the  problem. To be sure, additional economic growth would certainly help the  federal government\u2019s financial condition and ability to address this fiscal  gap, but it will not eliminate the need for action.", "Understanding and addressing the federal government\u2019s financial  condition and the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenge are critical to the  nation\u2019s future. As we reported in December 2007, several countries have  begun preparing fiscal sustainability reports to help assess the  implications of their public pension and health care programs and other  challenges in the context of overall sustainability of government finances.  European Union members also annually report on longer-term fiscal  sustainability. The goal of these reports is to increase public awareness  and understanding of the long-term fiscal outlook in light of escalating  health care cost growth and population aging, to stimulate public and  policy debates, and to help policymakers make more informed decisions.  These countries used a variety of measures, including projections of future  revenue and spending and summary measures of fiscal imbalance and  fiscal gaps, to assess fiscal sustainability. Last year, we recommended that  the United States should prepare and publish a long-range fiscal  sustainability report. I am pleased to note that the Federal Accounting  Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) will soon issue a draft of a proposed  standard on fiscal sustainability reporting.", "Here in the first half of 2008, the long-term fiscal challenge is not in the  distant future. In fact, the oldest members of the baby boom generation  are now eligible for Social Security retirement benefits and will be eligible  for Medicare benefits in less than 3 years.

Earlier this year, Moody\u2019s  Investors Service issued its annual report on the United States. In that  report, it noted that absent Medicare and Social Security reforms, the long- term fiscal health of the United States and the federal government\u2019s  current Aaa sovereign credit rating were at risk. Likewise, Standard and  Poor\u2019s noted in a recent report that Medicare and Social Security reform is  necessary to prevent a much worse long-term fiscal deterioration. These  comments serve to note the significant longer-term interest rate risk that  the federal government faces absent meaningful action to address these  long-range challenges. Higher longer-term interest costs would only serve  to complicate the nation\u2019s fiscal, economic, and other challenges in future  years.", "At some point, action will need to be taken to change the nation\u2019s fiscal  course.

Conversely, the longer that action to deal with the nation\u2019s long- term fiscal outlook is delayed, the greater the risk that the eventual  changes will be disruptive and destabilizing and future generations will  have to bear a greater burden of the cost.

GAO  has reported information security as a high-risk area across government  since February 1997. During fiscal year 2007, federal agencies did not  consistently implement effective controls to prevent, limit, or detect  unauthorized access to computing resources. Specifically, agencies did not  always (1) identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access;  (2) enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure that authorized access  was necessary and appropriate; (3) apply encryption to protect sensitive  data on networks and portable devices; (4) log, audit, and monitor  security-relevant events; and (5) restrict physical access to information  assets. In addition, agencies did not consistently configure network  devices and services to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system  integrity, such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely  manner; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so  that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction;  and maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information  systems. Such information security control weaknesses unnecessarily  increase the risk that the reliability and availability of data that are  recorded in or transmitted by federal financial management systems could  be compromised. A primary reason for these weaknesses is that federal  agencies have not yet fully institutionalized comprehensive security  management programs, which are critical to identifying information  security control weaknesses, resolving information security problems, and  managing information security risks on an ongoing basis. The  administration has taken important actions to improve information  security, such as issuing extensive guidance on information security and  requiring agencies to perform specific actions to protect certain personally  identifiable information. However, until agencies effectively and fully  implement agencywide information security programs, federal data and  systems, including financial information, will remain at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Collection Activities", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2007, material internal control weaknesses and systems  deficiencies continued to affect the federal government\u2019s ability to  effectively manage its tax collection activities, an issue that has been  reported in our financial statement audit reports for the past 10 years. Due  to errors and delays in recording taxpayer information, payments, and  other activities, taxpayers were not always credited for payments made on  their taxes owed, which could result in undue taxpayer burden. In  addition, the federal government did not always follow up on potential  unreported or underreported taxes and did not always pursue collection  efforts against taxpayers owing taxes to the federal government.  Moreover, the federal government did not have cost benefit information,  related cost-based performance measures, or a systematic process for  ensuring it is using its resources to maximize its ability to collect what is  owed and minimize the disbursements of improper tax refunds. As a  result, the federal government is vulnerable to loss of tax revenue and  exposed to potentially billions of dollars in losses due to inappropriate  refund disbursements."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
