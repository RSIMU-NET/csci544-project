However, fiscal realities raise questions about the efficiency of multiple housing programs and activities across federal agencies with similar goals, products, and sometimes parallel delivery systems. This report assesses the (1) extent to which there is overlap or fragmentation in selected housing programs, (2) federal collaborative efforts, and (3) implications of consolidating selected housing programs.", "For this report, GAO updated and expanded prior work and collected and analyzed new data, focusing on the largest programs in terms of funding. In addition to addressing these objectives, GAO developed a catalog of federal programs and activities that support rental housing and homeownership and identified what is known about the purpose, cost, eligibility, and populations served.

For instance, RHS, FHA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) all guarantee mortgage loans for homeowners. According to fiscal year 2009 data (the most recent available), FHA served a larger number of households than RHS in all areas, including a larger number of low- and moderate-income households in rural areas. Although selected HUD, USDA, and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) multifamily programs had overlapping purposes, the products, areas served, and delivery methods differed. For example, HUD, RHS, and Treasury provide financing for development and rehabilitation of multifamily housing for low- and moderate-income households, but RHS-financed properties were more concentrated in rural areas and HUD\u0092s and Treasury\u0092s tax credit properties were more concentrated in urban and suburban areas.", "Opportunities exist to increase collaboration among the agencies and potentially realize efficiencies. In February 2011, the Administration announced a task force to evaluate the potential for coordinating or consolidating homeownership loan programs at HUD, USDA, and VA. But the task force\u0092s efforts have not yet incorporated key collaborative practices GAO identified. Practices such as identifying goals and resources and defining strategies and outcomes will be important as the task force moves forward. HUD, USDA, and Treasury also have been working to consolidate and align requirements in rental housing programs through the Rental Policy Working Group. Although its efforts have been consistent with many key collaborative practices, the group has not taken full advantage of opportunities to reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through the agencies\u0092 annual and strategic plans, or expanded its guiding principles to evaluate areas requiring statutory action to generate savings and efficiencies. Also, in 2005 and in 2011, GAO recommended coordinating reviews of tax expenditures and related spending programs. Such reviews could help reduce overlap and inconsistencies and direct scarce resources to the most effective or efficient methods to deliver federal support.", "Consolidating programs carries certain implications for users, existing programs, personnel, portfolios, and associated information systems. Nevertheless, GAO suggested in 2000 that Congress consider requiring USDA and HUD to examine the benefits and costs of merging programs serving similar markets and providing similar products. Since then, certain aspects of the RHS and FHA homeownership programs have shown evidence of growing similarity, such as RHS\u0092 shift toward loan guarantees. However, the current statutory framework imposes additional challenges on the agencies\u0092 ability to further consolidate similar programs. Thus, any evaluations of which programs, products, systems, and processes to retain, revise, consolidate, or eliminate would involve complex analyses, trade-offs, and difficult policy decisions. The task force offers opportunities for these agencies to identify potential areas for consolidation or greater coordination and which actions would require statutory change."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To enhance evaluation of coordination or consolidation of single-family programs, HUD, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), USDA, and VA should adopt a more rigorous approach for their task force that incorporates collaborative practices.

As part of these collaborative efforts, these agencies also should identify specific programs for consolidation, including those requiring statutory changes. HUD, USDA, and VA generally agreed with the recommendations; however, HUD and OMB stated that actions should wait until after the housing markets stabilize.

However, the largest current activity (in terms of  forgone revenue) associated with homeownership\u2014the mortgage interest  deduction\u2014was introduced in 1913, when the federal income tax was  enacted. Further assistance was created in the 1930s, when most rural  residents worked on farms and rural areas generally were poorer than  urban areas. Accordingly, Congress authorized separate housing  assistance for rural areas and made USDA responsible for administering  it. Specifically, in 1937 the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act authorized  USDA to provide long-term, low-interest loans to farm tenants and  sharecroppers so that they could purchase and repair farms, including  homes on farms. The Housing Act of 1949 authorized new rural lending  programs through USDA and made farm owners eligible for assistance  for dwellings and other farm buildings if the farm was located on land  capable of producing at least $400 worth of agricultural commodities  annually. Amendments added in 1961 made nonfarm properties eligible  for single-family loans and created the farm labor housing program. A  1962 amendment created the rural rental housing program.Housing Administration (FHA) began providing mortgage insurance in  1934, and the first public housing program was authorized in 1937.

As we have noted, the mortgage interest  deduction represented the single largest activity\u2014in terms of annual  forgone revenue\u2014associated with homeownership. In fiscal year 2010,  the estimated revenue loss for the mortgage interest deduction was  almost $80 billion.

Most of the activities we identified as  emergency assistance were intended to support homeownership. For  example, Treasury and the Federal Reserve System purchased  mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to  help support the availability of mortgage credit for prospective  homebuyers or homeowners wishing to refinance. And, HUD and  Treasury administer programs that provide financing assistance to  struggling homeowners\u2014such as the Making Home Affordable program,  which reduces borrowers\u2019 monthly mortgage payments.", "Regulatory requirements also support homeownership by establishing  standards for residential mortgage lending, among other things.

In addition, in  the fiscal year 2013 President\u2019s Budget, agencies identified a limited  number of 2-year agency priority goals that align with the long-term goals  and objectives in their strategic plans. Agency priority goals target areas  in which agencies want to achieve near-term performance through  focused attention of senior leadership. HUD included the prevention of  foreclosures as a priority goal. As of April 2012, USDA, VA, and Treasury  had not highlighted homeownership among their agency priority goals.  Under its strategic goal to strengthen the nation\u2019s housing market, HUD  uses its single-family guaranteed loan program to meet its subgoal of  creating financially sustainable homeownership opportunities. Under its  broad strategic goal of assisting rural communities, USDA uses its single- family loan and grant programs to increase the number of  homeownership opportunities available in rural areas. VA\u2019s guarantee for  home mortgages is one among many entitlements that veterans earn.  The program falls under VA\u2019s broad strategic goal of improving the quality  and accessibility of health care, benefits, and memorial services while  optimizing value.

FHA provides 100-percent coverage of eligible losses when borrowers  default. This guarantee covers the unpaid principal balance, interest  costs, and certain costs of foreclosure and conveyance. USDA\u2019s  guarantee provides coverage for eligible losses of up to 90 percent of the  original principal, including unpaid principal and interest; principal and  interest on USDA-approved advances for protection and preservation of  the property; and the costs associated with selling the foreclosed  property. One of the most significant differences among these products is  the loss coverage offered by VA, which covers from 25 to 50 percent of  the original principal.", "Of the agencies, only USDA (RHS) offers single-family housing programs  specifically for low- and very low-income families. RHS offers two unique  products: a subsidized direct loan for the purchase of single-family  housing, with interest rates as low as 1 percent, to low-income borrowers  unable to qualify for credit elsewhere, and a home repair program that  offers grants or loans (with interest rates of 1 percent) to very low-income  rural residents. RHS may subsidize the interest on single-family direct  loans, depending on the borrower\u2019s income.", "As shown in table 1, two of the largest tax expenditures that provide  assistance to homeowners are the mortgage interest and property tax  deductions, with about half of all homeowners receiving housing  assistance through them. Taxpayers who itemize their deductions may  deduct mortgage interest and property taxes on their principal residence  and a second residence. Deductions are adjustments from adjusted gross  income (AGI). Whether or not a taxpayer itemizes deductions depends  on whether the sum of these deductions plus any other itemized  deductions exceeds the limits on the standard deduction. Taxpayers are  subject to certain limits on the total amount of mortgage interest that can  be claimed. The total amount of mortgage debt for which interest may be  claimed cannot exceed $1 million. In addition, taxpayers may deduct  interest payments on up to $100,000 of home equity debt. There are no  dollar limits on the amounts of property taxes that can be deducted.  Taxpayers with higher incomes are subject to additional limitations on use  of these two deductions.", "Data from selected single-family programs show some overlap in the  income and location of households served. Among the single-family loan  guarantee programs, all served moderate- and low-income populations,  although only USDA\u2019s program restricts eligibility on the basis of income.  USDA limits borrower income to 115 percent of AMI. Although FHA and  VA do not have this restriction, 1,291,000 or 74 percent of FHA borrowers  and at least 130,000 VA borrowers also fell into this income category in  fiscal year 2009 (see fig. 2). In part because of the number of borrowers it serves, FHA guaranteed more loans to borrowers with incomes at or  below 115 percent of AMI than RHS and VA combined.", "Further, although RHS may serve only borrowers with incomes at or  below 80 percent of AMI in its direct single-family loan program, FHA also  serves this group of borrowers. Specifically, 50 percent of FHA borrowers  in fiscal year 2009 had incomes at or below 80 percent of AMI.  However, RHS single-family direct loans may be combined with other  resources to help reach very low-income families that may not have the  income or down payment often needed to qualify for other financing. For  example, these loans may be used in self-help housing projects in which  future owners help build their own houses. The \u201csweat equity\u201d reduces  the cost of construction and the overall loan amount.", "The loan guarantee programs overlapped in rural areas. USDA  characterizes locations as rural or urban using different measures. Our  analysis showed overlap in areas served using three different USDA  characterizations for geographic areas.

The definition is largely  based on population, but also considers other factors, such as proximity  to metropolitan areas and access to mortgage credit. As of 2011, 97  percent of the land area of the United States and 37 percent of the  population were eligible for rural housing programs (see fig. 3). Eligible  areas will be adjusted based on the results of the 2010 Census.

While a larger percentage of RHS borrowers with  guaranteed loans were located in more remote rural areas compared with  FHA and VA borrowers, FHA served a larger number of borrowers in  these areas. Table 3 characterizes the location of single-family  guaranteed loans relative to their distance from the boundaries separating  RHS-eligible and -ineligible areas. For example, 50 percent of the RHS  single-family guaranteed loans were located inside or within 10 miles of  ineligible areas and 23 percent were located more than 25 miles from  ineligible areas. FHA and VA loans were concentrated in or close to RHS- ineligible areas; 89 percent of both FHA and VA loans were for properties  inside or within 10 miles of RHS-ineligible areas, and 4 percent were for  properties located more than 25 miles from RHS-ineligible areas.

In an October 2005 report, we  identified eight key practices that can help enhance and sustain  collaboration among federal agencies. The key practices are (1) define  and articulate a common outcome; (2) establish mutually reinforcing or  joint strategies; (3) identify and address needs by leveraging resources;  (4) agree on agency roles and responsibilities; (5) establish compatible  policies; (6) develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on  results; (7) reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts  through agency plans and reports; and (8) reinforce individual  accountability for collaborative efforts through performance management  systems. While these practices can facilitate greater collaboration, we  recognize that other practices also may do so. Furthermore, the specific  ways in which agencies implement these practices may differ in the  context of the specific collaboration challenges agencies face. For  example, joint activities can range from occasional meetings between  employees in which the roles and responsibilities of the respective  agencies are reaffirmed, to more structured task teams operating over a  period of time. But absent effective collaboration, routine interagency  meetings could result in limited information being communicated and few  joint agreements reached or implemented.", "In comparing the single-family task force\u2019s efforts with key collaboration  practices, we found that the agencies have not taken steps that are  consistent with the practices. For example, other than the announcement  of the task force, member agencies said that they had yet to identify goals  or expected outcomes, and could not provide strategies each agency  might utilize. The task force can benefit from identifying and agreeing on  goals, and evaluating the goals against realistic expectations of how to  achieve them. The task force also has not yet identified resources needed  to accomplish its goals; agreed on roles or responsibilities; taken steps to  establish compatible policies, procedures or other means to operate; or  made clear how they would be made accountable for collaborative efforts  and report on results. In addition to our key practices, the Government  Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA),  establishes a new framework for agencies to improve government  performance by taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to  key issues. GPRAMA requirements could lead to improved coordination  and collaboration among agencies. For instance, GPRAMA requires each  agency to identify the organizations and program activities\u2014both internal  and external to the agency\u2014that contribute to each agency\u2019s goals.  However, according to HUD and USDA officials, much of the single-family  task force\u2019s efforts to date have been informal. For instance, the officials  noted that senior agency officials met biweekly in teleconferences to  share information and best practices on housing policy and programs and  discussed current economic issues affecting the housing market and  ways to streamline the housing programs in a coordinated manner.", "According to HUD and OMB officials, aside from the biweekly meetings, a  benchmarking effort associated with the single-family task force recently  was established. Specifically, OMB will collect and analyze data on direct  and guaranteed housing loan programs as a way to develop greater  insight into best practices, potential overlap, and synergies among the  housing programs. According to HUD, as of April 2012, no milestones or  resource estimates were available for the task force and no results were  expected until a more formal approach for the task force was established.  Additionally, agency officials stated that no further collaborative efforts  among single-family housing programs were planned. OMB and HUD  officials stated that over the past few years, agency attention has been  focused on trying to improve the overall condition of the housing market,  making it difficult to turn attention to interagency efforts for program  coordination or consolidation. HUD officials also noted that the ongoing  housing crisis has been a complicating factor in addressing the broader  issue of housing finance reform, and mostly has overshadowed the issue.", "Nonetheless, in addition to focusing on the ongoing housing crisis and the  level of government support for the housing market, it is also important to  focus some attention on the way that government support for housing is  delivered and strike the appropriate balance between these issues. The  task force was established to explore ways in which programs can be  better coordinated or consolidated to serve homeowners more effectively.  Part of that analysis is the assessment of coordination and consolidation  of HUD, USDA, and VA programs. By incorporating key practices on  collaboration and developing a more formal approach for the single-family  task force, HUD, USDA, VA, and OMB can evaluate the potential for  coordinating or consolidating single-family loan programs, and possibly  generate savings and efficiencies while better serving homeowners. They  also may be able to help drive further collaboration, establish  complementary goals and strategies for achieving results, and increase  transparency (by reporting on their collaborative efforts).

The working group consists of  the White House Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council,  OMB, HUD, USDA, and Treasury. The purpose of the working group is to  better align rental requirements across programs, and thereby increase  the effectiveness of federal rental policy and improve participant  outcomes. According to working group documents, the group established  guiding principles, which centered on administrative changes that could  help respond to the concerns of external stakeholders (rental housing  owners, developers, and managers, and state and local housing agency  officials); required minimal statutory action; were realizable at little or no  cost or through education, outreach, or the issuance of new guidance or  rules; and helped create cost and time savings for all parties.", "The working group solicited recommendations for improved rental policy  coordination from external stakeholders. Within the working group,  interagency teams considered the recommendations, reviewed current  policies, and identified opportunities for greater federal alignment,  increased overall programmatic efficiency, and reduced costs and  regulatory burdens. Stakeholders have noted that inefficiencies can arise  when a multifamily housing project has multiple layers of assistance (such  as subsidies, tax expenditures, or mortgage insurance) from one or more  federal agencies. To help address those inefficiencies, the working group  identified 10 key areas or initiatives for alignment and further study, based  on recommendations from rental housing owners, developers, and  managers, and state and local officials (see table 9). Overall, the  initiatives are aimed at reducing unnecessary program regulations,  lessening administrative barriers so that developers and property owners  more easily can participate in programs, reducing duplicative  administrative actions to reduce costs for agencies and program  participants, and increasing coordination to allow better targeting of  agency resources.", "For two initiatives, HUD, USDA, and other federal and state housing  agencies have pilot programs under way in several states to test the  alignment activities before national implementation. Specifically, two  pilots will assess the feasibility of the proposed changes to physical  inspections and subsidy layering reviews and identify steps for better  coordination and information-sharing for potential replication on a national  scale.

To achieve more  immediate results, the Working Group started with those actions that  required no statutory action. However, the working group\u2019s long-term  collaborative efforts could be enhanced if it were to include areas beyond  administrative changes.

For example, one multifamily developer told us that it typically took  from 3 to 4 years to begin construction and leveraging the various funding  sources typically added 5-10 percent to project costs. He stressed that  the biggest factor in extending project lengths was the time needed to  secure multiple funding sources, navigate and comply with multiple  requirements, and align funding cycles. He added that obtaining LIHTCs  also can slow the process because a project might not receive credits one  year or might require more than one year\u2019s worth of credit allocations  from the state before it was feasible.", "The 2007 report also concluded that better information about combining  multiple federal sources and amounts\u2014from both tax and spending  programs\u2014for rental housing projects could be useful in identifying areas  for agencies to coordinate program measurement. Although Treasury  tracks taxpayer compliance with LIHTC program rules and HUD collects  some information on a few other types of federal subsidy an LIHTC  project might receive, neither agency collects leveraging data nor reports  a leverage measure for the program. Basic financial information about the  multiple sources and amounts\u2014from tax and spending programs\u2014a  housing project received could be useful in identifying areas for agencies  to coordinate in measuring performance for programs that have  overlapping purposes.

At  the time, there was no agency-specific or government-wide guidance on  what agencies should disclose about the leverage measures they  reported or how to calculate them for specific programs. Although OMB  has used leveraging as a program output measure in the past, as of April  2012, OMB had not taken action to issue guidance for agencies  calculating leverage measures.

For example, program  consolidation could improve service delivery, especially when programs  with similar objectives and markets are brought together and conflicting  requirements and overlap reduced. Consolidation could achieve savings  to the extent that agency overhead and, potentially, staffing were  reduced. Further, consideration of program consolidation could create  opportunities to reassess the various RHS and HUD single-family  programs or activities and eliminate programs that are overlapping, or  outdated, or whose costs no longer justify federal spending. However,  consolidation also presents a number of challenges that we discuss later  in the report. We first reported in 2000 that overlap exists among products  offered and markets served by FHA, RHS, and others and questioned the  need for maintaining separate programs for rural areas. Additionally, we  noted the potential for administrative savings by consolidating programs  that provided similar products and served similar markets. For instance,  FHA and RHS offer similar guaranteed single-family products and operate  in the same areas. With VA, which offers a guaranteed loan program,  FHA and RHS encourage lenders to make loans by guaranteeing them  against losses they might incur if borrowers defaulted on their mortgages.  As discussed earlier, lenders in FHA and RHS programs use FHA\u2019s  mortgage scorecard in evaluating borrowers for mortgages. However,  RHS\u2019s program offers more generous terms than FHA\u2019s program (such as  no down payment and lower overall mortgage insurance premiums). And  RHS\u2019s single-family direct loans have no counterparts in FHA or VA. Also,  VA loan guarantees are an entitlement only available to veterans, certain  members of the Reserves and National Guard, and spouses of certain  veterans. RHS guaranteed loans are limited by borrower income and  location. Despite the differences, we noted that FHA, RHS, and VA all  serve a significant share of low- to moderate-income households.", "We suggested in September 2000 that Congress consider requiring HUD  and USDA to examine the benefits and costs of merging those programs  that serve similar markets and provide similar products. Recognizing the  statutory restrictions that exist on both agencies\u2019 programs, as a first step  we suggested that Congress consider requiring HUD and USDA to  explore merging their single-family guaranteed lending programs and  multifamily portfolio management programs, taking advantage of the best  practices of each and ensuring that targeted populations were not  adversely affected. Congress held hearings on the report in 2003 but no  further actions have been taken.", "Our analyses have shown evidence of overlap in certain aspects of the  FHA and RHS single-family programs. First, RHS increasingly has moved  from direct to guaranteed loans. The number of guaranteed single-family  loans first exceeded the number of direct single-family loans in 1995, and  the trend has intensified since 2008. In fiscal year 2010, RHS made more  than 28,100 single-family direct loans and grants and guaranteed more  than 130,000 single-family loans. Since 2011, the Administration has  requested large cuts in RHS direct loan programs. For example, the 2012  President\u2019s Budget did not request any funding for Section 504 direct  repair loans and requested a 67 percent reduction for Section 502 direct  loans. The budget request stated that the shift in direction acknowledges  that the single-family direct loan program has struggled to make a  measurable impact due to flat funding levels and a labor-intensive review  process. According to RHS officials, after the implementation of early-out  and buy-out authority at the beginning of fiscal year 2012, RHS had about  900 full-time equivalent staff managing its direct loan program, and about  400 staff managing its larger guaranteed loan program.", "Second, the Administration has proposed that RHS use direct  endorsement lenders to approve guaranteed loans. Specifically, the 2011  and 2012 President\u2019s Budgets proposed that RHS use direct  endorsement lenders in its guaranteed loan program to make RHS more  efficient and allow time to transition the staff managing guaranteed loans  to other priorities. endorsement lenders to approve mortgage applications without first  submitting paperwork to HUD.

Properties assisted by both agencies are  aging and need new investments for capital improvements. Also, some  property owners may decide to leave the programs and convert their  properties to market rate and no longer be subject to rent and tenant  income requirements. In response to these challenges, RHS offers  incentives that provide equity investments and favorable loan financing to  property owners seeking to recapitalize their properties or at risk of exiting  the program. Similarly, HUD has various financing tools that offer  incentives to property owners to remain in the program. When property  owners do exit the program, HUD and RHS offer special rental assistance  to households to help ensure that their rents remain affordable.", "Further, similarities in guaranteed multifamily loans indicate the need for  greater coordination. For instance, among multifamily loan programs,  RHS programs (whether direct or guaranteed) are more prevalent in rural  areas than the much larger FHA multifamily guaranteed loan program.  However, RHS has been moving toward guaranteed multifamily loans,  primarily as a leveraged source of funds when preserving its direct loan  properties. Moreover, the 2013 President\u2019s budget proposes funding for  Section 538 guaranteed loans but not for Section 515 direct loans.  According to RHS officials, the only new Section 515 direct loans being  made are for preserving existing properties. As discussed earlier,  properties with RHS loans also tended to be much smaller than properties  with FHA loans, suggesting that RHS and its products have served a  unique market segment and that RHS may have a product model that  could be useful for FHA. Over the years, HUD has proposed variations of  guaranteed loans for small properties, such as in more rural areas where  HUD properties are smaller and more comparable in size to RHS  properties. For example, HUD announced demonstration programs in  1997 and 2006 for variations of small project guaranteed loans.", "More recently, the Rental Policy Working Group discussed existing  programs that HUD might use for smaller properties, including RHS\u2019  Section 538 guarantee program. The discussions resulted in the Rental  Policy Working Group developing a proposal for the 2013 budget that  would allow HUD to implement flexibilities with its Section 542(b) risk- share program to make risk-share loans to refinance, rehabilitate, and  recapitalize small properties. The proposal would allow HUD to use this  existing program to expand availability of capital to small properties. If  successful, this program could be used in urban and rural areas, as HUD  has no geographic restrictions. While statutory action would be needed  for HUD to implement the changes to its Section 542(b) risk-share  program, the working group focused on this effort because it required only  minor statutory changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation or Increased Coordination Presents Immediate Challenges and Has Longer-Term Implications", "paragraphs": ["Consolidation presents a number of challenges in the short and long  term.

And HUD operates the Good Neighbor  Next Door program, which restricts eligibility by profession (for example,  to teachers and law enforcement officers).", "But the fact that programs serve different targeted  Several of the immediate challenges that would stem from any  consolidation efforts have long been a concern for the agencies. In 2000,  when we first recommended that Congress consider requiring USDA and  HUD to examine the benefits and costs of merging programs such as  their single-family guaranteed programs, USDA noted that such a merger  could be detrimental to rural areas, which could lose a federal voice. In  addition, HUD noted that without legislative changes, any efforts to merge  the programs likely would result in a more cumbersome delivery system.  In May 2011 testimony before the House Financial Services  Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity, some  industry experts said a proposed consolidation plan merited further  discussion, but others stated the proposal could negatively affect USDA\u2019s  efforts to deliver its other rural development programs. In September, the  RHS Administrator testified that while RHS and HUD shared an important  commitment to meeting the housing needs of rural America, she opposed  the proposed consolidation plan. She said that RHS housing services  uniquely served rural communities by working in \u201csynergy\u201d with other rural  development programs.", "Since then, RHS officials and several housing industry officials with whom  we spoke also have raised concerns about consolidating RHS and HUD  programs. They have argued that rural housing assistance is a part of the  community development package that USDA\u2019s rural development  agencies (RHS, Rural Utilities Service, and Rural Business Cooperative  Service) can offer and that consolidating RHS programs into HUD would  disrupt the interrelationship between the three rural development  agencies in USDA. RHS officials pointed to the human capital challenges  that would arise from any consolidation. For example, they noted that  training would be an issue because product requirements, information  systems, and agency processes and procedures differ between HUD and  RHS. In addition, they questioned whether any consolidation would help  improve the delivery of service to rural areas. RHS officials and industry  officials expressed concern that rural guaranteed single- and multifamily  programs would get \u201clost\u201d in HUD. Some RHS and industry officials also  noted that program consolidation would not address the gap in access to  affordable housing credit for those individuals who could not qualify for  HUD or other conventional single-family loans.", "While training and information systems are important considerations for  any consolidation or increased coordination between the agencies,  consolidation or increased coordination does not necessarily require that  product terms be aligned. FHA already offers multiple products with  different terms and conditions. And although FHA does not have the  extensive delivery structure RHS uses to perform loan origination under  its now diminishing direct loan program, the continuing need for this RHS  product has been questioned by USDA and OMB. Moreover, the more  similar the products become, the stronger the argument for a  consolidated delivery structure. In the long term, this could present an  opportunity for the agencies to take advantage of the best features of  each agency\u2019s structure.", "In relation to concerns about the level of focus on rural housing in HUD,  HUD currently serves a larger number of homeowners in rural areas than  RHS serves, and HUD administration officials told us that they considered  HUD an agency that served housing needs in all communities\u2014urban,  suburban, and rural. Also, while RHS housing programs align with several  of HUD\u2019s priority goals, USDA currently does not have priority goals for  housing, and housing programs have not been a high priority in USDA.  For multifamily housing, we first reported in 2002 that RHS could not  prioritize the long-term rehabilitation needs of the properties in its Section  515 direct loan portfolio. The fiscal year 2013 budget is the first in which  the agency is requesting funding for a permanent (in place of a current  demonstration program) multifamily preservation and revitalization  program for its rural rental housing portfolio. As described earlier, we  reported in 2004 that RHS did not have access to the same wage  matching data as HUD to assure that rental payments under the Section  521 rental assistance program were accurate. USDA proposed legislation  to access Department of Health and Human Services data for wage  matching purposes in the fiscal year 2013 budget. In addition, the  administrative and reporting structure of rural housing programs among  USDA components has varied. As we reported in 2000, the position of  RHS Administrator is at the same organizational level as the State Rural  Development Offices, which can develop their own program delivery  systems. As a result, state offices still report to the Under Secretary for  Rural Development rather than the RHS Administrator on housing issues.  The state offices also have developed various interpretations rather than  uniform standards on issues ranging from rent calculations to loan  prepayment.", "Combining programs would not eliminate the need for managing existing  commitments. Both FHA and RHS have loan guarantees with terms of as  much as 40 years. In the single-family programs, both agencies have  systems in place for monitoring the performance of existing mortgages  and ensuring that loan servicers and contractors carry out functions  related to loss mitigation, foreclosure, and property management, as well  as systems for holding lenders accountable in the loan origination  process. The continuing need for these functions would necessitate  careful planning and alignment to permit consolidation.", "Consolidating or coordinating existing programs and activities also raise  important implications because of costs, and the potential impact on  people and agency mission. When consolidation or increased  coordination results in significant shifts of people, space, technology and  systems, several issues arise. As an example, simply moving staff and  responsibilities could increase costs and not result in any process  improvements. Ensuring long-term benefits from cost savings and  improved operations will require careful consideration of the  responsibilities and staffing resources needed for the combined  operation. For example, if the single-family loan programs of RHS and  HUD were to be consolidated, it would be necessary to specify the impact  on employees, including changes in roles and responsibilities, processes  and procedures, individual accountability, and day-to-day operations.  There also would be transition issues to consider, such as costs of leases  and unoccupied federal property, or moving expenses for employees  transferred to new sites. Consolidation or increased coordination also  may have implications for borrowers, lenders, developers, and other  industry participants. For instance, some borrowers and lenders who may  have worked extensively with particular programs could experience  increased costs in the short term for adapting existing program  administration, personnel, processes, and systems.", "Whether through consolidation or further coordination, RHS, FHA, and VA  have opportunities to assess the potential for learning from the practices  of each other. RHS did this when its guarantee program was created. For  instance, RHS officials told us that they had examined FHA\u2019s system  when they established their guaranteed program and decided it would be  more cost-effective to require lenders to dispose of properties. Thus,  unlike FHA, RHS relies on lenders to take title of foreclosed properties  and manage and market them. But, RHS and FHA have not taken steps  to further explore the relative benefits and costs of each other\u2019s  approaches. This and other areas may represent an opportunity for the  agencies to explore how to take advantage of their respective best  practices, while minimizing the adverse impact on targeted populations.", "Finally, combining management of the portfolio of existing multifamily  projects might require reassessing methods for overseeing and  monitoring these projects. Some noted that in RHS, staff were  responsible for a particular portfolio of multifamily projects and offered a  direct point of communication for these projects. They pointed out that  HUD, which provides funding for far more projects, did not have staff  responsible for individual projects. Also, payment structures for RHS- direct multifamily loans are linked and are offset by RHS rental assistance  payments. Combining RHS and HUD rental assistance programs would  require assessing the implications of aligning payment methods for the  two programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government plays an important role in encouraging  homeownership and ensuring the availability of decent, safe, and  affordable rental housing through a variety of single- and multifamily  programs that provide rental assistance, public housing, and tax  expenditures.

A recently created task force may help evaluate the potential  for coordinating or consolidating the single-family housing loan programs  at HUD, USDA, and VA and the agencies have been working to  consolidate and align certain requirements in multifamily housing  programs through the Rental Policy Working Group. However, the single- family task force has not yet specified its goals or expected outcomes,  roles and responsibilities, resources, or a means of monitoring or  reporting on results and reinforcing agency accountability for collaborative  efforts. Incorporating these key practices for effective collaboration would  help the task force and HUD, USDA, and VA establish the guidance and  direction needed to systematically bring about a productive working  relationship. With a more effective collaborative approach, the agencies  also can generate opportunities to evaluate the potential for improving,  coordinating, or consolidating single-family housing loan programs.  Certain aspects of the single-family programs show great potential for  consolidation\u2014as we have reported, overlap exists in products offered,  service delivery, and geographic areas served. Therefore, the task force  agencies could productively focus on the products offered, delivery  structure, and systems and resources that support the programs as part  of any assessment of coordination and consolidation of the programs. For  instance, agencies could consider whether and how to align product  terms and conditions, and how to optimize service delivery methods. Or,  they could move beyond administrative change, and assess what might  be accomplished in terms of coordination or consolidation through  statutory changes. Such assessments represent valuable first steps and  would serve as resources for the agencies.", "The Rental Policy Working Group, which has followed a majority of our  key collaboration practices, already has taken steps to identify specific  areas in which to align sometimes conflicting and redundant  requirements.

Overlap in multifamily  programs exists in the overall purpose of programs, delivery structures,  and provision of project-based rental assistance. However, any  consolidation of multifamily programs would require statutory changes.  There is more the Rental Policy Working Group can do to build on its  success. For example, it could expand its guiding principles to include  areas in which statutory action across individual agencies and programs  may be needed to help increase overall programmatic efficiency and save  additional taxpayer dollars. It could take additional steps to reinforce  agency accountability for collaborative efforts by documenting  collaborative efforts in its strategic and annual plans. In addition to the  two efforts highlighted above, and as we previously recommended,  coordinated reviews of tax expenditures with related spending programs  could help reduce overlap and inconsistencies and direct scarce  resources to the most effective or least costly methods to deliver federal  support.", "Options to increase collaboration or to effect consolidation in HUD and  USDA\u2019s single- and multifamily loan programs that serve similar markets,  provide similar products, or have similar delivery structures could  enhance the efficiency of and improve the programs overall. But as we  have noted, they are not without a number of human capital, information  technology, and other significant challenges and implications. We first  reported on these options in 2000. The potential exists for greater  collaboration or consolidation, including considering statutory action, if  applicable. Policy makers face difficult decisions on the structure and  funding of housing programs and activities across federal agencies.  Although Congress ultimately would have to decide, agencies could  further this effort by exploring the potential benefits and costs of  consolidating overlapping programs.

However, in  response to the recommendation that HUD and the other agencies  establish a more rigorous approach to collaboration, HUD noted the  importance of assessing the timing of implementing the recommendation  because the relevant agencies have been fully focused on the ongoing  recovery of the housing market. OMB staff expressed a similar concern.  HUD further stated that it will consult with other interested parties to  establish a framework through which to respond to our recommendation  and noted that an approximate time frame might involve waiting until after  February 2014. As we stated in the report, in addition to focusing on the  ongoing housing crisis and government support for the housing market,  focusing on achieving efficiencies and cost savings and the delivery of  government support for housing is important. By incorporating key  practices on collaboration and developing a more formal approach to the  single-family task force, HUD, USDA, VA, and OMB can evaluate the  potential for coordinating or consolidating single-family loan programs,  and possibly generate savings and efficiencies while better serving  homeowners. As we noted in the report, whether through consolidation or  further coordination, RHS, FHA, and VA have opportunities to assess the  potential for learning from the practices of each other.", "VA concurred with the recommendation to enhance the single-family task  force\u2019s efforts. VA said that the agency welcomed opportunities to  coordinate with other agencies and share best practices and looked  forward to refining and improving its own program by applying other  agencies\u2019 best practices. VA concurred in principle with our  recommendation on identifying opportunities to evaluate and report on  opportunities for consolidation as long as the efforts were coordinated  and not unilateral, adding that unilateral actions could waste resources  and have other negative effects. We modified the recommendation to  make it clear that we were referring to efforts through the interagency task  force and working group and not unilateral evaluations. In addition, VA  reiterated its position that while collaborating and coordinating with other  housing programs could be beneficial, combining VA\u2019s unique home loan  guaranty program with other housing programs would go against the  statutory intent that established an earned benefit for veterans.", "USDA generally agreed with our recommendations, stating that  collaborative efforts already under way should reduce duplication of  efforts by stakeholders working with multiple agencies as well as  \u201cbureaucratic red tape, processing times, and ultimately program costs.\u201d  USDA also provided a summary of the agency\u2019s positions on a number of  other issues. First, USDA stated that RHS\u2019s single-family guaranteed loan  program has been performing better than FHA\u2019s loan programs because  RHS controlled risk by tightening underwriting and performing preclosing  reviews. RHS has reported lower delinquency rates than FHA, and  concluded that these differences were due to the tighter controls.  However, RHS\u2019s analysis does not control for other factors that could  explain differences between the agencies\u2019 delinquency and default rates.  Second, RHS suggests that borrowers of its guaranteed loans could not  afford FHA-guaranteed loans, but it has not conducted the analysis  needed to make this judgment. RHS\u2019s lower fees and lack of down  payment could divert prospective borrowers from programs such as  FHA\u2019s, which could offer further evidence of the overlap in federal  mortgage products. Finally, USDA reiterated its position that rural  communities have a unique set of challenges and that rather than  duplicating other federal programs, USDA\u2019s housing programs address  unique needs. However, we found that HUD also serves rural areas  through its single- and multifamily programs. Further, RHS\u2019 greater  reliance on guaranteed single-family lending has lessened the differences  between RHS and FHA single-family loan programs; for example, more  than half of the new RHS-guaranteed single-family loans made in 2009  were in urban or suburban areas.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

As USDA has fewer housing programs, we selected these  first, then selected the active programs at HUD and Treasury with similar  purposes. For example, while HUD administers many programs that  provide loan guarantees for multifamily housing, we selected HUD\u2019s  Section 221(d)(3) and (d)(4) programs because they are most similar to  USDA\u2019s Section 538 loan guarantee and because they had the most loan  activity of HUD\u2019s programs. The other selected HUD, USDA, and  Treasury programs are similar in that they require that the owner keep the  properties available to the eligible populations or keep the rents  affordable or both. Finally, USDA\u2019s Section 521 provides rental  assistance to property owners for units rented to low-income tenants.  Similarly, HUD\u2019s project-based rental assistance provides payments to  property owners for the same purpose; therefore, we decided to select  HUD\u2019s project-based rental assistance (Section 8, Section 202, Section  811, and other rental supplement programs).
