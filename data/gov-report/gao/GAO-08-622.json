Since 2002, the United States relied principally on the Pakistan military to address U.S. national security goals. Of the approximately $5.8 billion the United States provided for efforts in the FATA and border region from 2002 through 2007, about 96 percent reimbursed Pakistan for military operations there. According to the Department of State, Pakistan deployed 120,000 military and paramilitary forces in the FATA and helped kill and capture hundreds of suspected al Qaeda operatives; these efforts cost the lives of approximately 1,400 members of Pakistan's security forces. However, GAO found broad agreement, as documented in the National Intelligence Estimate, State, and embassy documents, as well as Defense officials in Pakistan, that al Qaeda had regenerated its ability to attack the United States and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven in Pakistan's FATA. No comprehensive plan for meeting U.S. national security goals in the FATA has been developed, as stipulated by the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism (2003), called for by an independent commission (2004), and mandated by congressional legislation (2007). Furthermore, Congress created the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) in 2004 specifically to develop comprehensive plans to combat terrorism. However, neither the National Security Council (NSC), NCTC, nor other executive branch departments have developed a comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national power--diplomatic, military, intelligence, development assistance, economic, and law enforcement support--called for by the various national security strategies and Congress. As a result, since 2002, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan has had no Washington-supported, comprehensive plan to combat terrorism and close the terrorist safe haven in the FATA. In 2006, the embassy, in conjunction with Defense, State, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and in cooperation with the government of Pakistan, began an effort to focus more attention on other key elements of national power, such as development assistance and public diplomacy, to address U.S. goals in the FATA. However, this does not yet constitute a comprehensive plan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist attacks of 9/11 were planned from an Afghan safe haven, and  many of the terrorists who attacked the United States used Pakistan as the  main route to travel from Afghanistan to the United States. Since the 9/11  attacks in 2001, the administration and Congress have repeatedly stated  that destroying terrorist threats and closing terrorist safe havens are the  nation\u2019s critical national security goals. As such, the United States has  provided Pakistan, which has become a key U.S. ally in the global war on  terror, with more than $10.5 billion for military, economic, and  development activities in support of these goals. The 9/11 Commission, an  independent, bipartisan commission created by congressional legislation  in late 2002, concluded in 2004 that it is hard to overstate the importance  of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamist terrorism. The commission  found that the country\u2019s vast unpoliced regions have made it attractive to  extremists seeking a safe haven and have reportedly provided a base for  terrorist operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.

We also interviewed Defense officials operating out of  the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) headquarters in Tampa, Florida.  We requested meetings with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the  National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and the National Security  Council (NSC); however, only the CIA agreed to meet with us. To  determine progress in meeting national security objectives, we compared  the national security goals stated in strategic documents with unclassified  assessments conducted by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI),  State, and U.S. officials operating in Pakistan. To determine if  comprehensive plans were developed and contained the elements  recommended by national security documents, legislation, and GAO, we  requested all plans addressing U.S. efforts in the FATA from the CIA,  Defense, NCTC, NSC, State, USAID, and the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.  CIA, NCTC, and NSC did not provide any plans. We reviewed all plans  provided by Defense, State, and USAID, as of April 17, 2008.

We determined the  amount of U.S. funding to Pakistan by analyzing Defense, State, and  USAID budget documents covering the period from fiscal years 2002  through 2007 and by verifying the amounts used for the FATA and the  border regions through discussions with agency officials.

Per capita public development expenditure is reportedly one- third of the national average. Social development indicators are also poor.  The overall literacy rate is 17 percent, compared with 56 percent  nationally, with male literacy at 29 percent and female literacy at 3  percent.

The assessment also examines the impact of not meeting  the national security goals. It states that al Qaeda is now using the  Pakistani safe haven to put the last element necessary to launch another  attack against America into place, including the identification, training,  and positioning of Western operatives for an attack. It stated that al Qaeda  is most likely using the FATA to plot terrorist attacks against political,  economic, and infrastructure targets in America \u201cdesigned to produce  mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, significant economic  aftershocks, and/or fear among the population.\u201d", "DNI\u2019s 2008 assessment found that al Qaeda and other Pakistan-based  militants now also pose a threat to Pakistan.

While we acknowledge that  this effort is a step in the right direction toward implementing the 2003  national security strategy, the recommendations by the 9/11 Commission,  and Congress, it is unclear whether the new approach will include all of  the key elements of national power, such as intelligence, economic, and  law enforcement support.", "ODNI\u2019s comments stated that they agreed with our finding that the United  States had not met its national security goals in Pakistan\u2019s FATA and that  countering the growth of terrorist safe havens requires all elements of  national power. They disagreed, however, that the United States lacks  plans to combat terrorism in the area. Our report does not state that the  U.S. lacks individual plans; rather, we found that there was no  comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of Defense,  State, USAID, the intelligence community, and others to meet U.S. national  security goals in Pakistan.", "We also received technical comments from Defense and USAID, which we  have incorporated throughout the report where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to interested  congressional committees, to the National Security Advisor of the NSC,  the Director of the NCTC, the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the  Administrator of USAID. We will also make copies of this report available  to others upon request.
