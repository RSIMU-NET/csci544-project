More than 100,000 medical device products are currently in use in the United States, including a substantial number that health care professionals use every day to diagnose, treat, or prevent illness; improve the quality of patients\u2019 lives; and support and sustain life. Over the past 15 years, the U.S. medical device industry has grown from 5,900 to 16,900 firms. More than $40 billion was spent on such devices in the United States in 1994.", "FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting system gathers information about problems associated with marketed medical devices, which enables FDA and the medical device industry to work together to take corrective action on device problems and, when appropriate, to alert the public to potentially hazardous devices to prevent injury or death. Although medical device manufacturers have been required to report malfunctions and device-related injuries and deaths to FDA since 1984, hospitals and other facilities that use devices were not required to report these matters and, consequently, rarely did so.", "Recognizing this problem, the Congress enacted the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA ), which expanded the reporting requirements to include user facilities, such as hospitals and nursing homes, and medical device distributors. SMDA  also required us to report on user facilities\u2019 compliance with the act\u2019s reporting requirements. To carry out this responsibility, we sought answers to five questions: (1) Has the enactment of SMDA  was enacted, FDA does not systematically act to ensure that the reported problems receive prompt attention and appropriate resolution. As a result, FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting system is not providing an early warning about problem medical devices as SMDA reporting under SMDA  directly accounted for the increased volume of reports is unclear because, until recently, FDA did not require manufacturers to disclose whether serious injury reports originated from user facilities or from some other source. This increased volume made it difficult for FDA to process and review reports in a timely manner. To address this problem, FDA chose to give priority to death and serious injury reports, which resulted in its delaying for nearly 2 years processing and reviewing almost 50,000 malfunction reports. Malfunction reports are essential in alerting FDA to potentially serious device problems before they result in death or serious injury. To better manage the reporting workload in the future, FDA has initiated several changes to the adverse event reporting system, such as consolidating reporting system components and using electronic reporting.", "FDA has received significantly fewer adverse event reports from user facilities than it expected. Moreover, much of the information that user facilities did provide was of poor quality and incomplete, in part because FDA did not issue the final medical device reporting regulation in a timely manner or periodically educate user facilities about their responsibilities under SMDA FDA and representatives of both medical device users and manufacturers believe that the reporting system is overburdened with reports and data that may not be necessary to detect and resolve device problems. FDA is studying the feasibility of using a statistical sample of user facilities to reduce the volume of reports it has to review. However, concerns exist about whether a sample of users can provide FDA with the information that it needs to protect the public health. Further, while FDA\u2019s initiatives may improve the adverse event reporting system, they do not ensure timely resolution of device problems, user facility compliance with SMDA , or systematic dissemination of adverse event-related information to the medical device community."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To protect the public from harmful medical devices, the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act expanded FDA\u2019s responsibility for regulating medical devices in the United States.

This monitoring system gathers information about device problems that could necessitate withdrawing a device from the market or taking other corrective actions.", "Among other things, the act authorized FDA to establish a reporting system for adverse events associated with the use of medical devices. As a result, FDA established the Mandatory Medical Device Reporting (MDR) system. Under this system, since 1984, manufacturers of medical devices have been required to report to FDA\u2014and maintain records on\u2014device- related deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions that, should they recur, would be likely to result in death or serious injury. A system called the Medical Device and Laboratory Problem Reporting Program (PRP) was established to receive voluntary reports from health care professionals. FDA\u2019s responsibility is to audit manufacturers\u2019 performance to identify systemic problems and trends associated with an individual firm, a specific device, or the entire device industry, issuing guidance as necessary.", "The Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB) within CDRH operates the adverse event reporting system. OSB reviews adverse event reports on medical devices to identify, manage, and resolve public health issues; prepares safety alerts and public health advisories; and provides regulatory guidance on adverse event reporting issues. CDRH estimates that it spent approximately $8 million and used about 80 full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions in support of the medical device reporting program in fiscal year 1996. This represents an increase of about $606,000 and three FTEs over medical device reporting program expenditures in fiscal year 1995.", "When FDA receives an adverse event report, OSB health care analysts evaluate and compare the report with other information contained in FDA databases. A decision is then made about whether or not the device problem poses a potential risk to the public health. If so, depending on the nature and severity of the risk, an analyst may initiate a follow-up investigation, which generally involves a written request for additional information or an inspection of the manufacturer or user facility. (App. II provides a detailed description of FDA\u2019s report evaluation process.)", "For years, FDA\u2019s implementation and enforcement of the medical device reporting regulation have concerned the Congress. Studies issued by our office, the former Office of Technology Assessment, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have found significant weaknesses in FDA\u2019s ability to gather information about medical devices in use. For example, in 1986, we found that less than 1 percent of the device problems occurring in hospitals were reported to FDA and that, the more serious the problem with the device, the less likely it was to be reported to FDA.

User facilities are also required to report to manufacturers when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device caused or contributed to a serious injury or serious illness. In the event that the manufacturer of the device is unknown, the facility is required to report a serious injury or illness directly to FDA. User facilities are required to submit reports within 10 work days of becoming aware of such situations. The act also requires that user facilities submit to FDA semiannual summaries of all the adverse event reports they submitted to manufacturers and FDA during the previous 6 months. Table 1 summarizes the medical device reporting requirements for user facilities, distributors, and manufacturers.", "In addition, SMDA  reporting requirements. In addition to the statutory requirement that user facilities and distributors report serious medical device-related events to FDA and manufacturers, the tentative medical device reporting regulation provided nonmandatory guidance. This guidance instructed user facilities to establish and maintain written procedures that include (1) training and educational programs to inform employees about how to identify and report reportable events, (2) internal systems for documenting and reporting adverse events, and (3) documentation and recordkeeping guidelines.", "In December 1995, 4 years after the tentative medical device reporting regulation was issued, FDA published the final regulation for user facilities and manufacturers. As of July 31, 1996, they are both required to report device-related events under a uniform system of reporting. Also under the final medical device reporting regulation, manufacturers are required to submit baseline reports and annual certifications to FDA. FDA can issue various types of written notification to inform a user facility that it has not complied with the medical device reporting regulation, which could result in civil monetary penalties or warning letters.", "CDRH established the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) system to replace the PRP and MDR systems. From 1992 to 1996, voluntary reports from user facilities, distributors, and health professionals were input into the MAUDE system; as of April 1996, the MAUDE system contained approximately 20,000 such reports.", "During this same period, FDA continued to enter manufacturer reports into the MDR system. FDA plans to begin entering into the MAUDE system manufacturers\u2019 reports that give July 31, 1996, or later as the date the manufacturer learned of an adverse event. FDA expects to have moved all the data from the PRP and MDR systems into the MAUDE system by January 1997.", "Finally, in 1993, FDA established the Medical Products Reporting Program\u2014called \u201cMedWatch\u201d\u2014to encourage health professionals to report adverse events and product problems to FDA, simplify reporting, and improve the postmarket product information in FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting system. MedWatch consists of two forms used to elicit the information needed to monitor the safety of marketed devices: the form 3500 is completed by health professionals for voluntary reporting, and the form 3500A is completed by user facilities, distributors, and manufacturers for required reporting.

These delays could hinder the timely identification and resolution of device problems.

A comparison of two 4-year periods, fiscal years 1987 through 1990 and 1991 through 1994, illustrates the rapid growth of FDA officials believe the upward trend in reporting is due to (1) the unanticipated, large volume of problems associated with silicone gel-filled breast implants, which accounted for nearly one-third of all of the manufacturer event reports submitted to FDA during fiscal years 1992 through 1994, and (2) increased compliance by manufacturers with the 1984 medical device reporting regulation and SMDA ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Could Not Handle Volume of Reports", "paragraphs": ["CDRH has had considerable difficulty processing and reviewing the heavy volume of adverse event reports in a timely manner.

Many of the malfunction reports were not entered into the adverse event reporting system and available for complete review and assessment until 1996. Although FDA assigns malfunction reports a lower priority than reports of death and serious injury, processing malfunction reports quickly is critical because of their potential to alert FDA to device problems that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Entering all adverse event reports into the system promptly allows FDA analysts to perform more complete reviews and assessments on device problems. Further, entering event reports expeditiously is important because an event report, regardless of whether it requires immediate action, can become part of a group of reports that ultimately stimulates corrective action on a device problem.", "Two factors contributed to the backlog, according to FDA. First, FDA received an unanticipated, heavy volume of breast implant adverse event reports. Second, FDA lacked funds to increase hiring for the former medical device reporting contractor (United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.) that performed data processing functions related to the reports. FDA told us that it recognized the potential impact of the increasing backlog and decided to enter death and serious injury reports immediately, leaving less serious injury and malfunction reports to be entered when resources permitted.

FDA may, upon written request or at its own discretion, grant to user facilities or manufacturers an exemption or variance from any of the reporting requirements or change the frequency of reporting.", "Also, CDRH is in the process of developing an electronic data interchange (EDI) system to allow firms to submit their adverse event reports electronically. Currently, most of the reports are manually transmitted and then entered into FDA computers. The EDI system will function as a single system that receives device reports and distributes them for automated data entry into FDA computers. CDRH believes the EDI system, once embraced by the device industry, will reduce the likelihood of a significant backlog in coding and data entry of reports. EDI requirements and standards are currently being developed and will be piloted in fiscal year 1997.", "In addition, CDRH is developing alternative methods of analyzing event reports through enhancements to the computerized MAUDE system. For many years, CDRH has used several adverse event databases that are not integrated for analysis of reports.

Our analysis of CDRH data shows, for example, that many user facilities may be underreporting deaths to FDA and that some facilities are reporting events they are not required to report. Further, user facilities\u2019 reports are often late, inaccurate, or incomplete. User facility reports of device problems are important to manufacturers and FDA because only the user facility\u2019s physicians and staff have direct access to the patient and the device, as well as the clinical skills necessary to detect any adverse effects. Thus, the user facility is in the best position to obtain information that manufacturers and FDA need to determine whether a device presents a public health risk. Without sufficient high-quality reports from user facilities, therefore, FDA\u2019s ability to analyze device problems and assess the public health risk is hampered. Finally, FDA attributed user facilities\u2019 inadequate reporting to FDA\u2019s delay in issuing a final medical device reporting regulation to fully enforce the law, a low level of awareness about SMDA During the 4-year period, more than 80 percent of the user facility event reports were for serious injuries and illnesses (52 percent) and malfunctions (29 percent).

In contrast, user facility reporting under SMDA  requires user facilities to submit a report to FDA and manufacturers, if known, within 10 work days of receiving information that reasonably suggests that a device has caused or contributed to a patient death. However, our analysis of CDRH data revealed that user facilities may have underreported thousands of patient deaths to FDA. Without the user facilities\u2019 perspective on these events, FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting system has significantly less information about medical device problems to use in identifying problems and assessing the public health risk.", "We found that during fiscal years 1992 through 1995, manufacturers reported 5,976 deaths to FDA, while user facilities reported only 978 deaths\u2014a difference of 4,998 death reports (see fig. 4). According to CDRH officials, FDA has taken no action to determine the extent to which the discrepancy in reporting is due to underreporting by user facilities to FDA. Nevertheless, a CDRH official told us that the difference in the number of death reports received is a gross estimate of possible underreporting. Accurately determining the number of facilities that actually did not report deaths would require CDRH to use manufacturers\u2019 reports to identify the user facilities that may not have reported a death and then determine if the death was required to be reported\u2014a task the official said would be very time consuming.", "The official also stated that the difference in the number of deaths reported could be due, in part, to the different criteria that manufacturers and user facilities were required to use in deciding whether to report an event. For example, under the 1984 medical device reporting regulation, manufacturers were required to submit all event reports from health care professionals, even if the firm believed or knew that the event was not related to its device. In contrast, SMDA Once fully operational, the MAUDE system will be able to match and cross-reference all reports from manufacturers, distributors, user facilities, and health professionals so that an analyst will have a complete picture of the event. Thus, the analyst will be better able to determine, for example, whether or not a death report was submitted by a user facility, as required by law.

However, our review of CDRH statistics shows that many user facility reports are not submitted to FDA in a timely manner and that they frequently lack essential information on the device problem. Untimely and poor quality reports limit FDA\u2019s ability to identify device problems and assess the risk to the public health.

By increasing the agency\u2019s workload, extraneous reports can slow CDRH\u2019s review of adverse events that truly merit the agency\u2019s attention. For example, the act requires user facilities to submit event reports to manufacturers when they receive information that suggests a device may have caused or contributed to a serious injury or illness. Only in instances in which the manufacturer of the device is unknown is a serious injury or illness to be reported to FDA. However, of the 5,199 serious injury and illness reports FDA had received from user facilities as of June 1995, 3,588 (69 percent) did not need to have been sent to FDA because the user facility knew the manufacturer and identified it in the report. Moreover, during fiscal years 1992 through 1995, user facilities submitted 3,678 malfunction reports that were not required by SMDA consistent with those in the tentative final regulation (that is, they provided definitions of event terminology, descriptions of educational programs to teach employees how to identify and report device-related events, internal systems for documenting and reporting device-related events, and separate medical device reporting incident files). CDRH concluded that many facilities would benefit from additional educational efforts.", "FDA attributed user facilities\u2019 lack of adherence to FDA\u2019s tentative final regulation to several additional factors. First, a CDRH official told us that before the final medical device reporting regulation became effective in July 1996, the only requirements that were legally enforceable were the requirements of SMDA , which do not provide sufficient detail on medical device reporting. As a result, user facilities had to rely on guidance in the tentative final medical device reporting regulation to establish the program\u2019s requirements. This guidance was not enforceable, and, as the official pointed out, user facilities did not have to follow it because doing so was voluntary.", "In addition, FDA officials said that planning and performing compliance inspections are difficult because FDA has a limited number of investigators available to conduct the inspections that are required at over 70,000 regulated facilities.

However, CDRH does not have a system for routinely communicating adverse event reporting trends and remedial actions taken on device problems to specific reporters of device problems and the medical device community at large. Although FDA occasionally issues safety alerts and public health advisories, which inform the medical device community about health risks associated with devices, it does not provide user facilities and other medical device reporters with direct feedback on the status and outcomes of individual device investigations. Nor does it publish composite statistics on event trends and problem resolutions. Consequently, many adverse event reporters are unaware of the dispositions of their complaints and have little assurance that the agency is taking action on the device problems reported. Both user facilities and the industry have suggested that FDA provide more feedback on how it uses adverse event reports.", "A CDRH official told us that FDA does not have a notification system for advising individual user facilities and other reporters about the status and outcomes of reports because significant staff time would be required to provide feedback to reporters on the more than 100,000 event reports received annually. The official said further that often no feedback is available because FDA does not follow up on each event that is reported. Voluntary reporters receive an acknowledgment letter, but it does not provide specific feedback about their report. FDA does, however, disseminate safety alerts and public health advisories regarding medical device problems to user facilities; it also periodically features alerts in its User Facility Reporting Bulletin.

In addition, a senior executive of a New Jersey hospital said he was disappointed that a database has not been developed that can be searched for information about problem medical devices to help his hospital learn more about the performance of devices and assist in device purchase decisions.

Sampling, according to ECRI, would reduce duplication, speed processing and analysis, and free up resources to devote to analysis and educating hospitals about medical device reporting.", "NEMA members, however, believe that developing a user facility reporting program predicated on reports from only a small number of entities would pose at least two implementation problems. First, NEMA members believe, in general, that statistical sampling is beneficial only when it pertains to identical devices from one manufacturer. If statistical sampling is used in the device industry, they contend, the possibility exists that problems identified with a given type of device could be incorrectly generalized to apply to devices that do not possess the same attributes. Such a generalization could impose additional costs on the manufacturer if it had to repeatedly spend resources on investigating incident reports that turned out to be groundless.", "Second, statistical sampling is also problematic from the perspective of the user facility, in that not all user facilities are alike. In the opinion of NEMA members, the only useful approach to a statistical sampling program would be to confine the sample size to a small number of user facilities that share similar patient populations and operating characteristics, such as Public Health System facilities or Veterans Administration facilities.", "According to the safety coordinator at a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, statistical sampling would not be a good idea because, given the demands on the user facility community to provide quality health care, if reporting were not required, facilities would not report medical device-related problems. He believes that medical device reporting is an important prerequisite for good patient care and that user facilities must be required by law to report medical device-related incidents in order for them to consistently do so.", "CDRH\u2019s director told us that CDRH frequently receives adverse event reports from user facilities that are not very helpful in identifying and resolving device problems. He went on to say that CDRH would prefer to receive fewer, but more helpful reports. As a result, CDRH is planning a pilot study to determine the feasibility of adopting the statistical sampling approach to medical device reporting. Under this approach, FDA would educate a smaller population of user facilities in reporting device problems, which might improve the quality of reporting and increase manufacturers\u2019 and FDA\u2019s knowledge about device problems.", "CDRH recently issued a \u201cRequest for Proposals for a Sentinel System\u201d that asked prospective bidders to develop a design for a pilot study involving about 10 to 20 user facilities.

Staff of the user facilities that are chosen to participate will be trained in the medical device reporting requirements and user facility responsibilities. Participating facilities will be monitored, and the adverse events reported will be qualitatively evaluated for 12 months. User facilities will receive feedback and refresher training as needed.

Currently, manufacturers are required to report to FDA malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury should they recur. During fiscal years 1991 through 1995, reports of device malfunctions accounted for about one-third of all reports submitted by manufacturers. Industry officials contend that the medical device reporting system is so overburdened that FDA does not have an opportunity to evaluate the reports of device malfunction and that such reporting is costly and burdensome. Thus, these officials believe malfunctions should no longer be considered reportable events. They contend that manufacturers have systems in place to review and evaluate product malfunctions and that these evaluations are available to FDA during the routine inspections that FDA makes of their facilities.", "The purpose of the 1984 medical device regulation was to provide FDA with more information about device problems, such as malfunctions, so that the agency could learn about potential device problems before they endangered the lives of people. A CDRH official told us that deciding whether to eliminate malfunction reporting is the choice between having an adverse event reporting system that is proactive and one that is reactive. Further, he stated that if the objective of medical device reporting is to find out that a device is dangerous after it has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, then malfunction reporting can be eliminated. However, if the objective is to become aware of problems before they have caused a death or serious injury, then malfunction reporting should not be eliminated.

Without reliable statistics that measure the length of time that FDA takes to review and initiate action on device problems and systematic documentation of how all reported problems are resolved, FDA cannot ensure that the system is serving as an early warning system for unsafe and ineffective devices. Moreover, because FDA has not identified and followed up with user facilities that may have underreported thousands of patient deaths, its ability to analyze device problems and assess the public health risk may be significantly hampered. Finally, without feedback from FDA to user facilities about device problem trends and corrective actions taken, user facilities do not receive information that could help them determine which devices to purchase, and they have little assurance that FDA is taking action on their adverse event reports.", "FDA\u2019s new MAUDE system is now providing opportunities for FDA to correct weaknesses in its adverse event reporting system. In July 1996, FDA began requiring manufacturers to list on the form 3500A corrective actions that are initiated to resolve medical device adverse events. This improvement will provide the MAUDE system with the information that FDA needs to systematically document solutions to device problems and help it communicate more effectively with user facilities. In addition, once the MAUDE system is fully operational, it will be able to generate productivity data on the time FDA takes to process and review adverse event reports. If FDA expands this capability to include the time it requires to initiate action on reports, it will be able to more easily measure its performance as an early warning system. The MAUDE system will also enable FDA to identify and follow up with user facilities that do not submit reports of device-related deaths to FDA. If FDA uses the MAUDE system in this way, FDA will be able to ensure that user facilities are complying with the law and also obtain the user facilities\u2019 perspectives on these events.", "Limiting the number of user facilities required to report medical device problems could improve the quality of data FDA receives without jeopardizing its ability to identify device problems. On the other hand, fewer reporters could mean that problems would be less likely to be identified and resolved, especially for devices with relatively low usage rates. An evaluation of whether the identification and correction of device problems would better be accomplished through the current system or through a smaller user facility reporting program may help FDA decide which approach is better for protecting the public health. Furthermore, although FDA\u2019s initiatives may improve its reporting system, they do not address its difficulty in ensuring prompt resolution of device problems, compliance with SMDA document corrective actions on adverse event reports that result from analysis and investigations of device problems; and collect and disseminate adverse event trend analysis and corrective actions taken by manufacturers and FDA to the medical device community.", "Finally, we recommend that FDA\u2019s study of an adverse event reporting system based on a representative sample of user facilities focus on whether this approach can provide manufacturers and FDA with the quantity and quality of information needed to rapidly identify and correct problems with devices that have varying usage rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["FDA agreed with our recommendations for improving its adverse event reporting system.

This suggestion conflicts with FDA\u2019s response to a recent congressional inquiry in which FDA characterized the adverse event reporting system as \u201ccritically\u201d important to its postmarket surveillance system because it provides a balance with its premarket evaluation of new medical devices. FDA also characterized the adverse event reporting system as a \u201csafety net\u201d that allows the agency to move new technologies into the marketplace more rapidly because problems with devices that were not detected at the premarketing stage can be identified and corrected through the adverse event reporting system. Moreover, FDA\u2019s implication that it relies more heavily on its GMP compliance program than on the medical device reporting system to help protect the public health is worrisome. The GMP program is intended to assess the safety and effectiveness of devices before, rather than after, they reach users. Yet in an earlier study of the program, we documented that FDA did not inspect many manufacturers of medium- and high-risk devices at least once every 2 years, as required by law; the quality of the inspections that were performed was frequently poor; and the inspections did not detect quality assurance problems.", "While we acknowledge that FDA has recognized weaknesses in the adverse event reporting system and has instituted improvements to correct them, none of these improvements has been tested and proven effective. For example, although the form 3500A may provide FDA with the information it needs to better protect the public health, voluntary use of the form by user facilities since 1992 has shown that many data quality problems exist. Further, it is too early to tell if mandatory use of the form 3500A will result in improved reporting.", "Although FDA has provided some information that associates medical device reports with recalls and other administrative and regulatory activities, the adverse event reporting system does not routinely identify the actions that were initiated to correct the problems detailed in event reports.
