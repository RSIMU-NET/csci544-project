DOD provided computer-based training to help military supervisors, financial counselors, and eligible servicemembers understand the new retirement system, implemented in 2018, and its impact on saving for retirement. DOD trained financial counselors to provide servicemembers in-person, one-on-one financial counseling and classroom courses on BRS and related topics. In addition, DOD prepared ongoing financial literacy training that servicemembers will take upon reaching specific career and life stages.", "BRS trainings met many of the effective practices for financial literacy training identified in prior GAO work, but some DOD trainings do not incorporate the practice of assessing servicemembers' financial literacy. DOD could use such assessments to modify course material to bolster training in areas where servicemembers' comprehension was weaker. Without assessing whether its financial literacy training is effectively conveying course information, DOD may be missing opportunities to better support servicemembers' retirement decisions. Servicemembers also reported challenges in taking the Opt-In Course for BRS that may inform ongoing and future DOD training.", "Examples of Servicemembers' Financial Literacy Challenges on Retirement", "DOD determines BRS lump-sum payment amounts at retirement by applying an interest rate (or discount rate) to calculate the present value of annuity payments servicemembers forego by taking a lump sum. The BRS discount rate exceeds the rate used by private-sector pension plans, resulting in a lower lump sum than if private-sector rates applied. DOD can take certain steps to help servicemembers understand how to compare the BRS lump-sum payment option with the full annuity option.

The National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016 included  provisions that created a new military retirement system. This Blended  Retirement System (BRS) offers a new defined contribution (DC) benefit  in the form of an employer contribution to a personal Thrift Savings Plan  (TSP) account that will provide some retirement compensation for a large  majority of servicemembers, including those who serve less than 20  years; however, it also reduces the DB annuity paid to those who serve  20 years or more. The Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that full  implementation of BRS will reduce its annual budget costs by $1.4 billion  compared to the legacy retirement system, in 2016 dollars. Active-duty  servicemembers with fewer than 12 years of military service as of  December 31, 2017 were given the 2018 calendar year to make an  irrevocable decision on whether to opt into BRS or remain in the legacy  retirement system.

Additionally, for those who complete at  least 20 years of service, BRS offers the option to take some of their DB  annuity as a lump-sum payment. DOD and the military service branches  provide some financial education to servicemembers, but concerns exist  about whether servicemembers are able to make the informed decisions  about their retirement required by BRS.", "You asked us to review how DOD was helping servicemembers make  decisions about their retirement. In this report, we examine (1) what  actions DOD has taken to help servicemembers understand BRS and,  more generally, educate servicemembers on saving for retirement; (2)  what DOD can learn from financial literacy training effective practices and  the implementation of BRS training to continue supporting  servicemembers in saving for retirement; and (3) how lump-sum payment  amounts are determined under BRS and how they compare to the  methods used by the private-sector pension plans that offer them.", "To answer these questions, we conducted interviews with officials from  the DOD, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), and  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Finally, we reviewed and  compared DOD\u2019s financial literacy trainings to the financial literacy  training effective practices published in a prior GAO report. To  understand how BRS lump-sum payments are determined, we reviewed  DOD documents and relevant federal law. We also interviewed DOD  officials to understand what issues they considered when designing  BRS\u2019s lump-sum feature, how DOD determines the discount rate, or  interest rate, that it uses for lump-sum payments, and how the rate relates  to personal discount rates, which derive from research on observed  choices people make between receiving certain sums of money in the  future versus receiving smaller sums sooner. We interviewed  stakeholders knowledgeable about other pension plans to understand  how the discount rate in BRS differs from the discount rate used by those  plans.

DOD reported  that 91 percent of an estimated 1.7 million eligible servicemembers  attested that they had completed the training during the BRS opt-in  period. The course included information on (1) the importance of saving  for retirement, (2) the differences between the legacy retirement system  and BRS, (3) factors for servicemembers to consider in choosing between  the two retirement systems, and (4) tools and resources for  servicemembers to consult when making their opt-in decision. DOD  developed two additional BRS trainings for key military personnel in an  effort to expand the network of in-person resources available to  servicemembers eligible to opt into BRS. One course provided  installation-level financial management professionals\u2014Personal Financial  Managers (PFMs) and Personal Financial Counselors (PFCs)\u2014with more  detailed information to reinforce the BRS Opt-In Course curriculum for  servicemembers and answer their specific questions about BRS. The  other course provided optional training to military supervisors regardless  of their eligibility to opt into BRS. DOD officials said it was important to  educate military supervisors on BRS since many junior servicemembers  discuss personal financial information with their direct supervisors. DOD  officials said that the agency released both of these trainings in advance  of the BRS Opt-In Course so that PFMs and supervisors would have time  to understand the new system and prepare for questions from  servicemembers.", "DOD also developed the BRS New Accession Course for  servicemembers who entered the military on or after January 1, 2018 and  who are automatically enrolled in BRS.

This  course explains BRS\u2019s key components, identifies the tools and resources available to help servicemembers save for retirement, and  encourages servicemembers to actively manage their TSP accounts.  DOD officials said that the New Accession Course is very similar in  content to the BRS Opt-In Course but without comparisons to the legacy  retirement system. The course facilitator leads servicemembers through a  series of short videos on BRS, asks questions at the end of each of the  course sections, and is available to answer servicemembers\u2019 questions  throughout the course.", "DOD publicized BRS by creating a central website that links to outreach  material in a variety of media formats, including videos available on  YouTube, social media content, an interactive online comparison  calculator, webinars, and external websites such as Military OneSource  and https://www.tsp.gov. For example, DOD\u2019s central BRS website links  to its BRS Fact or Fiction video series, which addressed various BRS  misconceptions through 20 brief videos. In the video series, DOD  introduced the #BlendedRetirement hashtag, then distributed  supplementary BRS infographics with this hashtag to link back to  additional resources on social media sites. DOD officials said they also  are developing a mobile app to provide servicemembers easy access to  financial readiness information through tools like calculators and games.  Additionally, DOD\u2019s interactive online BRS calculator allowed  servicemembers to enter personal financial information, such as their  military grade, estimated date of military separation or retirement, and  TSP contribution percentage, so those who were eligible to opt into BRS  could compare how their retirement savings outcomes might differ under  BRS and under the legacy retirement system.", "DOD\u2019s Office of Financial Readiness also trained financial counselors  across the service branches to supplement the information in its BRS  trainings as well as to provide servicemembers in-person financial literacy  education. DOD officials said that the agency employs at least one PFM  at most military installations or uses PFCs, who are government  contractors. DOD officials said that PFMs and PFCs travel as needed to  provide support at multiple installations. One PFM we interviewed  estimated that PFMs provide as many as 10 group presentations per  week on retirement issues that they tailor to fit their audiences\u2019 needs.  Another said one-on-one counseling sessions allowed servicemembers to  share their personal financial situations, receive information germane to  their unique circumstances, and explore available tools and resources.  DOD officials said that, as outlined in federal statute, the role of PFMs  and PFCs is to educate servicemembers about financial options available  to them and not to provide financial advice.", "In addition to the centralized trainings and resources DOD created, the  service branches used their internal communication systems for BRS  outreach campaigns and created additional training tailored to the needs  of their servicemembers (see fig. 4). For example, according to Navy  officials, during the final 6 months of the BRS opt-in period, the Navy  posted approximately 80 Facebook and Twitter posts to its accounts, with  many of these reminding servicemembers of their opt-in choice. The  posts linked to additional resources and advertised outreach like the  Navy\u2019s Facebook Live event, which utilized social media to provide  servicemembers online access to financial experts who could answer  their retirement-related questions. Military supervisors also said that most  of the service branches sent targeted communications to supervisors to  remind eligible servicemembers at regular meetings to complete the BRS  Opt-In Course. The service branches also created supplemental BRS  trainings tailored to meet their servicemembers\u2019 needs.

However, behavioral  economic research has shown that people do  not always make rational choices related to  foregoing current benefits for future payoff. given stream of converted pension payments. The NDAA for Fiscal Year  2016 directed the Secretary of Defense to choose a discount rate for BRS  lump sums that (1) uses average personal discount rates that take into  consideration \u201capplicable and reputable studies of personal discount rates  for military personnel and past actuarial experience in the calculation of  personal discount rates,\u201d and (2) is in accordance with generally accepted  actuarial principles and practices.", "Researchers have sought to quantify personal discount rates by studying  personal choices in a variety of contexts involving the tradeoff of payoffs  at different times (see sidebar). Two such studies involved military  personnel being offered lump-sum payments in lieu of annuity  payments. According to the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), the  studies computed an estimated average personal discount rate for  servicemembers who were presented with the offer, based on the choices  by servicemembers to either elect the lump-sum payment or the annuity.", "DOD officials told us that, to comply with the requirements of the NDAA  for Fiscal Year 2016, they considered several factors to set the discount  rate for BRS lump-sum calculations. DOD officials said they first  contracted with a research organization to estimate a range of personal  discount rates based on past studies. They said they then adjusted that  range based on differences between the specific features of past lump- sum offers and those of BRS lump sums. They also considered how a  lump-sum offer could impact the retention of military personnel, since  DOD relies on a percentage of experienced servicemembers to continue  serving beyond 20 years. DOD officials told us they wanted to reduce the  likelihood a lump-sum payment would lead more people to retire earlier  than they would otherwise. Finally, even though past studies had found  higher personal discount rates (resulting in smaller lump-sum amounts)  for enlisted servicemembers than officers, DOD officials told us it would  go against core values of military compensation if the agency did not  apply the same discount rate to all lump-sum payments, regardless of the  servicemember\u2019s rank.", "Considering all of these factors, DOD devised a formula for setting what it  termed the \u201cGovernment Discount Rate\u201d (GDR) that would be used in  calculating BRS lump-sum amounts. DOD constructed the GDR by  starting with a market index of high-quality corporate bond rates and then  adding an adjustment factor so that the GDR fell within the range of  observed personal discount rates. According to DOD, this current  method for setting this rate will be reexamined at least every 4 years. The  GDR for 2019 is 6.81 percent, which is a \u201creal\u201d interest rate that does not  include an inflation component. To compare the GDR to more common  nominal interest rates, an inflation adjustment must be added. For  example, if inflation were assumed to be 2.4 percent per year, a GDR of  6.81 percent would be approximately equivalent to a nominal discount  rate of 9.37 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BRS Lump Sums Are Calculated Using a Higher Discount Rate than Private-Sector Pension Plans, Leading to Smaller Lump-Sum Payments by Comparison", "paragraphs": ["The method used to determine BRS lump-sum payment amounts is likely  to result in a discount rate that is higher\u2014based on recent interest rates,  roughly double\u2014 than that used to calculate minimum lump-sum  distributions from private-sector pension plans, when all other factors are  equal. The discount rates for determining minimum lump-sum amounts  for private-sector pension plans that offer them are governed by ERISA.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes the discount rates  applicable to minimum lump-sum determinations each month, based on  ERISA provisions. For 2018, these rates generally fell in the range of 2.5  to 4.9 percent, on a nominal basis, compared to the GDR, which was  about 9 percent, on a nominal basis (depending on assumed inflation).  We found, based on recent interest rates, holding age and monthly  annuity amounts constant, the higher discount rate applied to BRS lump- sum calculations would significantly reduce servicemembers\u2019 lump-sum  payment amounts. Additionally, we found that the percentage difference  would be the largest at younger retirement ages, since the difference in  discount rates would have an impact over a longer period of time. For a  servicemember retiring at age 40, for example, we found BRS lump-sum  payments to be about 40 percent smaller, based on recent interest rates,  than if calculated following the requirements under ERISA.

DOD officials said the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016  required that the BRS discount rate be based on average personal  discount rates, which is a different approach to discount rates than that  used under ERISA. DOD officials also said the agency relies on  maintaining a certain percentage of servicemembers with 20 or more  years of service and did not want the offer of a lump-sum offer to entice  too large a percentage of servicemembers to leave military service.", "However, knowledgeable stakeholders expressed some concerns with  the higher discount rate used to determine BRS lump-sum payment  amounts. For example, the DOD Board of Actuaries stated that a  relatively high discount rate, and the lower lump-sum payments that  would result, could be perceived as taking advantage of  servicemembers. Additionally, the American Academy of Actuaries said  those who accept lump-sum payments using higher discount rates are  likely to either not understand the financial value of their annuity benefits  or have an immediate financial need.

While more servicemembers will receive retirement  benefits under BRS than under the legacy retirement system, BRS will  require servicemembers to more actively and continuously manage their  retirement decisions throughout their military career and in retirement. As  an employer, DOD is well positioned to provide financial literacy training  and support to servicemembers as they make retirement decisions. DOD  has designed a multi-faceted approach to provide resources over time  and in a variety of formats, increasing the likelihood that servicemembers  will be able to find guidance when they need it. DOD completed a large  undertaking in educating servicemembers about the choice they faced in  deciding whether to opt into BRS, but this was only the first step in  educating servicemembers about how to maximize and manage their  retirement savings under BRS. In educating servicemembers about  saving for retirement, DOD would benefit from applying the financial  literacy training effective practices identified by experts, especially  periodically assessing employees\u2019 financial understanding and using  these assessments to revise and tailor ongoing training.", "Given that young servicemembers are often stationed in multiple  locations for short amounts of time and that BRS places increased  responsibility on servicemembers to save for retirement through TSP  contributions, it is important that servicemembers receive the necessary  information to access their TSP accounts online in a timely manner. The  current TSP password process has limited some servicemembers\u2019 ability  to manage their accounts. It is important for FRTIB to expeditiously  address this issue.", "Of additional concern is how DOD will ensure that servicemembers  understand the tradeoffs associated with BRS\u2019s lump-sum feature. BRS  lump-sum payments are calculated using a higher discount rate than  private-sector pension plans, which results in lower lump-sum payments,  by comparison. While the BRS lump sum is limited, and the full annuity  amount would resume at servicemembers\u2019 Social Security full retirement  age, the reduced annuity paid until then could still have a significant  impact on some servicemembers\u2019 financial security. A fundamental  element of BRS is the greater responsibility and choice placed on  individuals. To work well, such a system requires that sufficient, clear,  and accurate information be provided so that servicemembers can make  the prudent choices best suited to their personal financial situations.  Consistent with this principle, DOD should ensure that the information  and tools that it provides to eligible servicemembers about the lump sum  clearly lay out the tradeoffs of this decision and allows those eligible to  make a well-informed prudent choice that best meets their individual  financial circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should evaluate the results of its financial  literacy training assessments to determine where gaps in  servicemembers\u2019 financial knowledge exist and revise future trainings  to address these gaps.

For recommendation 1, regarding the evaluation of its financial  literacy training assessments, DOD stated that in 2017 it added questions  to its annual Status of Forces Survey to assess the military population\u2019s  understanding of basic financial concepts.  While these survey results will  allow DOD to respond to identified gaps in servicemembers\u2019 financial  literacy, Status of Forces survey results have taken years to compile in  the past. Assessing servicemembers\u2019 financial literacy as part of  mandatory trainings will allow DOD to more promptly identify gaps in  servicemembers\u2019 knowledge and adjust trainings to address those gaps.  For recommendation 2, regarding the provision of information on the  BRS\u2019s lump-sum payment options, DOD stated that it has developed a  training course, published information to help educate servicemembers  on the BRS\u2019s lump-sum option, and included a lump-sum section in its  BRS calculator. While we are encouraged by DOD\u2019s efforts to develop  various tools for educating servicemembers on the BRS\u2019s lump-sum  option, in this report we identified additional information that is important  to include in lump sum disclosures.", "In its letter, DOD expressed concern that the title of our report focused  only on one aspect of our findings.

DOD also said that the agency did not intend for the BRS Opt-In Course  to be financial literacy training, and thus were concerned that we  evaluated this training based on the effective practice identified in prior  GAO work of assessing employees\u2019 financial literacy to provide  assistance and help set priorities. However, we believe that our use of  this effective practice to evaluate the BRS Opt-in Course is consistent  with our prior findings that employers are well-suited to provide financial  education and help individuals improve their financial decision making.  We compared the BRS Opt-In Course to this effective practice because  the course provided DOD an opportunity to assess whether  servicemembers understood key aspects of BRS, undoubtedly a key  aspect of servicemembers\u2019 financial well-being.", "In addition, DOD stated that the agency viewed servicemembers\u2019 initial  low pass-rate of the BRS Opt-In Course as a positive result because they  designed the course to be rigorous and it forced servicemembers to  retake the parts of the training where they were failing to comprehend the  course material. DOD also stated that revising the training during the  2017 training period was not practical because it would have resulted in  some servicemembers receiving disparate training formats and materials.  We understand DOD\u2019s concerns; however as DOD continues to develop  additional financial literacy training we encourage the agency to consider  that low pass rates on post-training tests often indicate a gap in  knowledge and a possible need to revise the training.", "In its final comment, DOD agreed with us that there is a lack of reliable  data for comparing the BRS lump-sum feature with those provisions  offered by state and local government pension plans. DOD also stated  that the BRS lump-sum feature was unique and therefore not comparable  to private-sector pension plans governed by ERISA. Although there are  differences between BRS and ERISA, the BRS and ERISA lump-sum  provisions are the only defined benefit lump sum conversion provisions  that are specified under federal law. Further, the lump-sum provisions for  both reflect a participant choice that can have important consequences  for a participant\u2019s financial security.

Across these two topic areas, we selected the five  financial literacy training effective practices that were most relevant to the  type of trainings DOD developed for BRS. Specifically, we determined if  BRS trainings (1) contain unbiased information, (2) contain links to one- on-one financial help, (3) leverage trusted messengers, (4) assess  participants\u2019 financial literacy so DOD can provide assistance and help  set priorities, and (5) enable participants to take action directly from the  course.", "To understand how BRS lump-sum payments are determined, we  interviewed DOD officials to learn about the issues they considered when  designing BRS\u2019s lump-sum feature, how DOD determines the discount  rate it uses for lump-sum payments, and how the BRS discount rate used  to calculate lump sums relates to personal discount rates. To understand  discount rate issues applicable to lump-sum payments in other pension  plans, we interviewed stakeholders knowledgeable about other pension  plans, consulted with our internal actuarial experts, and reviewed relevant  prior work. We also consulted with actuaries at DOD to clarify our  technical understanding of the calculation of lump-sum amounts under  BRS.", "We created a lump-sum payment calculator to run simulations of various  lump-sum calculations\u2014including those used in private-sector pension  plans\u2014to show the effect that varying certain calculation methods and  assumptions can have on the value of the lump-sum payment. We  calculated and compared illustrative lump-sum amounts under BRS to  what those lump-sum amounts would have been under federal laws and  regulations applicable to private-sector pension plans. We did not do a  similar comparison to public-sector pension plans because of a lack of  reliable, generalizable data on the prevalence of lump sums offered by  the many state and local government plans and the applicable discount  rates used. Some lump-sum options under state and local government  plans do not require a discount rate at all because they return employee  contributions with interest or are a deferred retirement option provision  (DROP) rather than lump sums that involve discounting future promised  payments. Different state or local governments might set their own rules  regarding any lump sums.

DOD officials told us that the 23-year maturity was  intended to reflect the average time between a servicemember\u2019s  retirement from the military until Social Security full retirement age (FRA).  The 7-year averaging is for the purpose of smoothing out short-term  fluctuations in interest rates. The add-on for 2018 and 2019 is 4.28  percentage points. The GDR for 2019 is 6.81 percent, which is a \u201creal\u201d  discount rate that does not include an inflation component.", "Interest rates are often regarded, economically, as consisting of two  components: a portion to cover expected inflation (the inflation  component), plus a portion to provide a return in excess of inflation (the  \u201creal\u201d return component). For example, if inflation expectations are 2.50  percent per year, and the interest rate on a bond is 4.50 percent, then the  bond is expected to provide a real return (in excess of inflation) of  approximately 1.95 percent ( x 100). In this case, 4.50  percent would be referred to as the nominal interest rate and 1.95 percent  would be referred to as the real interest rate.", "In order to convert the GDR into an equivalent nominal discount rate (for  comparison to ERISA discount rates), an inflation assumption is needed.  We used an inflation assumption of 2.40 percent per year, which is the  inflation assumption used by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in  its 2019 long-term budget outlook. As a result, with this inflation  assumption, the nominal discount rate equivalent to the GDR of 6.81  percent is 9.37 percent ( x 100). Military pensions  (both under legacy and BRS) are increased each year to fully keep up  with inflation. The lump-sum equivalent of such a benefit could be  calculated in one of two ways, which mathematically would produce the  same result: (1) applying the nominal discount rate (in this example, 9.37  percent) to the projected increasing series of monthly annuity benefits, or  (2) applying the real discount rate (in this example, 6.81 percent) to a  fixed (not inflation indexed) monthly annuity.", "For determining minimum lump sums under ERISA, the discount rate is  actually a combination of three \u201csegment\u201d rates that reflect bond yields at  different maturities: a short-term rate to discount future payments due in  the next 5 years, a medium-term rate to discount future payments due  between 5 and 20 years out, and a long-term rate to discount future  payments due beyond 20 years. These are nominal rates. These rates  are published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are  based on an average of high-quality corporate bond rates for the month.  Private-sector pension plan sponsors have some flexibility in selecting a  method for determining which monthly averages would be used to  calculate lump sums offered in a particular plan year. As a result, for a  lump sum payable in a particular month, the applicable ERISA segment  rates could be those for a month up to 16 months prior to the month of the  lump-sum payment, depending on the provisions of the plan.", "Minimum lump sums under ERISA also include a \u201cmortality discount,\u201d  which means that the lump sum is reduced to reflect the fact that for any  future scheduled pension payment, there is a probability that the retiree  will no longer be alive to receive it. We included this mortality discount in  our ERISA calculations. DOD decided not to include a mortality discount  in the BRS lump-sum methodology. DOD officials told us that mortality  rates from age 44 to age 67 are relatively small, such that the impact of  including mortality would be overwhelmed by minor changes in the  discount rate. As a result, for simplicity, they decided not to include a  mortality discount. Not including a mortality discount has the effect of  making the BRS lump sum somewhat more generous than it would be if it  included a mortality discount.", "Thus, key differences in the determination of lump-sum amounts under  BRS and for ERISA minimums include the following:", "The development of the GDR starts with corporate bond rates for a  23-year maturity, whereas the ERISA segment rates are based on  corporate bond rates for many maturities that are summarized into  three segment rates for three different ranges of maturities.

The BRS lump sum ranged from 38 percent smaller to  42 percent smaller than on an ERISA basis for an age-40 retirement and  from 28 percent smaller to 32 percent smaller for an age-50 retirement.", "We also calculated sensitivities from varying the inflation assumption. As  noted earlier, we used an inflation assumption of 2.4 percent, the inflation  assumption used by the CBO in its 2019 long-term budget outlook.
