Rulemaking at most  regulatory agencies follows the APA\u2019s informal rulemaking process, also  known as \u201cnotice and comment\u201d rulemaking, which generally requires  agencies to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal  Register, provide interested persons an opportunity to comment on the  proposed regulation, and publish the final regulation, among other  things. Under the APA, a person adversely affected by an agency\u2019s  notice and comment rulemaking is generally entitled to judicial review of  that new rule, and a court may invalidate the regulation if it finds it to be  \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in  accordance with law,\u201d sometimes referred to as the arbitrary and  capricious test. In addition to the requirements of the APA, federal  agencies typically must comply with requirements imposed by certain  other statutes and executive orders. In accordance with various  presidential executive orders, agencies work closely with staff from the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs, who review draft regulations and other significant  regulatory actions prior to publication.requirements that affect OSHA standard setting were established in 1980  or later.", "The process OSHA uses to develop and issue standards is spelled out in  the OSH Act.

For example, according to agency officials,  OSHA staff have been working on developing a silica standard since  1997, a beryllium standard since 2000, and a standard on walking and  working surfaces since 2003.

Some agency officials  and experts told us such changes often cause delays in the process of  setting standards. For example, some experts noted that the agency\u2019s  intense focus on publishing an ergonomics rule in the 1990s took  attention away from several other standards that previously had been a  priority.", "The standard of judicial review that applies to OSHA standards if they are  challenged in court also affects OSHA\u2019s time frames because it requires  more robust research and analysis than the standard that applies to many  other agencies\u2019 regulations, according to some experts and agency  officials. Instead of the arbitrary and capricious test provided for under the  APA, the OSH Act directs courts to review OSHA\u2019s standards using a  more stringent legal standard: it provides that a standard shall be upheld  if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record considered as a   According to OSHA officials, this more stringent standard  whole.\u201d (known as the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard) requires a higher level of  scrutiny by the courts and as a result, OSHA staff must conduct a large  volume of detailed research in order to understand all industrial  processes involved in the hazard being regulated, and to ensure that a  given hazard control would be feasible for each process.", "According to OSHA officials and experts, two additional factors result in  an extensive amount of work for the agency in developing standards:", "Substantial data challenges, which stem from a dearth of available  scientific data for some hazards and having to review and evaluate  scientific studies, among other sources.

Similarly difficult to meet,  according to officials, is the requirement that an emergency temporary  standard must be replaced within 6 months by a permanent standard  issued using the process specified in section 6(b) of the OSH Act.", "OSHA uses enforcement and education as alternatives to issuing  emergency temporary standards to respond relatively quickly to urgent  workplace hazards.

OSHA officials said the agency considers  NIOSH\u2019s input on an ad hoc basis but OSHA staff do not routinely  work closely with NIOSH staff to analyze risks of occupational  hazards. They stated that collaborating with NIOSH on risk  assessments, and generally in a more systematic way, could reduce   the time it takes to develop a standard by several months, thus  facilitating OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process.", "Expand use of voluntary consensus standards: According to OSHA  officials, many OSHA standards incorporate or reference outdated  consensus standards, which could leave workers exposed to hazards  that are insufficiently addressed by OSHA standards that are based  on out-of-date technology or processes. Experts suggested that  Congress pass new legislation that would allow OSHA, through a  single rulemaking effort, to revise standards for a group of health  hazards using current industry voluntary consensus standards,  eliminating the requirement for the agency to follow the standard- setting provisions of section 6(b) of the OSH Act or the APA. One  potential disadvantage of this proposal is that any abbreviation to the  regulatory process could also result in standards that fail to reflect  relevant stakeholder concerns, such as an imposition of unnecessarily  burdensome requirements on employers.", "Impose statutory deadlines: OSHA officials indicated that it can be  difficult to prioritize standards due to the agency\u2019s numerous and  sometimes competing goals. In the past, having a statutory deadline,  combined with relief from procedural requirements, resulted in OSHA  issuing standards more quickly. However, some legal scholars have  noted that curtailing the current rulemaking process required by the  APA may result in fewer opportunities for public input and possibly  decrease the quality of the standard.  Also, officials from MSHA told  us that, while statutory deadlines make its priorities clear, this is  sometimes to the detriment of other issues that must be set aside in  the meantime.", "Change the standard of judicial review: Experts and agency officials  suggested OSHA\u2019s substantial evidence standard of judicial review be  replaced with the arbitrary and capricious standard, which would be  more consistent with other federal regulatory agencies. The  Administrative Conference of the United States has recommended  that Congress amend laws that mandate use of the substantial  evidence standard, in part because it can be unnecessarily  burdensome for agencies. As a result, changing the standard of  review to \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d could reduce the agency\u2019s  evidentiary burden. However, if Congress has concerns about  OSHA\u2019s current regulatory power, it may prefer to keep the current  standard of review.", "Allow alternatives for supporting feasibility: Experts suggested that  OSHA minimize on-site visits\u2014a time-consuming requirement for  analyzing the technological and economic feasibility of new or  updated standards\u2014by using surveys or basing its analyses on  industry best practices. One limitation to surveying worksites is that,  according to OSHA officials, in-person site visits are imperative for  gathering sufficient data in support of most health standards. Basing  feasibility analyses on industry best practices would require a  statutory change, as one expert noted, and would still require OSHA  to determine feasibility on an industry-by-industry basis.", "Adopt a priority-setting process: Experts suggested that OSHA  develop a priority-setting process for addressing hazards, and as  GAO has reported, such a process could lead to improved program  results. OSHA attempted such a process in the past, which allowed  the agency to articulate its highest priorities for addressing  occupational hazards. Reestablishing such a process may improve a  sense of transparency among stakeholders and facilitate OSHA  management\u2019s ability to plan its staffing and budgetary needs.  However, it may not immediately address OSHA\u2019s challenges in  expeditiously setting standards because such a process could take  time and would require commitment from agency management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["The process for developing new and updated safety and health standards  for occupational hazards is a lengthy one and can result in periods when  there are insufficient protections for workers. Nevertheless, any  streamlining of the current process must guarantee sufficient stakeholder  input to ensure that the quality of standards does not suffer. Additional  procedural requirements established since 1980 by Congress and various  executive orders have increased opportunities for stakeholder input in the  regulatory process and required agencies to evaluate and explain the  need for regulations, but they have also resulted in a more protracted  rulemaking process for OSHA and other regulatory agencies. Ideas for  changes to the regulatory process must weigh the benefits of addressing  hazards more quickly against a potential increase in the regulatory  burden imposed on the regulated community. Most methods for  streamlining that have been suggested by experts and agency officials  are largely outside of OSHA\u2019s authority because many procedural  requirements are established by federal statute or executive order.  However, OSHA can coordinate more routinely with NIOSH on risk  assessments and other analyses required to support the need for  standards, saving OSHA time and expense. In our report being released  today, we recommend that OSHA and NIOSH more consistently  collaborate on researching occupational hazards so that OSHA can more  effectively leverage NIOSH expertise in its standard-setting process.
