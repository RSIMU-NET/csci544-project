The primary role of the enterprises is to ensure that mortgage funds are available to home buyers in all regions of the country at all times. Congress has asked us to study the desirability and feasibility of repealing the federal charters of the enterprises, eliminating any federal sponsorship of the enterprises, and allowing the enterprises to continue to operate as fully private entities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises help ensure that mortgage funds are available to home buyers by buying mortgages from mortgage originators, such as savings and loans (thrifts), commercial banks, and mortgage bankers. The enterprises hold some of these mortgages in portfolio as direct investment on their own books and issue debt and equity securities to finance these holdings.", "Most mortgages that the enterprises buy from mortgage originators are \u201csecuritized\u201d\u2014that is, the enterprises package them into mortgage pools to support mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These mortgage pools receive the interest and principal payments from the mortgages in the pools and pass them on to the investors who purchased the MBS.", "The enterprises guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest payments from the mortgages in the pools to the investors and administer the payments. In September 1995, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac either owned in portfolio or guaranteed about $1.3 trillion of the $3.9 trillion of outstanding residential mortgages in the United States.", "The enterprises are government-sponsored in that they operate under federal charters that convey certain benefits, impose certain restrictions, and permit the enterprises to earn a profit while serving public policy purposes, such as providing liquidity to mortgage markets. In 1992, Congress expanded the enterprises\u2019 public purpose by requiring annual goals that are to be set, monitored, and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the purchase of mortgages on housing purchased by very low-, low-, and moderate-income and other households that are underserved by the residential mortgage market. The enterprises\u2019 charters exempt them from certain fees and taxes paid by other private sector firms. At the same time, the charters restrict the enterprises to buying mortgages that do not exceed a set dollar amount, known as the conforming loan limit.", "A major factor that enhances the enterprises\u2019 profitability is the financial market\u2019s perception that there exists an implied federal guarantee of their debt and other obligations (i.e., a perception that the federal government would act to ensure that the enterprises will always be able to meet their financial obligations on their debt and MBS guarantees). Investors perceive that this implied guarantee decreases the risk that the enterprises will ever fail to meet their financial responsibilities. Consequently, this perception lowers the enterprises\u2019 borrowing costs because investors are willing to accept lower expected returns on enterprise debt than they would for private firms without government ties. Likewise, funding costs on MBS are also lowered by this perception. Their lower funding costs allow the enterprises to increase their purchases and give them a cost advantage over competitors. This perception of a federal guarantee remains even though the laws chartering the enterprises contain explicit language stating that there is no such guarantee.", "The perception of the implied guarantee is based on special federal ties to the enterprises, including government-sponsored status, each enterprise\u2019s $2.25 billion conditional line of credit with the Treasury Department, and a belief that the federal government would consider such large institutions too big to fail.", "The federal charter also provides several explicit provisions that lower operating costs for the enterprises. For example, certain fees paid by other corporations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are not levied against the enterprises since the enterprises do not need to register their issuances with the SEC. They are also exempt from state and local income taxes. In addition, they can use the Federal Reserve\u2019s electronic payments system for transactions. These privileges, plus each enterprise\u2019s $2.25 billion conditional line of credit with the Treasury, reinforce the market\u2019s perception that the government will not let the enterprises fail. Given the lower funding costs created by this perception and the lower operating costs created by certain privileges and exemptions, the enterprises have cost advantages over any potential direct competitor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mortgages Are Funded by Primary and Secondary Markets", "paragraphs": ["The mortgage market is made up of primary and secondary parts; and many institutions serve several roles within the overall market, as shown in tables 1.1 and 1.2. Consequently, institutions sell to, buy from, and compete with each other. As shown in table 1.2, the enterprises function as conduits and guaranteeing agencies in the secondary mortgage market.", "In the primary market, the home buyer applies to an originator for a mortgage. The originator can be a depository, such as a bank or thrift, or a mortgage banker. Traditionally, depositories originated mortgages and held them as direct investments in portfolio on their books. Their profits from holding mortgages were the difference between interest earned from the mortgages and their costs of funds, primarily interest paid to depositors after adjusting for other expenses.", "Mortgage bankers originate mortgages for immediate resale in the secondary market. They earn profits primarily from two sources. The first source is fees charged to originate mortgages and profits from the sale of mortgages (losses can also result from such sales). The second source is fees investors pay to mortgage bankers for \u201cservicing\u201d mortgages\u2014collecting and processing mortgage payments. In recent years many depositories have also acted like mortgage bankers in that they originate mortgages and sell them to investors rather than hold them on their books.", "Mortgage insurers improve the liquidity of the market by compensating investors for losses caused by mortgage defaults\u2014losses created when the net sales price of the house after foreclosure does not cover the outstanding balance on the mortgage. This compensation reduces risks and makes the market more liquid. FHA and VA are the primary federal government insurers. The private mortgage insurance companies provide insurance for conventional mortgages\u2014that is, mortgages not backed by the federal government.", "The secondary mortgage market channels mortgages from originators to investors. The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the enterprises and other private companies, acting as conduits, create mortgage pools and MBS that are sold to investors. From a pool of mortgages, the MBS investors receive their proportional shares of interest and principal flows.", "Private-label MBS are created by fully private (nongovernment-sponsored) conduits. As of September 1995, private-label MBS totalled about 13 percent of outstanding MBS. The mortgages that these private conduits securitize either exceed the enterprises\u2019 conforming loan limit\u2014$207,000 on one-unit, single-family properties\u2014or do not meet the enterprises\u2019 underwriting standards. A loan whose underwriting standards do not meet the standards of either enterprise or exceeds the conforming loan limit is called a nonconforming loan. A loan that exceeds the conforming loan limit is called a jumbo loan.", "Guarantees on MBS enhance the liquidity of the secondary market. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest for mortgage pools of FHA and VA insured mortgages for a fee. The enterprises and private-label conduits guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on conventional mortgages in pools backing their MBS. The guarantees are an enhancement that reduces the risk that any given mortgage will not be paid on a timely basis.", "Private-label conduits generally use risk-based guarantee fees, which are based on the expected incremental cost of guaranteeing a particular level of credit risk exposure for the investor. For example, the conduits charge lower fees on mortgages with large down payments (i.e., mortgages with low loan-to-value ratios) than on loans with small down payments. The enterprises said that their mortgage commitment policies move them partially, but not fully, toward a risk-based fee structure.", "Private-label conduits may enhance the liquidity of their MBS with other credit enhancements. Private mortgage insurance is a common form of credit enhancement to reduce risk. Another common private label credit enhancement is over-collateralization. This means that the principal amount of the mortgages backing the MBS exceeds the dollar amount of the MBS shares sold to investors. Other forms of credit enhancement for the private-label MBS include bank letters of credit, corporate guarantees,and private insurance of mortgage pools.", "The cash flows to investors generated by interest and principal payments from any pool may vary over time. As interest rates fall, households tend to prepay principal more quickly, which is called prepayment risk. As interest rates increase, prepayments tend to slow down and cash flows to investors decline, since homeowners are refinancing or selling their houses more slowly. This tendency is called extension risk."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiclass Securities Have Improved Liquidity of the Secondary Mortgage Market", "paragraphs": ["To address the need for more predictable cash flows, the enterprises and private-label conduits issue multiclass mortgage securities called collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs). These multiclass securities can help investors better manage prepayment and extension risks by creating from the same mortgage pool several securities that receive different parts of the pool\u2019s interest and principal payments.", "Investors more concerned about variations in cash flows over time can buy the classes that pay off more quickly or have a fixed payment period. Investors more willing to undertake prepayment and extension risks can buy classes with payments that vary with interest rates. The expected return on classes with prepayment and extension risks exceeds the expected return on classes without such risk. Multiclass securities can also redistribute credit risk so that one class can be designed to absorb all or much of the credit risk in return for a higher expected return. Because multiclass securities bring new investors who wish to avoid unpredictable cash flows into the market, they improve the market\u2019s liquidity and help ensure continuing funding for home mortgages. The new investors that multiclass securities have attracted include banks, thrifts, pension funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions as well as individuals who originate, buy, hold, or sell whole mortgages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than 45 Percent of All Residential Mortgage Debt in September 1995 Was Securitized and Held in MBS", "paragraphs": ["Tables 1.3 and 1.4 show the different sectors of the housing finance system.

In September 1995, banks held about 33 percent of whole mortgages and savings and loans held about 26 percent of all whole mortgages.

The government\u2019s response concentrated on the savings and loan industry, which was then the backbone of the housing finance system. Congress created a thrift regulator to ensure the safety and soundness of the thrift industry; to bolster consumer confidence and keep deposits flowing into the thrifts, it created a deposit insurance system. In addition, Congress created the Federal Home Loan Banks, which borrowed in capital markets and made loans to thrifts so that they could continue to fund and originate mortgages. To further support housing, Congress created FHA, which insured mortgages originated by private financial institutions and reduced credit risk for investors.", "Congress also authorized the establishment of private mortgage associations to create a secondary market for mortgages. Because private mortgage associations did not develop, Congress chartered Fannie Mae in 1938 as a government-held association to buy and hold mortgages insured by FHA. Later it was authorized to purchase VA-insured mortgages. In its early years, Fannie Mae was part of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and subject to the regulation of the Federal Housing Administration. Modifications in Fannie Mae\u2019s structure occurred during the post-War period without changing its fundamental mission.", "In the early post-World War II period, Congress articulated Fannie Mae\u2019s purposes as providing liquidity and special assistance for selected housing types, supporting the mortgage market, and stabilizing the economy.", "Fannie Mae\u2019s mortgage purchases increased substantially during most of the 1950s. During the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, Fannie Mae sold mortgages when other sources of credit were readily available or purchased mortgages when credit was tight. After 1968, Fannie Mae\u2019s, and later Freddie Mac\u2019s, portfolios grew."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Volatile Interest Rates and Increasing House Prices Affected the Housing Mortgage Markets", "paragraphs": ["In the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Congress split Fannie Mae into two components. One component, Ginnie Mae, remained in HUD to provide support to FHA, VA, and special assistance programs. The other component was the government-sponsored, privately owned, for-profit Federal National Mortgage Association, which was to be concerned exclusively with attracting funding into residential mortgages. Thus, the newly private, yet government-sponsored, Fannie Mae continued to provide a secondary residential mortgage market and was governed by a board of directors dominated by its private sector owners with a minority of its members (5 of 18) appointed by the president. Fannie Mae was regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in terms of capital requirements and approval of new mortgage acquisition programs.", "Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae operated differently. Ginnie Mae did not purchase mortgages. Instead, it \u201cguaranteed the timely payment of principal and interest\u201d from pools of FHA- and VA-insured mortgages originated by mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. In contrast, Fannie Mae operated as a large portfolio investor. It bought mortgages from originators and financed these investments by selling debt and equity in the financial markets.", "Congress permitted Fannie Mae to develop a secondary market for conventional loans to counter periodic scarcities of mortgage credit in different regions of the country during different parts of the business cycle. Consequently, Fannie Mae helped counter a scarcity of mortgage credit during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when interest rates paid by thrifts and other depository institutions were capped\u2014sometimes below market levels. In response to these below-market rates, depositors withdrew funds and looked for higher returns elsewhere. As funds were withdrawn, thrifts were unable to originate or fund mortgages. At the same time, other originators such as mortgage bankers were able to originate mortgages at market rates and sell them to Fannie Mae. Since Fannie Mae did not have an interest rate cap, it could raise funds at market rates and thus continue to purchase mortgages at current market rates from all originators.", "Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 in reaction to the loss of deposits in the savings and loan industry that was curtailing that industry\u2019s ability to fund and originate home mortgages. Its creation ensured that the savings and loan industry had access to funds to continue to fund mortgages. Freddie Mac was first owned by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulated savings and loans, helped fund their operations through the Federal Home Loan Banks, provided deposit insurance to the thrifts through the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and liquidated insolvent thrifts. Freddie Mac mostly securitized the mortgages that it purchased and guaranteed timely interest and principal payments from the resulting mortgage pools.", "Originally, the enterprises and FHA had identical conforming loan limits for mortgages they could purchase or guarantee. In 1974, Congress raised the conforming loan limit for both enterprises above FHA\u2019s limit. Consequently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could buy an increasing share of mortgages that were not provided by, or guaranteed by, the federal government.", "In 1981, Congress created a formula for adjusting the conforming loan limit to account for the effects of inflation on house values. A three-tiered secondary mortgage market evolved in the late 1980s. Ginnie Mae primarily served a tier of lower value FHA and VA mortgages. The enterprises primarily served a middle tier of larger mortgages. The private-label conduits served a tier of jumbo\u2014loans with principal amounts that exceeded the conforming limit\u2014and other conventional, nonconforming mortgages.", "In the early 1980s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac experienced different financial results as short-term interest rates increased. Fannie Mae held mortgages in portfolio and funded them with short-term debt. As rates increased, Fannie Mae had to issue new short-term debt at higher rates to replace existing short-term debt that came due. Because interest earned on the old mortgages in portfolio was less than interest expenses on the newly issued debt, Fannie Mae experienced total losses of about $277 million between 1981 and 1984. In response to Fannie Mae\u2019s financial problems, the federal government provided limited tax relief and regulatory forbearance in the form of relaxed capital requirements.", "Unlike Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac held few mortgages in portfolio and issued little debt to fund mortgage holdings. Rather, it created MBS and sold them to investors. Consequently the investors and not Freddie Mac bore the risks of changing interest rates. To avoid future losses from interest rate changes, Fannie Mae partially adopted Freddie Mac\u2019s strategy of issuing MBS and passing interest rate risk to investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mortgage Bankers and the Enterprises Gained Importance in Mortgage Markets as Many Thrifts Failed", "paragraphs": ["The unexpected increase in interest rates in 1979 through 1981 that created problems for Fannie Mae also contributed to the failure of many thrifts in the 1980s. As interest rates rose, many thrifts became unprofitable, and some thrifts hoping to regain profitability undertook risky investments as their losses grew. In many of these cases, such actions accelerated and increased losses to the thrift deposit insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). At the same time, FSLIC did not have the resources to close all insolvent thrifts. As the weakened thrifts deteriorated further, closure costs continued to increase.", "In 1989, Congress abolished the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and dispersed its functions to other agencies. The Office of Thrift Supervision became the regulator of federally chartered savings and loans. Freddie Mac became a government-sponsored enterprise owned by private investors. Deposit insurance for thrifts went to the Savings Association Insurance Fund under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was created to close and liquidate insolvent thrifts that were still open when RTC was created.", "As thrifts failed and the thrift industry\u2019s originations and holdings of mortgages decreased, mortgage bankers originated more mortgages and mortgage conduits increased their issuance of MBS. As shown in figure 1.1, the importance of mortgage bankers as originators increased as that of thrifts decreased. In 1982, thrifts originated 35.9 percent of all mortgages on 1-4 family units (commonly called single-family units); however, their share had dropped by 1994 to 15.9 percent. In 1982, the mortgage bankers originated 28.9 percent of all mortgages for single-family units, and by 1994, their share had increased to 52.8 percent. Mortgage originations were no longer strongly tied to the thrift industry.", "Not only did thrifts become less prominent as originators, they also held less mortgage debt directly in portfolio. As shown in figure 1.2, the conduits and especially the enterprises became an increasingly important mechanism for channeling residential mortgage funds. In 1982, thrifts held in portfolio 36.6 percent of all outstanding mortgages on single-family units (their holdings of MBS were not reported). By 1994, thrifts held directly, in portfolio, only 14.3 percent of outstanding mortgages on single-family units. Much of this shrinkage of direct mortgage holdings was accounted for by the growth of the enterprises\u2019 activities. By 1994, the enterprises held in portfolio 6.7 percent of all mortgages on single-family units, and their MBS represented 29.5 percent of the outstanding single-family unit mortgages.

The perceived federal guarantee lowers the enterprises\u2019 funding costs in two primary ways. First, it decreases perceived risk for investors in the enterprises\u2019 debt and MBS; this lowers the funding costs that the enterprises must pay. Consequently, the enterprises pay interest rates on their debt that are above the rates that the Treasury pays and below the rates paid by highly rated financial corporations on similar debt.", "The second way that the perceived federal guarantee lowers the enterprises\u2019 funding costs is that it decreases the extent to which the enterprises must fund themselves with relatively more expensive equity capital\u2014the difference between assets and liabilities. Equity serves as a financial cushion that can absorb financial losses in bad years. Investors in a corporation\u2019s debt require this cushion because it can help ensure the continued operation of the company when downturns occur. The amount of equity a firm needs to maintain a high debt rating depends on financial risk; if risk is relatively high, equity must be correspondingly high. Because the perceived federal guarantee lowers investors\u2019 perceived financial risk, the enterprises are able to hold less equity and fund more of their operations through issuing debt securities, compared to potential private competitors.", "A further advantage of government sponsorship is that bond rating agencies and bank regulators consider the enterprises issuers of low-risk debt on the basis of their perceived government ties.

These investors include banks, insurance companies, and other regulated institutions, which provide a ready and consistent outlet for enterprise debt and MBS.", "The last funding advantage is that most investors realize that the very size of the enterprise ensures a ready market for reselling enterprise debt securities and MBS. Government sponsorship does not in itself guarantee large size. However, the combination of a multibillion-dollar mortgage market, the financial cost advantage arising from the perception of government backing, and the fact that only two organizations have been granted these advantages contribute to the enterprises\u2019 size. This marketability or liquidity further lowers the enterprises\u2019 funding costs since investors know they can readily resell the securities if they need cash quickly.

On the basis of yield data, they estimated that the enterprises paid on average about 0.37 percent less on noncallable debt and about .63 percent less on callable debt from 1985 to 1994.

For example, the officials said the draft report implied that the benefits are derived by the enterprises rather than homebuyers. Generally, they did not think that it is meaningful to discuss charter-based benefits without discussing their restrictions, obligations, and what is passed thorough to borrowers. Although Fannie Mae officials also said that it is possible to estimate the value of government sponsorship, they said a more appropriate analysis would require a specific identification of who benefits from government sponsorship. Because the Fannie Mae officials believe that homebuyers are the primary beneficiaries of the financial benefits, they said we should have estimated the total value of lower mortgage interest rates to the American public. In addition, Fannie Mae officials said that the enterprises do not pay MBS yields; rather, they only guarantee the timely payment of MBS principal and interest in exchange for a guarantee fee. Therefore, the officials said Fannie Mae does not incur funding costs on MBS, so it would not incur additional costs of 5 to 35 basis points in the event of privatization.", "Freddie Mac officials also said that our estimates of the benefits associated with government sponsorship are high and that any financial benefits flow to homebuyers in the form of lower mortgage interest rates.

In addition, the Freddie Mac officials said that privatization would not eliminate the perception of the federal government\u2019s implied guarantee to support the housing finance system.

However, the officials said that a similar analysis performed for the years 1985 to 1994 would have shown no difference in returns between enterprise bonds and bonds issued by other borrowers.", "One official said that bond yields interact over time, an econometric problem called serial correlation, and that this invalidates Ambrose and Warga\u2019s estimates.", "Fannie Mae officials commented that the draft report\u2019s discussion of the enterprises\u2019 capital adequacy was misleading. Contrary to a statement in the draft report, they said that the ratio of equity capital to assets is not a good measure of the enterprises\u2019 capital because they are a unique institution that faces risks that are different from depository institutions\u2019 risks.

We have concluded, however, that if the enterprises were fully privatized and the perceived guarantee were reduced or eliminated, their funding costs would increase for both MBS and debt. Although in a strict accounting sense, the enterprises charge guarantee fees for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest, the fees the market is willing to bear depend, in part, on how much higher mortgage interest rates are than the yield investors will accept for investing in MBS. Because of the perception of an implied guarantee, the market is willing to pay higher guarantee fees or accept a lower yield on GSE MBS than on private-label MBS.", "The use of beforetax or aftertax measures of the benefits derived from government sponsorship and therefore of the potential costs of privatization is spelled out in the report. The use of an aftertax measure is consistent with a case in which the enterprises would not be able to pass through any extra costs to homebuyers. Therefore, the use of an aftertax measure appears inconsistent with the enterprises\u2019 view that existing benefits flow through to homebuyers and that eliminating those benefits would harm borrowers. On the issue of whether it is even feasible to eliminate the perception of the implied guarantee, we do not take a position. We assume that privatization would reduce, if not eliminate, investors\u2019 perception, but we acknowledge the possibility that it may not occur and we discuss the implications in chapter 3.", "We did not base our estimates on the Ambrose and Warga study in its entirety. Rather, we relied on selected analyses from the study, after satisfying ourselves that those analyses were methodologically sound and appropriate for our use. For example, we relied on part of the study to calculate our ranges for the funding advantage on debt and MBS. The study is technical; therefore, use of their results required some technical judgments. In their first approach to analyzing interest rate spreads on debt, they make estimates using both yield and rate of return data. In prior written comments on the study (see p. 36), Fannie Mae objected to use of return data, largely because it measures both investor returns that are expected upon purchase and unanticipated changes in the value of the bond. We used the results from the yield rather than the return data, because yields are a better measure of expected returns at the time an investor buys a bond.", "Because bond characteristics differ between bonds issued by the enterprises and other issuers, and bond yields interact with one another over time (serial correlation), disentangling these effects can be difficult. Ambrose and Warga recognized how difficult their task was and qualified their results on the basis of the statistical complexities. We relied on their results for the mean yield spread between enterprise and others\u2019 debt based on their approach using yield data in which they controlled for differences in bond characteristics such as maturity and age. They recognized that interactions between bond yields over time create serial correlation, a criticism cited by Freddie Mac. We recognize this problem but we also recognize that serial correlation affects only the precision of the estimates. The estimated mean yield spreads, which we relied on, are not biased. Because such estimates lack precision, however, we used a wide range for the funding advantage on debt.", "In their second approach, Ambrose and Warga use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach to estimate cost of capital differences. Although we initially employed estimates derived using this approach, we have decided to base our estimates on the more straightforward approach based on yields. In our draft report the upper-range of our estimate for the funding advantage on debt was 120 basis points. We revised this upper-range to 106 basis points. Overall, we do not believe that the statistical estimation problems with the WACC approach or the acknowledged limits of the return-based approach provide sufficient basis to discard the authors\u2019 results that were based on yield data.", "The Ambrose and Warga estimates based on yield data were higher for the 1991 to 1994 period than for the 1985 to 1990 period. In our view, this most likely reflects imprecision associated with such estimates, changes in the funding strategies of the enterprises, and/or changes in financial markets. We believe it reaffirms our position that a wide range of possible outcomes should be associated with privatization.", "Finally, analyzing the capital adequacy of the enterprises is a complicated and largely unanswered question. Our understanding based on past government studies, discussions with financial market analysts, and regulators is that each enterprise would likely require greater capital for its current activities if they were privatized.

In purchasing mortgages, the enterprises may be unable to fully pass their increased funding and other costs to borrowers, since mortgages with other sources of funding would be available to borrowers. The enterprises would also be likely to charge fees more fully risk-based than their current fees; this would cause increases in mortgage interest rates to be greater for borrowers making smaller down payments.

When such market power is exercised, cost savings are less likely to fully flow through to consumers, and businesses can realize higher profits. Such profits can accrue to stockholders, managers, employees, and others who provide goods and services to businesses possessing the market power. In this respect, privatization poses complicated policy questions. The fact that government sponsorship ensures the dominance of two chartered enterprises in the securitization of conventional, conforming mortgages produces some benefits such as greater market liquidity, but it may also produce costs due to lessened competition.", "If the enterprises currently possess and exercise market power, increasing effective competition would tend to cause more of the benefits of government sponsorship to flow through to borrowers. The extent of market power, however, is difficult to determine for a number of reasons. For our purposes, the most important difficulty is defining the relevant product market when alternative distribution systems deliver similar, yet differentiated products. For example, the enterprises state that the share of residential mortgages they have funded\u2014about 30 percent\u2014is too small to convey market power, so the benefits of government sponsorship flow through to borrowers. The study commissioned for this project to analyze the effect of privatization on the mortgage market defined the relevant market for purposes of determining market power as conventional, conforming mortgages securitized in the secondary mortgage market. The resulting duopoly\u2014a market served by two suppliers\u2014and other characteristics of the secondary market (for example, its offering of a fairly standardized product) led them to conclude that the enterprises \u201ctacitly collude\u201d and earn above average profits. They contend that government sponsorship introduces inefficiencies that privatization could eliminate.", "Because of insufficient statistical evidence, we do not know whether a broad or narrow product market definition is appropriate in determining the market power of the enterprises. Therefore, we cannot determine the enterprises\u2019 market power or the potential benefits resulting from increased competition. If, under the current structure, the enterprises are not exercising market power and are passing most of the benefits from government sponsorship on to mortgage borrowers, increased competition may have little effect on mitigating the increase in mortgage interest rates in the conforming loan market that could result from privatization. However, if government sponsorship creates market power for the enterprises, conforming interest rates in the current environment may incorporate to some extent the extra profits resulting from the market power of the enterprises. Under this scenario, any increased competition resulting from privatization could provide the potential benefit of putting downward pressure on conforming mortgage rates.", "The likely increase in average mortgage interest rates is the broadest, most important market effect of privatization. The results of our analysis indicated that privatization could increase interest rates on fixed-rate, single-family housing mortgages below the conforming loan limits within an average range of about 15 to 35 basis points. Assuming that the interest rate increase does not cause a decline in house prices, the monthly payments of a borrower with a $100,000 thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage would increase by $10 to $25. We use a $100,000 thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage to illustrate the increase in monthly payments because the average conventional, conforming loan amount for mortgages purchased by the enterprises is about $100,000. For $2 trillion in outstanding conventional conforming fixed-rate mortgages, the aggregate annual increase in mortgage payments would be in the neighborhood of $3 billion to $7 billion.", "Our estimate of the likely effect of privatization on fixed-rate, single-family mortgage rates is based on a multipart analysis. For a preliminary estimate of how much interest rates might rise with privatization, we first sought to determine the interest rate spread between conforming mortgages (those purchased by the enterprises) and jumbo mortgages (those purchased by private-label conduits). Realizing that the interest rate differential is influenced by some factors specific to government sponsorship (which we assumed would be eliminated through privatization) and some that are not, we sought to adjust the estimated spread, accounting for specific factors unrelated to the enterprises\u2019 government sponsorship. The results of this work indicated that it would be reasonable to estimate that the conforming jumbo interest rate spread would be about 20 to 40 basis points. We next considered the need for one upward adjustment to account for the possibility of reduced liquidity and three downward adjustments. The three downward adjustments we considered were to account for (1) the geographic concentration of existing jumbo mortgages, which currently increases credit risk; (2) the possibility that the volatility of loan collateral for jumbo mortgages may exceed that of conforming mortgages; and (3) the likelihood of increased competition and operational efficiencies in the conforming and jumbo markets that could result from privatization.

The general consensus was that if a pool of jumbo mortgages that was geographically diversified could be backed by collateral equal to 103 percent of the security issue, a jumbo mortgage pool with similar characteristics but without such geographic diversification would require 106 to 108 percent collateral.

First, we analyzed regional interest rate differentials (the difference between the highest and the lowest regional mortgage interest rate) based on data for the years 1980 through 1993 that Freddie Mac officials provided from their Primary Mortgage Market Survey. It is important to note that credit risk variables excluded from the data can create part of the interest rate differentials. The regional interest rate differential declined from 100 basis points in 1980 to less than 20 basis points since 1988. This showed that interest rate disparities had lessened substantially over time. However, the data did not show that the reduction in regional interest rate disparities was due only to greater secondary market activity, because other variables could have influenced regional mortgage interest rates. Nonetheless, Freddie Mac officials attributed this decline to the growth of secondary mortgage markets created by the enterprises.", "Evidence presented in a study by Jud and Epley using statistics for the years 1984 through 1987 indicated that after adjustments for loan characteristic factors that affect interest rate differentials, no significant regional differences remained in mortgage interest rates. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the substantial development of the secondary market, facilitated by government sponsorship, helped eliminate the regional interest rate disparities that had existed before 1984. The result that significant regional disparities were all but eliminated even when the enterprises were much smaller than they currently are is also consistent with the idea that the elimination of this disparity did not require the enterprises to be as large as they are today.

In addition, the potential increase in secondary market competition would reinforce this change in business behavior.

Additionally, the Fannie Mae official stated that there were substantial flaws in the Hermalin and Jaffee paper which contended that the enterprises tacitly collude. For example, he said the authors reviewed data only from 1989 to 1993 when an analysis of 1985 to 1995 would have produced contrary results. The Fannie Mae official also said that Hermalin and Jaffee ignored evidence that shows, on a monthly basis, that the market share data of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are quite volatile. He cited this as evidence that the enterprises do not engage in tacit collusion.", "Freddie Mac officials stated that there is no evidence of a lack of competition in the mortgage markets. They said there is no basis for excluding all firms that buy and sell mortgages from the definition of the relevant market. Further, the Freddie Mac officials stated that the guarantee fees the enterprises charge for securitization services have declined since the early 1980s. They said that declining fees are inconsistent with arguments that the enterprises exercise market power. The Freddie Mac officials also reemphasized comments they made on the chapter 2 draft that the financial benefits of government sponsorship flow to homebuyers in the form of lower interest rates and are not retained by the enterprises.", "Fannie Mae officials also disagreed with an assertion in the draft report that privatization would not result in significant regional variations in mortgage interest rates. The officials said the report acknowledged that privatization would result in risk-based pricing: for example, homebuyers making relatively low down payments would pay higher mortgage rates and fees. The Fannie Mae officials said they could not understand why the draft report did not seem to consider the possibility that with privatization, specific regions of the country experiencing economic downturns would also experience relatively higher mortgage costs. The Fannie Mae officials said that this \u201crisk premium\u201d would probably become permanent in regions of the country that are perceived to have volatile home prices. The officials said this contrasts sharply with the current conforming mortgage market where lenders nationwide can get the same posted cash price for loans and homebuyers nationwide have access to the same rates.", "Freddie Mac officials also said that privatization would result in significant regional variations in mortgage interest rates. For example, they said that the regional variations observed in today\u2019s jumbo mortgage market would likely be replicated in the larger mortgage market. Freddie Mac officials also said that evidence from regions of the country that have suffered economic downturns in recent years, such as New England, indicate that lenders and borrowers in these areas experience disparities in the cost and availability of credit.", "Fannie Mae officials also said the draft report ignored substantial evidence that the enterprises currently provide a substantial \u201ccushion\u201d to the housing markets regions of the country experiencing economic downturns. For example, the officials said that the enterprises\u2019 market share increased in such regions during economic downturns. The officials also found that there was a significant negative correlation between changes in the housing price index and Fannie Mae\u2019s market share in California and New England between 1984 and 1994. In other words, when housing prices declined in these areas, Fannie Mae\u2019s market share tended to increase, which officials said demonstrates the regional cushion.", "Freddie Mac officials disputed the draft report\u2019s analysis of correlated annual data for 1980 to 1994, by state, on Fannie Mae\u2019s market share and a house price index; this analysis found \u201cno evidence\u201d that Fannie Mae provided a regional cushion. The officials said that including early 1980s data ignores substantial changes in the secondary market that occurred during those years. The officials said that the data for the early 1980s is skewed because the enterprises dramatically increased their mortgage purchase volume during those years, particularly as a result of the introduction of the Guarantor and Swap program in 1981 and CMOs in 1983.", "The officials said that changing the beginning of the sample period from 1980 into 1985 changes the results. The officials stated that such an adjustment showed, for example, a strong negative correlation between declining house prices and Freddie Mac\u2019s market share in three states that experienced substantial economic downturns: California, New York, and Texas.", "In addition, Freddie Mac officials said that the expected increase in adjustable-rate mortgages at the expense of fixed-rate mortgages would result in more mortgage foreclosures. The Freddie Mac officials provided data on Freddie Mac purchased mortgages that show the foreclosure rate on adjustable-rate mortgages between 1990 and 1995 was at least twice the foreclosure rate on fixed-rate mortgages, even though adjustable-rate mortgages have higher down payment requirements.", "We explained how important the enterprises are to the housing markets and we analyze the connection between the benefits conferred on that market through the enterprises and benefits received by households. We do not, however, believe that we can state how much of the benefits generated flow to households. Nor can we say exactly how privatization would affect the housing market.", "Even so, we made a change to our draft report to address the enterprises\u2019 concerns that we did not provide an overall measure of the effects of lower interest rates on the mortgage market as a whole. Using an estimate provided by Freddie Mac for the outstanding value of conforming, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, we calculated the total benefit as ranging from $3 billion to $7 billion. We also clarified how we derived the spread between jumbo and conforming fixed-rate mortgages. We also added more precise language to indicate that we would not expect significant regional variations in mortgage costs across regions on mortgages with similar risk characteristics.", "We have included information provided by a Fannie Mae official on temporary disruptions in liquidity in the jumbo market. The official did not know how serious these disruptions were. We continue to conclude that the share of conventional mortgages that would be securitized with privatization would likely exceed the current share of jumbo mortgages securitized, and such a development would contribute to a higher level of liquidity in the conventional market with privatization than exists now in the jumbo market.", "Our discussion indicates that we placed more emphasis on studies such as the commissioned one by Cotterman and Pearce that use individual loan level data and control for loan characteristics than we did on other data sources reporting the interest rate spread between jumbo and conforming mortgages. Officials from neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac criticized the Cotterman and Pearce study. Freddie Mac estimated the spread using a data source different from the one they had originally used and provided to us when we met in the course of this assignment. Both data sources are based on telephone surveys of lenders. We cannot determine why the spreads they now report are larger than those they reported previously, but we continue to rely primarily on the studies by Cotterman and Pearce and the other two studies employing similar methodology. Freddie Mac officials adjusted this spread upward by 25 basis points, on the basis of their estimate of the effect on rates of an increase in the use of subordinated securities used to finance many private mortgage pools. We did not make such an adjustment because, in our view, it is likely that interest rate spreads between jumbo and conforming mortgages already reflect the impact of subordinated securities on jumbo mortgages. Finally, we do not see how the commercial mortgage market, a market in which loan underwriting decisions and standardization are very different from the single-family residential mortgage market, provides reliable information on the level of liquidity that could result from privatization of the enterprises.", "Our draft report did not take a position on whether the enterprises do or do not have market power, because we could not, from our analysis of the data, make such a determination. While the enterprises would like us to conclude that they do not exercise market power, we continue to conclude that there is insufficient statistical evidence to reach such a conclusion. Both enterprises emphasize that they compete vigorously both with each other and with depository institutions. We think this evidence is insufficient to conclude an absence of market power, because depository institutions fund a higher share of variable-rate mortgages while the enterprises fund relatively more fixed-rate mortgages. These products have differing characteristics, and their competitive impacts on one another depend on how highly substitutable they are to borrowers.", "Both enterprises also criticize the commissioned study by Hermalin and Jaffee, stating that the study does not consider how monthly shares of secondary market purchases fluctuate between the enterprises. Hermalin and Jaffee attributed the stability of annual shares to their finding that the enterprises are tacitly colluding duopolists in the (narrowly defined) secondary mortgage market for conforming loans. In competitive markets the process of rewarding the relative efficiency of one or more sellers tends to create instable market shares measured over long periods of time. The evidence the enterprises presented showing market shares that fluctuated was based on monthly data and we believe it could just reflect random or seasonal fluctuations in mortgage originations that affect each enterprise differently (e.g., because the regional distribution of their mortgages differ). Finally, Freddie Mac officials argued that the general decline in guarantee fees by both enterprises since 1985 indicates a competitive market where all of the benefits to the enterprises flow through to borrowers. The data provided by Freddie Mac show that fees have declined, but they do not show whether they are high or low compared with a competitive market. The competitive process the enterprises have described was largely in place in the 1980s, when fees were higher. Thus, the decline in fees reflects either cost changes or an increase in competition or potential competition. The private-label conduits, in their infancy in the middle 1980s, may have provided a source of potential competition. CBO emphasized the possible impact of potential competition on the enterprises when it stated: \u201cSome empirical evidence suggests that the GSEs may not have priced their services at fully competitive levels in the 1980s.\u201d Even if there were evidence of some increased competition from private-label conduits or other sources, we still do not know whether the market is competitive enough to cause all or a large part of the benefits from government sponsorship to flow through to households with mortgages.", "After considering the enterprises\u2019 comments, we clarified our discussion to indicate that we do not think privatization would lead to significant regional disparities in mortgage interest rates that were not based on risk differences. However, we did not change our overall conclusion that privatization is not likely to significantly reduce capital mobility across regions. We analyzed year-to-year correlations between Fannie Mae\u2019s share of originations and their housing price index in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, California, and Alaska, and in the New England region. A negative correlation indicates that Fannie Mae could be providing a cushion in declining markets. When we did the analysis using data for the 1984 to 1994 period, as suggested by enterprise officials, we found negative correlations in Texas and Oklahoma and positive correlations in the remaining areas. We also reanalyzed the data for the 1984 to 1994 period by estimating correlations between changes in Fannie Mae\u2019s share and changes in the housing price index. In addition to Texas and Oklahoma, the correlation for Colorado was also negative. These results are also consistent with our original conclusion that the evidence is ambiguous.", "Finally, we have no evidence on what effects privatization would have on foreclosure rates.

The effects on targeted groups of eliminating the enterprises\u2019 social goal obligations are uncertain for three primary reasons. First, the effects would depend largely upon whether other federal mechanisms that support housing affordability and homeownership are maintained or expanded after privatization and the impacts of those mechanisms. Second, it is difficult to judge whether and how well the enterprises have achieved their goals, because 1993 was the first year for which the enterprises provided HUD the data necessary to monitor the amount of funding provided to targeted groups under HUD\u2019s interim goals, and the permanent goals HUD has recently promulgated have a new measure of underserved areas. Third, neither we nor the enterprises were able to quantify the impacts of the enterprises\u2019 social goal efforts on housing affordability. Assuming that privatization leads to the elimination of the enterprises\u2019 social goal requirements without any change in other government mechanisms, the likely increase in mortgage interest rates for single-family housing (the broad market effects discussed in chapter 3) would make homeownership less affordable. In particular, the increase in mortgage interest rates could cause a delay in homeownership, primarily for young households with low but rising incomes.

It would involve retaining some social goal regulation of the enterprises because of possible residual advantages they would still have due to the period of government sponsorship. This issue is related to whether the enterprises should pay some sort of exit fee (directly or indirectly in the form of social goal requirements) upon privatization for benefits received during the period of government sponsorship. However, based on our discussions with industry participants and regulators, it seems likely that social goal regulation of the enterprises by HUD would not continue following privatization. As discussed in chapter 5, if Congress decides to privatize, it could be important to convince the markets that links between the enterprises and the government are broken, in order to change investors\u2019 perceptions about any implied guarantee.

One of the five studies commissioned to help assess privatization analyzed the implications of higher mortgage interest rates on housing affordability and homeownership.

If the cost of rental housing were affected by privatization proportionally to the cost of owner-occupied housing, the relative cost of owning versus renting would be unaffected, and most of the estimated impacts on homeownership rates would have disappeared.

In addition, borrowing constraints tend to be greater for households with low current income who have relatively high levels of expected income in the future, because the optimal house that first-time homebuyers purchase is dictated in part by their expected future incomes. The authors found that a majority of the households with low current income had relatively high levels of expected future income. Therefore, it can be expected that one of the primary impacts of privatization on homeownership would be to delay rather than permanently preclude homeownership for the group of households with low current income and relatively high expected future income.", "Even if privatization\u2019s effect on interest rates were only to delay and not preclude homeownership, such a delay could still have social costs.

If so, then attaining homeownership at a younger age by households with relatively low but rising incomes could help promote such social goals.

Fannie Mae officials told us that most of their targeted lending products were more costly than standard mortgage products. For example, in our review of the enterprises\u2019 targeted lending programs, we found that default rates were substantially higher on purchases through those programs. We examined Fannie Mae mortgage default and borrower targeting statistics comparing targeted lending programs and standard business for mortgages purchased in 1994. The difference in the default rates appears to result from the higher loan-to-value ratios and the easing of other underwriting restrictions in the targeted lending programs. This finding is consistent with preliminary analysis at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) indicating that enterprise funded loans with loan to value ratios above 90 percent, in census tracts in which incomes are below metropolitan area median income, and where more than 30 percent of residents are minority group members default more often than other mortgages purchased by the enterprises.

The Fannie Mae official also said that the draft report neglected to mention that increased reliance on other federal programs designed to promote homeownership, such as FHA and VA, will increase the risks of a taxpayer rescue. Fannie Mae officials also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated where appropriate.

For example, he said that Fannie Mae provided tracking data for the years 1993 to 1995 that clearly show the enterprise\u2019s overall share of business serving low- and moderate-income groups has increased consistently. He also said that there are quantifiable measures of the success of Fannie Mae\u2019s efforts to make mortgage financing more affordable for certain targeted groups; for instance, the use of higher debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios means that targeted groups can more easily qualify for mortgages. Moreover, he said there is no reason to expect that the social goals would be retained in any form in the event of privatization. He noted that private sector conduits that perform similar functions as the enterprises are not subject to social goal requirements.", "The Fannie Mae official also disputed the Wachter and Follain finding that privatization would not have a significant effect on mortgage interest rates for multifamily housing. He said that Fannie Mae\u2019s commitment to this market predates the social goals, but its extensive innovation and outreach efforts would likely be curtailed in the event of privatization. He said that this would have genuine effects on capital availability for affordable rental housing development.

For example, he said that many such mortgages that the enterprises purchase are not credited by the HMDA data. He attributed this shortcoming to the fact that only the first mortgage sale is recorded by HMDA, and some mortgage lenders are not covered and this can be a mortgage affiliate or other player that eventually sells the mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.", "The Fannie Mae official also commented that the FHA and VA mortgage programs and other options we listed could not possibly substitute for the dollar volume commitments that the enterprises make each year to purchase low- and moderate-income mortgages. Moreover, he said that relying on these programs further does not necessarily represent good public policy because it would shift potential loss liabilities directly to the federal government and the taxpayers and the options are not viable. He also said that it is highly speculative to assume that Congress would enact CRA-type requirements for the enterprises in the event of privatization.", "Freddie Mac officials also said that potential taxpayer risks would increase with privatization due to increased reliance on the FHA and VA programs, as well as insured depository institutions. Further, they stated that privatization would result in depositories increasing their use of FHLB advances and generating additional taxpayer risks. The Freddie Mac officials also said that renters would likely face higher housing costs in the event of full privatization because the owners of single-family rental properties would pass increased mortgage costs on to their tenants.", "We believe it is still too early to measure the impact of the enterprises\u2019 social goals on the provision of additional housing finance to targeted groups. For that reason, in the report we presented information we obtained during this assignment on the resource commitments the enterprises are making to fund mortgages serving targeted borrowers. In addition to not being able to draw unqualified conclusions about the effects of existing programs, it is even more difficult to predict the effect of privatization largely because we do not have enough information to predict (1) how eliminating the enterprises\u2019 social goal obligations will interact with other federal mechanisms, (2) what requirements HUD would have set in the future without privatization, and (3) the market impact of eliminating social goals on housing affordability. We do not have a basis for knowing whether the limited coverage of HMDA biases estimates of the enterprises\u2019 contributions to funding mortgages to targeted borrowers. The increased reliance on FHA and VA programs resulting from privatization could increase the total risk of these programs, although it could also lower their average level of risk if the enterprises\u2019 expanded efforts are taking away the more, rather than the less, profitable business of these federal insurance programs.

Second, the newly privatized enterprises must have the managerial, capital, and other resources necessary for them to be successful going concerns without preventing entry into the conforming secondary mortgage market by potential competitors. Engineering the restructuring necessary for the transition would require extensive expertise by legal and financial experts. This engineering would also involve trade-offs among competing objectives and create policy challenges. Generally, the larger the new enterprises are, the greater the risks that investors would continue to perceive an implicit federal guarantee, because the enterprises could be considered too big to fail and there would be increased potential cost to taxpayers if the enterprises were rescued by the government; and the enterprises, because of their size and the possible remaining perception of an implicit federal guarantee, would exercise market power in business activities outside of the secondary mortgage market for conventional, conforming residential mortgages.", "One approach would be to make each enterprise a holding company with two subsidiaries\u2014one subsidiary conducting liquidation of old (that is, preprivatization) business and the other, conducting new business. The proposed privatization of the Student Loan Marketing Association (known as Sallie Mae) contains such a structure. Segregation of securities created under government sponsorship and new private entity securities would help sever the perceived implied federal guarantee on post-privatization business, although it could strengthen the tie on old business. If outstanding debt and MBS previously issued by the enterprises as government-sponsored entities were to be segregated, market stability and liquidity are less likely to be jeopardized, because the liquidating subsidiary\u2019s securities would be more likely to keep their current government-sponsored status.", "In addition to this option, the study commissioned by CBO assessed other possible approaches to restructuring. These included creating two separate privatized companies that receive an allocation of resources along with government actions to liquidate the terminating government-sponsored enterprises; and a number of separate privatized companies, which would break up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into smaller operating companies, followed by restructuring to remove government- sponsorship from the successor companies.", "The first of these options may be more likely than the \u201cold company new company\u201d approach to prevent the perception of an implied federal guarantee on new business, because all of the old obligations that were thought to have the implied guarantee would be liquidated. However, liquidating such a large amount of existing debt and MBS could disrupt financial markets. The second option could be the most conducive to insuring competition and to eliminating the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d perception, because there would presumably be a larger number of smaller companies created out of the current enterprises.

First, it could reduce the amount of enterprise activity without greatly limiting the ability of the enterprises to diversify risk and thereby should reduce the potential taxpayer risk in the event of a government bailout. This reduction could be offset somewhat, because some of the activity that currently fits under the conforming label but would not fit under the tighter ceiling may end up in the portfolios of depositories rather than being securitized. To the extent this occurs, there could be an increase in potential taxpayer exposure. For example, depositories taking on more credit risk could raise the risk exposure of the deposit insurance funds. If the depositories are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System that receive additional advances, the potential taxpayer exposure of this system could increase.", "Second, mortgage interest rates for borrowers that would shift from conforming to jumbo mortgage status would probably increase. There is currently an interest rate spread between fixed-rate conforming and jumbo mortgages. The study commissioned by HUD examining this spread predicted that a 10-percent decline in the conforming loan limit would likely lead to an increase in mortgage interest rates on affected mortgages near the lower end of the 25 to 40 basis point range.", "Third, there could be a decline in mortgage interest rates for the remaining jumbo market to the extent that private-label conduits would choose to expand and become better able to geographically diversify their funding.The expected decline in mortgage interest rates would still, however, probably leave jumbo rates above those on conforming mortgages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Minimum Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises are not allowed to purchase mortgages with loan-to-value ratios above 80 percent unless the borrower obtains mortgage insurance.

If Congress legislated higher requirements for mortgage insurance coverage, the enterprises would be exposed to less credit risk. Simply put, when mortgage defaults occurred, more of the burden would fall on private mortgage insurers that have no federal ties and less would fall on the enterprises.

Levying user fees on the value of enterprise debt and MBS issuance could be thought to compensate taxpayers for the possibility that they might be asked someday to come to the rescue of a failing enterprise. User fees could be passed onto borrowers in part or in whole and result in higher interest costs. The net effects would depend on the level of user fees. User fees on the enterprises could help level the playing field between the enterprises and private-label conduits and motivate these conduits to securitize conforming mortgages, because the cost of funds differential would be reduced.", "CBO analyzed the federal revenue consequences of user fees on enterprise debt and MBS.

Annual revenue from a user fee equal to half of the dollar amount of estimated funding cost savings was estimated to be about $700 million. The passing on of part or all of this payment to borrowers would raise mortgage interest rates.", "Determining the correct level of such a fee would be difficult because of problems associated with measuring the value of the funding cost savings resulting from investors\u2019 perception of an implied guarantee. Another difficulty is determining the possible interaction between a user fee and regulatory capital charges.", "OFHEO told us that user fees that are set through legislation are a fairly blunt instrument, while the risk-based capital requirements that OFHEO is developing could be flexible over time. Both user fees and capital requirements increase the cost of capital to the enterprises, which can, in turn, pass on to borrowers some or all of these costs in the form of higher guarantee fees and interest rates. If Congress legislated user fees, OFHEO\u2019s ability to set capital charges to manage enterprise risk taking could be affected, because both actions would increase enterprise costs and could contribute to higher mortgage interest rates. In other words, user fees and capital requirements must be viewed in conjunction with one another to determine cost impacts on the enterprises and residential mortgage borrowers.", "A somewhat different approach to compensating the government for its risk exposure would attempt to make that exposure more symmetrical than it is currently. If the government felt the need to rescue a failing enterprise, clearly it would face \u201cdownside\u201d risk.

One way to make the government\u2019s payoff more symmetrical would be for the government to receive a greater share of income in good times to make up for the possibility it will have to come to the rescue if the enterprises face bad times. The effects of such a payment would depend on how it was structured. For example, if it were simply a surtax on corporate income, it could end up being passed on to borrowers in the mortgage market or be passed back to shareholders.
