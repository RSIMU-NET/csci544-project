For example, states and transit authorities are no longer required to justify goals lower than 10 percent--the amount identified in the statutory DBE provision. Rather, goals are to be based on the number of \"ready, willing, and able\" DBEs in local markets. GAO was unable to determine the characteristics of DBE participants because of a lack of information. Without this information, it is impossible to define the universe of DBEs, compare them with the transportation contracting community as a whole, or gain a clear understanding of the programs impact.

The Surface Transportation  Assistance Act of 1982 contained the first statutory DBE provision for  federal highway and transit programs, requiring that at least 10 percent of  the funds provided be expended with DBEs, unless the Secretary of  Transportation determined otherwise.  From 1983 through 1999, about $35  billion of the federal funds expended through USDOT-assisted highway and  transit contracts went to DBEs.  Congressional debate preceding the  passage in 1998 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA- 21), which reauthorized the DBE program, focused largely on the need for  and impact of the DBE program. USDOT issued new regulations in 1999  that significantly altered the DBE program.  These regulations were  designed to respond to issues raised in the congressional debate and the  Supreme Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena.", "In addition to reauthorizing the DBE program, TEA-21 required that we  review the program\u2019s impact throughout the United States and directed us  to include analyses of specific program-related issues in our review.

Accordingly, this  report provides information on (1) important changes made to the DBE  program since 1999, (2) characteristics of DBEs and non-DBEs that receive  USDOT-assisted highway and transit contracts, (3) evidence of  discrimination and other factors that may limit DBEs\u2019 ability to compete for  USDOT-assisted contracts, and (4) the impact of the DBE program on  costs, competition, and job creation and the impact of discontinuing the  federal and nonfederal DBE programs.", "To address these issues, we conducted a nationwide mail survey in October  2000 of the 52 state departments of transportation (including those of the  District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) and the 36 largest transit  authorities.  We received responses to our survey from all 52 state  departments of transportation (states) and 31 transit authorities, for an  overall response rate of 94 percent.  Our survey instrument and overall  results are included in appendix II and selected survey results are available  at www.gao.gov/special.pubs/dbe.  We also assessed USDOT\u2019s DBE  program data, reviewed court cases addressing the constitutionality of  USDOT\u2019s DBE program since 1995, and analyzed transportation-specific  disparity studies.  This report is not a compliance review and therefore  does not address whether states and transit authorities followed the DBE  program regulations or how USDOT enforced those regulations,  particularly with respect to the certification of DBEs.

The  Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 contained the first statutory  DBE provision for federal highway and transit programs, requiring that a  minimum of 10 percent of the funds provided by the act be expended with  small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically  disadvantaged individuals, unless the Secretary of Transportation  determined otherwise.  Nonminority women were not included as socially  and economically disadvantaged individuals. The Surface Transportation  and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 continued the program and  included nonminority women in the statutory definition of socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals, thereby allowing states to use  contracts with both minority- and women-owned businesses to meet their  DBE goals. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991  and TEA-21 (1998) reauthorized the program, continuing the combined 10- percent provision for participation by minority-owned and nonminority- women-owned DBEs. The percentage of federal funds expended through  USDOT-assisted highway and transit contracts with DBEs increased from  9.9 percent in 1983 to 12.8 percent in 1999.", "TEA-21 and USDOT\u2019s regulations establish the basic eligibility  requirements for participation in the DBE program. The program is limited  to small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically  disadvantaged individuals. Women and members of certain minority  populations, such as African-, Hispanic-, and Native-Americans and other  minorities found to be disadvantaged by the Small Business Administration  (SBA), are presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged unless  proved otherwise. These individuals must own at least 51 percent of  thefirm and actually control its operations. To qualify as a small business, a  firm must have average annual gross receipts over a 3-year period that do not exceed either (1) the applicable SBA small business size standards or  (2) a USDOT-specific cap ($17.4 million). There is no legislative or  administrative requirement limiting the length of time firms can participate  in the program. However, DBEs become ineligible, or \u201cgraduate,\u201d when  their average annual gross receipts over a 3-year period exceed the  applicable SBA small business size standards or the USDOT-specific cap.  According to our survey results, most of the states and transit authorities  did not have any DBEs graduate in 2000. In addition, about one-quarter of  the states and transit authorities we surveyed could not provide this  information. States and transit authorities are not required to track this  information, and graduation is not a goal of the DBE program. Moreover, as  we reported in 1994, because average annual gross receipts do not reliably  indicate DBEs\u2019 success, graduation is not a useful measure of the success  of the program as a whole.", "USDOT administers the DBE program through the Office of the Secretary  and the Department\u2019s operating administrations, including the Federal  Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration  (FHWA). USDOT develops program policies, instructions, and procedures;  reviews and approves states\u2019 and transit authorities\u2019 DBE program plans;  and provides technical assistance, among other things. States and transit  authorities must certify that program applicants meet the eligibility criteria,  reassess annually the eligibility of certified businesses, and establish  overall annual goals for the participation of DBEs in their USDOT-assisted  contracts. DBE participation goals are expressed as a percentage of all  federal highway and transit funds expended on USDOT-assisted contracts  in a fiscal year.", "One of the sources states and transit authorities may use to help set their  overall federal DBE participation goals is data derived from disparity  studies, which measure the availability of minority- and women-owned  businesses compared with their utilization in contracting. States and transit  authorities also use disparity studies to support state and local minority  business contracting programs. The significance of disparity studies as  evidence of discrimination in this context was discussed in a 1989 Supreme  Court decision. In City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., the Court held  that state and local programs that use race or ethnicity as a factor in  apportioning public contracting opportunities are subject to strict  scrutiny. This means that the programs must serve a compelling  governmental interest and be narrowly tailored\u2014that is, designed to be no  broader than necessary\u2014to meet that interest.", "The Court found that combating racial discrimination is a compelling  interest. However, it held that the city had not presented sufficient  evidence of discrimination to justify its minority contracting plan. In  evaluating the city\u2019s evidence, the Court found, among other things, that the  city had inappropriately relied on the disparity between the number of  prime contracts awarded to minority firms and the minority population of  Richmond. It stated that an appropriate disparity evaluation would  compare the percentage of qualified minority contractors with the  percentage of dollars actually awarded to minority businesses. While  courts have favorably cited disparity studies in some cases, many courts  have rejected the studies\u2019 findings, often because of methodological  weaknesses, when considering whether a compelling interest exists for  state or local minority contracting programs. These decisions provide  varying degrees of guidance on the data and methodology that need to be  used in disparity studies to produce reliable evidence of discrimination.", "A 1995 Supreme Court decision had a significant impact on the federal DBE  program, as well as other federal programs that use race or ethnicity as  factors in decision-making. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena involved  FHWA\u2019s use of a subcontracting compensation clause in direct federal  contracting to implement the DBE provision and provisions of the Small  Business Act. Adarand Constructors, a nondisadvantaged contractor,  initiated the litigation in 1990 after it was denied a subcontract on a federal  lands highway project. In 1992, the district court held that the programs at  issue were constitutional, and in 1994 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals  affirmed that decision. In 1995, the Supreme Court set aside the Court of  Appeals\u2019 decision and sent the case back to the lower courts, directing  them to apply the strict scrutiny standard and thus determine whether the  programs were narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental  interest. Applying this standard, the district court held that the  subcontracting compensation clause and related statutory provisions were  unconstitutional in 1997. This decision was the subject of considerable  discussion during the congressional debate over the reauthorization of the  DBE program as part of TEA-21, which was enacted in 1998.", "Responding largely to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1995 decision and congressional  debate over the DBE program, USDOT issued regulations in 1999 to ensure  that the DBE program is narrowly tailored. In addition, the regulations are  designed to ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration of  USDOT-assisted contracts, remove barriers to the participation of DBEs in  such contracts, and provide appropriate flexibility to the recipients of  federal funds in establishing and providing opportunities to DBEs, among  other things. In September 2000, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld  the constitutionality of the current DBE program because it found that the  program served a compelling governmental interest and was narrowly  tailored, largely because of structural changes in the program resulting  from USDOT\u2019s new regulations. Adarand Constructors requested that the  Supreme Court review the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in November 2000. In  March 2001, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDOT\u2019s New Regulations Significantly Changed the DBE Program", "paragraphs": ["USDOT\u2019s 1999 DBE regulations made significant changes to the DBE  program.

In addition, the new  regulations required that states and transit authorities develop bidders lists  and unified certification programs, among other things, to make the DBE  program more streamlined and efficient. However, 72 percent of the states  and transit authorities responding to our survey indicated that the new  regulations have made it more difficult for them to administer the program.

For example, under the prior regulations, states and transit  authorities were required to justify goals lower than 10 percent\u2014the  amount identified in the statutory DBE provision. The regulations  established a direct link between the amount of participation identified in  the statute and the goals set by states and transit authorities. In contrast,  the new regulations require states and transit authorities to base their DBE  participation goals on demonstrable evidence of the number of \u201cready,  willing, and able\u201d DBEs available in local markets relative to the number of  all businesses \u201cready, willing, and able\u201d to participate in USDOT-assisted  contracts in such markets\u2014representing the level of DBE participation  expected in the absence of discrimination.", "The regulations outline a two-step process for goal-setting. First, states and  transit authorities must establish a base figure that represents the \u201cready,  willing, and able\u201d DBEs in the state or transit authority\u2019s market relative to  all \u201cready, willing, and able\u201d firms in that market (i.e., relative availability of  DBEs). To determine the relative availability of DBEs, the new regulations  require that states and transit authorities use the best available data and  suggest that states and transit authorities use DBE directories and Census  Bureau data, bidders lists, disparity studies, or the goal of another  recipient. Second, states and transit authorities must adjust their base  figure to account for other factors affecting DBEs, such as the capacity of  DBEs to perform work in USDOT-assisted contracts and findings from  disparity studies. According to our survey results, the most common  sources used to set states\u2019 and transit authorities\u2019 fiscal year 2000  participation goals were DBE directories, historical utilization patterns,  Census Bureau data, and bidders lists. Under the new goal-setting process,  the average DBE participation goal decreased from 14.6 percent in fiscal  year 1999 to 13.5 percent in fiscal year 2000.", "The new regulations also require that states and transit authorities meet the  maximum feasible portion of their overall DBE goals using race-neutral  measures rather than race-conscious measures.  The prior regulations did  not require the use of race-neutral measures (e.g., outreach and technical  assistance), which are designed to increase contracting opportunities for  all small businesses, and do not involve setting specific goals for the use of  DBEs on individual contracts.  A race-conscious measure is one that is  focused solely on assisting DBEs. An example of a race-conscious measure  is a contract goal\u2014that is, a DBE participation goal set for a specific  contract or project.  While quotas are prohibited and set-asides are allowed  only in the most extreme cases of discrimination, states and transit  authorities must use contract goals to meet any portion of their overall  goals they do not expect to meet using race-neutral measures.  States and  transit authorities must submit their overall DBE participation goals,  including the methodology used to set the goals and the projected use of  race-neutral and race-conscious measures, to USDOT for approval on an  annual basis.  The states and transit authorities we surveyed indicated that,  on average, they used race-neutral measures to achieve slightly over one- third of their overall DBE participation goals in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Eligibility Requirement Focuses on Owners\u2019 Personal Wealth", "paragraphs": ["The new regulations established a personal net worth cap for individuals  whose ownership and control of a business determines DBE eligibility.  According to USDOT, this new eligibility requirement is designed to ensure  that the program is limited to firms owned and controlled by genuinely  disadvantaged individuals. Prior to the new regulations, the absence of a  limit on personal net worth led to criticism that wealthy individuals could  benefit from the program.  Under the new regulations, to qualify as  economically disadvantaged, individuals who own and control DBEs must  have a personal net worth that does not exceed $750,000.  USDOT chose  the $750,000 cap because it is a well-established standard for the SBA\u2019s  programs.  According to our survey results, the number of firms that  exceeded this limit and became ineligible for the DBE program in fiscal  year 2000 ranged from 0 in 14 states and transit authorities to 39 in 1 state.   Twenty-two percent of the states and transit authorities we surveyed  reported that this information was not available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Regulations Include Other Requirements to Improve the DBE Program", "paragraphs": ["The new regulations include other changes designed to improve the  effectiveness and efficiency of the DBE program.  For example, states and  transit authorities are now required to create and maintain a bidders list,  which is a record of all firms that bid on prime and subcontracts for  USDOT-assisted projects.  The list must include each firm\u2019s name, its status  as a DBE or non-DBE, its years in operation, and its annual gross receipts.   The list is intended to count all firms that are participating, or attempting to  participate in USDOT-assisted contracts; however the regulations do not  specify how often the bidders list must be updated, for example, to ensure  that firms no longer available are removed from the list. USDOT believes  that the bidders list is a promising tool for states and transit authorities to  accurately measure the relative availability of \u201cready, willing, and able\u201d  DBEs when setting their DBE goals.  Sixty percent of the states and transit  authorities we surveyed reported that they are in the process of developing  or implementing their bidders lists while 27 percent indicated that their  lists are fully implemented.  Eight percent of the states and transit  authorities reported that they had not yet started developing their bidders  lists.  The remaining 5 percent of the states and transit authorities reported  that their bidders lists were in some other stage of development.", "Another change designed to improve the efficiency of the DBE program is  the requirement that states and transit authorities develop and participate  in a unified certification program (UCP).  A UCP provides \u201cone-stop  shopping\u201d for DBEs because it makes all DBE certification decisions within  a state.  All recipients within a state must honor the certification decisions  of the UCP.  Prior to the new regulations, DBEs often had to obtain  separate certifications from multiple recipients within one state. For  example, in California there were about 60 certifying agencies throughout  the state.  Under the new regulations, DBEs will have to be certified by only  one agency to participate in the DBE programs administered by all  recipients in that state.  By March 2002, the state DOT and all transit  authorities within each state must sign an agreement establishing the UCP  for that state and submit an implementation plan to USDOT for approval.   The UCP must be fully operational no later than 18 months after USDOT  approves the plan.  The majority of the states and transit authorities (72  percent) we surveyed indicated that their UCPs were in some stage of  development or implementation while 7 percent indicated that their UCPs  were fully implemented; 14 percent reported that they had not yet started  to develop their UCPs; and the remaining 6 percent noted that their UCPs  were in some other stage of development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Regulations Make Application to and Administration of the DBE Program More Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Fifty-four percent of the states and transit authorities we surveyed  indicated that the new regulations had made it somewhat or much more  difficult for DBEs to apply to the DBE program.  This view could be  attributable to the requirement for additional documentation that DBEs  must now submit\u2014specifically, documentation of the personal net worth of  the individuals who own and control the firms.  Furthermore, when states  and transit authorities were asked to identify barriers to firms\u2019  participation in the DBE program, the two most common barriers cited  were (1) reluctance to provide personal information and (2) the time  required for certification paperwork.  Despite these problems, most states  and transit authorities (58 percent) indicated that they believe the benefits  to firms participating in the DBE program outweigh any costs.", "In addition, states and transit authorities reported that the new regulations  made it more difficult to administer the program.  For example, 59 of 82  states and transit authorities we surveyed reported that the new  regulations had made it somewhat or much more difficult to administer the  DBE program while 9 states and transit authorities indicated that the new  regulations had made it easier to administer the program.  Fourteen states  and transit authorities reported that there was no change or they had no  basis to judge.  It is not surprising that most states and transit authorities  reported that the new regulations made it more difficult to administer the  DBE program, since the new regulations required that they completely  overhaul their DBE goal-setting process and collect more information from  DBEs and non-DBEs.", "One source of frustration for states and transit authorities appears to be the  process for developing and approving the new DBE program plans. The  new regulations required that states and transit authorities develop and  submit plans for fiscal year 2000 that reflected the requirements and  changes under the new regulations to USDOT by August 31, 1999\u2014about 6  months after the effective date of the new regulations.  During the approval  process, USDOT sometimes sent the DBE plans back to states and transit  authorities multiple times for revisions and clarifications.  One state  noted that even after it had worked closely with USDOT\u2019s local office to  develop its plan, USDOT headquarters twice rejected the plan.  On average,  it took USDOT 8 months to approve the 2000 DBE plans.

For example, a DBE may be certified by Virginia,  Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia. Unlike the SBA\u2019s  Small and Disadvantaged Business program, which gives a unique  identification number to each certified small and disadvantaged business,  the DBE regulations do not require states and transit authorities to assign  unique identifiers to certified DBEs. As a result, a DBE certified with four  states would be listed in four different DBE directories. Because of this  duplication, aggregating the number of certified DBEs listed in states\u2019 and  transit authorities\u2019 DBE directories would significantly overstate the  number of firms certified. While we cannot provide the total number of  certified DBEs nationwide, our survey results indicate that the number of  certified DBEs per state and transit authority varies greatly.

We focused on these sources  because they are directly related to transportation contracting and the  federal DBE program. However, we did not address whether the DBE  program satisfies the requirements of strict scrutiny and is therefore  constitutional. In our review, we found the following:  The courts that have considered the constitutionality of the federal DBE  program under the standard articulated in the Supreme Court\u2019s 1995  decision in the Adarand case have concluded that discrimination  adversely affects DBEs.", "All 14 studies we reviewed found that there were disparities between  the availability and utilization of minority- and women-owned business  enterprises (MBE/WBEs) in transportation contracts.

The courts that have addressed the DBE program under the  standard articulated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Adarand  Constructors, Inc. v.

On the basis of the evidence presented, the court found  that discrimination by prime contractors, unions, and lenders impedes the  formation of qualified minority businesses in the subcontracting market  nationwide. The court also acknowledged the causal link between the  availability of capital and the ability to implement public works  construction projects and found that the studies cited by the government  strongly supported a finding of discrimination in lending. For example, it  cited a survey of 407 business owners in the Denver area that found  significant differences in the loan denial rate for white, African-American,  and Hispanic business owners, even after controlling for other factors like  size and net worth.", "The court also addressed barriers to competition by existing minority  businesses. Citing congressional hearings and statistical evidence, among  other things, the court found that minority businesses are often excluded  by business networks of prime and subcontractors from opportunities to  bid on construction projects. The court also discussed bonding  requirements, finding another barrier to competition. For example, it cited  a Louisiana study finding that minority firms were nearly twice as likely to  be rejected for bonding; three times more likely to be rejected for bonding  in amounts over $1 million; and, on average, charged higher rates for the  same bonding policies than white firms with the same experience.  Similarly, the court accepted evidence of suppliers\u2019 withholding price  discounts from minority subcontractors, thus driving up their bids. In light  of this evidence, the court rejected Adarand Constructors\u2019 argument that  minority businesses face the same problems as all new businesses,  regardless of the race of the owners.", "Finally, the court considered disparity studies conducted by state and local  governments. In doing so, the court accepted the government\u2019s finding,  based on a review of disparity studies, that minority construction  subcontracting firms received 87 cents for every dollar that they would be  expected to receive given their availability. The court also acknowledged  the potential for weaknesses in the data and methodology used in disparity  studies and stated that particular evidence undermining the reliability of  specific studies would be relevant to a determination regarding  discrimination. However, it noted that Adarand Constructors had not  provided it with evidence undermining the studies\u2019 reliability.  Furthermore, the court found that Adarand Constructors had failed to  introduce credible, specific evidence to refute the government\u2019s showing of  a compelling interest.

Numerous  state and local governments have used disparity studies to support their  minority contracting programs and in setting their federal DBE goals. For  example, about 30 percent of the states and transit authorities we surveyed  reported that they used a disparity study to help set their fiscal year 2000  DBE participation goals. However, our review of the 14 disparity studies  found that the limited data used to calculate disparities, compounded by  methodological weaknesses, create uncertainties about the studies\u2019  findings. Rather than discuss the limitations of each study specifically, we  have chosen to discuss some of the more common problems we found.  While not all studies suffered from every problem, each suffered from  enough problems to make its findings questionable. We recognize that  there are difficulties inherent in conducting disparity studies and that such  limitations are common to social science research; however, the disparity  studies we reviewed did not sufficiently address such problems or disclose  their limitations. It is not clear what conclusions a court would draw about  the studies\u2019 findings.", "The studies we reviewed relied on a disparity ratio\u2014that is, a comparison  of the availability of MBE/WBEs to their utilization in contracts\u2014as an  indicator of discrimination. However, the data necessary to properly  calculate such ratios\u2014complete and accurate lists of MBE/WBEs\u2019  availability and utilization\u2014are often lacking. An availability list should  include all qualified, willing, and able firms in the relevant market area,  grouped by industry subspecialties and by MBE/WBE or non-MBE/WBE  status. A utilization list should include all firms in the relevant market area  that were awarded prime and subcontracts, grouped by industry  subspecialty and MBE/WBE or non-MBE/WBE status. Because these data  are often lacking, some proxies (i.e., substitute information) have been  used to calculate disparity ratios.", "To develop proxies of availability, the disparity studies we reviewed used  sources including Census Bureau data, directories or other listings of firms,  prequalification lists, and/or bidders lists. These could be useful data  sources. However, all of these data sources have shortcomings, whether  used separately or in combination, that must be taken into account when  using them as proxies for availability. Such shortcomings would result in  availability lists that could either under- or overstate the number of firms  available for transportation contracting. The limitations of using these data  sources as proxies for availability include the following:  Census Bureau data cannot adequately indicate whether a firm is truly  available, that is, whether it has the qualifications, willingness, or ability  to complete contracts. However, in using Census Bureau data, the  studies depicted all operational firms as available for contracting. Some  studies attempted to account for the qualifications of firms by including  only firms in the relevant two-digit Standard Industry Classification  (SIC) codes in their availability lists. Using a finer degree of distinction  (e.g., classification by the four-digit SIC code level) would help to ensure  that firms are similar enough for comparison. For example, some  studies used the two-digit SIC code for heavy construction, a category  that includes firms as diverse as general contractors for highway  construction and general contractors for radio tower construction.", "Directories and other listings do not contain information on firms\u2019  qualifications, willingness, or abilities. This could result in an  overstatement of how many firms are available for transportation  contracting. In addition, some of the data obtained from directories and  listings were inaccurate. For example, some of the disparity studies we  reviewed indicated that as many as 16 percent of the firms included in  the directories and listings were unreachable because of such problems  as disconnected telephones, wrong telephone numbers, incorrect  addresses, or dissolution of the firms.", "Prequalification and bidders lists may be better sources of availability  than Census Bureau data or directories because they better  approximate firms\u2019 qualifications, willingness, and ability to compete for  contracts. However, the mechanisms used by states and transit  authorities to compile them may limit their reliability. In the studies we  reviewed, we found four problems. First, some studies we reviewed  used bidders and prequalification lists that were updated infrequently or  had no mechanism to ensure that firms no longer available were  removed from the list. For example, one study used a list that never  removed firms, increasing the risk that it contained firms no longer in  business in the relevant market area. Second, some studies we reviewed  used bidders or prequalification lists that were maintained for multiple  city agencies, ranging from school districts to port authorities.  Businesses qualified to perform school district work may not be  qualified to perform port authority work. Third, the lists grouped all  potential firms together, failing to take into account their industry  subspecialty and capacity. Because of these problems, availability lists  based on this information would overstate the number of firms that  were qualified, willing, and able to perform transportation contracts.  Finally, prequalification and bidders lists could under represent capable  firms. Firms may refrain from participating because of perceived or  actual barriers. For example, one study we reviewed surveyed firms and  found that only 22 percent of those firms that expressed an interest in  contracting with the transit agency had actually attempted to obtain  such work in the past.", "The disparity studies we reviewed made few efforts to mitigate the  problems with using these data sources as proxies for availability, nor did  they disclose the limitations of their use. For example, the disparity studies  did not sufficiently account for the lack of information on firms\u2019  qualifications when the availability lists were developed. One aspect of a  firm\u2019s qualifications is its capability to handle transportation contracting.  Some studies used average yearly revenue as a proxy for capability.", "However, revenue does not adequately explain the differences in firms\u2019  capability. For example, two firms could have similar yearly revenues, but  one firm might have performed 100 small contracts throughout the year  because it did not have the capacity to perform large contracts, whereas  the second firm might have performed two very large contracts. If revenue  were used as a proxy for capability, these two firms would be considered  equivalent.", "In addition to determining the availability of firms, disparity studies must  measure the utilization of MBE/WBEs to determine if disparities in  contracting exist. This requires an analysis of both the number and dollar  amount of contracts awarded to MBE/WBEs and non-MBE/WBEs. Such  measurement is difficult because some states and transit authorities have  incomplete records of the prime and subcontracts they have awarded. For  example, several studies we reviewed did not include any analyses of  subcontracting and therefore may understate the utilization of firms.  Because MBE/WBEs are more likely to be awarded subcontracts than  prime contracts, MBE/WBEs in particular may appear underutilized when  the focus remains on prime contractor data. Furthermore, although some  studies did include calculations based on the number of contracts, all but  two based their determination of disparities on only the dollar amounts of  contracts. Because MBE/WBEs tend to be smaller than non-MBE/WBEs,  they are often unable to perform larger contracts. Therefore, it would  appear that they were awarded a disproportionately smaller amount of  contract dollars. A more complete indicator of utilization would consider  both the dollar amount and the number of contracts awarded or to control  for differences in contract dollar amounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USDOT Has Not Provided Criteria for Reliability of Disparity Studies Used to Set DBE Goals", "paragraphs": ["In March 2001, USDOT advised states and transit authorities that disparity  studies used to set their DBE participation goals should be reliable.

Of the 31 complaints filed, 29 had been investigated. Four of  these investigations resulted in findings of discrimination. While the  number of complaints filed by DBEs with states and transit authorities may  seem low, it is important to note that DBEs that believe they have been the  victims of discrimination have several options and may have elected to  pursue action elsewhere. For example, a DBE could file a complaint with  the responsible state or transit authority, USDOT, and/or the courts. In  addition, USDOT officials stated that the number of written discrimination  complaints filed (at any level) probably understates the level of  discrimination for two reasons.

Contract bundling is the consolidation of  two or more procurement requirements previously provided or performed  under separate, smaller contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single  contract. The resulting contract is likely to be unsuitable for award to  small businesses, such as DBEs, because of (1) the diversity, size, or  specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified; (2) the  aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award; (3) the geographic  dispersion of contract performance sites; or (4) any combination of these  three factors. USDOT officials stated that they believe contract bundling is  one of the largest barriers for DBEs in competing for transportation  contracts. GAO recently reported that there is limited government-wide  data on the extent of contract bundling and its effect on small businesses.", "Prequalification requirements are also cited as a barrier for DBEs. Most  states require that firms competing for prime contracts be prequalified,  meaning they must prove to the state that they are capable of performing  contracts.

Officials from USDOT and a  minority business group stated that the DBE program does not hurt  competition, noting that the DBE program does not use quotas and that  DBEs must compete with non-DBEs to receive USDOT-assisted contracts.  Moreover, these officials commented that the DBE program enhances  competition because it encourages greater participation by more firms. In  contrast, representatives from transportation associations believe that the  DBE program stifles competition in certain subcontracting areas (e.g.,  guardrail work) where there is an overconcentration of DBEs. Because of  this overconcentration of DBEs, according to the transportation  associations, non-DBEs do not have an opportunity to work in those fields.  Although USDOT does not have data indicating that overconcentration is a  serious, nationwide problem, the new regulations authorized states and  transit authorities to remedy situations in which an overconcentration of  DBEs is limiting non-DBEs\u2019 ability to compete for contracts, such as  varying the use of contract goals in these areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Discontinuing Federal and Nonfederal DBE Programs", "paragraphs": ["Limited data prevent a thorough assessment of the impact of suspending or  repealing (discontinuing) federal or nonfederal DBE programs on DBEs\u2019  participation in transportation contracting.

We grouped the statute\u2019s 11 objectives  into the following 4 researchable questions: 1. How has the DBE program changed since 1999? 2. What are the characteristics of DBEs and non-DBEs that receive  USDOT-assisted highway and transit contracts? 3. What do selected sources indicate about discrimination or other factors  that may limit DBEs\u2019 ability to compete for USDOT-assisted contracts? 4.

We also interviewed USDOT officials and  representatives from minority-owned business and transportation  associations.  In addition, we surveyed the departments of transportation  of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and 36 transit  authorities throughout the nation.  (We planned to survey all transit  authorities required to submit plans for a DBE program.  However, the  Federal Transit Administration could not provide an accurate list of these  transit authorities.)  The 36 transit authorities we surveyed are the largest  transit authorities in the nation as defined by the number of unlinked  passenger trips in 1999.  They also received about two-thirds of all federal  transit grant funds obligated in 1999.  Our survey was designed to obtain  information on the issues that TEA-21 directed us to examine, including the  participation rates of DBEs in USDOT-assisted contracts, the annual gross  receipts of DBEs and non-DBEs, and the cost of administering the DBE  program.", "To help design our survey, we obtained input from USDOT, states, and  transit authorities.  After we developed our survey, we pre-tested the  questionnaire with officials of 4 state departments of transportation  (states) and 5 transit authorities.  We selected states and transit authorities  from a variety of geographical regions for our pre-tests.  For each pre-test,  members of our staff met with officials from the state or transit authority  and simulated the actual survey experience by asking the officials to fill out  the questionnaire.  We also interviewed the officials after they had  completed the questionnaire to ensure that (1) the questions were  understandable and clear, (2) the terms used were precise, (3) the  questionnaire did not place undue burden on state or transit authority  officials, and (4) the questionnaire was unbiased.  Appropriate changes  were incorporated in the final survey based on our pre-testing.  In addition,  we provided a draft copy of our questionnaire to USDOT officials and  incorporated comments from them, as appropriate.", "To increase the response rate of our survey, we sent two additional  reminders after the survey was mailed in October 2000, including (1) a  postcard sent one week after the survey and (2) a follow-up letter and  replacement survey to nonrespondents sent about 3 weeks after the initial  mailing.  In addition, we conducted follow-up phone calls to  nonrespondents through January 2001.  We received survey responses from  all 52 states and 31 transit authorities for a response rate of 94 percent.", "To evaluate the existence of discrimination against DBEs, we reviewed  recent court cases that have addressed the constitutionality of the federal  DBE program, transportation-specific disparity studies, and written  discrimination complaints filed by DBEs with USDOT, states and transit  authorities.  Specifically:   We reviewed the court decisions that have addressed the  constitutionality of the federal DBE program since the Supreme Court\u2019s  1995 decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena.  We identified  decisions meeting these criteria and consulted with officials from  USDOT and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to ensure that we included  all relevant decisions in our review.  We also obtained information from  USDOT and DOJ about pending cases concerning the constitutionality  of the federal DBE program.", "We identified and reviewed all (14) transportation-specific disparity  studies published between 1996 and 2000.  We reviewed disparity  studies because DOJ has stated that they are of particular relevance for  affirmative action measures in federal programs providing grants to  states and local governments, and because courts have recognized them  as a source of evidence of discrimination in considering the federal DBE  program.  In addition, USDOT has identified disparity studies as one  source that states and transit authorities could use to help set their  federal DBE participation goals.  Numerous state and local governments  have used them to support their minority business contracting programs  and to set their federal DBE goals.  We selected disparity studies that (1)  were published between 1996 and 2000, (2) contained a separate  disparity analysis on transportation contracting, and (3) used a disparity  ratio\u2014that is, a comparison of the availability of MBE/WBEs to their  utilization in contracts\u2014as a indicator of discrimination.  These criteria  are generally consistent with USDOT\u2019s regulations, which state that any  disparity studies used in the DBE goal setting process should be as  recent as possible and focused on the transportation contracting  industry.  To determine whether the disparity studies\u2019 findings were  reliable, we evaluated the methodological soundness of the studies  using common social science and statistical practices.  For example, we  systematically examined each study\u2019s methodology, including its  assumptions and limitations, data sources, analyses, and conclusions.", "To identify relevant disparity studies, we obtained information from  USDOT, DOJ, the Policy Sciences Graduate Program of the University of  Maryland Baltimore City, the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense  and Education Fund, Inc.

However, we chose to review sources directly related to transportation  contracting and the federal DBE program, including those suggested by  USDOT and minority-owned business and transportation associations.   Since we did not conduct an exhaustive review and evaluation of all  evidence of discrimination, our results cannot be used to support or  dismiss claims about the existence of discrimination against DBEs  throughout the nation.  Moreover, we did not address whether the DBE  program satisfies the requirements of strict scrutiny and is therefore  constitutional.", "To identify factors, other than discrimination that may limit the ability of  DBEs to compete for transportation contracts, we reviewed information  collected in our nationwide survey and recent GAO reports.  In addition, we  interviewed officials from USDOT and the Small Business Administration  (SBA) and representatives from the American Road and Transportation  Builders Association, Associated General Contractors of America, Minority  Business Enterprise Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., Women  Construction Owners and Executives, and National Black Chamber of  Commerce.", "To determine the impact of the DBE program on costs, competition, and  job creation, we collected data from states and transit authorities through  our survey and from USDOT.

Twelve survey  respondents indicated that they had participated in such programs.  We  excluded the two transit authorities that had participated in nonfederal  DBE programs that were discontinued in 2000 because sufficient time had  not elapsed to determine the impact of this change.

As noted on pages 24 and 74, our objective was not to address the  question of whether the DBE program satisfies the requirements of strict  scrutiny and is therefore constitutional as USDOT seems to suggest.  In  particular, we did not attempt to determine whether sufficient evidence of  discrimination exists to demonstrate that the DBE program serves a  compelling interest.  Further, as stated on pages 11, 14, and 24, we  recognize that disparity studies are not required to support the federal DBE  program, represent one of several sources of evidence of discrimination,  and are but one method that states and transit authorities could use to set  their federal DBE goals.  2. We agree with USDOT\u2019s assertion that an inference of discrimination can  be drawn from studies finding statistical disparities between the  availability and utilization of MBE/WBEs.  Consequently, we chose to  review disparity studies as one source of evidence of discrimination.  Also,  as we stated on pages 6 and 29, all 14 studies we reviewed found disparities  between the availability and utilization of MBE/WBEs in contracting, and  taken as a whole, these studies suggest discrimination against MBE/WBEs.   However, the data limitations and methodological weaknesses we  identified create uncertainties about their findings.", "Furthermore, we agree with USDOT that we did not review all sources of  evidence of discrimination against DBEs\u2014a point we make repeatedly  throughout the report.  While we could not review all possible sources, we  chose to review the sources directly pertaining to transportation  contracting and the federal DBE program.  As such, one of the sources we  reviewed were transportation-specific disparity studies published between  1996 and 2000.  As noted on page 29, we defined transportation-specific  studies as those containing a separate disparity analysis on transportation  contracting.  While the Urban Institute report cited by USDOT included  several studies focusing on transportation contracting, it combined these  studies with a variety of others in its analysis and did not contain a separate  disparity analysis of transportation contracting.  In addition, although the  Urban Institute published its report in 1997, all of the disparity studies it  examined had been published before 1996.   Therefore, the Urban Institute  report did not meet our criteria.", "We did not discuss all of the details about the methods we used to analyze  the 14 disparity studies because the methods are commonly used in social  science research.  To help clarify this for readers who are unfamiliar with  these methods, we have added an example to our discussion in appendix  III.  3. We agree with USDOT that states and transit authorities must use the  best available data in setting their DBE goals and that there are inherent  limitations in conducting disparity studies.  However, we disagree that we  are seeking an unobtainable level of sophistication and detail in these  endeavors.  Rather, we believe we identified some basic problems with the  data sources that should be recognized and, in most cases, could  reasonably be avoided in conducting disparity studies and setting DBE  goals.  For example, if bidders lists are used to set DBE goals, they should  be as up-to-date as possible in order to avoid overstating or understating  the number of available firms.  4. We disagree that the information necessary to calculate DBE  participation rates in subcontracts is routinely made available to DOT. To  calculate DBE participation rates in prime contracts and subcontracts, one  needs the number and value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded  to DBEs and the number and value of prime contracts and subcontracts  awarded to non-DBEs. We were able to calculate DBE participation rates in  prime contracts because most states and transit authorities could provide  the number and value of prime contracts awarded to DBEs and non-DBEs.   However, the majority of states and transit authorities could not provide  the number and value of subcontracts awarded to non-DBEs and therefore  the data on DBEs\u2019 participation rates in subcontracts are limited.   Information on the number and value of subcontracts awarded to non- DBEs is not reported to USDOT and USDOT does not maintain this  information.  Most states and transit authorities provided the number and  value of subcontracts awarded to DBEs\u2014information that is routinely  provided to USDOT.  However, this information alone does not allow one to  calculate DBEs\u2019 participation rates in subcontracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Physical Infrastructure Team", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Applied Research and Methods", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
