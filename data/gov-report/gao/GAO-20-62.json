FDA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) both play a role in overseeing imported seafood. FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of most imported seafood. DHS provides FDA with import data on FDA-regulated products, including seafood. If FDA finds that imported seafood products appear to violate U.S. laws, FDA may place the products, firms, or countries on an import alert.", "GAO was asked to review FDA's efforts to use import alerts to ensure the safety of imported seafood. This report, among other things, (1) describes FDA's import alert process for seafood products, (2) examines FDA oversight of key activities to support import alert removal decisions, and (3) examines the extent to which FDA has assessed the effectiveness of its seafood import alerts. GAO reviewed FDA procedures and data, including data on 274 removal decisions, for a non-generalizable sample of seven import alerts selected for a range of violations of federal law. GAO also interviewed FDA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) import alert process for seafood products includes three key components: (1) establishing new import alerts, which inform FDA field staff and the public that the agency has enough evidence that products appear to violate a federal food safety law to detain those products at U.S. ports of entry without physically examining them; (2) placing firms and products on existing import alerts; and (3) removing firms and products from those import alerts when violations are resolved. As of July 3, 2018\u2014the most recent data at the time of GAO's analysis\u2014FDA had 52 active import alerts affecting imported seafood that addressed a wide range of violations of federal law, including the presence of foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella , or unapproved animal drug residues.", "FDA has established audit goals, requirements, and expectations related to sampling and inspections\u2014key activities to support import alert removal decisions\u2014but does not monitor the extent to which it is meeting them. GAO's review of 274 removal decisions from October 1, 2011, through July 3, 2018, found that FDA had supported only a small percentage of its removal decisions by conducting sampling and inspections. For example, FDA has a goal to audit samples from at least one of the shipments used to support each removal decision to ensure the validity of the analysis that a private laboratory performed. However, GAO found that within a year prior to the 274 removal decisions, FDA did not conduct any audits for 260 (95 percent) of the 274 removal decisions. FDA officials said they conducted limited sampling because many import alert removal decisions can be supported by documentary evidence provided by firms. Additionally, for certain violations that indicate a firm failed to meet regulatory or administrative requirements and may pose a public health hazard, an FDA directive establishes a goal for FDA staff to conduct a follow-up inspection within 6 months. However, GAO's review of removal decisions found that for 31of the 32 firms that received such a finding, FDA did not conduct a follow-up inspection before removing them from an import alert. FDA officials said they did not know whether they were meeting their audit goals because the agency does not have a process to monitor the extent to which it is conducting its sampling and inspections. Establishing such a process would provide greater assurance that FDA is conducting its expected level of sampling and inspections to support its removal decisions and has confidence in continued compliance.", "FDA has not established performance goals and measures for seafood import alerts\u2014key elements for assessing the effectiveness of programs. Goals explain the outcomes a program seeks to achieve, and measures track progress towards those goals. In February 2019, FDA published a broad plan for the safety of imported food. The plan states that FDA intends to develop performance goals and measures related to imported food safety, but FDA has not established a time frame for doing so. By establishing a time frame and developing such goals and measures, FDA would be better positioned to assess how well its seafood import alert activities are supporting the agency in achieving its food safety mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA (1) establish a process to monitor whether the agency is meeting its audit goals and expectations for sampling and inspections, (2) establish a time frame for developing goals and measures for its imported food safety program, and (3) develop goals and measures for seafood import alerts. FDA agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States is the world\u2019s second largest importer of seafood,  importing from approximately 140 countries. More than 90 percent of  seafood products consumed in the United States are imported, according  to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA). These data also indicate that U.S. seafood imports have risen in  recent years, from about 5.8 billion pounds of seafood in 2014 to about  6.3 billion pounds in 2017.", "Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) is generally responsible for ensuring that the  nation\u2019s food supply, including most imported seafood, is safe,  wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled. To carry out its oversight  responsibilities for imported seafood, FDA requires processors and  importers to follow its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)  regulations to identify hazards and the critical control points in their  processing systems where one or more hazards are reasonably likely to  occur. Hazards can include drug residues such as antibiotics, pathogens  such as Salmonella, and insanitary conditions at the foreign processing  facility. FDA also relies on (1) inspections of importers\u2019 facilities and of  processors\u2019 foreign facilities each year to ensure HACCP compliance,  and (2) port-of-entry examinations and tests of imported seafood for  contaminants, including unsafe drug residues.", "If FDA finds that imported seafood products from particular firms or  countries appear to violate FFDCA, FDA may place the products, firms,  or countries on an import alert. An import alert informs FDA field staff  and the public that the agency has enough evidence to detain products at  U.S. ports of entry without physically examining them (known as detention  without physical examination). For example, if routine FDA sampling at  ports of entry detects drug residues in an imported seafood product at  levels above acceptable limits, the agency can place the product and the  foreign firm that processed the product on an existing import alert  established for similar problems.", "Products that are detained because of import alerts may ultimately be  refused entry into the United States, in which case they must be exported  to another country or destroyed. Alternatively, if the products are brought  into compliance, they will be allowed to enter U.S. commerce. FDA can  allow food products on import alerts to enter U.S. commerce if the  importer (1) proves that the individual shipment complies with FFDCA or  (2) \u201creconditions\u201d the shipment\u2014for example, by relabeling the product or  converting it into a type of product FDA does not regulate. To show that  the shipment complies with FFDCA, the importer must provide FDA with  evidence, such as private laboratory reports, to show that the importer\u2019s  products do not violate federal laws and FDA regulations. Evidence of  multiple compliant shipments from an importer\u2014based on sampling of  seafood products, inspections of foreign seafood processing facilities, or  documentation provided by facilities of corrective actions taken\u2014may  lead FDA ultimately to decide to remove the firm and product from the  import alert. According to FDA officials, the effective use of import alerts  is key to FDA\u2019s efforts to ensure that imported products under its  jurisdiction, including seafood, are safe and wholesome for U.S.  consumers.", "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) also plays a role regarding imported food, including  seafood. CBP is responsible for collecting customs duties on imports,  including seafood, and seeks to prevent the evasion of customs duties.  In February 2009, we reported that CBP determined that Chinese shrimp  were being illegally transshipped through Malaysia to the United States.  Illegal transshipment is one scheme firms use to conceal the country of  origin and thereby evade applicable duties or import alerts. Because of  this illegal transshipment, importers of Chinese shrimp were not only able  to evade CBP\u2019s duty requirements but also FDA\u2019s 2007 import alert that  covered Chinese shrimp, among other seafood products, because of the  presence of unapproved drug residues.", "You asked us to review FDA\u2019s efforts to use import alerts to ensure the  safety of imported seafood.

We also interviewed FDA officials to gain a further understanding  of this process. To identify the number of active seafood import alerts, as  of July 3, 2018, and the number of firms and countries affected by them,  we reviewed information that FDA posted on its website on seafood  import alerts and data that FDA maintained on these alerts from October  1, 2011, through July 3, 2018\u2014the most recent available data at the time  of our analysis. FDA provided these data from its Compliance  Management System (CMS). To assess the reliability of FDA\u2019s data, we  reviewed documentation for CMS, conducted electronic or manual  testing, and interviewed agency officials regarding controls, among other  things.

We selected these seven import alerts to (1)  illustrate a range of violations of FFDCA\u2014such as the presence of drug  residues, pathogens, and insanitary conditions\u2014that led FDA to place  products or firms on import alerts, (2) include import alerts that address  violations for which sampling or inspections were not specifically required  but would be reasonably expected prior to removal decisions, according  to FDA\u2019s procedures (e.g., HAACP violations or drug residue violations),  and (3) include import alerts that specifically require sampling or  inspections prior to such removal. Using CMS data, we identified the firms  and products that FDA removed from any of the seven seafood import  alerts we selected. We then used sampling and inspection data from  FACTS and OASIS to identify any sampling FDA conducted within 1 year  before the removal decisions and any inspections within 6 months before  those decisions. In addition, we identified any sampling or inspections  FDA conducted within 1 year after the decisions. We also interviewed  FDA officials about how the agency ensures that it is conducting the  appropriate level of sampling and inspections to support its removal  decisions and have confidence that seafood firms removed from import  alerts continue to comply with FFDCA.", "To examine the extent to which FDA coordinates with DHS to help ensure  compliance with seafood import alerts, we reviewed FDA\u2019s efforts to  coordinate with DHS\u2019s CBP to identify potential schemes to evade import  alerts, such as through illegal transshipment. Further, we reviewed a prior  GAO report related to FDA\u2019s coordination with DHS on the issue of  evasion. In addition, we interviewed officials from both agencies about  their coordination efforts related to identifying potential seafood import  alert evasion.", "To examine the extent to which FDA assesses the effectiveness of its  seafood import alerts in achieving FDA\u2019s food safety mission, we  reviewed the FDA Strategy for the Safety of Imported Food and agency  documentation describing FDA\u2019s Import Alert Effectiveness Program. We  compared FDA\u2019s strategy and documentation with leading practices we  have identified in our past work for assessing the effectiveness of programs. For example, we have previously reported that requirements of  the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as  updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), such as  performance goals and performance measures, which apply at the  departmental or agency level, can serve as leading practices for planning  at lower levels, such as component agencies, offices, programs, and  projects, within federal agencies.

Import  alerts covering a specific geographical area may apply to an area within a  country, to one or more entire countries, or worldwide. For example,  FDA established an import alert covering all firms processing shrimp in  India because of the presence of filth, decomposition, and Salmonella.", "For import alerts that apply to geographical areas, all firms in the area  that produce the products specified in an import alert are initially placed  on that alert, and the specified products are subject to detention without  physical examination. If a firm presents evidence establishing that the  conditions that gave rise to the appearance of the violation associated  with the alert have been resolved and the agency has confidence that  future entries will comply with FFDCA, FDA indicates that the firm may be  removed from the alert by placing it on a \u201cgreen list\u201d that FDA creates for  the alert.

The updated analysis shows that this percentage has  improved in recent years, with FDA auditing about 3 percent of the  work that private laboratories performed for fiscal year 2018.  However, this level of auditing remains far below the goal of at least  10 percent, as shown in figure 1. According to FDA officials, the  agency has not met this audit goal largely because it has limited  resources.", "Inspections prior to removal decisions. For the 274 removal  decisions we reviewed, FDA conducted inspections of importers or  foreign processing facilities for 28 (about 10 percent) of the removal  decisions in the 6 months prior. According to FDA\u2019s procedures,  firms or products placed on an import alert based on a violative facility  inspection may generally be removed from the alert following a  reinspection of the importer or foreign processing facility. In some  instances, a firm may present information or documentation sufficient  to demonstrate that appropriate corrections are in place to overcome  the appearance of a violation and, with appropriate concurrence, may  be removed from the import alert. FDA officials added that, regardless  of the basis for placement on an import alert, FDA could require an  on-site inspection prior to removal, depending on the hazard the  violation posed. For example, certain violations may result in a finding  of \u201cofficial action indicated\u201d (OAI), which indicates that an  establishment failed to meet regulatory or administrative requirements  and may pose a hazard to public health. FDA\u2019s Field Management  Directive 86 establishes a goal for FDA staff to conduct a follow-up  inspection within 6 months after an OAI finding to verify that the facility  has corrected violations. In our review of the 274 removal decisions,  we found that for 32 firms that received an OAI inspection finding after  FDA issued the directive in December 2011, FDA did not conduct a  follow-up inspection for 31 of these firms before removing them from  an import alert. According to FDA officials, the agency did not monitor  whether its staff decided that inspections would be expected for the  274 removal decisions or whether the facilities that received an OAI  inspection finding were reinspected. FDA officials told us that the  agency relied on reviewing data on removal decisions individually to  ensure that expected inspections had been conducted. Consequently,  FDA was not aware of the extent to which the facilities associated with  the removal decisions were actually inspected.", "Sampling or inspections following removal decisions. As shown  in figure 2, for the 274 removal decisions we reviewed, FDA  subsequently conducted sampling for 6 percent of the products at  ports of entry and inspections for 13 percent of the importers or  foreign processing facilities within 1 year after removal. FDA does  not have a goal for the amount of sampling or inspections that should  be conducted following removal decisions; however, as described  above, FDA\u2019s procedures call for the agency to base removal  decisions on evidence establishing that the conditions that gave rise  to the appearance of a violation have been resolved and that the  agency has confidence that future shipments will comply with FFDCA.", "FDA officials said that when the agency does not inspect a facility and  relies on documentation describing the actions the firm has taken to  address the appearance of a violation to support a removal decision,  the agency relies on subsequent sampling and inspections to have  confidence in continued compliance. According to FDA, the past  violative history of a firm is reflected in the PREDICT screening rules  for the examination of future shipments and in the process of  prioritizing inspections of foreign facilities. It was unclear from the  CMS data that FDA provided the extent to which the agency relied on  documentation to support the remainder of its removal decisions.  However, based on FDA officials\u2019 statements about subsequent  sampling or inspections, we would expect to see a larger percentage  of products sampled and firms inspected after their removal from  import alerts for FDA to have confidence in continued compliance  given the low percentage of inspections we found before removal  decisions. FDA officials said they were not monitoring whether staff  decided that subsequent sampling and inspections would be expected  for these removals, and staff do not continuously monitor post- removal activities. Consequently, FDA officials were not aware of the  extent to which the products and foreign processing facilities  associated with removal decisions were subsequently sampled and  inspected.", "FDA officials told us that they were generally aware that FDA had  conducted limited sampling and inspections to support removal decisions  and have confidence in continued compliance. They attributed this limited  sampling and inspections to their belief that many import alert removal  decisions can be supported by reviewing documentary evidence that FDA  requested and the firms provided that describes the actions the firms  have taken to address the appearance of a violation. According to FDA  officials, such reliance on firm-provided documentation to support removal  decisions is, in part, how FDA prioritizes its use of limited laboratory and  inspection resources.", "FDA officials stated that the agency can check the basis of its removal  decisions by looking up individual import alert cases in CMS and the  agency\u2019s sampling and inspection data in FACTS and OASIS to  determine whether the agency would conclude that sampling and  inspections to support these decisions would be appropriate, and if so,  whether they were done. These officials said that they believed that  checking the data on the basis of removal decisions individually and when  questions arise from sources internal or external to FDA, instead of  regularly analyzing sampling and inspections data, was sufficient to  ensure the appropriate level of oversight. However, as discussed above,  this approach has not informed them of the extent to which the agency is  meeting its audit goals and expectations.", "Standards for internal control in the federal government state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. An example of such control activities includes  management comparing actual performance with planned or expected  results. Such a comparison could include FDA comparing audits  conducted with its audit goal (e.g., auditing at least 10 percent of a private  laboratory\u2019s work) to ensure that its goal was met. Monitoring the extent  to which the agency is meeting its audit goals and expectations for  conducting sampling and inspections to support its import alert decisions  would enhance its oversight of these activities to better protect U.S.  consumers from imported seafood that is not safe and wholesome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Generally Has Not Coordinated with DHS to Help Ensure Firms Comply with Seafood Import Alerts", "paragraphs": ["FDA and DHS have established a mechanism for coordinating the use of  certain resources, but they generally have not coordinated to help ensure  that firms comply with seafood import alerts by identifying potential  instances of evasion of alerts, according to agency officials. FDA  officials stated that the agency can coordinate with CBP in situations that  could involve evasion of import alerts, but the agency does not have a  formal mechanism for regularly and proactively coordinating to identify  evasion. FDA officials said that such coordination could include CBP  sharing information that could help FDA identify instances of evasion.", "As previously noted, CBP is responsible for collecting customs duties on  imports, including seafood, and seeks to prevent the evasion of customs  duties. As we reported in 2012, CBP personnel are to analyze trends in  import data, among other things, to look for anomalies that may indicate  evasion and also follow up on allegations from external sources. Once  CBP identifies a potential instance of evasion, it can use a variety of  techniques at different points in the import process to determine whether  evasion is actually occurring. These techniques include collecting  samples from shipments of products at U.S. ports of entry and conducting  laboratory analyses of these samples to identify their true country of  origin. Through its efforts, CBP has identified illegal transshipments\u2014a  scheme to conceal the country of origin and thereby evade applicable  duties or FDA\u2019s import alerts. For example, CBP reported that in 2016,  customs officers seized about 42 tons of Chinese honey that had been  transshipped through Taiwan to evade U.S. duties applicable to Chinese  honey. According to FDA documents, at the same time, FDA had an  import alert for honey because of unsafe drug residues. This alert  included Chinese firms, but did not include any firms from Taiwan.", "In February 2009, we reported on CBP\u2019s expertise in detecting illegal  transshipment that could enhance FDA\u2019s ability to detect import alert  evasion. We stated that FDA and CBP could work together to help ensure  that importers were not attempting to evade duties or import alerts.", "However, we found that the agencies had not identified ways to maximize  and leverage their resources or established processes and policies for  working together systematically across agency lines. We recommended,  among other things, that FDA and CBP develop mechanisms to share  information related to the evasion of import alerts. FDA and CBP agreed  with our recommendation, but as of July 2019, the agencies had not fully  implemented it.", "Specifically, FDA and CBP signed a memorandum of understanding  (MOU), effective May 2013, to set forth terms for CBP to coordinate with  FDA on staffing, space, and equipment requirements for the National  Targeting Center. However, the MOU does not address CBP sharing  information on potential evasion of import alerts with FDA regularly or the  agencies working proactively to identify such evasion. According to CBP  officials, FDA and CBP do not coordinate specifically on targeting to  detect evasion, but CBP would be willing to coordinate with FDA and  provide any applicable expertise in this area.", "While a collaborative mechanism such as an MOU is not needed to share  information, we continue to believe that FDA and CBP should develop a  mechanism to help the agencies formally coordinate to identify potential  evasion of seafood import alerts. Until these agencies develop such a  mechanism, they may be missing opportunities to share information  regularly that could benefit each agency\u2019s efforts to detect illegal  transshipment and help FDA proactively identify and prevent evasion of  seafood import alerts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Not Assessed the Effectiveness of Its Seafood Import Alerts in Achieving Its Food Safety Mission", "paragraphs": ["FDA has not assessed the effectiveness of its seafood import alerts in  helping to achieve its food safety mission.

GPRAMA also  requires agencies to use performance information to assess their  progress toward achieving their goals.", "According to FDA officials, the agency is implementing a program, which  it refers to as an import alert effectiveness program, to review its import  alerts. FDA documents note that the focus of this program includes (1)  determining if FDA identified the firms on import alerts during its  admissibility screening and took the appropriate action, (2) ensuring the  accuracy of data FDA maintains in CMS on firms on import alerts, and (3)  determining whether the reasons for the alerts are still relevant, and  ensuring that the import alerts are accurately posted for clear  communication to industry and FDA field staff. We commend FDA for  these efforts. However, according to our review of FDA documents  describing the activities planned for this program, the program does not  include performance goals and measures for import alerts.
