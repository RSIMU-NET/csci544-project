Moreover, OMB reported on three of these measures in the analytical perspectives associated with the President\u0092s fiscal year 2013 budget. Specifically, regarding data center consolidation, OMB reported that agencies were on track to close 525 centers by the end of 2012 and expected to save $3 billion by 2015.

Key reports that address topics covered in the IT  Reform Plan include reports on data center consolidation, cloud  computing, best practices in IT acquisition, IT spending authority,  investment review and oversight, and agency CIO responsibilities. For  example, in July 2011, we reported that only one of the agencies  submitted a complete data center inventory and no agency submitted a  complete data center consolidation plan. We concluded that until these  inventories and plans are complete, agencies might not be able to  implement their consolidation activities and realize expected cost savings.  We recommended that agencies complete the missing elements in their  plans and inventories. In response to our recommendations, in October  and November 2011, the agencies updated their inventories and plans.

The Federal CIO agreed with both of these  recommendations and stated that OMB intends to complete the action  items by the deadline. We are also recommending that the Federal CIO  accurately characterize the status of the IT Reform Plan action items in  an upcoming progress report in order to keep momentum going on action  items that are not yet completed. The Federal CIO disagreed with this  recommendation and stated that OMB has accurately characterized the  completeness of the action items, and therefore, the recommendation  does not apply. We do not agree with OMB\u2019s characterization of four  action items. Specifically, OMB considers the action items associated with  data center consolidation, cloud-first policy, best practices collaboration  portal, and redefining roles of agency CIOs and the CIO Council to be  completed. While we agree that OMB has made progress in each of  these areas, we found activities specified in the IT Reform Plan that have  not yet been completed. For example, in the area of data center  consolidation, we found that selected agency plans are still incomplete. In  addition, in the move to cloud computing, selected agency migration  plans lack key elements. Thus, we believe that the recommendation is  warranted.", "To address our concerns regarding performance measures, we are  recommending that the Federal CIO establish outcome-oriented  measures for each applicable action item in the IT Reform Plan. The  Federal CIO disagreed with our recommendation and noted that OMB  measured the completeness of the IT Reform Plan action items and not  the performance measures associated with broader initiatives. We  continue to believe that our recommendation is appropriate because there  are multiple action items in the IT Reform Plan that are not aligned with  broader initiatives and for which there are no measures. Examples  include the best practices portal, developing a cadre of specialized IT  acquisition professionals, and establishing budget models that align with  modular development. Given that the purpose of the IT Reform Plan is to  achieve operational efficiencies and improve the management of large- scale IT programs, we maintain that it is appropriate to establish  performance measures to monitor the IT Reform Plan\u2019s results.", "In summary, OMB and selected agencies have made strides in  implementing the IT Reform Plan, including pushing agencies to  consolidate data centers, migrating federal services to cloud computing,  improving the skills of IT acquisition professionals, and strengthening the  roles and accountability of CIOs. However, several key reform items  remain behind schedule despite OMB stating that these items have been  completed.", "In addition, OMB has not established performance measures for gauging  the success of most of its reform initiatives. For example, while OMB is  tracking the number of services that agencies move to a cloud computing  environment and the number of data center closures, it is not tracking the  usefulness of its efforts to develop a best practices collaboration portal or  a cadre of IT acquisition professionals.", "Overstating progress and not implementing appropriate performance  measures do not position the federal IT community to leverage and build  on the progress made to date. Moving forward, it will be important for  OMB to continue to provide guidance, goals, and oversight to ensure that  critical IT reform efforts extend well beyond the original 18-month time  frame.
