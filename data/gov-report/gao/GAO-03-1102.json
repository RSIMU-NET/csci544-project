Some taxpayers claiming the business employee credit may have  their returns processed by the Wage and Investment (W&I) Division,  which is not planning to enter information from the form into the  computer system. However, IRS officials said that the bulk of the  taxpayers who would claim this credit would submit their returns to the  SB/SE Division.", "IRS can collect information on the use of the business employee credit  because it developed a new form to administer this credit. Although the  business employee credit was included in the WOTC provisions, IRS  officials said they needed to track business employee credits separately  because the business employee credit can be used to offset any alternative  minimum taxes owed but the general WOTC provisions cannot. IRS  currently cannot collect information on the remaining six Liberty Zone  benefits because it is using existing forms to administer them, and  taxpayers do not report these six benefits as separate items on their  returns. For example, taxpayers add the amount of depreciation they are  allowed under the Liberty Zone special depreciation allowance benefit to  other depreciation expenses and report their total depreciation expenses  on their returns. Since taxpayers do not report their use of six of the seven  benefits separately on their returns, IRS cannot report on how extensively  these six benefits were used.", "IRS officials said that although they are collecting information on the  amount of business employee credits claimed by taxpayers, they are not  planning on reporting information on the extent to which the benefit  reduced taxpayers\u2019 tax liabilities.

For example, IRS could determine how much lower each  taxpayers\u2019 tax liability is due to the use of the tax benefits, assuming that  taxpayer behavior would be the same whether the benefits existed or not.  Table 1 is an example of such a computation for claiming the Liberty Zone  Section 179 expensing benefit. In this example, a taxpayer with $100,000 in  income bought $40,000 worth of office equipment in 2002 and placed this  equipment in service in the Liberty Zone in 2002. After applying the Liberty  Zone section 179 expensing benefit, taxable income would be $60,000.  Since the equipment has been completely expensed, the taxpayer cannot  claim any further deductions for this equipment. To recalculate the  taxpayer\u2019s taxable income as if the special Liberty Zone expensing benefit  did not exist, IRS could assume that the taxpayer would make the same  investment, even without the Liberty Zone tax benefit, and still claim the  $24,000 section 179 deduction available to all taxpayers in 2002 and any  other available deductions, such as the special depreciation allowance. In  our example, the special depreciation allowance would be worth $4,800,  and the amount otherwise available as a depreciation deduction (regular  depreciation) would be worth $1,600, which would reduce the taxpayer\u2019s  taxable income to $69,600. The total reduction in taxable income would be  $9,600.", "Once all the adjustments to taxable income were made, IRS would then  need to apply the appropriate marginal tax rate to arrive at the taxpayer\u2019s  recalculated tax liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Could Produce Estimates but Not a Verifiable Measure of the Revenue Loss", "paragraphs": ["If IRS were to begin collecting information on the number of taxpayers  using the Liberty Zone tax benefits and the amounts they claimed, the  information would not be complete.

To produce the estimate, IRS would have to make assumptions about  how taxpayers would have behaved in the absence of the benefits.", "IRS said the earliest it would be able to collect information on the number  of taxpayers using the benefits and the amounts each claimed would be  for tax year 2004 returns, which IRS would not process until calendar year  2005. As a result, IRS would not have information for two of the years that  the benefits were in effect, which is significant because most of the  benefits expire by the end of 2006. IRS could not reconstruct information  on tax liability for those 2 years because returns already filed would not  indicate whether taxpayers used the Liberty Zone benefits and would not  show the amount claimed through benefit use. Although IRS could ask for  information about past benefit use since taxpayers are instructed to keep  tax records for 3 years, this would require taxpayers to provide additional  information and increase taxpayer burden. Also, it would be difficult for  IRS to use current year information to estimate the amount claimed  through benefit use retroactively because the pattern of using the benefits  could have changed over time.", "In addition to not being complete, the data that IRS could collect on the  number of taxpayers using the Liberty Zone benefits and the amounts each  claimed would not be sufficient for actually measuring how much revenue  those benefits cost the federal government. The reduction in revenues due  to the Liberty Zone tax benefits is equal to the difference between the  amount of revenue that the federal government would collect with the  benefits in place and the amount it would collect in the absence of those  benefits. There are two reasons why revenues would be different with and  without the benefits. First, the rules for computing tax liabilities are  different in the two cases (as shown in table 1). Second, the behavior of  many taxpayers is likely to be different in the two cases. In fact, a primary  purpose of the tax benefits is to influence taxpayer behavior. For example,  in the case of the Liberty Zone section 179 benefit, some taxpayers who  claim this benefit would have made different investment decisions if that  particular benefit were not available. In our simplified example shown in  table 1, this difference in behavior might be that the taxpayer invested less  than $40,000 in office equipment\u2014perhaps even nothing\u2014because the  Liberty Zone benefit did not exist. As a consequence, the taxpayer\u2019s  taxable income would have been different than the $69,600 shown in table  1.
