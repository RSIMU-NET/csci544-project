NPR claimed that about $137 billion in savings has resulted from its efforts to reinvent the federal government, including about $34.3 billion in savings that is not expected to be realized until fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Of the $137 billion in estimated savings, about $44.3 billion was claimed from recommendations that were targeted toward individual agencies. About $67.5 billion was claimed from recommendations designed to be implemented governmentwide, and another $24.9 billion was claimed from items not originated by NPR but, according to NPR, were consistent with the principles of reinventing government.", "Our objective was to describe and assess how OMB estimated savings from selected NPR recommendations targeted toward individual agencies. We reviewed recommendations representing over two-thirds of the $44.3 billion in savings that NPR claimed had been achieved from its recommendations to individual federal agencies.

(Appendixes I through VI contain detailed information on the six recommendations.)  The claims we reviewed at these three agencies constituted about 22 percent of the total estimated savings from NPR.

The first NPR report was released in September 1993 and made recommendations intended to make the government \u201cwork better and cost less.\u201d The first NPR phase, called NPR I, included recommendations to reinvent individual agencies\u2019 programs and organizations. It also included governmentwide recommendations for (1) reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, (2) reducing procurement costs through streamlining, (3) reengineering processes through the better use of information technology, and (4) reducing administrative costs. The estimates for NPR I savings covered fiscal years 1994 through 1999.", "Vice President Gore launched the second NPR phase (called NPR II) in December 1994 and reported on this phase\u2019s savings estimates in September 1995.According to NPR, this second phase expanded the agenda for governmental reform. NPR II efforts focused on identifying additional programs that could be reinvented, terminated, or privatized, as well as on reinventing the federal regulatory process. The estimates for NPR II savings covered fiscal years 1996 through 2000.", "As shown in table I, NPR claimed estimated savings of $82.2 billion from NPR I recommendations. NPR similarly reported that $29.6 billion had been \u201clocked into place\u201d from program changes in individual agencies under NPR II.", "In addition to the $111.8 billion NPR claimed from the NPR I and II recommendations, NPR claimed $24.9 billion in estimated savings based on reinvention principles. These additional claimed savings included, for example, $23.1 billion from the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s auctions of wireless licenses. This $24.9 billion brings the total amount of reinvention savings claimed by NPR to about $137 billion. This $137 billion savings figure is the one NPR most commonly cites as the savings it has achieved.", "NPR relied on OMB to estimate the savings it claimed from its NPR I and II recommendations. OMB\u2019s program examiners were responsible for developing the estimates in their role as focal points for all matters pertaining to their specific assignment area. One of the examiners\u2019 major duties is to oversee the formulation and execution of the budget process. They are also expected to perform legislative, economic, policy, program, organizational, and management analyses. OMB made the initial estimates for the 1993 and 1995 NPR reports and updated its database on the savings claimed in the summers of 1996 and 1997. These updates, according to an OMB official, were primarily to ensure that all the estimates for recommendations that NPR considered implemented were included in the total amount of savings claimed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To describe and assess how OMB estimated the savings from NPR, we focused on three agencies (USDA, DOE, and NASA), where relatively large savings were claimed and that provided a variety of types of actions taken. At each agency, we selected two recommendations with claims of at least $700 million in savings each. The six recommendations we reviewed accounted for $10.45 billion of the $14.7 billion claimed from changes in individual agencies under NPR I and $19.17 billion of the $29.6 billion claimed from NPR II savings. Overall, the claimed savings from the recommendations we reviewed accounted for over two-thirds of the $44.3 billion in savings claimed from NPR\u2019s recommendations to individual agencies and 22 percent of the total amount of NPR\u2019s savings claims.", "Following is a listing of the six recommendations we reviewed and the estimated savings, in millions of dollars, that NPR claimed for each of those recommendations. (See apps. I through VI for detailed information on each of the recommendations.) reorganize USDA to better accomplish its mission, streamline its field structure, and improve service to its customers ($770 million); end USDA\u2019s wool and mohair subsidy ($702 million); redirect DOE laboratories to post-Cold War priorities ($6,996 million); realign DOE, including terminating the Clean Coal Technology Program; privatizing the naval petroleum reserves in Elk Hills, CA; selling uranium no longer needed for national defense purposes; reducing costs in DOE\u2019s applied research programs; improving program effectiveness and efficiencies in environmental management of nuclear waste cleanups; and strategically aligning headquarters and field operations ($10,649 million); strengthen and restructure NASA management, both overall management and management of the space station program ($1,982 million); and reinvent NASA, including eliminating duplication and overlap between NASA centers, transferring functions to universities or the private sector, reducing civil service involvement with and expecting more accountability from NASA contractors, emphasizing objective contracting, using private sector capabilities, changing NASA regulations, and returning NASA to its status as a research and development center ($8,519 million).", "Since these recommendations are not representative of all NPR recommendations, our findings cannot be generalized to apply to other savings claimed by NPR. As agreed with your office, we did not independently estimate the actual amount of savings achieved from these six recommendations.", "We interviewed NPR and OMB officials about how they estimated and claimed savings and also requested relevant documentation. We also examined a database OMB maintained showing the amount of savings achieved from the recommendations. The NPR I data covered fiscal years 1994 through 1999, and the NPR II data covered fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Both sets of data were most recently updated in the summer of 1997. We reviewed NPR data, including a description of the status of the recommendations and reports containing background information, on the three agencies and the relevant recommendations where available. We also interviewed officials from these agencies about the savings OMB estimated for the recommendations we reviewed.", "We conducted our review in Washington, D.C., from April 1998 through February 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from OMB, the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, and NASA. These comments are discussed at the end of this letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Relationship Between NPR Recommendations and Agency Savings Claims Was Not Clear", "paragraphs": ["OMB generally did not distinguish between NPR\u2019s and other contributions for the agency-specific recommendations we reviewed. NPR attempted to build on prior management reforms and operated in an atmosphere where other factors, such as agencies\u2019 ongoing reforms as well as the political environment, also influenced actions taken to address NPR\u2019s recommendations. The relationship between the recommendations we reviewed and the savings claimed was not clear because OMB attributed a broad range of changes to NPR.", "Savings estimated from the recommendation to reinvent NASA illustrate how OMB attributed a broad range of changes to NPR and did not distinguish NPR\u2019s contribution from other factors. To estimate savings for that recommendation, OMB consolidated seven somewhat related recommendations into one savings estimate of $8.519 billion. OMB estimated savings by totaling expected reductions to NASA\u2019s entire budget for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. According to a NASA official, NASA\u2019s funding during this period was limited as the result of several initiatives, including direction from the NASA administrator that began before NPR was initiated and congressionally imposed spending caps. Nevertheless, OMB attributed all of the $8.519 billion in savings from estimated reductions in the entire NASA budget to NPR.", "OMB followed similar procedures in estimating savings from the other NPR recommendation concerning NASA that we reviewed\u2014the recommendation to strengthen and restructure NASA management. The examiner estimated savings of $1.982 billion on the basis of expected reductions in funding levels for one of NASA\u2019s three budget accounts for fiscal years 1994 through 1999. The estimated savings were based on expectations for lower levels of budget authority due to the combined effects of several factors, such as budgetary spending caps and ongoing NASA management reform efforts.", "In the case of the NPR recommendation for DOE to shift its laboratory facilities\u2019 priorities in response to conditions that accompanied the end of the Cold War, NPR recognized that changes were already under way. For example, as part of this recommendation, NPR called for DOE to \u201ccontinue\u201d the reduction of funding for nuclear weapons production, research, testing programs, and infrastructure. Considering the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty agreements and other factors, it was apparent that the DOE laboratories\u2019 priorities would have changed regardless of whether NPR had made the recommendation. However, as figure 1 shows, when OMB estimated savings from this recommendation, it credited all savings from estimated reductions in the weapons activity budget account ($6.996 billion) to NPR.", "Similarly, efforts related to NPR\u2019s recommendation to reorganize USDA were under way prior to or simultaneously with the NPR recommendation. These efforts included USDA reorganization plans and the introduction of legislation to streamline USDA. For example, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-354, Oct. 13, 1994), required USDA to reduce the number of federal staff years by at least 7,500 by the end of fiscal year 1999. Therefore, USDA\u2019s reorganization could be viewed as part of a continuous management improvement effort. OMB attributed the entire $770 million in estimated savings it reported from USDA\u2019s staffing reductions to NPR.", "In contrast, the relationship between the recommended action and the estimated savings was relatively straightforward for the NPR recommendation to end USDA\u2019s wool and mohair subsidy program. In that case, program costs, primarily subsidy amounts that were reduced by phasing out the program and subsequently eliminated by ending the program, were counted as savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Used Standard Budget Estimating Techniques to Estimate Savings", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB, the procedures and techniques it used to estimate NPR savings were those that it commonly follows in developing the President\u2019s budget. Therefore the NPR savings estimates were to provide a \u201csnapshot\u201d showing the amount of savings OMB expected would result from the recommendations. For example, in 1993, OMB projected savings from the NPR recommendation to strengthen and restructure NASA management covering fiscal years 1994 through 1999. OMB characterized these estimated savings as achieved in 1996, and NPR has continued to report these estimated savings (based on the 1993 estimate) as achieved. More generally, OMB\u2019s savings estimates for agency-specific recommendations included about $34.3 billion in savings that were not expected to be realized until fiscal years 1999 and 2000. OMB last updated its estimates in 1997, so any changes that have occurred since then are not reflected in NPR\u2019s claimed savings.", "OMB\u2019s budget estimating procedures and techniques use policies and economic forecasts in effect at a given time. The estimates OMB prepared for NPR initiatives involved projecting changes from a given baseline and identifying the difference as savings. OMB said that it generally used a fiscal year 1994 current services baseline for the NPR I agency-specific recommendations and a fiscal year 1996 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act baseline for the NPR II recommendations. OMB said, however, that in both cases, program examiners could use other savings baselines where the examiners believed it made better sense for a particular program or NPR recommendation. The OMB examiners also had latitude in determining the most appropriate analytical approach to use, based on their knowledge of the agency and the specific characteristics of the individual NPR recommendation.", "Our prior reviews of budget estimates have shown that it is difficult to reconstruct the specific assumptions used or to track savings for estimates produced several years ago. As we reported in 1996, once an estimate is prepared and time passes, it becomes difficult to retrace the original steps and reconstruct events in order to replicate the original estimate.Moreover, it is often difficult to isolate the impacts of particular proposals on actual savings achieved due to the multiple factors involved. In our 1994 report on issues concerning the 1990 Reconciliation Act, we found that it is generally not possible to identify or track precise savings by isolating the budgetary effects of individual provisions from the effects of other factors such as intervening actions or subsequent legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Estimated NPR Savings Were Claimed Twice", "paragraphs": ["In two instances, OMB counted some of the estimated savings NPR claimed twice. In the first instance, OMB counted the same estimated savings on two different NPR I initiatives\u2014once for agency-specific changes (from reorganizing USDA) and again as part of a NPR governmentwide initiative to reduce the bureaucracy. In the second instance, OMB appears to have counted the same savings twice when separately estimating savings from the two NASA recommendations we reviewed. Therefore, the total estimated savings NPR claimed in both of these instances were overstated.", "OMB estimated that $770 million in cost savings resulted from NPR\u2019s recommendation to reorganize USDA on the basis of workforce reductions. OMB also counted these workforce reductions when estimating the total of $54.8 billion in savings NPR claimed from its governmentwide initiative to reduce the size of the bureaucracy. While acknowledging that this occurred, OMB officials stated that the level of double counting appeared to be quite small in relation to total NPR savings\u2014less than 1 percent of the total savings claimed from NPR recommendations. They said that the double counting was small because the recommendation to reorganize USDA was the only agency-specific recommendation with a significant staffing effect.", "However, OMB officials told us that they had not established a mechanism to prevent double counting from savings claimed for the agency-specific recommendations and from the governmentwide initiative. Officials from the other two agencies we reviewed\u2014DOE and NASA\u2014said that their staff also had been reduced and counted as part of the savings claimed for the agency-specific recommendations to streamline DOE and strengthen NASA management. Therefore, in the absence of OMB processes to guard against including savings from personnel reductions in both agency- specific and governmentwide savings claims, additional double counting of workforce reductions could have occurred.", "In the second instance, a portion of the estimated savings appears to have been counted twice for two NASA recommendations we reviewed, one from NPR I (to strengthen and restructure NASA management) and the other from NPR II (to reinvent NASA). Some of the actions NPR recommended, such as restructuring NASA centers, were components of both the NPR I and NPR II recommendations. The OMB examiner acknowledged that some of the savings could have been counted twice and that there was no mechanism to distinguish the sweeping changes that were occurring at NASA. She said that the NPR II recommendation built on the NPR I recommendation. NASA officials also said that they were not able to assign savings precisely to one recommendation or the other because the recommendations were similar and there was no clear demarcation where one ended and the other began.", "OMB estimated savings from the NPR I recommendation for fiscal years 1994 through 1999 and from the NPR II recommendation for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Estimated savings from both recommendations were included when OMB aggregated total NPR-estimated savings. As figure 2 shows, a portion of the savings claimed from these two recommendations overlapped during fiscal years 1996 through 1999. For those years, claimed savings totaled about $7 billion (about $1.6 billion from the NPR I recommendation and about $5.4 billion from the NPR II recommendation).
