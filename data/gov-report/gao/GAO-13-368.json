To obtain a range  of perspectives, we selected five publishers that represented over 85  percent of new U.S. higher education textbook sales, according to  information they provided us, as well as three smaller publishers. In  addition, we reviewed the websites of a nationally representative,  stratified random sample of 150 2-year and 4-year public, private  nonprofit, and private for-profit postsecondary schools to determine the  extent to which they have disclosed textbook information. The sample  was drawn from the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which contains data on  over 7,200 institutions eligible for federal student aid programs. We  assessed the reliability of the IPEDS data and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In order to review comparable  information across schools, we examined available textbook information  for an introductory business, psychology, and biology course at each  school in our sample. The percentage estimates reported from this review have margins of error of 9 percentage points or less, unless  otherwise noted. All statistical tests and the margins of error were  constructed using a 95-percent confidence level. In cases where we were  unable to find or access textbook information online for a particular  school, we contacted the school to determine how to access it and  followed up with representatives as appropriate to determine the reasons  why the information was not available online. We collected complete  information for all 150 schools in our sample, resulting in a response rate  of 100 percent. While we reviewed documentation of publisher and school  efforts to implement the textbook provisions, we did not conduct a review  of any entity\u2019s legal compliance. Based on the results of our review of  school websites, we conducted follow-up interviews regarding the  implementation of the textbook provisions and the associated costs and  benefits with various representatives from eight schools, including seven  groups of administrators, four campus bookstores, three faculty groups,  and three student government groups. To select this subset of eight  schools, we took into account characteristics such as level (2-year or 4- year), sector (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit), and geographic  location. We also interviewed representatives from two national campus  retailers that operate hundreds of bookstores nationwide, a textbook  rental company, a company that provides price comparison software for  campus bookstores, and professional organizations that represent  publishers, bookstores, faculty, students, and schools.

First,  publishers develop and produce textbooks and accompanying materials  for faculty and students. Publishers then market their materials to faculty,  school administrators, and sometimes academic departments that make  decisions about what course materials to assign to students. Publishers  employ sales representatives who often speak with instructors in person  to discuss product options. They also provide instructors with free sample  materials for their consideration.", "Publishers produce a variety of products and services for faculty to  choose from in selecting course materials. In addition to traditional  textbooks, faculty can work with publishers to create customized course  materials by adding or deleting information from a single textbook or  multiple sources. Faculty may also select supplemental materials, such  as workbooks, lab activities, and study guides. Supplemental materials  and textbooks may be sold together in one package, referred to as a  bundle, and may also be available for sale separately. In addition to print  versions, course materials are often available as digital products that can  be accessed on computers or e-readers. Publishers have also developed  online interactive systems that integrate multimedia instructional material  with supplemental materials like homework or personalized quizzes and  tutorials.", "Faculty or other designated parties select course materials and submit  orders for them according to the process and time frames established by  their school. Upon receiving information about selected materials and  enrollment numbers from the school, campus bookstores determine how  many to order and stock. These school-affiliated bookstores may include  independent booksellers and large retail chains. They generally sell both  new and used books, and some offer digital products and textbook rental  programs. Many campus bookstores also have websites through which  students can purchase or rent textbooks online. In addition to campus  bookstores, students may be able to obtain course materials from a  variety of sources. For example, students may purchase or rent course  materials from online retailers, publishers, or through peer-to-peer  exchanges, among other outlets. They may also borrow materials from  libraries or peers. An emerging source of course materials is the open  source model, in which textbooks and other materials are published under  a license that allows faculty to personally adapt materials and students to  access them for free or for a nominal cost. Table 1 below summarizes  common options available for obtaining course materials.", "After completing a course, students may be able to offset their costs by  selling back their course materials to the campus bookstore, online  retailers, or wholesale companies. Bookstores generally buy as many  used textbooks from their students as possible, but there are limits to  what students can sell back. For example, electronic products are  generally not eligible for resale because they are accessible through one- time access codes or downloading. Opportunities to sell back customized  course materials may also be limited given their uniqueness to a  particular course on a particular campus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pricing and Spending", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we reported  that new college textbook prices had risen at twice the rate of annual  inflation over the course of nearly two decades, increasing at an average  of 6 percent per year and following close behind increases in tuition and  fees. More recent data show that textbook prices continued to rise from  2002 to 2012 at an average of 6 percent per year, while tuition and fees  increased at an average of 7 percent and overall prices increased at an  average of 2 percent per year.

For example,  one publisher told us it made the decision to make its bundled products  available for sale individually prior to HEOA\u2019s enactment because it  wanted to be more transparent about its product offerings. Another  publisher said that most of its bundled materials were available for sale  individually by 2004, and in response to HEOA, it only had to change its  external website to allow faculty to view the individual components. In  contrast, another publisher noted that in response to HEOA, it had to  begin setting prices for all bundled components and change its process  for storing them.

Our review of a nationally representative sample of  school websites shows that bundles continue to be assigned for some  courses.

They added that a new textbook could cost over $200, which is  more than the course fee of $136. These faculty also said that as a result  of HEOA, more faculty are providing information about textbook  selections in their syllabi as early as possible, and are putting books on  reserve in the library. In addition, several faculty from different schools  reported using the same textbook for multiple semesters, which allows  students to buy a used version at a reduced price. At one public school,  faculty told us their school\u2019s guidelines encourage them to consider both  the price of course materials and the use of the same edition of a  textbook for as long as possible. With regard to other cost-saving  solutions, a few faculty told us they have developed their own course  materials. For example, one professor said a lab manual for his course  could cost $50-$60 when developed by a publisher; instead, he created  his own, which costs students about $10 in printing fees.

Representatives we spoke with at one such private for- profit, 2-year school that offers medical, business, and technical programs  told us the school has a centralized curriculum and standardized  textbooks for each program across its 10 campuses, allowing it to  purchase textbooks and materials in bulk at lower prices and pass the  savings on to its students.

Representatives of another national campus retailer we  spoke with said their costs were more considerable because they  developed software to help their schools comply. We also heard from  representatives of two higher education associations, which represent  over a thousand schools nationwide, that implementation of the HEOA  textbook information provisions had gone smoothly and that they did not  hear about any complaints from their member schools.", "Schools varied in their approach to implementing the HEOA provisions.  Some schools that provided textbook information online relied on their  campus bookstores to provide it, according to school administrators and  national campus retailers. For example, administrators we spoke with at  four schools said they provided textbook information to students by  adding links from their schools\u2019 online course schedules to their  bookstores\u2019 websites, which in some cases involved linking school and  bookstore databases so that students could go directly from the course  schedule to the bookstore\u2019s list of textbook information for each course.  Administrators at two of these schools said this approach was simpler  and more cost-effective than other options they considered. Another  school went a step further and provided textbook information directly on  the school\u2019s course schedule. Specifically, administrators said they used  a web-based tool from the company that managed their bookstore to  display textbook information directly on the school\u2019s online course  schedule, at no additional cost to the school. A student at this school told  us it was helpful to have course and textbook information available in one  place. However, administrators at another school that considered this  approach, but ultimately included a link to the bookstore website instead,  said it would have required substantial resources and maintenance to  implement. Besides providing textbook information to students, schools  also submitted the number of students enrolled in each course to their  campus bookstores, as outlined by HEOA. Administrators at four schools  we spoke with said they provide this information electronically by  transferring it from their course registration database to the campus  bookstore\u2019s database.", "Some bookstores moved up their deadlines for faculty to submit their  textbook choices as a result of implementing the HEOA provisions.  Specifically, representatives from an industry trade group representing  school bookstores said some of their members moved their fall deadlines  up by as many as 2 months to provide textbook information to students at  the time of preregistration. Representatives of two campus bookstores  and both national campus retailers we spoke with reported that getting  faculty to submit their textbook choices by the deadlines had already  been a challenge prior to HEOA. However, faculty we spoke with at one  school, as well as representatives from two campus bookstores and an  industry trade group, acknowledged there may be legitimate reasons why  textbook choices are not submitted by the deadline, such as a given  course having no instructor assigned.", "Students, faculty, school administrators, and most other stakeholders we  spoke with said students have benefited from having timely and reliable  textbook information. As faculty submit more complete and timely  textbook information, schools are better able to provide that information to  students, according to faculty at one school and representatives from a  campus bookstore and an industry trade group. Representatives of  student organizations at three schools said they now have sufficient  information and time to shop for their course materials before each  academic term. Students told us they use ISBNs found on their campus  bookstore\u2019s website to actively research textbook prices at both the  campus bookstore and other retailers, and that they make better  spending decisions as a result. Students at one school said researching  their options to find the highest quality materials for the lowest cost is  easy and worth the little time it takes. For example, one student estimated  she saves about $150 per semester by being able to compare prices  among multiple retailers. Students at one of the three schools said their  campus bookstore includes competitors\u2019 prices on its website, allowing  students to see which retailer offers the lowest price for a given textbook.  While students said price is the biggest factor affecting their decisions  about obtaining textbooks, they also consider how they want to use the  books and how long they want to keep them. For example, students at  three schools mentioned that some students prefer to highlight or take  notes in print versions of books rather than mark up digital books.  Students also said they are able to obtain ISBNs and other information in  enough time to acquire their required textbooks by the first day of class.  Students further benefit from increased information on the options for  obtaining textbooks, such as institutional rental programs, according to  representatives from one bookstore and an industry trade group we  interviewed. In addition to talking to students and other stakeholders, we  reviewed 153 entries from Education\u2019s Program Compliance Complaints  Tracking System from July 2010 through April 2012 that mentioned the  word \u201cbook.\u201d While we found several entries related to the timing of  financial aid for purchasing books, our review yielded no complaints  related to the HEOA textbook provisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As the cost of attending college continues to rise, students and their  families need clear and early information about the cost of textbooks. In  implementing HEOA\u2019s textbook provisions, publishers and schools have  provided them with increased access to such information. Greater  transparency of information alone, however, does not make textbooks  less expensive, as the affordability of course materials results from the  complex market forces that drive prices. Moreover, the textbook market is  different from other commodity markets; although students are the end  consumers, faculty are responsible for selecting which textbooks students  will need, thereby limiting students\u2019 ability to allay costs. Nevertheless, the  proliferation of new products, formats, and delivery channels has left  students with many options for obtaining course materials. For example,  students can now choose whether to realize savings upfront by selecting  digital or rental options, or on the back end by reselling books in the used  book market. In light of the increased complexity of students\u2019 options, the  information schools have provided in implementing HEOA has proven  useful to students in making informed decisions. As a result, even though  students cannot directly control the cost of their textbooks, they can better  manage these costs by comparison shopping and making deliberate  decisions about what to purchase, and from where."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to the Department of Education for review  and comment.

To obtain a range of perspectives, we selected  five publishers that represented over 85 percent of new U.S. higher  education textbook sales, according to information they provided us, as  well as three smaller publishers. The views of publishers we spoke with  cannot be generalized to all publishers. While we reviewed  documentation of publisher efforts to provide information to faculty and  make bundled materials available for sale individually, we did not  evaluate whether these practices, as supported by documentation or  described to us in interviews, were in compliance with the law. We also  interviewed others with relevant expertise, including faculty groups at  three schools, two national campus retailers that operate hundreds of  bookstores nationwide, a textbook rental company, a company that  provides price comparison software for campus bookstores, and  professional organizations that represent publishers, bookstores, faculty,  students, and schools.", "To determine the extent to which postsecondary schools have provided  students and college bookstores access to textbook information, we  reviewed websites of a nationally representative, stratified random  sample of 150 schools to determine the extent to which they disclosed  textbook information in their fall 2012 course schedules. The sample was  drawn from Education\u2019s 2010-2011 Integrated Postsecondary Education  Data System (IPEDS), which contains data on over 7,200 institutions  eligible for federal student aid programs authorized under Title IV of the  Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. We assessed the reliability of  the IPEDS data by reviewing Education\u2019s quality control procedures and  testing the data electronically. We determined the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Our sampling frame consisted of all public,  private nonprofit, and private for-profit 2-year and 4-year degree-granting  postsecondary schools that participated in Title IV federal student aid  programs, had undergraduate programs, were not U.S. military  academies, and had at least 100 students, yielding a universe of 4,293  schools. We created six strata to stratify the sampling frame by sector  (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit) and level (2-year and 4- year). This sample of schools allowed us to make national estimates  about the availability of textbook information, as well as estimates by  sector and level. The percentage estimates reported from this review  have margins of error at the 95 percent confidence level of 9 percentage  points or less, unless otherwise noted. In order to review comparable  information across the sampled schools, we developed a standardized  web-based data collection instrument and pre-tested it in July 2012.  Using the finalized data collection instrument, we examined available  textbook information for an introductory business, psychology, and  biology course at each school in our sample. We judgmentally selected  these subjects because they are among the top 10 undergraduate majors  for degree-completing students, according to IPEDS data. In addition,  these courses likely affect a larger number of students than upper division  courses. We reviewed school websites from July through September  2012, as students would be obtaining textbooks for their fall 2012 term  courses. In cases where we were unable to find or access textbook  information online for a particular school, we contacted the school to  determine how to access it and followed up with representatives as  appropriate to determine the reasons why information was not available  online. We recorded and verified the information we obtained in the web- based data collection instrument to facilitate the analysis across schools.  We collected complete information for all 150 schools in our sample,  resulting in a response rate of 100 percent.", "Based on the results of our review of school websites, we conducted  follow-up interviews regarding the implementation of the HEOA textbook  provisions and the associated costs and benefits with various  representatives from eight schools in our sample, including seven groups  of administrators, four campus bookstores, three faculty groups, and  three student government groups. (See table 2 for a list of schools.) To  select this subset of eight schools, we took into account characteristics  such as sector, level, and geographic location.", "To provide background information on changes in the prices of textbooks  over time, we reviewed public data from 2002-2012 from the Consumer  Price Index (CPI) published by the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI data reflect changes over time in the  prices paid by urban consumers for different goods and services.  Specifically, we reviewed CPI data for three expenditure categories:  college textbooks, college tuition and fees, and overall prices. The college  textbooks data are limited to the price of new print and digital books. In  addition, the timeframes for collecting price information in the field vary,  so different textbooks may be priced at different times. We assessed the  reliability of these data by reviewing documentation of the CPI data and  interviewing BLS officials about the methodology used to calculate the  data. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our study. We provided BLS with an opportunity to review our  use of the CPI data.", "In addition, we reviewed complaints submitted to Education to determine  whether any were related to the information provided by schools about  required textbooks. Specifically, Education provided GAO with an excerpt  from its Program Compliance Complaints Tracking System containing any  complaints in which the word \u201cbook\u201d appeared. There were 153 such  complaints from July 2010, when the HEOA textbook provisions went into  effect, through April 2012. We took steps to verify the reliability of the  data. We interviewed Education officials about the methodology used to  calculate the data and determined they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.
