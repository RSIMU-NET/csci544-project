To obtain value from these properties, some agencies have used EULs, which are generally long-term agreements to lease property from the federal government in exchange for cash or non-cash consideration. However, agencies also incur costs for EUL programs. We have previously reported that agencies should include all costs associated with programs\u0092 activities when assessing their values.

However, some agencies we reviewed do not include all costs associated with their EULs when they assess the performance of their EUL programs. Guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not specify what costs agencies should include in their EUL evaluations, resulting in variance among agencies. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of State do not consistently attribute EUL-related costs of consultant staff who administer the leases, and VA does not attribute various administrative costs that offset EUL benefits. Without fully accounting for all EUL costs, agencies may overstate the net benefits of their EUL programs.", "Based on recent agency experiences, EULs may be a viable option for redeveloping underutilized federal real property when disposal is not possible or desirable, but two agencies raised issues pertaining to EUL use that affect their use or budgetary treatment. First, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials said that the limit on its authority to receive in-kind consideration as part of its EUL program has limited its ability to encourage the use of EULs for underutilized NASA property. Specifically, NASA officials said prospective lessees are reluctant to make costly capital improvements to a property that will have to be returned to the government at the end of the lease without other compensation, such as a reduction in cash rent. Second, VA and CBO disagree on the extent to which VA should account for the budget impacts for EULs that could include long-term government commitments. VA has made multi-year commitments with certain EULs without fully reporting them in its budget. Assessing and recognizing the budget impacts of EULs is complicated and may be interpreted differently by agencies with EUL authority. In particular, VA EULs can include long-term commitments that are recognized in the federal budget in different ways."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To promote transparency about EULs, improve decision-making regarding EULs and ensure more accurate accounting of EUL benefits, GAO recommends that OMB coordinate with affected agencies to ensure that agencies consistently attribute all relevant costs associated with EULs to their EUL programs. Agencies generally agreed with our findings and recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government owns many underutilized properties that are  costly to operate. However, closing or disposing of them can present  challenges, including covering the costs associated with federal real  property disposal, addressing legal requirements agencies must adhere  to, such as requirements for screening and environmental cleanup, and  negotiating competing stakeholder interests that can arise over the  disposal of property. We have designated federal real property  management as a high-risk area, in part because of the presence of  underutilized properties. As an alternative to increased agency use or  disposal, some agencies initiated enhanced use lease (EUL) programs.  EULs are typically long-term lease agreements that allow public or private  entities to use the property. Agency EUL programs have allowed entities  to develop or occupy federal properties such as power plants, housing  and healthcare facilities, office space, and parking facilities, and in return,  federal agencies receive cash or in-kind consideration. However,  agencies also incur costs for EUL programs. We have previously reported  that in any assessment of the cost/benefit of an agency\u2019s activities, all  program costs should generally be included and any excluded costs  should be disclosed and explained. In 2011, we raised concerns about  how the Department of Defense monitored the costs of its EUL program.To help inform the discussion surrounding agencies\u2019 recent use of EULs  to manage their federal real property portfolio, you asked us to examine  issues related to these leases. Specifically, we addressed the following  research questions:  1.  To what extent do agencies attribute the full benefits and costs of their  EULs in their assessments of their EUL programs?  2.  What have been the experiences of agencies using their EUL  authority?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed prior GAO reports on enhanced-  use leasing and capital financing and identified agencies as candidates  for a detailed review of EUL use. To identify candidate agencies, we  used Federal Real Property Profile data; the General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) 2008 document Real Property Authorities for  Federal Agencies; a prior GAO report on enhanced use leasing; and  interviews with officials at the four agencies that indicated they use  EULs\u2014the the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of State  (State), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). We reviewed relevant  documentation related to these agencies\u2019 enhanced use leasing,  including laws providing agencies with EUL authority, and agencies\u2019 EUL  guidance. We also interviewed agency officials involved with developing  and managing EULs. We chose a sample of 16 EULs from among the  four agencies to review as case studies. We selected this sample to  represent a variety of (1) lease purposes (e.g., leasing vacant land for  development and leasing unused office space); (2) estimated financial  benefits (e.g., cash benefits and in-kind consideration); and (3)  geographic locations. We conducted site visits at nine of the 16 case  study locations to observe the properties.NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California; VA sites in  Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington; and a USDA agricultural  research center in Beltsville, Maryland. We interviewed agency officials  and lessees about their experiences with EULs at these locations. In  addition, we interviewed State officials about that department\u2019s EULs for  properties located in Istanbul, Turkey; Paris, France; and Singapore. See  appendix II for a list of case studies and descriptions of the properties and  lessee uses. We reviewed the agreements between VA and its lessees  and the past work of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the  VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General on VA\u2019s EULs in Chicago, Illinois; North  Chicago, Illinois; and Mountain Home, Tennessee.

In particular, VA EULs can include long-term commitments  that are recognized in the federal budget in different ways. OMB\u2019s  Circular No. A-11 guidance specifies that lease obligations be recorded  when the contract is signed; sufficient budget authority must be available  at that time to cover the obligation. However, the obligated amount that is  to be recorded differs by type of lease. For capital leases and lease  purchases, OMB Circular A-11 states that the amount obligated should  equal the net present value of these lease payments over the full term of  the lease. For operating leases, OMB Circular A-11 states that agencies  should record an amount equal to the total payments under the full term  of the lease or the first year\u2019s lease payments plus cancellation costs.VA views EUL leasebacks as operating leases and consequently does  not obligate the total amount of these commitments upfront in its budget.  VA\u2019s leaseback costs are nearly $16 million annually (see table 3), but VA  and CBO disagree on the extent to which VA should account for the  budget impacts for EULs that could include long-term government  commitments. For example, VA\u2019s leaseback costs for its Chicago West  Side EUL were about $3.5 million in fiscal year 2011. VA regards its  underlying office and parking purchase agreements as 2-year operating  leases, as opposed to capital leases or lease purchases. VA officials said  that the department is properly treating the office and parking purchase  agreements as operating leases, because VA can cancel the office and  parking leasebacks at the end of each 2-year agreement. However, in a  2003 report to Congress on the budgetary treatment of leases, CBO  found that VA used this enhanced use lease to obtain a $60 million  regional headquarters building and parking facility. The CBO report stated  that VA entered into a 35-year enhanced use lease for a four-acre site  with an owner trust, with VA as the sole named beneficiary. VA  subsequently leased back space in the building and the parking facility  that the lessee constructed on the site.", "The CBO report also stated that:", "VA\u2019s lease payments played a crucial role in allowing the lessee to  borrow funds. VA is committed to a two-year lease of 95 percent of  the space in the building and 95 percent of the parking facility; almost  all of the lessee\u2019s revenue will initially come from VA.", "The initial two-year lease is automatically renewed unless the VA  takes specific steps at the end of the lease period to halt it. In  addition, as long as VA chooses to occupy any portion of the facility it  must make payments that are sufficient to cover amortization and  interest on the lessee\u2019s debt.", "VA also has the right to purchase the building from the lessee at any  time for a price that would cover payments on the lessee\u2019s debt.", "Thus, VA has a long-term commitment to cover the lessee\u2019s capital  costs even if it reduces its occupancy in the building, and this,  together with an implicit right to renew the lease, would appear to  make the arrangement either a lease-purchase or, if the trust is not  viewed as a separate entity from VA, a government purchase  financed by federal borrowing.", "As such, CBO concluded in its report that the intent of the West Side EUL  project was to provide VA with capital assets (an office building and  parking facilities for VA staff) without recording the cost of the purchase  upfront in the budget. In general, we have also consistently stated that  the full costs of the government\u2019s commitments should be reflected  upfront in the budget.officials said the agency made changes in subsequent EULs to address  and in their view eliminate CBO\u2019s early concerns related to EULs with  leasebacks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have shown that EULs have the potential to produce mission- related and financial benefits for otherwise underutilized federal real  property, but the costs and benefits of these programs are not fully  understood, given different agency practices in accounting for EUL costs.
