FHA mortgage insurance protects lenders against financial losses stemming from a borrower\u2019s default. When default occurs, a lender may elect to assign the mortgage to HUD and file an insurance claim with HUD for the unpaid principal balance of the loan. As of September 30, 2001, FHA had approximately 15,000 multifamily mortgages in its insured portfolio, with a total unpaid principal balance of about $55 billion. In May 2000, HUD implemented a program called Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) to expedite and standardize the insurance application process for its most frequently used multifamily loan programs. Similar to HUD\u2019s Direct Endorsement program for single-family housing lenders, a key feature of the MAP program is its delegation of significant responsibilities to multifamily housing lenders for underwriting the loans that FHA insures. To mitigate its financial risks, HUD developed controls and procedures designed to ensure that lenders participating in the MAP program are qualified and are complying with FHA\u2019s underwriting standards. HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing and multifamily housing field offices are responsible for implementing these controls and procedures.", "In April 2000, we reported on weaknesses in HUD\u2019s oversight of single- family lenders participating in the Direct Endorsement program.Concerned that similar problems might exist with multifamily lenders, you asked us to provide information on HUD\u2019s oversight of lenders participating in the MAP program. Accordingly, our report addresses the following questions: (1) How well does HUD ensure that lenders participating in the MAP program meet HUD\u2019s qualification requirements? (2) How well is HUD implementing its processes for reviewing and monitoring MAP lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans? (3) Has HUD held any MAP lenders accountable for noncompliance with program requirements? To address these questions, we reviewed the activities of HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing and 8 of its 51 multifamily field offices in Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Fort Worth, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; San Antonio, Texas; and San Francisco, California. Our work focused on the 35 new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans insured under the MAP program by these 8 offices between May 2000 and August 2001, and the 20 lenders that made these loans. The 35 loans had a total value of approximately $500 million, or about 75 percent of the value of all new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans insured under the MAP program during that period. The 20 lenders accounted for about half of those that made MAP loans during that timeframe. Appendix II provides detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established by the National Housing Act, FHA administers several programs that support multifamily housing for low- and moderate-income families by insuring loans made by private lenders. Specifically, these programs insure mortgage loans for the construction, purchase, substantial rehabilitation, and refinancing of multifamily apartments and health care facilities. FHA insures most of its mortgages for multifamily housing under its General Insurance Fund and Special Risk Insurance Fund. To cover lenders\u2019 losses, FHA collects insurance premiums that borrowers pay to the lenders and deposits the premiums into the funds. In addition, because the funds were not designed to be self sustaining, Congress provides budget authority as part of FHA\u2019s budget each fiscal year to cover anticipated costs\u2014known as \u201ccredit subsidy costs\u201d\u2014for some of the multifamily insurance programs. In fiscal year 2001, Congress provided $101 million in credit subsidy budget authority to FHA.", "When a default occurs on an insured loan, the lender may elect to assign the mortgage to HUD\u2014effectively making the Department the new lender for the mortgage\u2014and file an insurance claim with HUD for the unpaid principal balance of the loan. As a result, the lender is protected from financial losses stemming from a borrower\u2019s default. FHA\u2019s multifamily insurance programs also benefit borrowers by providing favorable financing terms. For example, under one of the programs, nonprofit borrowers can finance up to 100 percent of a project\u2019s replacement costs, and for-profit borrowers can finance up to 90 percent of these costs. As of September 30, 2001, FHA had about 15,000 multifamily mortgages in its insured portfolio, with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $55 billion.", "To obtain an FHA-insured loan, a prospective borrower must use a lender approved by HUD\u2019s Lender Approval and Recertification Division, and the HUD-approved lender, in turn, must submit a mortgage insurance application to HUD. HUD\u2019s multifamily housing field offices\u2014comprising 18 \u201chubs\u201d and their associated 33 program centers\u2014are responsible for processing the applications and approving or rejecting them. Historically, these responsibilities included the bulk of the loan underwriting duties, such as preparation of the property appraisal, mortgage credit analysis, and other loan exhibits. Because this process was often slow and inefficient, in 1994 HUD developed an expedited approach for processing loan insurance applications\u2014known as \u201cfast-track\u201d\u2014that delegated certain underwriting functions to the lenders. About 30 of HUD\u2019s field offices eventually adopted fast-track processing, but, according to HUD, variations existed among the offices regarding the extent of the functions delegated to the lenders and the thoroughness of the offices\u2019 review of loan documents.", "In order to standardize the responsibilities of both lenders and the field offices, in May 2000, HUD implemented the Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) program for several of its insurance programs, including the most widely used programs. HUD\u2019s objective for the MAP program was to provide a consistent, reliable, and expedited process that would enable FHA to insure more loans while limiting risk to the FHA insurance funds. To accomplish this objective, HUD, among other things, developed a new guidebook for lenders and HUD staff and established set time frames for the mortgage insurance application and review process. In addition, although HUD delegated significant underwriting responsibilities to the lenders, it continued to retain the final underwriting decision authority. Under MAP, a lender\u2019s insurance application goes through a two-stage review process. The first stage, called \u201cpre-application,\u201d focuses on the overall eligibility and feasibility of the property to be insured (for example, whether a sufficient market exists for the property). If an application passes this stage, HUD invites the lender to submit a complete set of underwriting exhibits as part of the second stage, known as \u201cfirm commitment.\u201d If the application passes this stage and the borrower agrees to accept the conditions of the FHA mortgage insurance agreement, the loan becomes FHA-insured.", "Although only about 30 percent of all multifamily loans insured by FHA in fiscal year 2001 were insured through the MAP program, HUD expects that in subsequent years the large majority of its insured multifamily loans will be MAP loans. During fiscal year 2001, HUD insured 212 loans under the MAP program, with a total value of about $1.5 billion. As shown in figure 1, this total was about equally divided between new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans and refinancing and acquisition loans.", "To mitigate the financial risks of the MAP program, HUD established controls and procedures covering the (1) approval of MAP lenders, (2) review and monitoring of lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans, and (3) sanctioning of poorly performing lenders. Specifically:   HUD requires HUD-approved lenders wanting to participate in the MAP program to apply to the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division within HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing. The division is responsible for reviewing documentation submitted by the lender and deciding whether or not the lender meets the MAP program\u2019s qualification standards. In addition, for every mortgage insurance application submitted by a MAP lender, the cognizant HUD multifamily field office is required to review the qualifications of the lender\u2019s staff involved in making the loan. As of March 2002, HUD had approved about 100 lenders to participate in the MAP program.", "HUD\u2019s multifamily field offices are responsible for conducting and documenting reviews of MAP mortgage insurance applications and associated loan exhibits (for example, appraisal, market study) to ensure lenders\u2019 compliance with HUD\u2019s underwriting requirements. At both stages of the application process, a team of technical specialists, known as a MAP team, with expertise in the areas of architecture, property appraisal, mortgage credit, and building costs reviews the application and its associated underwriting exhibits. The MAP team may require the lender to correct underwriting deficiencies uncovered by the reviews. After each stage of review, the team\u2019s supervisor, called the MAP team leader, is required to provide a recommendation to the field office director on whether to accept or reject the application. On the basis of the team leader\u2019s recommendation, the field office director decides whether or not to insure the loan. The field offices are to complete each stage of their reviews within 45 to 60 days, depending on the type of loan. To further monitor MAP lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans and to oversee the work of the field offices, teams of field staff assigned to HUD\u2019s Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division are to conduct comprehensive reviews of samples of loans already approved for mortgage insurance. These reviews focus on the same four technical areas that the field offices analyze in reviewing an insurance application. After completing a review, the teams are to document their findings and recommendations in written reports, which are to be reviewed and approved by the division\u2019s director. Upon approval, the reports are issued to the cognizant lender and multifamily field office. If HUD determines that a lender is not complying with program requirements, HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing may take enforcement actions against the lender.

However, we also found that HUD sometimes lacked a sufficient basis for determining whether the lenders\u2019 underwriters met MAP qualification requirements.

As evidence of its financial soundness, a prospective MAP lender must provide HUD with a recent audited financial statement showing a net worth in excess of $250,000. As evidence of a satisfactory lending record, a lender must submit information on the FHA-insured and conventional multifamily housing loans it made during the previous 5 years. For the lender\u2019s FHA-insured loans, the submission must include a list of the loans that were assigned to HUD for insurance benefits and a narrative explanation of why the assignments occurred. HUD uses this information to (1) determine whether the lender has a recent history of assignments that can be attributed to poor lending practices and (2) ask cognizant multifamily field offices about their experience with the lender.", "To determine whether approved MAP lenders met HUD\u2019s requirements, we examined HUD\u2019s approval files for the 20 lenders that made the 35 new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans we reviewed during our visits to eight of HUD\u2019s multifamily field offices. We found that all 20 lenders provided the required documentation and that the documentation adequately supported HUD\u2019s conclusion that the lenders met the criteria for financial soundness and satisfactory lending records. Specifically, we found that 19 of the 20 lenders we reviewed submitted the required audited financial statements and that the statements showed the lenders met the net worth requirement. In accordance with HUD\u2019s guidance, the remaining lender was exempted from the requirement because its accounts were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.With respect to lending performance, we used a HUD database containing assignment information to confirm that all 20 lenders submitted complete lists of their assigned loans. The lenders either had no loans assigned to HUD or had few assignments relative to their total number of FHA-insured loans\u2014an indicator of sound lending practices, according to HUD.

The underwriter is an employee of the lender, who is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable requirements and for approving or rejecting a loan on the basis of a review and analysis of the loan exhibits. HUD\u2019s guidance sets forth experience and training requirements for underwriters and requires a prospective MAP lender to submit the resumes of those underwriters who will have responsibility for MAP loans. According to HUD\u2019s guidance, the resumes must demonstrate that these individuals have at least 3 years of recent experience in underwriting multifamily housing loans and have underwritten at least three loans that were funded. In evaluating a prospective MAP lender, the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division within HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing is required to review the resumes and approve those underwriters who meet the requirements. In addition, HUD\u2019s multifamily field offices may subsequently approve additional underwriters who are qualified.", "Lenders frequently have more than one individual who is authorized to underwrite loans. Thus, HUD approved a total of 81 underwriters for the 20 lenders we reviewed. We found, however, that HUD sometimes approved underwriters without having a sufficient basis for determining whether the underwriters met the qualification requirements of the MAP program. Specifically, the resumes for 22 of the 81 underwriters did not provide clear evidence of at least 3 years of recent underwriting experience; and the resumes for 30 did not provide evidence of 3 funded loans. Furthermore, 11 of the resumes did not provide clear evidence that either requirement had been met. (See fig. 2.)", "In some cases, the resumes showed some underwriting experience but less than 3 years of experience. In other cases, the resumes cited experience only in loan administration, processing, or origination\u2014 activities that can encompass a range of duties that may or may not involve significant underwriting responsibilities. Although some HUD officials told us that they knew from first-hand knowledge that the underwriters met HUD\u2019s experience standards, others indicated that they were not aware of the standards, had applied the standards loosely, or had drawn inferences about the underwriters\u2019 qualifications without knowing whether these inferences were accurate. By not applying the qualifications standards in a strict and consistent manner, HUD increases its chances of insuring loans underwritten by individuals who lack sufficient expertise in evaluating financial risk.", "HUD\u2019s guidance states that in addition to having proper experience, an underwriter must attend a MAP training session before submitting a mortgage insurance application to HUD. The main objective of the training is to familiarize the underwriter with the MAP process and the roles and responsibilities of both the lender and HUD under this process. HUD\u2019s multifamily field offices are responsible for ensuring that the underwriters who submit insurance applications have met the training requirement. During our visits to HUD\u2019s multifamily field offices, we reviewed 35 loans submitted by 22 separate underwriters. Our review of HUD\u2019s training records indicated that only 10 of the 22 underwriters attended MAP training. Without proper assurance that underwriters are trained, HUD increases the likelihood that MAP underwriters will not be familiar with the program\u2019s requirements and will make errors that increase HUD\u2019s review time and insurance risk. Field office officials acknowledged that they did not always verify whether underwriters had attended MAP training, citing incomplete local training records and the absence of a nationwide list of trained underwriters as factors that made this verification difficult. To help address this problem, the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division in January 2002 developed a nationwide list of trained underwriters. In addition, the division director told us that better attendance records would be kept at future MAP training sessions.", "HUD inconsistently applied its qualifications standards for the underwriters we reviewed largely because of a lack of clear guidance. For example, HUD\u2019s guidance for approving underwriters does not clearly define the meaning of \u201cunderwriting experience.\u201d As a result, the HUD officials responsible for approving the underwriters interpreted the guidance differently. One official, for example, said that work in \u201cloan origination\u201d counted as underwriting experience; another official said it did not, because loan origination focuses on the marketing of loans. Similarly, another official told us that he counted property appraising as underwriting experience; another did not. In addition, although HUD\u2019s guidance authorizes the multifamily field offices to approve MAP underwriters, that portion of the guidance does not cite the specific requirements of 3 years of experience and three funded loans.

A quality control plan is an important internal control mechanism because it sets forth a program of independent review designed, among other things, to ensure compliance with HUD\u2019s requirements and to prompt corrective actions when deficiencies are found. For example, a quality control plan may require a lender to have a certain percentage of its loans reviewed either by external auditors or by individuals on the lender\u2019s staff who are independent of the loan processing and underwriting functions.", "Although HUD has implemented specific written standards for single- family housing lenders\u2019 quality control plans, it has not done so for lenders that make multifamily housing loans. According to the Director of HUD\u2019s Lender Approval and Recertification Division\u2014the office responsible for granting lenders HUD-approved status\u2014establishing the standards had not been a high priority because, until the MAP program was implemented, HUD retained primary responsibility for underwriting the multifamily loans insured by FHA. He said that because of the lack of standards, most lenders applying for HUD approval did not submit quality control plans for their multifamily lending operations. Accordingly, in our examination of the division\u2019s files we found a multifamily quality control plan for 1 of the 20 lenders we reviewed.", "Multifamily Housing officials told us that their decision not to require a quality control plan as a condition of MAP approval was influenced by several factors, including (1) the Department\u2019s lack of standards for these plans, (2) the difficulty of developing standards that would be suitable for both large and small lenders, and (3) concerns that lenders would treat the plans as merely a paperwork requirement. In our view, however, the MAP program\u2019s delegation of greater underwriting responsibilities to lenders heightens the need for lenders to implement quality control measures.

Without proper documentation, however, HUD lacks adequate assurance that technical staff are performing thorough reviews and that team leaders\u2019 recommendations to approve insurance applications are properly supported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Offices Did Not Always Ensure Lenders\u2019 Compliance with HUD\u2019s Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In conducting their reviews of MAP insurance applications, field staff are expected to determine whether the lender complied with specific underwriting requirements set forth in HUD\u2019s guidance. To determine the extent to which the field offices ensured lenders\u2019 compliance, we focused on HUD\u2019s requirements for property appraisals, a critical component of loan underwriting. Among other things, HUD\u2019s guidance indicates that an appraisal should (1) use rent and expense information from at least three comparable properties as a basis for estimating the expected rental income and operating expenses of the subject property; (2) update the operating expense estimate for the subject property to the date of the appraisal; (3) account for comparable properties\u2019 occupancy rates and rent concessions\u2014factors that affect rental income\u2014in estimating income for the subject property; and (4) be no more than 120 days old at the time the mortgage insurance application reaches the firm commitment stage. Despite this guidance, however, for the 35 loans we reviewed, we found that the field offices did not always ensure lenders\u2019 compliance with these requirements. The Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division has also found problems with appraisals, as well as deficiencies in other aspects of the loan underwriting.", "Among other things, the appraisal estimates the income (generated primarily from rents) and operating expenses of the property being insured, or \u201csubject\u201d property. As a basis for these estimates, the appraiser uses rent and expense data from existing properties\u2014known as comparable properties\u2014that are as similar as possible to the subject property in size, location, age, and other characteristics. Because no two properties are identical, the appraiser must make adjustments to these rent and expense data to account for differences between the comparable properties and the subject property, and must use the adjusted data as a basis for making estimates regarding the subject property. These estimates are important because a property\u2019s net income (that is, gross income minus expenses) is a major factor in determining the size of the mortgage the property can support and HUD will insure. In general, the higher a property\u2019s net income, the larger the mortgage it can qualify for.", "In accordance with HUD\u2019s guidance, we found that the appraisals for all 35 loans provided rent and expense data from at least three comparable properties as a basis for estimating the subject property\u2019s rental income and operating expenses. In addition, we found that the rent data in the appraisal were consistent with other data sources, and that these data supported the rental income estimate for the subject property. However, the same did not always hold true for the expense data and operating expense estimates. To corroborate the appraisal\u2019s expense data for the comparable properties, we used HUD\u2019s Financial Assessment Subsystem\u2014-a database containing audited financial statements for all HUD-insured and \u2013assisted properties. The appraisals for 10 of the 35 loans we reviewed used one or more comparable properties that were HUD-insured or \u2013assisted and for which corresponding expense information was available in HUD\u2019s database. In 9 of the 10 cases, we found that the appraisals cited lower expenses for the comparable properties than did the corresponding information in the database. The appraisals\u2019 understatement of expenses for the comparable properties ranged from about $28,000 to $270,000 per year. This situation is problematic because an underestimation of expenses can lead to an overestimation of net income and approval of a higher mortgage amount than the property can support. The field office staff who reviewed the appraisals told us that they had not been aware of these discrepancies for most of the properties and, in any event, felt that the operating expense estimates for the subject properties were reasonable based on their experience and knowledge as professional appraisers. However, they also acknowledged that appraisers sometimes made estimates that were not well supported by expense data from comparable properties, as required, and that this practice raised questions about the quality of the appraisals. Some field office staff said they did not try to corroborate the expense data for the comparable properties against information in HUD\u2019s database because this was not a required part of their review and they did not have time to do it. Similarly, Office of Multifamily Housing officials told us that the field offices should not be performing this task because to do so would overstep HUD\u2019s role in relation to the lenders under the MAP program. However, given that HUD, and not the lender, bears the financial risk of a MAP loan, HUD should take reasonable steps to protect its financial interests. Given the importance of the subject property\u2019s estimated operating expenses in determining the mortgage amount that HUD insures, HUD would be prudent to use data in its Financial Assessment Subsystem to help ensure that the estimate is based on accurate information.", "According to HUD\u2019s guidance, the operating expense estimate for the subject property should be updated by the lender to the date of the appraisal. The updating procedure involves the application of an inflation rate to account for the age of the data used to develop the expense estimate. For example, if the data are current as of January 1, 1999 (known as the data\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d), and the appraisal is conducted in January 1, 2001, the expense estimate should be adjusted upward to reflect 2 years of inflation. However, for 27 of the 35 loans we reviewed, we found that the lender did not properly update the expense estimate, and the field office did not require the lender to correct the error. As a result, the operating expense estimates for 9 of these loans were 5 to 9 percent lower than if the updating procedure had been done correctly. When a property\u2019s actual operating expenses are higher than originally estimated, its ability to support the mortgage may be weakened, thereby increasing HUD\u2019s insurance risk. Some field staff told us they did not see a need to correct the errors or inform the lenders of these problems because they felt the magnitude of the understatement was too small to significantly affect HUD\u2019s risk. However, Office of Multifamily Housing officials told us that the operating expenses should always be updated. We also found that some field staff were unclear on how to perform the updating procedure because the instructions in MAP program guidance were vague. The instructions for the updating procedure are located in both a standard HUD appraisal form and in MAP program guidance. However, unlike the form\u2019s instructions, the MAP guidance does not indicate that the effective date of the expense data is the beginning date of the fiscal year in which the expenses were accrued. When the effective date used is not the beginning date of the fiscal year, the time period for which the data are updated is shortened, resulting in an understatement of the expense estimate for the subject property.", "HUD\u2019s guidance also requires that the appraisal account for the comparable properties\u2019 occupancy rates and rent concessions in estimating income for the subject property. Specifically, if the occupancy rate for the comparable property is lower than the occupancy rate estimated for the subject property, the guidance requires that a downward adjustment be made to the comparable property\u2019s rent to reflect this difference. Similarly, if a comparable property is offering rent concessions (for example, first month\u2019s rent free), the rent should again be adjusted downward. When these downward adjustments are not made, the rental income for the subject property can be overestimated, which, in turn, can lead to an overestimation of the property\u2019s net income. Despite HUD\u2019s guidance, however, we found that the appraisals for 11 of the 35 loans did not make adjustments to account for lower occupancy rates at the comparable properties. Furthermore, in 5 cases, no adjustments were made for rent concessions at the comparable properties, even though these concessions were mentioned in the appraisal reports. Although the adjustments in these cases would have been minor and would not have affected the properties\u2019 net income, HUD\u2019s guidance does not make exceptions for such situations. Moreover, none of this noncompliance was documented in the field office\u2019s reviews of the appraisals. Field office staff told us they generally did not bother documenting instances of minor noncompliance or notifying the lender of such problems because (1) doing so would make it more difficult for them to stay within the required review time frames and (2) according to HUD\u2019s guidance, their role as reviewers is to require lenders to correct only those underwriting deficiencies that significantly affect HUD\u2019s insurance risk.", "Finally, HUD guidance states that an appraisal should be no more than 120 days old at the time the lender\u2019s insurance application reaches the firm commitment stage of HUD\u2019s review. When an appraisal is beyond the 120- day point, the guidance permits the lender to update the appraisal in lieu of doing a new one. According to Office of Multifamily Housing officials, the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the appraisal\u2019s conclusions reflect current market conditions. However, for 7 of the 35 loans we reviewed, the age of the appraisals exceeded 120 days and no update was submitted. Specifically, the 7 appraisals ranged from 121 to 251 days old at the firm commitment stage. HUD field office officials told us that they accepted the appraisals without an update because, to their knowledge, market conditions had not changed since the time the appraisal was originally performed.", "The Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division has found similar appraisal deficiencies that were not identified during the field office\u2019s review. These problems included situations where operating expense estimates were not properly updated, rent concessions were not accounted for in estimating income, and the appraisal was over 120 days old. The division has also found deficiencies with other aspects of the field offices\u2019 review, including mortgage credit and architectural problems. These problems included unauthorized financial relationships between borrowers and lenders and noncompliance with building accessibility requirements for the disabled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Offices\u2019 Workloads Often Exceeded HUD\u2019s Standard", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, field office staff cited workload and time constraints as major reasons for some of the implementation problems we found. In addition, some field office managers told us that they needed additional staff to handle their assigned workload. HUD\u2019s risk assessment for the MAP program concluded that a MAP team should be able to review up to four mortgage insurance applications at a time and still meet required processing timeframes. To compare the teams\u2019 workloads against this standard, we determined the number of applications that each MAP team was reviewing at the time of our visits to the eight field offices. Because two of the field offices had two MAP teams apiece, we reviewed a total of 10 teams. As shown in figure 3, we found that 9 of the 10 teams were reviewing more than four applications. For these 9 teams, the number of applications ranged from 5 in Denver and San Francisco to 10 in Baltimore and Phoenix.", "Office of Multifamily Housing officials told us that they were aware that some of the field offices had heavy workloads. To address this problem, the officials said that to a limited extent, they had shifted some of this work to staff in field offices with smaller workloads.

The risk assessment indicated, among other things, that quality assurance efforts would promote lenders\u2019 compliance with program requirements. However, HUD has not fully implemented its quality assurance process. Specifically, although the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division is tasked with implementing this process, it has not (1) achieved its intended staffing level, (2) developed and implemented formal operating procedures, or (3) effectively used the results of its reviews to improve lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans.", "In developing the MAP program, HUD recognized that it had not committed sufficient resources to lender monitoring in the past. Despite this recognition, the Department has not fully staffed its Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division, which is tasked with performing quality assurance reviews of loans already approved for FHA insurance. The division\u2019s staffing plan envisioned that the reviews would be conducted by 15 field-based staff divided into three teams. However, as of March 2002\u2014almost 2 years after the MAP program\u2019s inception\u2014only 4 of the 15 positions had been filled. Although the division performed 24 quality assurance reviews in fiscal year 2001, it had to bring in volunteers from other HUD headquarters and field offices to assist in this work. The division director indicated that the volunteers were not as productive as the permanent staff because they were only temporary and lacked experience in performing reviews. Furthermore, he estimated that with 15 permanent full-time staff, the division could have conducted 75 reviews. The Department has taken steps to deal with the vacant field positions; in February 2002, the division received approval from HUD\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing to fill its staff vacancies. According to HUD officials, the Department will begin hiring for these positions in May 2002, but has not established a target date for filling all of the vacancies. The division also has a vacancy in a headquarters position slated to assist the division director with his responsibilities. However, an Office of Multifamily Housing official told us there was no plan to fill the position until other staffing needs in Multifamily Housing were addressed.", "According to the division director, these staffing problems have contributed to delays in the division\u2019s development of written operating procedures addressing, among other things, how quality assurance reviews should be conducted and how loans and lenders should be targeted for review. Without such procedures, the division cannot ensure that its reviews are performed in a systematic and consistent manner and that its resources are focused on loans and lenders that pose the highest insurance risks to HUD. The division has been in the process of drafting operating procedures since October 2000, but it has relied on a series of individuals detailed from another part of Multifamily Housing to complete this task. According to the division director, turnover in these detailees, the fact that they are not directly accountable to him, competing work priorities, and his lack of an assistant have made it difficult for him to adequately supervise the development of the procedures. At the time of our review, one of the detailees was still working on the procedures but, according to the director, did not have an estimated completion date.", "A key objective of the quality assurance reviews is to improve the MAP lender\u2019s underwriting of loans by conveying findings and recommendations to the lenders through written reports and by identifying serious or recurring underwriting deficiencies and program violations that may require corrective action. In addition, the reviews are also intended to evaluate the field office\u2019s compliance with procedures for approving lenders\u2019 mortgage insurance applications under the MAP program. However, the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division is not fully meeting this objective because it has been slow to communicate the results of its reviews to MAP lenders and field offices and has done limited analysis of the results. For example, during fiscal year 2001, staff completed 24 reviews and submitted draft reports for all of these reviews to the division director for approval and issuance. According to division field staff, conducting a review and drafting the associated report takes about 2 weeks. However, as of March 2002, the division had issued final reports for only 6 of the 24 reviews, even though all 18 of the remaining reviews had been conducted over 6 months earlier. In two cases, the reviews were done over a year earlier. According to the division director, the remaining draft reports have not been finalized because he has not had time to review them. However, by not issuing the reports, HUD is not providing lenders and field offices with timely feedback on problems uncovered by these reviews that may increase HUD\u2019s insurance risk. In addition, the division has not developed a systematic process for aggregating and analyzing the results of its reviews to identify patterns of deficiencies. As a result, it has done limited analysis of the 24 completed reviews to identify recurring underwriting errors and program violations committed by MAP lenders. Even these limited efforts demonstrate the benefits of this kind of analysis. For example, the division observed that several lenders had not, as required, determined whether the properties HUD was insuring complied with accessibility requirements mandated by the Fair Housing Act. Accordingly, the division sent a notice to all MAP lenders reemphasizing the lenders\u2019 responsibility for ensuring compliance with the accessibility requirements. However, further analysis of its reviews would be difficult\u2014particularly as the number of completed reviews increases\u2014without storing the results in an automated spreadsheet or database."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Held Some Lenders Accountable for Specific Violations, but Has Had a Limited Basis for Identifying Lenders with Patterns of Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["To hold MAP lenders accountable for specific violations of program requirements or for exhibiting patterns of noncompliance, HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing can suspend or terminate their ability to participate in the MAP program.

According to HUD\u2019s guidance, violations that directly and adversely affect HUD\u2019s risk may result in termination; violations that do not pose such a risk may result in suspension.", "As of March 2002, HUD had not terminated any MAP lenders, but it had suspended three. Two of the three lenders were suspended because they had prohibited financial relationships with the borrowers. The third lender was suspended because it did not follow HUD\u2019s insurance application process for health care facilities. Specifically, it submitted mortgage insurance applications without first obtaining the required HUD approval of the management agent of these facilities. The duration of the suspensions range from 6 to 12 months. During the term of their suspensions, these lenders are prohibited from submitting additional mortgage insurance applications under the MAP program. The suspensions do not affect insurance applications already being processed by HUD\u2019s field offices. The three suspensions are a result of lender noncompliance with MAP program requirements identified by Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division staff.", "Multifamily Housing officials told us that taking enforcement actions consumes considerable staff time and effort, partly because the actions must be supported well enough to withstand potential court challenges by the lenders. According to HUD officials, two of the three lenders that HUD suspended have challenged the Department\u2019s actions in federal district court. In one case, the lender ultimately withdrew its challenge and served its suspension. In the other case, as of April 2002, the court had not made a ruling, according to Multifamily Housing officials.

Consequently, HUD has had a limited basis for identifying any patterns of noncompliance and, as of March 2002, had not taken enforcement actions against lenders for exhibiting such patterns. The newness of the MAP program has also limited HUD\u2019s ability to identify patterns of deficiencies, because patterns take time to emerge and may only become evident after HUD has performed quality assurance reviews on several of a lender\u2019s loans.

Given the size of this financial commitment and the MAP program\u2019s delegation of significant loan underwriting responsibilities to lenders, it is important that HUD have sufficient controls to mitigate the program\u2019s financial risks. Although HUD has established processes and procedures for this purpose, it has not always consistently or effectively implemented them. Weaknesses in HUD\u2019s lender approval and monitoring efforts, in particular, underscore the need for improvements in its oversight of MAP lenders.", "HUD did not always ensure that the lenders it approved to participate in the MAP program met HUD\u2019s qualification requirements for underwriters. Because the Department\u2019s guidance does not provide clear standards for assessing the experience of lenders\u2019 underwriters, HUD staff applied the guidance inconsistently. In addition, HUD did not ensure that approved underwriters attended required training sessions before submitting insurance applications. When qualification standards are not clear and strictly enforced, HUD increases the potential that MAP underwriters will not be familiar with program requirements and will make errors that could increase HUD\u2019s review time and insurance risk. Although the success of the MAP program rests heavily on the quality of its participating lenders, HUD did not require these lenders to implement quality control plans and did not establish standards for these plans. We believe that implementing such a requirement would help ensure that MAP lenders have the necessary policies and procedures to prevent underwriting deficiencies that could increase HUD\u2019s insurance risk.", "HUD could improve its implementation of processes for reviewing and monitoring MAP lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans. Because field office staff did not always document their reviews of mortgage insurance applications, as required, HUD lacked full assurance that the reviews were thorough and that its decisions to insure loans were properly supported. In addition, field staff did not enforce lenders\u2019 compliance with some requirements for property appraisals, including those designed to ensure that expense estimates for the property being insured are accurate. These problems occurred, in part, because of unclear guidance and heavy workloads. Because a property\u2019s income and expenses are major factors in determining the size of the mortgage, inaccurate estimates can increase HUD\u2019s risk of insuring mortgages that are higher than what the property can support. The consequence of this increased risk is higher potential program costs. Finally, HUD\u2019s monitoring of lenders and field offices through quality assurance reviews has several weaknesses.

Worth, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Francisco. To assess how HUD implemented its process for approving MAP lenders, we focused on the 20 lenders that made the 35 new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans insured under the MAP program by the eight field offices between May 2000 and August 2001. For each of the 20 lenders, we reviewed its application and supporting documents for MAP approval; comments solicited from the field offices about it; and HUD\u2019s records showing the approval of the lender and its underwriters for participation in the program. In addition, we used information from HUD\u2019s F47 database\u2014which provides current and historical information on the multifamily mortgage loans that FHA insures\u2014to verify that the lenders reported all of their FHA-insured loans made during the previous 5 years that were assigned to HUD. We also examined HUD\u2019s training records to determine whether the 22 underwriters who underwrote the 35 loans we reviewed had received MAP program training. Finally, to determine whether HUD had obtained quality control plans from the lenders, we reviewed files maintained by the Department\u2019s Lender Approval and Recertification Division.", "To determine how well HUD implemented processes for reviewing and monitoring MAP lenders\u2019 underwriting of loans, we reviewed HUD\u2019s guidance and procedures for the field offices\u2019 review and approval of mortgage insurance applications. We also interviewed officials from HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing and each of the eight field offices we visited regarding how the reviews are conducted and documented, as well as workload and staffing issues. To assess how HUD implemented the application review process, we focused on the 35 new construction and substantial rehabilitation loans insured under the MAP program by the eight field offices between May 2000 and August 2001. For each of these cases, we reviewed the lender\u2019s mortgage insurance application and associated underwriting exhibits and documentation of HUD\u2019s review and approval of the applications, including review checklists and team leader memos. To assess the extent to which the field offices ensured lenders\u2019 compliance with HUD\u2019s underwriting requirements, we focused on four requirements for property appraisals, a critical aspect of loan underwriting. Specifically, we determined whether the appraisals: 1) used rent and expense information from at least three comparable properties as a basis for estimating the expected rental income and operating expenses of the subject property; 2) updated the expense estimate for the subject property to the date of the appraisal; 3) accounted for the comparable properties\u2019 occupancy rates and rent concessions in estimating rental income for the subject property; and 4) were no more than 120 days old at the time the insurance application reached the firm commitment stage. In making these determinations, we corroborated the rent data used in the appraisals using information in apartment rental guides and Web sites and by contacting apartment leasing offices. Similarly, we corroborated expense data for HUD-insured or -assisted properties used in the appraisals against audited financial statements in HUD\u2019s Financial Assessment Subsystem. We discussed our findings with the field office staff responsible for reviewing the appraisals. Also, we compared the field offices\u2019 workloads at the time of our visits against the workload standard set forth in HUD\u2019s risk assessment for the MAP program. In addition, we reviewed the results of reviews conducted by the Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division to identify underwriting deficiencies uncovered by HUD\u2019s quality assurance process.
