As of November 2002, 18 federal agencies had reported initiating a total of 62 smart card projects. These projects have provided a range of benefits and services, ranging from verifying the identity of people accessing buildings and computer systems to tracking immunization records. To successfully implement such systems, agency managers have faced a number of substantial challenges: (1) sustaining executive-level commitment in the face of organizational resistance and cost concerns; (2) obtaining adequate resources for projects that can require extensive modifications to technical infrastructures and software; (3) integrating security practices across agencies, a task requiring collaboration among separate and dissimilar internal organizations; (4) achieving smart card interoperability across the government; and (5) maintaining the security of smart card systems and privacy of personal information. In helping agencies to overcome these challenges, not only GSA but also the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have roles to play. As the federal government's designated promoter of smart card technology, GSA assists agencies in assessing the potential of smart cards and in implementation. Although GSA has helped agencies significantly by implementing a governmentwide, standards-based contracting vehicle, it has not kept guidance up to date and has not addressed important subjects, such as building security standards, in its guidance. Further, OMB, which is responsible for setting policies for ensuring the security of federal information and systems, has not issued governmentwide policy on adoption of smart cards. In its role of setting technical standards, NIST is responsible for the government smart card interoperability specification, which does not yet address significant emerging technologies. Updated guidance, policy, and standards would help agencies to take advantage of the potential of smart cards to enhance security and other agency operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, technology plays an important role in helping the federal  government provide security for its many physical and information assets.  In particular, \u201csmart cards\u201d offer the potential to significantly improve the  process of verifying the identity of people accessing federal buildings and  computer systems, especially when used in combination with other  technologies, such as biometrics. Further, smart cards can be used to  support other business-related functions, such as tracking immunization  records or storing cash value for electronic purchases. The General  Services Administration (GSA) has promoted the adoption of smart card  technology across government based on a goal, set in 1998, of equipping all  federal employees with a standardized smart card for a wide range of  services.", "This report responds to your request that we review the federal  government\u2019s progress in promoting the use of smart cards as a way to  streamline and better secure interactions between individuals and  government agencies. Specifically, we agreed to assess (1) the extent to  which federal agencies have adopted smart card technologies and realized  the associated benefits, (2) the challenges of adopting smart cards within  federal agencies, and (3) the effectiveness of GSA in promoting the  adoption of smart card technologies within the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Today, federal employees are issued a wide variety of identification (ID)  cards, which are used to access federal buildings and facilities, sometimes  solely on the basis of visual inspection by security personnel. These cards  often cannot be used for other important identification purposes\u2014such as  gaining access to an agency\u2019s computer systems\u2014and many can be easily  forged or stolen and altered to permit access by unauthorized individuals.  In general, the ease with which traditional ID cards\u2014including credit  cards\u2014can be forged has contributed to increases in identity theft and  related security and financial problems for both individuals and  organizations.", "Smart cards are plastic devices about the size of a credit card that contain  an embedded integrated circuit chip capable of both storing and processing  data. Figure 1 shows a typical example of a smart card. The unique  advantage of smart cards\u2014as opposed to cards with simpler technology,  such as magnetic stripes or bar codes\u2014is that smart cards can exchange  data with other systems and process information rather than simply serving  as static data repositories. By securely exchanging information, a smart  card can help authenticate the identity of the individual possessing the card  in a far more rigorous way than is possible with simpler, traditional ID  cards. A smart card\u2019s processing power also allows it to exchange and  update many other kinds of information with a variety of external systems,  which can facilitate applications such as financial transactions or other  services that involve electronic record keeping.", "Smart cards can also be used to significantly enhance the security of an  organization\u2019s computer systems by tightening controls over user access. A  user wishing to log on to a computer system or network with controlled  access must \u201cprove\u201d his or her identity to the system\u2014a process called  authentication. Many systems authenticate users by merely requiring them  to enter secret passwords, which provide only modest security because  they can be easily compromised. Substantially better user authentication  can be achieved by supplementing passwords with smart cards. To gain  access under this scenario, a user is prompted to insert a smart card into a  reader attached to the computer as well as type in a password. This  authentication process is significantly harder to circumvent because an  intruder would need not only to guess a user\u2019s password but also to possess  the same user\u2019s smart card.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved by using smart cards in  conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards can be configured to store  biometric information (such as fingerprint templates or iris scans) in  electronic records that can be retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s  live biometric scan as a means of verifying that person\u2019s identity in a way  that is difficult to circumvent. A system requiring users to present a smart  card, enter a password, and verify a biometric scan provides what security  experts call \u201cthree-factor\u201d authentication, the three factors being  \u201csomething you possess\u201d (the smart card), \u201csomething you know\u201d (the  password), and \u201csomething you are\u201d (the biometric). Systems employing  three-factor authentication are considered to provide a relatively high level  of security. The combination of smart cards and biometrics can provide  equally strong authentication for controlling access to physical facilities.", "Smart cards can also be used in conjunction with PKI technology to better  secure electronic messages and transactions. A properly implemented and  maintained PKI can offer several important security services, including  assurance that (1) the parties to an electronic transaction are really whom  they claim to be, (2) the information has not been altered or shared with  any unauthorized entity, and (3) neither party will be able to wrongfully  deny taking part in the transaction. An essential component is the use of  electronic encryption keys, called \u201cprivate keys,\u201d that are unique to each  user and must be kept secret and secure. For example, storing and using  private keys on a user\u2019s computer leaves them susceptible to attack  because a hacker who gains control of that computer may then be able to  use the private key stored in it to fraudulently sign messages and conduct  electronic transactions. However, if the private key is stored on a user\u2019s  smart card, it may be significantly less vulnerable to attack and  compromise. Security experts generally agree that PKI technology is most  effective when deployed in conjunction with smart cards.", "In addition to enhancing security, smart cards have the flexibility to  support a wide variety of uses not related to security. A typical smart card  in use today can store and process 16 to 32 kilobytes of data, while newer  cards can accommodate 64 kilobytes. The larger the card\u2019s electronic  memory, the more functions can be supported, such as tracking itineraries  for travelers, linking to immunization or other medical records, or storing  cash value for electronic purchases.", "Other media\u2014such as magnetic stripes, bar codes, and optical memory  (laser-readable) stripes\u2014can be added to smart cards to support  interactions with existing systems and services or provide additional  storage capacity. For example, an agency that has been using magnetic  stripe cards for access to certain facilities could migrate to smart cards that  would work with both its existing magnetic stripe readers as well as new  smart card readers. Of course, the functions provided by the card\u2019s  magnetic stripe, which cannot process transactions, would be much more  limited than those supported by the card\u2019s integrated circuit chip. Optical  memory stripes (which are similar to the technology used in commercial  compact discs) can be used to equip a card with a large memory capacity  for storing more extensive data\u2014such as color photos, multiple fingerprint  images, or other digitized images\u2014and making that card and its stored data  very difficult to counterfeit.", "Smart cards are grouped into two major classes: contact cards and  \u201ccontactless\u201d cards. Contact cards have gold-plated contacts that connect  directly with the read/write heads of a smart card reader when the card is  inserted into the device. Contactless cards contain an embedded antenna  and work when the card is waved within the magnetic field of a card reader  or terminal. Contactless cards are better suited for environments where  quick interaction between the card and reader is required, such as high- volume physical access. For example, the Washington Metropolitan Area  Transit Authority has deployed an automated fare collection system using  contactless smart cards as a way of speeding patrons\u2019 access to the  Washington, D.C., subway system. Smart cards can be configured to  include both contact and contactless capabilities, but two separate  interfaces are needed, because standards for the technologies are very  different. Figure 2 shows some of the capabilities and features that can be  included in smart cards.", "Since the 1990s, the federal government has considered the use of smart  card technology as one option for electronically improving security over  buildings and computer systems. In 1996, GSA was tasked with taking the  lead in facilitating a coordinated interagency management approach for the  adoption of multiapplication smart cards across government. The tasking  came from OMB, which has statutory responsibility to develop and oversee  policies, principles, standards, and guidelines used by agencies for  ensuring the security of federal information and systems. At the time, OMB  envisioned broad adoption of smart card technology throughout the  government, as evidenced by the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1998,  which set a goal of enabling every federal employee ultimately to be able to  use one smart card for a wide range of purposes, including travel, small  purchases, and building access. In January 1998, the President\u2019s  Management Council and the Electronic Processing Initiatives Committee  (EPIC) established an implementation plan for smart cards that called for a  governmentwide, multiapplication card that would support a range of  functions\u2014including controlling access to government buildings\u2014and  operate as part of a standardized system. More recently, several legislative  bills have been proposed or enacted in the wake of the events of September  11, 2001, to enhance national security and counterterrorism by using smart  card and biometric technologies to better identify individuals entering the  country or gaining access to mass transportation systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to assess (1) the extent to which federal agencies have  adopted smart card technologies and realized the associated benefits,  (2) the challenges of adopting smart cards within federal agencies, and  (3) the effectiveness of GSA in promoting the adoption of smart card  technologies within the federal government.", "To assess the extent of smart card adoption by federal agencies and  identify associated benefits and challenges, we reviewed smart card  project documentation, cost estimates, and other studies from GSA; OMB;  the Western Governors\u2019 Association (WGA), which was responsible for a  smart card project funded in part by the Departments of Agriculture and  Health and Human Services; the Department of Justice\u2019s Immigration and  Naturalization Service; DOD; and the Departments of Interior,  Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs (VA). We also held  discussions with key officials from these organizations regarding project  benefits and challenges. Discussions were also held with representatives of  the Smart Card Alliance, an association of smart card technology vendors,  regarding smart card technology benefits and challenges. In addition, we  reviewed publicly available materials and reports on smart card technology  issues and discussed key issues with representatives of these  organizations.", "To assess GSA\u2019s effectiveness in promoting the governmentwide adoption  of smart cards, we reviewed contract task orders, examined pilot project  documentation, and assessed smart card plans and other reports obtained  from the agency. We also held discussions with key officials in GSA\u2019s Office  of Governmentwide Policy, Federal Technology Service, and Public  Building Service to obtain information on internal pilot projects and other  key plans and documents. We analyzed reports and evaluations on the  smart card program obtained from GSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General. To  obtain information on whether GSA had taken an effective leadership role  in fostering the adoption of smart card technology across government, we  interviewed officials from NIST; DOD; VA; the Departments of Interior,  Transportation, and Treasury; and OMB.

For  some federal agencies, the benefits of using smart card technology (such as  improving security over federal buildings and systems and achieving other  business-related purposes) have only recently been recognized, and many  agencies are still planning projects or evaluating the benefits of this  technology before proceeding with more wide-scale initiatives. Still, results  from several ongoing smart card projects suggest that the technology offers  federal agencies a variety of benefits.", "According to information obtained from GSA, OMB, and other federal  agencies, as of November 2002, 18 federal agencies were planning, testing,  operating, or completing a total of 62 smart card projects. These projects  varied widely in size and technical complexity, ranging from small-scale,  limited-duration pilot projects to large-scale, agencywide initiatives  providing multiple services. The projects were reported to be in varying  stages of deployment. Specifically, 13 projects were in the planning stage,  and 7 were being piloted. An additional 17 projects were listed as  operational, and 13 had been completed. No information was provided  about the project phase of the remaining 12 initiatives; it is not clear  whether these projects had moved beyond the planning or pilot testing  phases. Figure 3 shows the status of the 62 federal smart card projects  identified by GSA and OMB. Table 1 provides additional summary  information about these projects.", "Many pilot projects initiated in the late 1990s deployed smart cards for  specific, limited purposes in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the  technology. For example, GSA distributed smart cards to approximately  3,000 staff and visitors at the 1997 presidential inauguration to control  physical access to that event. The cards contained information that granted  individuals access to specific event activities and allowed security  personnel to monitor movements within the event\u2019s headquarters facility as  well as maintain records on those entering secure areas.", "Likewise, many smart card pilot projects were implemented by the military  services to demonstrate the technology\u2019s usefulness in enhancing specific  business operations, such as creating electronic manifests to help deploy  military personnel more efficiently, managing medical records for military  personnel, and providing electronic cash to purchase goods and food  services at remote locations. Officials at military bases and installations  participating in these pilots reported that smart cards significantly reduced  the processing time required for deploying military personnel\u2014from  several days to just a few hours.", "Recently, broader and more permanent projects have begun. Among  federal agencies, DOD has made a substantial investment in developing and  implementing an agencywide smart card system. DOD\u2019s CAC is to be used  to authenticate the identity of nearly 4 million military and civilian  personnel and to improve security over on-line systems and transactions.  The cards are being deployed in tandem with the rollout of a  departmentwide PKI. As of November 2002, DOD had issued approximately  1.4 million CACs to military and civilian personnel and had purchased card  readers and middleware for about 1 million of its computers. More  information about DOD\u2019s program appears in appendix I.", "The Department of Transportation is also developing two large smart card  pilot projects, which will be focused on controlling access to and  improving security at the nation\u2019s many transportation hubs as well as at  federal facilities controlled by the department. One pilot aims to distribute  smart cards to approximately 10,000 FAA employees and contractor  personnel for access to the department\u2019s facilities. Subsequent phases will  be implemented across the agency to approximately 100,000 employees. In  the second pilot, transportation worker identification cards will be issued  to about 15 million transportation workers across the United States and is  intended to improve physical and logical access to public transportation  facilities. Transportation plans to document results from the pilot project,  including benefits and costs.", "Other federal agencies are now using smart cards for controlling logical  access to computer systems and networks. For example, the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) distributed smart cards to approximately 30,000 of  its revenue agents and officers for use when accessing the agency\u2019s  network remotely through notebook computers. According to an IRS  official, the cards are still in use and working well.", "In July 2002, the Department of the Treasury announced plans to launch a  pilot project to assess the use of smart cards for multiple purposes,  including both physical and logical access. Treasury plans to distribute  smart cards equipped with biometrics and PKI capabilities to  approximately 7,200 employees during its pilot test. Treasury\u2019s main  department offices and five Treasury bureaus will be involved in the pilot  test: U.S. Secret Service; IRS; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms;  Bureau of Engraving and Printing; and the Federal Law Enforcement  Training Center. According to Treasury officials, if the smart card pilot  proves successful, it will be implemented across the department.", "While efforts such as these represent a recent trend toward adopting  agencywide smart cards for security functions, almost half (42 percent) of  the projects that have been undertaken to date, as identified by GSA and  OMB, involved storing either cash value on the cards for use in making  small purchases or other information for use in processing electronic  payment transactions, transit benefits, or agency-specific applications.  Many of these projects (45 percent) used smart cards that supported a  combination of media, such as magnetic stripes, bar codes, and optical  memory stripes. Further, the majority (86 percent) of these non\u2013security- oriented projects involved cards used internally, usually to support  formerly paper-based functions. For example, in October 1994, the 25th  Infantry Division in Hawaii was issued 30,000 smart cards configured to  support medical documentation, mobility processing, manifesting,  personnel accountability, health care, and food service. In this pilot, the  most notable benefit was seen in deployment readiness. The deployment  process, which normally took a day or more, was reduced to a matter of  hours.", "In another example of a stored-value card project, the Departments of  Agriculture and Health and Human Services supported a project by the  WGA to issue smart cards to approximately 12,000 individuals\u2014including  pregnant women, mothers, and children\u2014who were eligible for electronic  benefits transfer (EBT) programs such as the Women, Infants, and Children  program, Head Start, Food Stamps, and other public health programs in  three different states. The smart cards contained a circuit chip that  included demographic, health, appointment, and EBT information, as well  as a magnetic stripe that included Medicaid eligibility information. The  smart cards also allowed grocery and retail establishments to track food  purchases and rebate offers or coupon redemptions more accurately. Users  helped control information stored on the card with a personal  identification number and were provided with kiosks to read or view  information stored on the card. According to WGA officials, the pilot was a  success because participants had immediate access to healthcare  appointment and immunization records. In addition, federal and state  agencies were able to track benefits and baby formula purchases more  accurately, resulting in manufacturers no longer questioning the process  used by these government organizations to collect millions in rebate offers.", "To demonstrate that a single smart card could have many uses and provide  many benefits, GSA\u2019s Federal Technology Service introduced a  multipurpose smart card to its employees during a pilot project conducted  in the summer of 1999. The card functioned as a property management  device, boarding pass for American Airlines, credit card for travel, and  stored-value calling card. The card used fingerprint biometric technology,  as well as digital certificates for use in signing E-mail messages. In addition,  the card contained a contactless interface\u2014an embedded antenna\u2014that  allowed cardholders to access transit services by waving the card near a  card reader to electronically pay for these services.", "Appendix I provides more detailed information about smart card projects  at several government agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful Adoption of Smart Cards Can Be Achieved If Challenges Are Met", "paragraphs": ["The benefits of smart card adoption identified by agency officials can be  achieved only if key management and technical challenges are understood  and met. While these challenges have slowed the adoption of smart card  technology in past years, they may be less difficult in the future, not only  because of increased management concerns about securing federal  facilities and information systems, but also because technical advances  have improved the capabilities and reduced the cost of smart card systems.  Major implementation challenges include  sustaining executive-level commitment;  coordinating diverse, cross-organizational needs and transforming   achieving interoperability among smart card systems; and  maintaining security and privacy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sustaining Executive-Level Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all the officials we interviewed indicated that maintaining executive- level commitment is essential to implementing a smart card system  effectively. According to officials both within DOD and in civilian agencies,  the formal mandate of the Deputy Secretary of Defense to implement a  uniform, common access identification card within DOD was essential to  getting a project as large as the CAC initiative launched and funded. The  Deputy Secretary also assigned roles and responsibilities to the military  services and agencies and established a deadline for defining smart card  requirements. DOD officials noted that without such executive-level  support and clear direction, the smart card initiative likely would have  encountered organizational resistance and cost concerns that would have  led to significant delays or cancellation.", "Treasury and Transportation officials also indicated that sustained high- level support had been crucial in launching smart card initiatives within  their organizations and that without this support, funding for such  initiatives probably would not have been available. In contrast, other  federal smart card pilot projects have been cancelled due to lack of  executive-level support. Officials at VA indicated that their pilot VA  Express smart card project, which issued cards to veterans for use in  registering at VA hospitals, would probably not be expanded to full-scale  implementation, largely because executive-level priorities had changed,  and support for a wide-scale smart card project had not been sustained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recognizing Resource Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Smart card implementation costs can be high, particularly if significant  infrastructure modifications are required or other technologies, such as  biometrics and PKI, are being implemented in tandem with the cards.  However, in light of the benefits of better authenticating personnel,  increasing security over access to buildings, safeguarding computer  systems and data, and conducting financial and nonfinancial transactions  more accurately and efficiently, these costs may be acceptable. Key  implementation activities that can be costly include managing contractors  and card suppliers, developing systems and interfaces with existing  personnel or credentialing systems, installing equipment and systems to  distribute the cards, and training personnel to issue and use smart cards. As  a result, agency officials stated that obtaining adequate resources was  critical to implementing a major government smart card system.", "For example, Treasury\u2019s project manager estimated the overall cost for the  departmentwide effort at between $50 and $60 million; costs for the FAA  pilot project, which have not yet been fully determined, are likely to exceed  $2.5 million.", "At least $4.2 million was required to design, develop, and implement the  WGA Health Passport Project (HPP) in Nevada, North Dakota, and  Wyoming and to service up to 30,000 clients. A report on that project  acknowledged that it was complicated and costly to manage card issuance  activities. The states encountered problems when trying to integrate legacy  systems with the smart cards and had difficulty establishing accountability  among different organizations for data stored on and transferred from the  cards. The report further indicated that help-desk services were difficult to  manage because of the number of organizations and outside retailers, as  well as different systems and hardware, involved in the project; costs for  this service likely would be about $200,000 annually. WGA officials said  they expect costs to decrease as more clients are provided with smart  cards and the technology becomes more familiar to users; they also believe  smart card benefits will exceed costs over the long term.", "The full cost of a smart card system can also be greater than originally  anticipated because of the costs of related technologies, such as PKI. For  example, DOD initially budgeted about $78 million for the CAC program in  2000 and 2001 and expected to provide the device to about 4 million  military, civilian, and contract employees by 2003. It now expects to expend  over $250 million by 2003\u2014more than double the original estimate. Many of  the increases in CAC program costs were attributed by DOD officials to  underestimating the costs of upgrading and managing legacy systems and  processes for card issuance. Card issuance costs likely will exceed $75  million out of the over $250 million now provided for CAC through 2003,  based on information provided by DOD. These costs are for installing  workstations, upgrading legacy systems, and distributing cards to  personnel.", "According to DOD program officials, the department will likely expend  over $1 billion for its smart cards and PKI capabilities by 2005. In addition  to the costs mentioned above, the military services and defense agencies  were required to fund the purchase of over 2.5 million card readers and the  middleware to make them work with existing computer applications, at a  cost likely to exceed $93 million by 2003. The military services and defense  agencies are also expected to provide funding to enable applications to  interoperate with the PKI certificates loaded on the cards. DOD provided  about $712 million to issue certificates to cardholders as part of the PKI  program but provided no additional funding to enable applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integrating Physical and Logical Security Practices Across Organizations", "paragraphs": ["The ability of smart card systems to address both physical and logical  (information systems) security means that unprecedented levels of  cooperation may be required among internal organizations that often had  not previously collaborated, especially physical security organizations and  IT organizations. Nearly all federal officials we interviewed noted that  existing security practices and procedures varied significantly across  organizational entities within their agencies and that changing each of  these well-established processes and attempting to integrate them across  the agency was a formidable challenge. Individual bureaus and divisions  often have strong reservations about supporting a departmentwide smart  card initiative because it would likely result in substantial changes to  existing processes for credentialing individuals, verifying those credentials  when presented at building entrances, and accessing and using computer  systems.", "DOD officials stated that it has been difficult to take advantage of the  multiapplication capabilities of its CAC for these very reasons. The card is  primarily being used for logical access\u2014for helping to authenticate  cardholders accessing systems and networks and for digitally signing  electronic transactions using PKI. DOD only recently has begun to consider  ways to use the CAC across the department to better control physical  access over military facilities. Few DOD facilities are currently using the  card for this purpose.

One Treasury official, for example, noted that departmentwide  initiatives, such as its planned smart card project, require the support of 14  different bureaus and services. Each of these entities has different systems  and processes in place to control access to buildings, automated systems,  and electronic transactions. Agreement could not always be reached on a  single business process to address security requirements among these  diverse entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Interoperability Among Smart Card Systems", "paragraphs": ["Interoperability is a key consideration in smart card deployment. The value  of a smart card is greatly enhanced if it can be used with multiple systems  at different agencies, and GSA has reported that virtually all agencies agree  that interoperability at some level is critical to widespread adoption of  smart cards across the government. However, achieving interoperability  has been difficult because smart card products and systems developed in  the past have generally been incompatible in all but very rudimentary ways.  With varying products available from many vendors, there has been no  obvious choice for an interoperability standard.", "GSA considered the achievement of interoperability across card systems to  be one of its main priorities in developing its governmentwide Smart  Access Common ID Card contract. Accordingly, GSA designed the contract to require awardees to work with GSA and NIST to develop a government  interoperability specification. The specification, as it currently stands,  includes an architectural model, interface specifications, conformance  testing requirements, and data models. A key aspect of the specification is  that it addresses aspects of smart card operations that are not covered by  commercial standards. Specifically, the specification defines a uniform set  of command and response messages for smart cards to use in  communicating with card readers. Vendors can meet the specification by  writing software for their cards that translates their unique command and  response formats to the government standard. Such a specification  previously had not been available.", "According to NIST officials, the first version of the interoperability  specification, completed in August 2000, did not include sufficient detail to  establish interoperability among vendors\u2019 disparate smart card products.  The officials stated that this occurred because representatives from NIST,  the contractors, and other federal agencies had only a very limited time to  develop the first version. Version 2, released in June 2002, is a significant  improvement, providing better definitions of many details, such as how  smart cards should exchange information with software applications and  card readers. The revised specification also supports DOD\u2019s CAC data  model in addition to the common data model developed for the original  specification. However, it may take some time before smart card products  that meet the requirements of version 2 are made available, because the  contractors and vendors (under the Smart Access Common ID contract)  will have to update or redesign their products to meet the enhanced  specification. Further, potential interoperability issues may arise for those  agencies that purchased and deployed smart card products based on the  original specification.", "While version 2 addressed important aspects of establishing  interoperability among different vendors\u2019 smart card systems, other  aspects remain unaddressed. For example, the version 2 specifications for  \u201cbasic services interface\u201d provide for just 21 common functions, such as  establishing and terminating a logical connection with the card in a  specified reader. Other fundamental functions\u2014such as changing personal  ID numbers and registering cards when they are issued to users\u2014are not  included in the basic services interface. For such functions, vendors must  use what are known as \u201cextended service interfaces.\u201d Because vendors are  free to create their own unique definitions for extended service interfaces  and associated software, interoperability problems may occur if interface  designs or software programs are incompatible. NIST officials stated that,  at the time the specification was finalized, it was not possible to define a  standard for the functions not included in the basic services interface  because existing commercial products varied too widely. According to the  NIST officials, greater convergence is needed among smart card vendors\u2019  products before agreement can be reached on standards for all important  card functions\u2014including changing passwords or personal identification  numbers\u2014as part of extended service interfaces.", "In addition, the guidelines do not address interoperability for important  technologies such as contactless smart cards, biometrics, and optical  memory stripes.

The  government has not yet adopted industry-developed contactless and  biometric standards, which are generally not extensive enough to ensure  interoperability among commercial products from different vendors.  According to one NIST official, a thorough risk assessment of optical stripe  technology needs to be conducted first, because the security issues for a  \u201cpassive\u201d technology such as optical stripes are different from those of  \u201cactive\u201d chip-based smart cards.

As discussed in the background  section of this report, smart cards can offer significantly enhanced control  over access to buildings and systems, particularly when used in  combination with other advanced technologies, such as PKI and  biometrics. Although smart card systems are generally much harder to  attack than traditional ID cards and password-protected systems, they are  not invulnerable. In order to obtain the improved security services that  smart cards offer, care must be taken to ensure that the cards and their  supporting systems do not pose unacceptable security risks.", "Smart card systems generally are designed with a variety of features  designed to thwart attack. For example, cards are assigned unique serial  numbers to counter unauthorized duplication and contain integrated  circuit chips that are resistant to tampering so that their information  cannot be easily extracted and used. However, security experts point out  that because a smart-card-based system involves many different discrete  elements that cannot be physically controlled at all times by an  organization\u2019s security personnel, there is at least a theoretically greater  opportunity for malfeasance than would exist for a more self-contained  system.", "In fact, a smart-card-based system involves many parties (the cardholders,  data owner, computing devices, card issuer, card manufacturer, and  software manufacturer) that potentially could pose threats to the system.  For example, researchers have found ways to circumvent security  measures and extract information from smart cards, and an individual  cardholder could be motivated to attack his or her card in order to access  and modify the stored data on the card\u2014perhaps to change personal  information or increase the cash value that may be stored on the card.  Further, smart cards are connected to computing devices (such as agency  networks, desktop and  laptop computers, and automatic teller machines)  through card readers that control the flow of data to and from the smart  card. Attacks mounted on either the card readers or any of the attached  computing systems could compromise the safeguards that are the goals of  implementing a smart card system.", "Smart cards used to support multiple applications may introduce additional  risks to the system. For example, if adequate care is not taken in designing  and testing each software application, loading new applications onto  existing cards could compromise the security of the other applications  already stored on the cards. In general, guaranteeing the security of a  multiapplication card can be more difficult because of the difficulty of  determining which application is running inside a multiapplication smart  card at any given time. If an application runs at an unauthorized time, it  could gain unauthorized access to data intended only for other  applications.", "As with any information system, the threats to a smart card system must be  analyzed thoroughly and adequate measures developed to address  potential vulnerabilities. Our 1998 report on effective security management  practices used by leading public and private organizations and a  companion report on risk-based security approaches identified key  principles that can be used to establish a management framework for an  effective information security program. In addition, the National Security  Agency\u2019s draft guidelines for placing biometrics in smart cards include  steps that could be taken to help protect information in smart card  systems, such as encrypting all private keys stored in the smart card and  defining a system security policy with a user certification process before  access to the system is granted.", "In addition to security, protecting the privacy of personal information is a  growing concern and must be addressed with regard to the personal  information contained on smart cards. Once in place, smart-card-based  systems designed simply to control access to facilities and systems could  also be used to track the day-to-day activities of individuals, potentially  compromising their privacy. Further, smart-card-based systems could be  used to aggregate sensitive information about individuals for purposes  other than those prompting the initial collection of the information, which  could compromise privacy. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the federal  government to restrict the disclosure of personally identifiable records  maintained by federal agencies, while permitting individuals access to their  own records and the right to seek amendment of agency records that are  inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. Accordingly, agency  officials need to assess and plan for appropriate privacy measures when  implementing smart card systems.", "To address privacy concerns, officials with the WGA indicated that some  participants in the HPP were made aware of the information that would be  stored on their cards. Kiosks were installed in some grocery stores to  encourage individuals to view the information stored on the cards.  Similarly, GSA officials provided employees access to information stored  on their headquarters ID cards and said they received few complaints about  the cards.", "While individuals involved in these projects had few concerns, others may  require more assurances about the information stored on smart cards and  how government agencies will use and share data.

One of the  objectives in GSA\u2019s 1998 smart card plan was to lead by example in  implementing and showcasing smart cards. Yet GSA\u2019s pilot projects have  generally not allowed the agency to lead by example.

In  terms of coordination, GSA has been unable to develop and implement a  strategy to deploy smart card technology in a standard manner across  the agency. For example, two divisions within GSA, the Federal Supply  Service and the Public Building Service, while operating in areas where  smart cards have a known benefit, did not use GSA\u2019s standard  governmentwide contracting vehicle, which requires adherence to the  government smart card interoperability specification.

The card was also intended to be usable by  non-VA hospitals equipped with the necessary readers to access patients\u2019  VA benefits information.", "At the time of our review, about 24,000 smart cards had been issued  through two VA hospitals located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Iron  Mountain, Michigan. The cards are PKI enabled and can also be used  throughout VA\u2019s network of hospitals\u2014the majority of which do not have  smart card readers\u2014because they include all the same patient information  found printed on the front of the older Veteran Identification Cards, which  are still in use. The PKI capabilities of the card allow patients with a home  computer and card reader to securely access their information on-line and  digitally sign forms, saving time and offering convenience for both the  patient and the agency. For those without Internet access, kiosks were  installed at the two pilot locations, allowing Express Card holders to  access their information, make any necessary changes, or request PKI  certificates.

Patients involved in the pilot project had  access to express registration services, thus saving time. However,  although the Express Card program is still in use, VA officials have decided  not to expand beyond the two pilot locations. The reasons given were the  expense of back-end automation, complications integrating the new system  with legacy systems, and the lack of an existing card reader infrastructure  at other VA hospitals.

As part of the Border Crossing Cards  project, INS is working with the Department of State to produce and  distribute the cards. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant  Responsibility Act of 1996, every Border Crossing Card issued after  October 1, 2001, is required to contain a biometric identifier and be  machine readable. The Laser Visas will store biographical information  along with a photograph of the cardholder and an image of the cardholder\u2019s  fingerprints. The Permanent Resident Cards will store similar information.  Information from the Laser Visas is stored in a central INS database.

As part of a cost-benefit analysis  conducted in 1999, INS considered implementing chip-based smart cards  and determined that smart card technology was not the best solution. This  decision was based, in part, on the limited storage capacity of smart cards  at the time. INS examined smart cards with 8 kilobytes of memory, which  did not provide enough memory to store the fingerprint data required by  law.

Each state was  expected to maintain common demographic information as well as clinical  data on individuals participating in the pilot project. Selected sites also  tested unique applications related to electronic benefits transfer (EBT),  insurance eligibility, and health appointment information. WGA had overall  responsibility for managing the HPP contract, and each state was  responsible for providing on-site management, technical support, and  funding as needed.

The report stated that HPP was successful in bringing a concept  to life. HPP enabled participants to use the EBT and healthcare  appointment and immunization information more effectively and  conveniently, because information was stored on the card. Project  participants also liked using the cards and kiosks to access their personal  information, and many liked being able to electronically track  appointments and health care records. In addition, retailers liked the cards  and the ability to track EBT data more accurately. WGA officials further  noted that HPP has helped federal and state governments maintain more  accurate information on EBT distributions and baby formula purchases,  which can be used to request coupon rebates from manufacturers.
