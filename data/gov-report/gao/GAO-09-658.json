To do this, GAO reviewed signed agreements and other relevant documentation and met with officials from OFS, contractors, and financial regulators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury continued to operationalize its more recent programs, including the Capital Assistance Program (CAP). As part of this program, the Federal Reserve led the stress tests of the largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies, which revealed that about half needed to raise additional capital to keep them strongly capitalized and lending even if economic conditions worsen. Whether any of the institutions will have to participate in CAP has yet to be determined. While the Federal Reserve disclosed the stress test results, it has no plans to disclose information about the 19 institutions going forward. What information, if any, is disclosed will be left to the discretion of the affected institutions raising a number of concerns including potentially inconsistent or only selected information being disclosed. Moreover, the Federal Reserve had not developed a mechanism to share information with OFS about the ongoing condition of the 19 bank holding companies that continue to participate in TARP programs. According to Treasury, its Financial Stability Plan has provided a basis for its communication strategy. Treasury plans to more regularly communicate with congressional committees of jurisdiction about TARP. However, until this strategy is fully implemented, all congressional stakeholders will not be receiving information in a consistent or timely manner. A key component of the communication strategy is the new www.financialstability.gov Web site. While a goal of the new site is to provide the public with a more user friendly format, Treasury has not yet measured the public's satisfaction with the site. OFS has made progress in establishing its management infrastructure. Continued attention to hiring remains important because some offices within OFS, including the Office of the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, continue to have a number of vacancies that will need to be filled as TARP programs are fully implemented. Treasury has also continued to build a network of contractors and financial agents to support TARP administration and operations. These contracts and agreements are key tools OFS has used to help develop and administer its TARP programs. Treasury has provided information to the public on procurement contracts and financial agency agreements, but has not included a breakdown of cost data by each entity. As a result, Treasury is missing an opportunity to provide additional transparency about TARP operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  (the act) was signed into law. The act established the Office of Financial  Stability (OFS) within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and  authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Among other  things, the act, as amended, provides Treasury with broad, flexible  authorities to buy or guarantee billions in troubled assets, which include  mortgages and mortgage-related instruments, and any other financial  instrument whose purchase Treasury determines is needed to stabilize the  financial markets.", "The act also created oversight mechanisms to oversee the implementation  and operations of TARP.

We also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from  OFS who were responsible for approving financial institutions to  participate in CPP and overseeing the repurchase process for CPP  preferred stock and warrants. Additionally, we contacted officials from  the four federal banking regulators\u2014the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve),  and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)\u2014to obtain information on their  process for reviewing CPP applications, the status of pending applications,  their process for reviewing preferred stock and warrant repurchase  requests, and their examination process for reviewing recipients\u2019 lending  activities and compliance with TARP requirements.", "To update the status of the Targeted Investment Program (TIP), the  Systemically Significant Failing Institutions Program (SSFI), and the  Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), we reviewed relevant  documents and interviewed OFS officials about these programs.

We also interviewed officials in OFS for updates to  TALF. For updates to Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) and  small business efforts related to its Consumer and Business Lending  Initiative, we reviewed agency documentation and interviewed Treasury  and FDIC officials. For updates on the Small Business Administration  (SBA) efforts related to improving credit and securitization markets for  small businesses, we relied on previously issued GAO work.", "To determine Treasury\u2019s progress in developing an overall  communications strategy for TARP, we assessed Treasury\u2019s activities  based on GAO reports on effective communications. We also accessed  www.financialstability.gov\u2014Treasury\u2019s new Web site for communication  of TARP-related strategies\u2014through June 4, 2009.

We also reviewed  our prior work on human capital flexibilities and strategic workforce  planning to assess OFS\u2019s performance in these areas. In addition, we met  with a variety of Treasury and OFS officials to discuss the staffing levels of  OFS offices including vacancies, their processes for recruiting employees  with the skill sets and competencies needed to administer TARP, steps  taken to find permanent replacements to fill key leadership positions, and  the extent of pay comparability challenges. We also met with officials from  the Office of Personnel Management to discuss their coordination with  Treasury in establishing hiring flexibilities and other tools to staff OFS.", "To assess OFS\u2019s process for vetting employees\u2019 potential conflicts of  interest, we reviewed information from Treasury\u2019s databases used to track  submission and reviews of Treasury employees\u2019 confidential and public  financial disclosure reports. Specifically, we reviewed information in the  databases for 64 OFS employees hired as of April 23, 2009. Of these, 56  were permanent employees required to submit confidential financial  disclosure reports and 8 were senior-level officials required to submit  public disclosure reports. In order to determine the reliability of the  information provided in the databases, we interviewed Treasury officials  and performed basic tests on the data. We determined that the information  provided for these 64 employees was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We also reviewed standard operating procedures that Treasury developed  to manage the submissions and reviews of its employees\u2019 financial  disclosure reports and new internal operating procedures developed  specifically for reviewing OFS employees\u2019 confidential financial disclosure  reports. In coordination with GAO experts on federal ethics laws and  regulations, we reviewed information provided by 15 senior-level OFS  officials in public financial disclosure reports and identified any potential  conflicts meriting additional discussion with Treasury ethics counsel. In  addition, we met with Treasury and OFS officials to discuss their reviews  of financial disclosure reports and the training provided to OFS staff on  the laws and regulations pertaining to ethical conduct in the federal  workplace, including those related to conflicts of interest. We met with  officials from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to discuss pertinent  ethics regulations that applied to Treasury and reviewed their guidance on  ethical standards of conduct for employees. We also reviewed reports  published by Treasury\u2019s Office of the Inspector General describing  conflicts of interest incidents and their resolution.", "To assess OFS\u2019s use of contractors and financial agents to support TARP  administration and operations for the period of March 14 through June 1,  2009, we reviewed information from Treasury for (1) new financial agency  agreements, contracts, blanket purchase agreements, and interagency  agreements; and (2) task orders, modifications, and amendments involving  ongoing contracts and agreements. We analyzed this information, in part,  to identify small or minority- and women-owned prime contractors and  subcontractors providing TARP services and supplies. To report OFS  expenses for contracts and agreements, we obtained information from the  OFS Chief Financial Officer. To identify the extent to which federal  banking regulators use contractors to support their TARP activities, we  obtained information from FDIC, Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS. To  assess the status of OFS progress in developing a final TARP conflicts-of- interest rule and responding to our prior recommendations to   (1) complete reviews of vendor conflicts-of-interest mitigation plans to  conform with the interim rule and to (2) issue guidance requiring key  communications and decisions be documented, we interviewed officials  from Treasury and reviewed applicable documents.", "To assess the status of internal controls related to TARP activities and the  status of TARP\u2019s consideration of accounting and reporting topics, we  reviewed documents provided by OFS and conducted interviews and made  inquiries with officials from OFS, including the Chief Financial Officer,  Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Risk Officer, Cash  Management Officer, Director of Internal Controls, and their  representatives. To evaluate selected internal control activities related to  the CPP, AIFP, and SSFI programs, we designed tests using OFS\u2019s process  flows, narratives, risk matrices, and high-level operational procedures. As  part of our ongoing work, we completed the following additional activities:    For CPP, we tested certain internal control activities related to dividend  payments received through June 12, 2009, from institutions included in our  previous sample of 45 unique preferred stock purchase transactions for  the four months ended January 31, 2009. To make that selection, we used a  monetary unit sampling (probability proportionate to size) methodology.  We also tested dividends received through June 12, 2009, for TIP, Asset  Guarantee Program (AGP), and AIFP.", "For SSFI, we tested selected control activities, including approvals,  reviews, and closing documentation, for the American International Group  Inc. (AIG) restructuring. The documentation that we reviewed included an  exchange agreement and purchase agreement executed on April 17, 2009.", "For AIFP, we tested controls over the (1) authorization and execution of  the initial General Motors Corporation (GM) and Chrysler LLC (Chrysler)  agreements (executed on December 31, 2008, and January 2, 2009,  respectively), (2) funding process, (3) receipt of promissory notes and  securities, (4) disbursements made by Treasury under the agreements, and  (5) receipts of interest and principal. In addition, we verified that the loan  amounts disbursed to and interest received from GM and Chrysler were  consistent with the terms of the agreements.", "Finally, in our initial report under the mandate, we identified a preliminary  set of indicators on the state of credit and financial markets that might be  suggestive of the performance and effectiveness of TARP. We consulted  Treasury officials and other experts and analyzed available data sources  and the academic literature. We selected a set of preliminary indicators  that offered perspectives on different facets of credit and financial  markets, including perceptions of risk, cost of credit, and flows of credit to  businesses and consumers. We assessed the reliability of the data upon  which the indicators were based and found that, despite certain  limitations, they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To update the  indicators in this report, we primarily used data from Thomson  Datastream\u2014a financial statistics database. As these data are widely used,  we conducted only a limited review of the data but ensured that the trends  we found were consistent with other research. We also relied on data from  Inside Mortgage Finance, Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Chicago  Board Options Exchange, and Global Insight. We have relied on data from  these sources for past reports and determined that, considered together,  these auxiliary data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of presenting  and analyzing trends in financial markets. The data from Treasury\u2019s survey  of lending to the top 21 CPP recipients (as of March 31, 2009) are based on  internal reporting from participating institutions, and the definitions of  loan categories may vary across banks. Because the data are unique, we  are not able to benchmark the origination levels against historical lending  or seasonal patterns at these institutions. Based on discussions with  Treasury and our review of the data, we found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of documenting trends in lending. The  survey data will prove valuable for more thorough analyses of lending  activity in future reports. We also conducted an econometric analysis to  assess the impact of CPP on the TED spread. Although we used a standard  and widely used methodology, the model results should be interpreted  with caution because we did not attempt to capture all potential factors  that might explain movements in the TED spread. Moreover, in spite of the  empirical evidence, we cannot link improvements in the TED spread  exclusively to CPP (see app. III for more detail).", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 through June 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Treasury has  indicated that, while the term sheets for privately held mutual institutions  allow institutions to reduce the warrants held by Treasury if they complete  a qualified equity offering during 2009, this provision was included in the  term sheets in error.

However, the regulators have yet to disclose to  Treasury or the public a generally consistent set of criteria that they are  using to make decisions concerning repayment other than that they follow  existing applicable supervisory procedures. According to Treasury  officials, ARRA severely limits Treasury\u2019s authority to decide whether  banks may purchase their stock. After all the preferred shares are  repurchased, the financial institution may repurchase all or part of the  warrants held by Treasury. Under the original terms of CPP, financial  institutions were prohibited from repurchasing within the first 3 years  unless they completed a qualified equity offering.

Unless the Treasury, in  consultation with the primary federal regulators, take steps to ensure that  the regulators have and apply generally consistent criteria and clearly  articulate the basis they have used or plan to use to approve or deny  repurchase requests, Treasury will face an increased risk that TARP  participants may not be treated equitably.", "As of June 12, 2009, 22 institutions had repurchased their preferred stock  from Treasury for a total of about $1.9 billion (see table 5 for additional  repurchase information).

Collectively, the  Treasury-held preferred shares in these 10 institutions have a liquidation  preference of approximately $68 billion. Upon completion of the preferred  stock repurchase process, each institution will have the right to  repurchase the warrants held by Treasury.", "As mentioned previously, as of June 12, 2009, 5 institutions had  repurchased their warrants from Treasury. We found that Treasury  followed a consistent process in these instances; however, according to  Treasury, there is no readily available market for the warrants that had  been repurchased to date. The value of those warrants depends on the  valuation process and the underlying assumptions. In one instance,  Treasury received multiple offers from the institution to repurchase its  warrants but rejected the first two offers. The final offer that Treasury  accepted was slightly lower than Treasury\u2019s own determination of the  market value of the institution\u2019s warrants but more than twice the initial  offer and slightly more than its second. According to documents we  reviewed, in accordance with its process for determining whether to  accept an offer from the institution, Treasury considered 1) warrant price  indications from certain market participants, 2) certain warrant pricing  models, 3) a warrant price calculation from a third-party contractor, and 4)  Treasury\u2019s own financial analysis of the institution. According to Treasury,  the final warrant price was deemed to be reasonable given that the  institution\u2019s stock price had declined during negotiations, reducing the  warrant\u2019s value and that Treasury\u2019s market value determination for the  warrant was based on a number of factors that involve judgment such as  liquidity discounts. If Treasury and the issuing institutions cannot agree on  a price, either can invoke an appraisal procedure whereby each chooses  an independent appraiser to determine the estimated fair market value  (FMV) and if the two cannot agree on a FMV, they will appoint a third  appraiser. If an institution decides not to repurchase its warrants under  the negotiation and appraisal procedure, Treasury may sell the warrants  through an auction process\u2014another mechanism that Treasury could use  to sell shares\u2014when it deems appropriate.", "Treasury describes the warrant repurchase process broadly on the  www.financialstability.gov Web site. Additional details about the process  are contained in the individual securities purchase agreements that are  also posted on the Web site. Further, the final warrant prices are disclosed  on the Web site. However, Treasury has provided limited information  about the valuation process it has used to date. Specifically, it has not  disclosed the details\u2014such as the institution\u2019s initial offer or how the final  price compares to Treasury\u2019s valuation. For less liquid securities, prices  can vary widely depending on the assumptions underlying the valuation  models leading some market observers to question whether Treasury had  received a fair market value for the warrants that have been repurchased  to date. By not being more transparent about the valuation process and the  negotiations that were undertaken to establish the accepted warrant price,  Treasury increases the likelihood that questions will remain about whether  Treasury has best served taxpayers\u2019 interests. Given the broad ranging  risks inherent in TARP, Treasury must take steps to help ensure that its  decisions are not only fair and equitable but also that they result in  maximum value. Unless Treasury takes this type of broad-based approach,  it may not ensure that taxpayers\u2019 interests are fully protected.", "In our March 2009 report, we recommended that Treasury update  guidance available to the public on determining warrant exercise prices to  be consistent with actual practices applied by OFS. Treasury has since  updated its frequently asked questions on its Web site to clarify the  process it follows for determining the prices. However, there continues to  be inconsistent guidance available on the Web site for calculating the  exercise prices.

In a  process similar to the one used for CPP, the regulators are to submit  recommendations to Treasury regarding an applicant\u2019s viability.

According to the Federal Reserve,  the more adverse outlook was not intended to be a worst-case scenario  but rather a deliberately stringent test designed to account for highly  uncertain financial and economic conditions by identifying the extent to  which a bank holding company is vulnerable today to a weaker than  expected economy in the future. The required capital buffer was sized  based on the more adverse scenario. While the forecast for the three  economic indicators\u2014GDP growth, unemployment rates, and home price  changes\u2014were considered quite severe at the time they were formulated  in February, subsequent data indicated that the probability of the more  adverse scenario was likely higher than previously thought, particularly  with respect to the unemployment rate.

As a result, the total losses for the top 19 U.S. bank holding companies  since the beginning of the financial crisis in the second quarter of 2007  would be nearly $950 billion. The $600 billion represents a 7.7 percent loss  of total risk-weighted assets for the 19 companies.", "The U.S. bank holding companies were asked to list available resources  that they could use to absorb losses without impacting capital.

As a  result, we recommended that Treasury continue to develop an integrated  communication strategy that may include, among other things, building  understanding and support through the program, integrating  communications and operations, and increasing the impact of  communication tools such as print and video. Moreover, we emphasized  the need for the communication strategy to establish a means to engage in  regular and routine communication with Congress. Since our March 2009  report, Treasury said that it established a working group to address  communications both within OFS and to external stakeholders. Treasury  has stated that the working group is responsible for monitoring, reporting  on, and addressing all OFS communication efforts, and has been  developing a communications plan to build support for the various  programs it has established under the act. Treasury also noted that its  Financial Stability Plan provided the basis for its improved communication  strategy.", "The current communication strategy for TARP utilizes and builds on  existing resources, such as Treasury\u2019s Office of Public Affairs and Office of  Legislative Affairs. Officials from Treasury\u2019s Office of Public Affairs and  Office of Legislative Affairs told us that the Financial Stability Plan  announced in February 2009 provided a base for the new administration  launching its current communication strategy. To ensure that Treasury can  communicate with the public and Congress in a timely manner, officials  from Treasury\u2019s Office of Public Affairs and Office of Legislative Affairs  are included in regular policy meetings with OFS officials and officials  from other offices in Treasury. As major changes occur, Treasury\u2019s Office  of Public Affairs\u2014in conjunction with OFS, the Office of the Secretary,  and the Office of Legislative Affairs\u2014has established a routine approach  to more fully communicate activities to the public. Specifically, the Office  of Public Affairs has a process that involves timely issuance of press  releases and white papers, holding media briefings, and conducting  outreach to the academic and investor community. According to Treasury,  policy officials from OFS and Domestic Finance are involved in this  process. Moreover, the Office of Public Affairs told us that Treasury had  dedicated a media and public affairs employee that works on TARP and in  coordination with other senior members of the Public Affairs office.", "Staff from the Office of Legislative Affairs told us that they routinely  communicate with congressional leadership and staff from key  committees with jurisdiction over TARP activities, specifically noting the  Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House  Committee on Financial Services. They also respond to a variety of  questions and requests made to them by individual members\u2019 and  congressional staff on an ongoing basis. In addition, Treasury noted that  on April 15, 2009, the Secretary transmitted written letters to  congressional committees to provide a broad update on TARP-related  activities, and on May 15, 2009, OFS staff provided background briefings to  Congressional staff on TARP programs and recent developments. OFS told  us they plan to provide additional briefings to congressional staff on a  monthly basis. They also said that they are in the process of hiring a  communications officer to work with the Office of Public Affairs and the  Office of Legislative Affairs, who have two staff members dedicated to  TARP, among other duties, to implement a coordinated communications  strategy. Though these efforts may improve communication with  congressional stakeholders, Treasury has yet to implement an approach  that ensures all relevant stakeholders are routinely reached. For example,  the act creating TARP includes several other committees of jurisdiction  besides Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and House Financial  Services\u2014the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the  House and Senate Committees on Budget, the Senate Committee on  Finance, and the House Committee on Ways and Means. However,  according to Treasury officials, while they have more recently begun to  outreach to others, their efforts have primarily been targeted to House  Financial Services and Senate Banking. Treasury\u2019s communication  strategy, once finalized, should help ensure regular and proactive outreach  to all of the committees of jurisdiction and Congress in general. Until the  plans for regular outreach to Congress on TARP matters are implemented,  Treasury risks that some congressional committees or staff may not be  receiving consistent and timely information, increasing the likelihood of  misunderstanding by Congress and according to Treasury officials, will  continue to be inundated with ad hoc TARP-related inquires.", "Since our March 2009 report, Treasury has made operational its new Web  site, www.financialstability.gov, to report TARP-related matters and has  taken steps to improve the site\u2019s effectiveness through the use of various  communication tools. Treasury said that this effort is part of a refocused  public communications initiative to enhance communications on how  TARP strategies will stabilize the financial system and restore credit  markets. According to Treasury, there are several key differences between  the new site and the older Web page used to communicate TARP  strategies, which was a part of the Treasury\u2019s Web site. Specifically,  Treasury officials told us that the new site is less technical than the former  Web page and the intention was to provide details on TARP activities in a  more user-friendly, simplified manner that is easier for the general public  to understand. For example, the site features a \u201cdecoder\u201d tool that  translates frequently-used financial language and TARP program names,  such as \u201casset-backed security,\u201d to reach a wider audience. In addition, the  site has provided information on all of the investments Treasury has made  and the contractual terms of and participants in those investment  programs. Treasury also posts a detailed monthly lending and  intermediation survey on the Web site. Moreover, Treasury has provided  links to program-related content provided on other federal agencies\u2019 sites,  such as frequently asked questions on the TALF posted by the Federal  Reserve. Treasury has also tried to provide information to better address  constituent interests. For example, the Web site has included an  interactive map illustrating state-by-state bank and financial institution  funding provided under TARP. According to Treasury, the site provided  some information on warrant sales and repayments of principal  investments made to various institutions under CPP. Consistent with our  recommendation aimed at better disclosure of monies paid to Treasury, it  now includes dividends and interest received in its periodic reports to  Congress that are also posted to the Web site, and according to Treasury,  it is in the process of creating a mechanism to report dividends received  under the various TARP programs on the Web site.", "Treasury also created a separate Web site\u2014 www.makinghomeaffordable.gov\u2014in order to communicate about the  homeownership preservation program established under TARP. Treasury  said that it has coordinated closely with the White House, HUD, FHFA,  Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac in developing a means to communicate  information on the Making Home Affordable program to stakeholders  across the country. The Web site includes information targeted to  homeowners on refinancing and loan modifications and, according to  Treasury, as of May 29, 2009, the site has received more than 19.5 million  hits.", "In other work, we have noted that best practices useful for improving the  quality of federal public Web sites include conducting usability testing of  Web sites and developing performance measures or other means to gauge  customer satisfaction, such as conducting surveys and convening focus  groups. Treasury is in the process of entering into an agreement with a  vendor to conduct usability testing of the Web site. According to a  Treasury official, small surveys of site visitors will be conducted and every  six months the vendor will suggest changes to improve the Web site. While  Treasury said that the new Web site was designed to make information  less technical and accessible to a wider audience, until Treasury gauges  whether the new www.financiastability.gov Web site provides more useful  and easily found information to the general public than the old Web page,  Treasury lacks a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of its  communication strategy.", "The lack of ready access to key information on some recent TARP  developments on the new www.financialstability.gov Web site  underscores the need to seek input from others in making continuous  improvements in TARP-related communications. For example, users from  the general public, unfamiliar with the TARP terminology, would have  difficulty finding basic descriptive information on the stress test initiative  announced February 2009 under the administration\u2019s Financial Stability  Plan. Among other things, we found that the Web site lacked readily-found  information on the components of the test and test results. Further, while  Treasury officials said that the decoder tool intends to translate more  technical program information, as of June 4, 2009, we found no  information in the decoder tool or elsewhere on the Web site to let users  know that the stress test is now formally referred to in Treasury press  releases as SCAP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Made Progress in Developing OFS\u2019s Management Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Since our March 2009 report, Treasury has continued to take steps to hire  permanent OFS staff and detailees to fill short- and long-term  organizational needs. First, Treasury has continued to seek qualified  successors for various permanent leadership positions, including the Chief  Investment and Chief Homeownership Preservation officers. Until  permanent successors are identified, Treasury has appointed an Acting  Chief Investment Officer and appointed an interim Chief Homeownership  Preservation Officer to head these areas of OFS. In addition, Treasury has  created a new senior position within OFS\u2014a senior restructuring  official\u2014to oversee major investments that have been made under TARP.  The administration has also nominated an individual to become the  Assistant Secretary of Financial Stability. This appointment, which is  subject to Senate confirmation, would fill the vacancy created by the  departure of the Interim Assistant Secretary of Financial Stability, who  had served in this capacity since TARP was created in October 2008.", "Second, Treasury has increased the number of permanent OFS staff. As of  June 8, 2009, OFS had 166 total staff, with the number of permanent staff  rising from 77 to 137 since our March 2009 report and the number of  detailees decreasing to 29 (see fig. 3). In its latest budget request to OMB,  Treasury anticipated that OFS would need 225 full-time employees to  operate at full capacity in fiscal year 2010, an increase of 29 from its March  2009 estimate of 196. Having both detailees and long-term staff helps OFS  meet its short- and long-term needs. Treasury continues to anticipate that  permanent staff will support long-term responsibilities, while detailees will  continue to play an important role by supporting the flexibility of OFS  operations.", "Currently, some offices are more fully staffed than others. OFS provided  information on 2 types of vacancies\u2014ones the agency is currently in the  process of hiring for (current vacancies)\u2014and ones that the agency  anticipates based on the projected size of each office over time  (anticipated vacancies). While the offices of the Chief Financial Officer  and Chief Investment Officer have identified only a few current vacancies,  the offices of the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and Chief  Homeownership Preservation Officer have identified several current  vacancies (table 10). Current vacancies that Treasury has identified within  OFS include senior positions for program compliance within the office of  the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and leadership positions for data  analysis and communications and marketing within the office of the Chief  Homeownership Preservation Officer. In some instances, OFS has filled  important personnel gaps. For example, since our March 2009 report, OFS  has filled two new staff positions for program and data management  analysts to support its oversight of financial agents.", "Treasury has made progress in developing a more routine process for  hiring OFS staff. During the transition from the previous administration,  with new TARP responsibilities still emerging and OFS functional areas  still developing, Treasury employed an informal approach to hiring staff in  order to bring employees on board expeditiously and meet immediate  mission needs. As TARP activities have solidified and become more stable,  Treasury and OFS staff have been better able to identify the skills and  abilities OFS needs and develop a more structured process for hiring.  Currently, Treasury routinely updates its Web site,  www.financialstability.gov, to inform potential candidates of new OFS  vacancies. These vacancy announcements are linked to job  announcements posted on the USAJOBS Web site. Additionally, Treasury  has developed more systematic approaches to reviewing applications and  interviewing candidates. For example, Treasury recently updated its  standard operating procedures for hiring staff to OFS. This includes a  procedure describing how to bring on board federal employees to serve as  detailees in OFS. While Treasury has developed more formal processes for  assessing candidates seeking employment with OFS, the department still  uses flexible hiring strategies in order to ensure that it is recruiting  candidates with the right skill sets and abilities to meet OFS mission  needs. For example, Treasury still utilizes the flexibilities provided under  direct hire authority to select candidates for employment who do not  submit formal applications via www.usajobs.gov. Nonetheless, Treasury  officials said that they encourage all candidates expressing interest in OFS  employment to apply via announcements posted on www.usajobs.gov  whenever feasible. In addition, to retain critical skills learned on the job,  Treasury has established a process to ensure knowledge transfer between  outgoing and incoming OFS detailees.", "Treasury continues to experience challenges in hiring qualified employees,  however, in part due to pay disparities with federal financial regulatory  agencies. In the past, Treasury told us that it had identified candidates  with the right skills and abilities to fill various OFS positions, but these  candidates often worked for financial regulators that could offer more  competitive salaries than OFS. To mitigate the effects of pay differences,  Treasury has employed some strategies that are available to all federal  agencies. In particular, Treasury has utilized maximum payable rates and  offered promotions to mid-level career employees. According to  Treasury, these incentives have been helpful in hiring some employees  who had previously worked at financial regulatory agencies. Nonetheless,  Treasury noted that while these tools have been useful in attracting lower-  and mid-level career employees, they do not always address substantial  differences between the compensation OFS can offer senior executives  and the rates offered by financial regulators. In addition, while the  department has the ability to use recruitment bonuses, use of this  incentive has been limited to employees who are not currently government  employees and therefore has not been used to recruit employees from  financial regulatory agencies. Moreover, while Treasury may use  relocation bonuses, its use of these for recruiting employees from financial  regulatory agencies has been limited because most candidates currently  working for financial regulatory agencies would not have to relocate to  accept a position in OFS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treasury Has Taken Various Steps to Manage Potential Conflicts of Interest among TARP Employees", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned in our prior work, Treasury has told us that vetting OFS  candidates\u2019 potential conflicts of interest has added time to the hiring  process.

First, Treasury officials have been obtaining  information on candidates\u2019 potential conflicts earlier in the hiring process,  through preliminary reviews of information provided on financial  disclosure reports. OFS employees are subject to the same laws and  regulations covering ethical codes of conduct as employees of other  executive branch agencies. Accordingly, OFS employees are prohibited  from participating personally and substantially in a particular matter that  will affect their financial interests or those of (1) a spouse or minor child;  (2) a general partner; (3) an organization for which they serve as an  officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee; or (4) a person with  whom they are negotiating for employment or have an arrangement  concerning prospective employment.", "In accordance with the Ethics in Government Act, Senate-confirmed  appointees, members of the Senior Executive Service, and other senior- level executive branch employees must disclose assets and other interests  that are attributable to them when beginning federal service and annually  thereafter in a public financial disclosure report. Other OFS employees  whose duties involve the exercise of significant discretion are required by  regulation to report their financial interests on a confidential financial  disclosure report (see table 11). Employees required to file a financial  disclosure report must do so within 30 days of appointment, unless  granted an extension. Treasury said it had obtained and retained a copy of  the financial disclosure reports filed by detailees with their home  agencies.", "Treasury has used databases to track reviews of Treasury employee  financial disclosure reports. These databases provide sufficient evidence  to demonstrate that, in general, OFS employees have filed financial  disclosure reports within 30 days of their appointment. We found that in  all but two cases, individuals required to complete these reports filed them  within 30 days of their appointment to OFS. In one case, the employee  was granted an extension to file and filed before the expiration of the  extension period. In the other case, the employee appears to have  submitted the report on time, but it was not officially marked as received  by Treasury ethics counsel until 1 business day after the expiration of the  30-day time-to-file period.", "Our analysis also supports Treasury\u2019s statement that it usually vets  conflicts of interest earlier in the hiring process for OFS staff than for  employees in other areas of Treasury. We found that, on average,  permanent OFS employees required to submit confidential financial  disclosure reports filed them about 21 days before their appointment.  Moreover, we found that the majority of OFS employees coming from  outside the federal government who were required to submit public  financial disclosure reports filed the reports in advance of their  appointment to OFS.", "To address the unique aspects of TARP operations in its reviews of OFS  employees\u2019 financial disclosure reports, Treasury established new internal  operating procedures on February 17, 2009, concerning the submission  and review of OFS employees\u2019 confidential financial disclosure reports. To  facilitate a preliminary identification and communication of obvious  potential conflicts, the new procedures set out as a goal to have OFS  candidates submit for initial review confidential financial disclosure  reports with Treasury ethics counsel before their formal appointment to  OFS. Generally, Treasury has followed this new procedure. In our review,  we found that of the 31 employees filing confidential financial disclosure  reports who were appointed to OFS on or after February 17, 2009,  Treasury ethics counsel received copies of such reports in advance of the  candidate\u2019s appointment to OFS in all but three cases. The new  procedures outlined plans for Treasury ethics counsel to better coordinate  with OFS supervisors during their reviews of confidential financial  disclosure reports submitted by OFS candidates. Treasury officials said  that the new coordination effort was helpful because OFS mission staff  were often more familiar with the day-to-day roles and responsibilities of  employees directly under their supervision. One of the tracking databases  provides some evidence to support Treasury\u2019s assertion that it routinely  coordinates reviews of employees\u2019 financial interests with OFS mission  staff. Specifically, the database includes a field that tracks the dates of  supervisory OFS staff reviews of confidential disclosure reports. In  reviewing the database, we identified several instances in which OFS  supervisors had reviewed confidential financial disclosure reports within a  few days of the Treasury ethics counsel\u2019s initial review. We found that for  42 permanent employees, OFS supervisors reviewed confidential financial  disclosure reports, on average, 5 days after Treasury\u2019s ethics counsel first  received the reports. However, the supporting information is somewhat  limited because the supervisory review field was incomplete for 14 of the  56 database pages we reviewed. Treasury\u2019s ethics counsel told us that this  information was absent most often because of a lag in data entry.  Specifically, Treasury said that dates might be entered into the database  some time after the reviews were complete because supervisory mission  staff might retain the reports for extended periods to, among other things,  track potential conflicts identified in the reports and help ensure that  employees recuse themselves from matters in which they had a financial  interest.", "Treasury provides various types of training to employees to help them  understand conflicts of interest and ensure compliance with ethical  standards of conduct. According to Treasury, this training is more rigorous  for employees whose jobs have higher potential to involve financial or  other conflicts. Treasury officials said that all employees receive group  training at orientation and certain employees whose positions are of a  more sensitive nature are provided one-on-one training with an ethics  officer. The databases also support Treasury\u2019s statement that it provided  both individual and group-based ethics training to OFS staff. Specifically,  we found that as of April 23, 2009, all OFS staff who completed financial  disclosure reports had received at least one ethics training session and  almost half had received two or more types of ethics training sessions.  While one database lacked some information on specific training dates, it  did provide some information on types of training provided to these  individuals (such as one-on-one training with ethics officers, makeup  training sessions, or group training conducted at orientation).", "OFS uses a variety of other measures to manage potential conflicts of  interest. Federal law permits Treasury to authorize a waiver permitting an  employee to hold certain financial interests if Treasury determines that  holding such interests does not substantially interfere with the integrity of  the individual\u2019s performance. According to Treasury, to date, two waivers  have been issued to OFS employees. One of these waivers gave a new OFS  employee 90 days to divest assets held in pooled investment funds that  could have presented a conflict into nonconflicting assets. In the other  case, after determining that a senior OFS official\u2019s deposits in a banking  institution could present a conflict of interest to the extent that these   deposits exceeded the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000, as a precautionary  measure, Treasury issued a waiver to permit the individual to retain these  deposit accounts. In both cases, Treasury determined that the investments  involved were not likely to affect the integrity of the individual\u2019s federal  service.", "In addition, when reviewing financial disclosure reports, Treasury ethics  counsel consulted with OFS employees on what activities they should  recuse themselves from participating in during their employment with OFS  because such activities could have potentially interfered with the  independent and objective performance of their jobs. According to  Treasury, during reviews of financial disclosure reports, OFS employees  have agreed to divest themselves of certain financial assets to mitigate  potential conflicts. Although Treasury does not routinely track  divestments, Treasury provided some documentation demonstrating that  multiple OFS employees divested assets that might have caused a conflict  with their official duties.", "Treasury has appropriately identified potential conflicts of interests among  senior-level OFS officials and has taken appropriate steps to address such  issues. We reviewed 15 public financial disclosure reports submitted by  OFS officials as of April 23, 2009. Seven of the reports reviewed had  already been submitted to the detailees\u2019 federal agencies during the past  fiscal year, but Treasury\u2019s ethics counsel reviewed the reports again to  assess potential conflicts in the context of the employee\u2019s OFS duties. In  our review of the reports, we identified financial interests that could have  conflicted with the independent and objective performance of some  duties. During our consultation with Treasury\u2019s ethics counsel, however,  we found that the same interests had already been identified, and we  obtained information showing that the ethics counsel had taken the  appropriate steps to address them. For example, in some cases, Treasury\u2019s  ethics counsel instructed individuals to divest themselves of certain  investments. In other cases, Treasury\u2019s ethics counsel directed individuals  to recuse themselves from matters involving former employers or firms  that compensated them for consulting services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Continued to Engage Contractors and Financial Agents", "paragraphs": ["Since our March 2009 report, Treasury has awarded 11 new contracts and  entered into four new financial agency agreements, bringing to 40 the total  number of TARP financial agency agreements, contracts, and blanket  purchase agreements as of June 1, 2009.

As we have noted in  prior reports, if TARP is having its intended effect, a number of  developments might be observed in credit and other markets over time,  such as reduced risk spreads, declining borrowing costs, and more lending  activity than there would have been in the absence of TARP. However, a  slow recovery does not necessarily mean that TARP is failing, because it is  not clear what would have happened without the programs. In particular,  several market factors helping to explain slow growth in lending include  weaknesses in securitization markets and the balance sheets of financial  intermediaries, a decline in the demand for credit, and the reduced  creditworthiness among borrowers. Nevertheless, credit market indicators  we have been monitoring suggest that while some rates have increased  since our March 2009 report, there has been broad improvement in  interbank, mortgage, and corporate debt markets in terms of perceptions  of risk (as measured by premiums over Treasury securities). In addition,  empirical analysis of the interbank market, which showed signs of  significant stress in 2008, suggests that CPP and other programs outside  TARP that were announced in October of 2008 have resulted in a  statistically significant improvement in risk spreads even when other  important factors were considered. Although foreclosures continue to  highlight the challenges facing the U.S. economy, total mortgage  originations rose roughly 70 percent over the fourth quarter of 2008.  Similarly, while the Federal Reserve data show that lending standards  remain tight, our analysis of Treasury\u2019s new loan survey indicate that the  largest 21 CPP recipients extended roughly $260 billion, on average, each  month in new loans to consumers and businesses in the first quarter of  2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TARP Programs Could Have a Number of Effects on Credit Markets and the Economy", "paragraphs": ["In our previous reports, we highlighted the rationale for CPP, CAP, TALF,  and the Home Affordability Mortgage Program (HAMP) and the intended  effects of these programs. Among other improvements, the TARP  programs, if effective, should jointly result in the following:  improvement in credit market conditions, including declining risk  premiums (the difference between risky and risk-free interest rates, such  as rates on U.S. Treasury securities) for interbank lending and bank debt  and lower borrowing costs for business and consumers. improvement in banks\u2019 balance sheets, enhancing lenders\u2019 ability to  borrow, raise capital, and lend to creditworthy borrowers; however, as we  have discussed in previous reports, tension exists between promoting  lending and improving banks\u2019 capital position.  fewer foreclosures and delinquencies than would otherwise occur in  absence of TARP. improvements in asset-backed securities markets, a development that  should increase the availability of new credit to consumers and  businesses, lowering rates on credit card, automobile, small business,  student, and other types of loans traditionally facilitated by securitization.", "While TARP\u2019s activities could improve market confidence in participating  banks and have other beneficial effects on credit markets, we have also  noted in our previous reports that several factors will complicate efforts to  measure any impact. For example, any changes attributed to TARP may  well be changes that (1) would have occurred anyway; (2) can be  attributed to other policy interventions, such as the actions of FDIC, the  Federal Reserve, or other financial regulators; or (3) have been enhanced  or counteracted by other market forces, such as the correction in housing  markets and revaluation of mortgage-related assets. Consideration of  market forces is particularly important when using bank lending as a  measure of CPP\u2019s and CAP\u2019s success because it is not clear what would  have happened in absence of TARP. Weaknesses in the balance sheets of  financial intermediaries, a decline in the demand for credit, reduced  creditworthiness among borrowers, and other market fundamentals  suggest lower lending activity relative to the expansion phase of the  business cycle. Similarly, nonbank financial institutions, which have  accounted for a significant portion of lending activity over the past two  decades, have been constrained due to weak securitization markets.  Because it is unlikely that any increase in loans originated by banks would  completely offset the decline in nonbank activity, the weakness in  securitization markets suggests that growth in aggregate lending will be  slow. Success in supporting nonbank financial institutions and revitalizing  the securitization market will depend in part on the success of TALF.  Lastly, because the extension of credit to less-than-creditworthy  borrowers appears to have been an important factor in the current  financial crisis, it is not clear that lending should return to precrisis levels.", "As discussed in our March 2009 report, Treasury has introduced PPIP to  facilitate the purchase of legacy loans and securities. The program aims  not only to reduce uncertainty about the solvency of holders of these  assets but also to encourage price discovery in markets for these assets,  assuming current market prices are below what they would otherwise be  in a normally functioning market. The impact of PPIP will depend in  particular on the pricing of the purchased assets. Sufficiently high prices  will allow financial institutions to sell assets, deleverage, and improve  their capital adequacy. To the extent that markets are underpricing such  assets or prices are suppressed due to illiquidity, higher prices may be  more reflective of the underlying value or cash flows associated with the  assets (and therefore aid in price discovery). However, all other things  being equal, higher prices impose certain risks on Treasury, FDIC, and the  Federal Reserve if prices paid are too high, as these agencies will absorb  losses beyond the equity supplied by investors. The contribution of  private-sector equity capital reduces incentives to overpay for assets,  depending on the proportion of equity supplied, because greater equity  contributions entail greater downside risk for buyers. In addition to  providing more transparent pricing to these assets, PPIP, if it is effective,  should have effects broadly similar to the intended effects of CPP and  CAP: improved solvency at participating institutions, reduced uncertainty  about their balance sheets, and improved investor confidence, allowing  these institutions to borrow and lend at lower rates and raise additional  capital from the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Selected Indicators Suggest General Improvement in Credit Market Conditions, but These Changes Cannot Be Attributed Exclusively to TARP", "paragraphs": ["We continue to consider a number of indicators that, although imperfect,  may be suggestive of TARP\u2019s impact on credit and other markets.  Improvements in these measures would indicate improving conditions,  even though those changes may be influenced by general market forces  and cannot be exclusively linked to any one program or action being  undertaken to stabilize and improve the economy. Table 13 lists the  indicators we have reported on in previous reports, as well as the changes  since the March 2009 report and the changes since the announcement of  CPP, the first TARP program. In general, the indicators illustrate that the  cost of credit and perceptions of risk have declined in corporate debt,  mortgage, and interbank markets since mid-October 2008 although the  cost of credit has risen in some markets since our March 2009 report. For  example, the cost of interbank credit (LIBOR) has declined by 38 basis  points since our March 2009 report, and the TED spread, which captures  the risk perceived in interbank markets, has declined by 57 basis points.  Since the announcement of CPP, the LIBOR and TED spreads have fallen  by approximately 400 basis points. Since the announcement of CPP,  corporate bond spreads have declined, and there have been significant  decreases of 101 and 207 basis points for high-quality (Aaa) and moderate- quality (Baa) corporate spreads, respectively, since our March 2009 report,  indicating reduced risk perceptions. Although the Aaa bond market rate  has increased somewhat since our March 2009 report, both Aaa and Baa  bond rates have declined since the announcement of CPP, indicating an  decrease in the cost of credit for businesses. Similarly, the improvement in  the mortgage market is consistent across rates and spreads although rates  have been rising dramatically recently. Mortgage rates were up 61 basis  points since our March 2009 report largely due to significant increases  over the last two weeks. However, the mortgage spread is down 53 basis  points. Since the announcement of CPP the improvement in the mortgage  market was consistent across rates and spreads\u2014down 87 basis points  and 74 basis points, respectively. (See our December and January reports  for a more detailed description and motivation for the indicators.) Recent  trends in these metrics are consistent with indicators monitored by GAO  but not reported and those tracked by other researchers. For example,  although not reported, the credit default swap index for the banking sector  has declined significantly since March 2009. As discussed above, changes  in credit market conditions may not provide conclusive evidence of  TARP\u2019s effectiveness, as other important policies, interventions, and  changes in underlying economic conditions can influence these markets.", "To examine further whether the decline in the TED spread could be  attributed in part to CPP, we conducted additional analysis using a simple  econometric model to address one of the most obvious threats to validity.  Because the TED spread reached extreme values leading up to the CPP  announcement (over 450 basis points), it is possible there would have  been declines from these peaks even in the absence of CPP simply  because extreme values have a tendency to return to normal levels.  However, even when we accounted for this possibility and the general  state of the economy using variables such as stock market performance  and the spread between long- and short-term Treasuries, we found that  CPP, announced on October 14, 2008, had a statistically significant  negative impact on changes in the TED spread. Even so, the associated  improvement in the TED spread (or LIBOR) cannot be attributed solely to  TARP because the October 14 announcement was a joint announcement  that introduced other Federal Reserve and FDIC programs in addition to  CPP. Moreover, the model we used is relatively simple and did not attempt  to account for all of the important factors that might influence the TED  spread. Omitting such variables could bias the results in unpredictable  ways. (See appendix III for additional information and limitations.)", "We continue to monitor mortgage originations and foreclosures as  potential measures of TARP\u2019s effectiveness. As table 13 indicates,  mortgage originations increased over 70 percent, from $260 billion in the  fourth quarter of 2008 to $445 billion in the first quarter of 2009 (see also  fig. 5). We noted in previous reports that if TARP worked as intended, we  expected mortgage originations to stop declining and eventually rise.  While the volume of new mortgage lending may reflect the availability of  credit, it may also indicate changes in credit risk or the demand for credit.  As figure 5 illustrates, mortgage applications also increased in the first  quarter, principally due to refinancing. Although originations were still  below the level in the first quarter of 2008, it is not clear that originations  would or should return to the level seen in the period leading up to the  credit market turmoil. Similarly, foreclosure data, although also influenced  by general market forces like falling housing prices and job loss, should  provide an indication of the effectiveness of HAMP and CPP to the extent  that improved market conditions enhance the ability of creditworthy  borrowers to refinance mortgages. However, it is too soon to expect  material changes in this area given that HAMP was only recently  implemented. As table 13 shows, the percentage of loans in foreclosure  reached an unprecedented high of 3.9 percent at the end of the first  quarter of 2009, up from 3.3 percent the previous quarter. The foreclosure  rate on subprime loans rose to 14.3 percent from 13.7 percent (the rate for  adjustable-rate subprime loans is now over 23 percent). We will provide  additional information on foreclosures and general conditions in mortgage  markets in future TARP-related and other reports to Congress.", "Our analysis of Treasury\u2019s loan survey showed that the largest CPP  recipients continued to extend loans to consumers and businesses,  roughly $260 billion on average each month in 2009. Because these data  are unique, we were not able to benchmark the origination levels against  historical lending or seasonal patterns at these institutions. As illustrated   in figure 6, new lending at the 21 largest institutions participating in CPP  fell 6 percent in February and rose 27 percent in March, month over  month.", "Although lending normally drops during a recession and lending standards  for consumer and business credit remained tight, our analysis of the April  2009 release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s loan officer survey found that  aggregate new lending by these institutions in March amounted to roughly  $295 billion (see table 14), or 41 percent higher than the low recorded in  November 2008. Consistent with the trends in aggregate mortgage  originations discussed above, total mortgage originations for the largest  CPP banks rose 15 percent to roughly $117 billion. The reporting  institutions generally received CPP funds on October 28, 2008, or  November 14, 2008, with a few institutions receiving funds on December  31, 2008, or January 9, 2009.", "As we discussed in the March report, TALF support to securitization  markets should, if effective, result in lower rates and increased availability  of credit for the businesses and households that receive the underlying  loans. The primary consumer ABS markets include ABS backed by auto  loans, credit card receivables, and student loans. Although TALF is in its  beginning stages, we have begun monitoring lending activity at the  institutions most likely to be impacted by conditions in securitization  markets. For example, because stand-alone auto finance companies are  more heavily reliant on securitization than commercial banks, we noted  that changes in the trends in their automobile loan rates could partially  reflect the issues in securitization markets that TALF is intended to  address. As figure 7 shows, the average finance company auto rate has  been consistently below commercial bank auto rates. However, from  August to November 2008 the average finance company rate increased  significantly, rising by 132 basis points, while the average bank rate  increased just slightly (13 basis points). In contrast, from November  2008 to February 2009, the finance company rate declined significantly  (326 basis points) to 3.2\u2014well below the bank rate, which fell only 13  basis points. The average rate for new automobile loans at finance  companies declined another 43 basis points to 2.74 percent during  March. While these declines correlate with the launching of TALF, the  finance rate could also reflect the attempt by auto finance companies to  attract buyers in a weak market, as well as other forces. We will continue to monitor these trends as well as data on credit card debt and othe  consumer and business loan markets. Moreover, because TALF has beenexpanded to other assets, including commercial MBS, other measure s of  lending activity and loan rates may become more appropriate indicators as  time progresses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has continued to take steps to refine some TARP programs and  finalize others. In doing so, it has taken steps to address our previous  recommendations. Some areas, however, require ongoing attention.

Consistent with our recommendation for greater  disclosure of monies paid to Treasury by TARP participants, Treasury now  includes dividends and interest received in its periodic reports to Congress  that are also posted to the www.financialstaility.gov Web site and plans to  provide dividend information by institution on the Web site. OFS has also  made progress in filling key positions in most areas but some vacancies  continue to be more challenging to fill. Finally, Treasury has made  additional progress in improving its communication strategy, including  hiring an individual who will be responsible for managing OFS\u2019s  relationships with Congress, among other duties, but continued progress  in this area would further improve the transparency of the program.  Appendix II provides our assessment of Treasury\u2019s implementation of our  previous recommendations.", "Since our March 2009 report, Treasury has hired its first asset managers to  help manage its investment portfolio and help monitor compliance with  limitations on dividend payments and stock repurchases. However,  Treasury has yet to clearly identify the role that asset managers will have  in monitoring compliance; it has only noted that the asset managers will  have a limited role in the area of executive compensation oversight. While  hiring these managers is an important step, Treasury has yet to develop a  structured process to oversee compliance with program requirements and  the act. As noted in prior reports, we will continue to monitor  developments in this area, which is critical to ensuring the accountability  and integrity of the program.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s completion of the stress tests for the 19 largest  bank holding companies was a significant milestone for CAP. While stress  test results revealed that about half of the banks needed to raise additional  capital to ensure their ability to continue lending to creditworthy  borrowers and maintain sufficient capital against losses, it remains unclear  whether any of the institutions will have to use CAP to raise additional  capital. The results of the stress test provided a rare glimpse into the  condition of these institutions, but questions have been raised about the  stress test assumptions, given the ongoing challenges in financial markets.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve does not plan to provide any additional  information on the condition of the banks over the next 18 months that  could show whether the banks had met their projected performance and  loss levels. The extent to which the institutions will disclose additional  information is unclear. As a result, the information provided could be  selective and difficult to compare across institutions, raising questions not  only about transparency of SCAP but also CAP. Moreover, the Federal  Reserve did not provide OFS staff with information about SCAP prior to  its public release and has no plans to share ongoing information about any  of the SCAP institutions that continue to be CPP or CAP participants.  Without such information, OFS lacks information needed to adequately  monitor these programs.", "Although several banks have repurchased or announced plans to  repurchase their preferred shares and warrants, the regulators\u2019 repurchase  approval criteria have lacked adequate transparency. The Federal Reserve  has provided criteria for the 19 largest bank holding companies, but the  other regulators have not consistently provided details about how they  have made repurchase determinations and how they will make future  determinations. Clearly articulated and consistently applied criteria are  indicative of a robust decision-making process, and without them,  Treasury\u2019s ability to help ensure consistent treatment of institutions  requesting repurchase of their shares is limited.", "Similarly, Treasury has provided limited information about the warrant  repurchase process on its www.financialstability.gov Web site. We  recognize the challenges associated with valuing warrants in the absence  of readily available markets for these instruments. For this reason, and  because the valuation process can be assumption driven, a well-designed,  fully vetted transparent process becomes critical to defusing questions  about the warrant valuation process and whether the resulting prices paid  by the institutions reflect the taxpayers\u2019 best interests. While Treasury has  provided some limited information about the valuation process, it has yet  to provide the level of transparency at the transaction level that would  begin to address such questions. Additional information, such as the  institution\u2019s initial offer and Treasury\u2019s final valuation, would begin to  address some of these issues.", "Treasury has taken steps toward implementing a communication strategy,  such as developing a new Web site and developing a media relations  position dedicated to TARP. Treasury has also included its public affairs  and legislative affairs staff in regular meetings with OFS to ensure that  communication and operations are better integrated. However, Treasury\u2019s  current communication strategy may not be as effective as it could be.  Treasury has recognized the importance of reaching out to congressional  stakeholders on a regular and proactive basis and planned to do more to  ensure that all committees of jurisdiction receive regular communication  about TARP. However, until this strategy is fully implemented,  congressional stakeholders may not receive information in a consistent or  timely manner. In addition, although Treasury has said that the new  www.financialstability.gov Web site is a key component of its efforts to  improve communication on TARP, it has not yet taken steps to determine  whether the site is user-friendly or whether visitors to the site are finding  the information they seek. Usability testing and customer satisfaction  surveys are recognized best practices for improving the usefulness of Web  sites. While Treasury is in the process of exploring the use of such tools,  these efforts should be implemented as quickly as possible to gauge the  effectiveness of its communication efforts.", "Treasury has continued to make progress in establishing its management  infrastructure and has responded to our two most recent contracting  recommendations and continued to respond to the others.", "In the hiring area, Treasury has continued to establish its management  infrastructure, including hiring more staff. In accordance with our prior  recommendation that it expeditiously hire personnel to OFS, Treasury  continued to use direct-hire and various other appointments to bring a  number of career staff on board quickly. Since our March 2009 report,  Treasury has continued to increase the total number of OFS staff overall,  including the number of permanent staff. However, continued attention to  hiring remains important because some offices within OFS, such as the  offices of Homeownership and Risk and Compliance, continue to have a  number of vacancies that need to be filled as TARP programs become fully  implemented.", "In the internal controls area, consistent with our previous report  recommendation that Treasury update guidance available to the public on  determining warrant exercise prices to be consistent with actual practices  applied by OFS, Treasury updated its frequently asked questions on its  Web site to clarify the process it follows for determining the prices.   However, there continues to be inconsistent guidance available on the  Web site for calculating the exercise prices. Treasury told us that any new  CPP applicants would most likely be non-public institutions for which  these guidance documents would not apply.  As such, Treasury does not  believe the inconsistent guidance is a significant issue and therefore does  not plan on further addressing the inconsistency.  If this warrant exercise  price guidance is no longer needed, then we believe that Treasury should  remove these guidance documents from its Web site to alleviate any  inconsistent descriptions of its process pertaining to warrant exercise  price calculations for public institutions. If Treasury chooses to leave the  documents on its Web site, then, as we previously recommended, Treasury  should make these documents consistent with respect to the warrant  exercise price calculations.", "Treasury has continued to build a network of contractors and financial  agents to support TARP administration and operations and has an  opportunity to enhance transparency through its existing reporting  mechanisms. Treasury issues a number of reports and uses other  mechanisms, such as public announcements and its Web site, to provide  information to the public. Useful details are still lacking, however, on the  costs of procurement contracts and financial agency agreements, such as a  breakdown obligated and expenses for each entity. These contracts and  agreements are key tools OFS has used to help develop and administer its  TARP programs. By not providing this information, Treasury is missing an  opportunity to provide additional transparency about the cost of TARP  operations.", "Finally, while again noting the difficulty of measuring the effect of TARP\u2019s  activities, some indicators suggest general improvements in various  markets since our March 2009 report although the cost of credit has risen  in some cases. Specifically, the Baa corporate bond rate and LIBOR have  declined but mortgage and Aaa bond rates have risen. However,  perceptions of risk in credit markets (as measured by premiums over  Treasury securities) have decreased in interbank, mortgage, and corporate  bond markets, while total mortgage originations have increased. Empirical  analysis of the interbank market, which showed signs of significant stress  in 2008, suggests that CPP and other programs outside of TARP that were  announced in October 2008 resulted in a statistically significant  improvement in risk spreads, even when other important factors were  considered. In addition, although Federal Reserve survey data suggest that  lending standards remained tight, collectively the largest CPP recipients  extended roughly $260 billion on average each month in new loans to  consumers and businesses in the first quarter of 2009, according to the  Treasury\u2019s loan survey. However, attributing any of these changes directly  to TARP continues to be problematic because of the range of actions that  have been and are being taken to address the current crisis.

The  official expressed concern that our recommendation to consider  periodically disclosing aggregate information to the public on the  performance of the 19 U.S. bank holding companies against the more  adverse scenario would be operationally difficult and potentially  misleading. Specifically, the official said the SCAP loss estimates were  developed as aggregate 2-year estimates, without attempting to forecast  the quarter-to-quarter path of such losses over the 2009 to 2010 period.  Further, the official expressed concern that the size and character of the  bank holding companies\u2019 on- and off-balance sheet exposures may change  materially over the 2-year period and that the Federal Reserve never  intended that the one-time SCAP estimates be used as a tool for measuring  U.S. bank holding company performance during the 2009 to 2010 period.", "We understand that while this analysis would pose some operational  challenges for the Federal Reserve because the exercise was intended to  calculate a one-time capital buffer needed to withstand a more adverse  economic scenario and that the on-and off-balance sheet exposure of the  19 institutions may change materially over time. However, given the  dynamic economic environment, we see great value in periodically  measuring and reporting U.S. bank holding company performance against  the adverse scenario and whether the adverse scenario is more or less  adverse compared against changing economic conditions. Although this  would periodically require additional calculations, we believe this analysis  would provide useful trend information on the aggregate health of these  important institutions. As we previously stated, without such analysis, the  public will not have reliable information that can be used to gauge the  accuracy of the stress test projections on a more detailed basis than what  has been disclosed in the SCAP papers. Further, it could counter any  adverse affect of any selective reporting by individual institutions.

We also include a time trend, an indicator variable  that indicates whether the TED spread was at an extreme value the day  before (defined as 200 basis points or greater) and a counter variable that  indicated the number of consecutive days, including the day in question,  that the TED spread had taken on an extreme value. The latter variable  was included to control for a potential \u201cregression to the mean\u201d effect.

Under the  original terms of CPP, financial institutions were prohibited from  repurchasing such stock and debt within the first 3 years unless they  completed a qualified equity offering. Under the act, as amended,  Treasury must permit a financial institution to repurchase the preferred  stock or subordinated debt issued to Treasury at any time, subject to  Treasury\u2019s consultation with the primary federal banking regulator. In  Treasury\u2019s public guidance (FAQs) on repurchases, it states that financial  institutions should give notice of their intent to repurchase to their  primary banking regulator, which will apply existing supervisory  procedures to determine whether to approve the repurchase.", "As shown in figure 8, the process begins when Treasury and the primary  federal regulator receive written notification (e-mail or letter) from the  financial institution of its intent to repurchase in full or in part its  preferred stock or other securities from Treasury. The primary federal  regulator performs an analysis using available supervisory information and  information provided by the institution to gauge its current financial  condition and prospects, such as whether there has been a significant  change in a financial institution\u2019s financial condition and viability since it  received CPP funds. This analysis allows the regulator to determine if the  repurchase request should be approved or denied. In addition, the 19  largest U.S. bank holding companies that were subject to the stress test  must also be able to demonstrate access to common equity through public  issuance in the equity capital markets, and successfully issue senior  unsecured debt for a term greater than 5 years and not backed by Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guarantees, in amounts sufficient  to demonstrate a capacity to meet funding needs independent of FDIC  guarantees. According to Treasury, the consultation consists of the  primary federal regulator informing Treasury of its decision to approve or  deny the request via e-mail. If the federal regulator of the entity that issued  the preferred stock or other securities to the Treasury indicates it has no  objection to, or approves of, the repurchase, Treasury then notifies in  writing the financial institution that the repurchase is in process and  instructs the financial institution to contact its Treasury counsel to set up  dates for closing and settlement. If the repurchase is denied, Treasury  notifies the institution.", "All four primary federal regulators noted that their role in the repurchase  process followed existing regulations and procedures for evaluating  requests by any financial institution regardless of whether they participate  in CPP. The Federal Reserve has established instructions for processing  capital repurchase requests for CPP and other government capital  programs by bank holding companies. For the 19 U.S. bank holding  companies that participated in the Supervisory Capital Assessment  Program, on June 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve released the criteria it  planned to use to evaluate applications to repurchase Treasury\u2019s capital  investments.

For privately held institutions, Treasury  immediately exercises the warrants at the time of the capital investment  and receives additional preferred shares. The financial institution  repurchases these warrant preferred shares after it repurchases the senior  preferred shares from Treasury. Publicly traded institutions have the  option to repurchase outstanding and unexercised warrants after the  senior preferred shares are repurchased. Although Treasury can sell the  warrants at any time, Treasury is required to notify the financial institution  30 days prior to a sale. Following a repurchase of the senior preferred  shares held by Treasury, an institution can repurchase the warrants at fair  market value (FMV), as defined in section 4.9 of the Securities Purchase  Agreement.

If the financial institution does not wish to  repurchase the outstanding warrants, Treasury may proceed with  liquidating the warrants at the current market price. If the financial  institution decides to repurchase the warrants, the institution\u2019s board of  directors determines the FMV, acting in good faith and relying on an  opinion of a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm  retained by the financial institution for such purpose and certified in a  resolution to Treasury. Through the use of market quotes from market  participants, financial modeling, fundamental research, and a third-party  consultation, Treasury makes an independent determination of the FMV of  the warrants. If Treasury does not agree with the financial institution\u2019s  determination, it may object in writing within 10 days of receipt of the  financial institution\u2019s FMV determination, and the two parties must work  together to resolve any issues and agree on an FMV. If they are unable to  agree on an FMV in 10 days, either party has 20 more days to invoke the  appraisal procedure by delivery of written notice.", "Under the appraisal procedure, Treasury and the financial institution each  choose an independent appraiser to determine the estimated FMV and  notify each other of their choices within 10 days. If the two appraisers are  unable to agree upon an FMV for the warrants within 30 days of their  appointment, the appraisers have 10 additional days to select and appoint  a third independent appraiser. The third appraiser then has 30 days to  render its estimated FMV. The three estimated FMVs are to be averaged  unless the larger of the differences between the higher FMV and middle  valuations and the middle and lower valuations is more than 200 percent  of the smaller difference. If the larger difference exceeds 200 percent of  the smaller, the outlying valuation that triggers the exception is to be  excluded and the remaining two are to be averaged.
