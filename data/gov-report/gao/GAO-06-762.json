However, MBN lacks a comprehensive, long-term strategic plan. As MBN emerges from its start-up mode and faces future challenges, a long-term strategic plan will be important. While MBN has developed financial and administrative controls to manage and safeguard its financial resources, it could take additional steps to strengthen its system of internal control. For example, the MBN has not (1) convened a meeting of its internal control board to formally develop its controls and coordinate audits, (2) completed an internal control plan, (3) completed a risk assessment to address potential risks to its operation, or (4) developed a comprehensive training program for its staff. MBN has procedures in place to help ensure its programming meets its journalistic standards. However, MBN lacks regular editorial training and has not fully implemented a comprehensive, regular program review process to determine whether its programming complies with those standards or with MBN's mission. While the BBG calls for its broadcasters to undergo an annual program review, Radio Sawa has only held one such review, and Alhurra has not completed one to date. The BBG has developed several performance indicators and targets for MBN's Radio Sawa and Alhurra services, including measures of audience size and program credibility. However, it is not clear whether the Radio Sawa and Alhurra performance targets have been met because of weaknesses in MBN's survey methodology and documentation. The BBG did not take certain steps that could have explained and increased the reliability of its estimates, such as by fully documenting its research and estimation methods, measuring the level of uncertainty surrounding its estimates, disclosing significant limitations, and consistently implementing policies and procedures for verifying data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s 2006 National Security Strategy stipulates that public  diplomacy, which includes U.S. international broadcasting, is an important  instrument for engaging and informing foreign audiences, creating and  maintaining a dialogue with Muslim leaders, and confronting  misinformation about the United States.

Pan-Arab satellite television stations\u2013in  particular, the news stations Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya--are currently the  primary competitors to Alhurra. According to the BBG\u2019s research firm  Intermedia, Al Jazeera is currently the top international broadcaster as a  source of news and information for audiences in many countries  throughout the Middle East. Moreover, Alhurra will face new competition  from the BBC\u2019s entry to the Middle Eastern satellite television market in  2007. BBC officials have indicated that the new station\u2019s overall approach  in the region will be multimedia in focus, taking advantage of the BBC\u2019s  more than 60 years experience of broadcasting on the radio to the region as  well as its award-winning Arabic-language news Web site. For Radio Sawa,  the primary competitive challenge comes from existing local radio stations  in its broadcast range and the BBC World Service in Arabic, as well as from  the generally increasing competitiveness of the Middle East radio market.", "Alhurra also faces operational and programmatic competitive disparities,  since both Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya are estimated to receive significant,  although unknown, levels of funding from their respective supporting  Qatari and Saudi financiers--allowing them to develop large networks of  correspondents and bureaus throughout the Middle East and other parts of  the globe. Al Jazeera, in particular, has bureaus in over 30 locations across  6 continents, which enable it to respond to breaking news events on a  timely basis. Alhurra and Radio Sawa, by comparison, only have overseas  bureaus in Baghdad, Dubai, and Amman. In addition, the BBC has a large  network of correspondents and bureaus around the globe and, unlike  Alhurra, has a vast in-house library of desirable BBC-produced content,  including documentaries and current affairs programming, which can be  readily translated into Arabic. The BBC also has favorable licensing and co- production arrangements with many companies.", "One of Radio Sawa\u2019s other primary challenges is its lack of broadcast  coverage in certain countries in the Middle East region. For example, Radio  Sawa does not have any broadcasting coverage in Tunisia, Libya, and  Algeria. Moreover, it has faced difficulties expanding its transmission to  include FM coverage in some countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria,  Yemen, and Oman.

In addition, MBN conducts  ongoing assessments of its competitors and uses various types of market  research to gain information about its audience and media usage patterns  in the Middle East. It has used this information to make adjustments to its  programming within its current budget, and also to develop proposals for  obtaining additional funding for new efforts. BBG and MBN officials have  explained that they use audience surveys, audience monitoring panels,  focus groups, in-depth interviews, and Arab television and music station  monitoring to inform MBN\u2019s current efforts and planning, whenever  possible.", "As a result of market research performed in August 2004, MBN officials  identified television viewing patterns and made changes to Alhurra  program schedules, such as by offering programming appealing to  women (e.g., current affairs and health and fitness programming) during  the daytime.", "Through a review of the current competition in the market, MBN  officials decided that it was important to increase the number of debate  programs they broadcast on Alhurra.

MBN officials also learned of the  importance of efforts to localize those features, and made changes to  tailor programs to the interests of audiences of the various Radio Sawa  streams.", "MBN has also developed program enhancement proposals for Alhurra and  Radio Sawa as part of the BBG\u2019s language review and budget request  processes. Several proposals were included in the President\u2019s fiscal year  2007 budget request. For example, the budget request includes a proposal  to increase Alhurra\u2019s newsroom hours to increase on-the-spot and breaking  news coverage. In addition, in fiscal year 2005, the administration  requested additional funds for providing satellite Alhurra broadcasts to  Europe. According to planning documents, many of the Alhurra proposals  were designed to reinforce one another with the goal of improving  Alhurra\u2019s credibility, as well as building audience size and increasing  viewing time of those who already tune in. MBN also developed one  proposal for enhancing Radio Sawa\u2019s operations that calls for increasing  the amount of localized news content offered on five regional streams,  which officials say would allow the station to more effectively compete  with local stations in its broadcast range.

Additionally, risk assessment is  an integral part of strategic planning. According to GAO guidance,  organizations should make management decisions in the context of a  strategic plan, with clearly articulated goals and objectives that identify  resource issues and internal and external threats, or challenges, that could  impede the organization from efficiently and effectively accomplishing its  objectives. Additionally, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance suggests that strategic plans contain, among other things, a  statement of the organization\u2019s long-term goals and objectives; define  approaches or strategies to achieve goals and objectives; and identify the  various resources needed and the key factors, risks, or challenges that  could significantly affect the achievement of the strategic goals.", "MBN has yet to create its own long-term strategic plan. MBN\u2019s president  stated that funding uncertainties and other more pressing organizational  needs--such as the development of financial and administrative policies and  procedures--have delayed the development of MBN\u2019s strategic plan and  related planning policies. In addition, he commented that MBN did not  emphasize planning in its early stages because it was focusing on making  its networks broadcast-ready. BBG officials said another reason for the  delays in planning is that the BBG and MBN are still learning about the  market, especially for Alhurra, and are taking a close look at the results of  audience surveys, focus groups, and in-depth interviews to determine the  best direction for these initiatives. MBN has stated that, to date, it has  primarily used the BBG strategic plan for organizational guidance.  Nevertheless, BBG officials said the BBG also has the expectation that all  broadcasting entities will develop their own strategic plans, particularly to  guide funding decisions.", "In the absence of a strategic plan of its own, MBN lacks a comprehensive,  strategic approach that fully outlines (1) a shared vision of operations for  Alhurra and Radio Sawa, (2) detailed implementation strategies to achieve  measurable outcomes related to its goals, and (3) the competitive  challenges it faces and how it plans to address them.", "First, MBN does not have a comprehensive strategic vision for the  integration of Radio Sawa and Alhurra operations in the organization. For  example, although MBN\u2019s most recent annual performance plan contains a  goal to \u201cintegrate news operations for more effective television and radio  news-gathering,\u201d none of MBN\u2019s current plans outline specific, shared  objectives for Radio Sawa and Alhurra. MBN officials told us that several  steps toward integration of Alhurra and Sawa have occurred to date, such  as sharing financial and administrative support staff. However, Radio Sawa  and overseas bureau staff we talked with said that cooperation between  Alhurra and Radio Sawa is limited, the identities of the stations are  separate, and the two stations work largely independently of one another.  Radio Sawa staff noted several areas for further increasing cooperation,  including more sharing of interviews, sound bites, field correspondents,  Web site stories, and copy editors. One staff member in the Baghdad  bureau said that Radio Sawa and Alhurra operations in Iraq are completely  independent, including separate offices, and only the financial activities of  both offices are supervised by the same person.  In addition to gaining  more efficiency in operations, a vision for further integration of Radio  Sawa and Alhurra may help MBN more effectively identify opportunities to  address its challenges from increasing competition in the Middle East.", "Second, MBN has not yet developed detailed implementation and resource  strategies needed for successful implementation of its goals. For example,  with regard to MBN\u2019s initiative to localize content on Radio Sawa, we were  not able to identify a plan directing what types of local news and features  will be considered on the various streams, to what degree existing program  schedules might be affected, and how required resources might be divided  among the various streams. Additionally, although MBN\u2019s most recent  annual performance plan states a goal of \u201cexpanding overseas production  of news coverage for radio and television,\u201d neither that document nor any  other plan MBN identified provides details or direction for the overseas  production of news for Alhurra in existing overseas offices. MBN officials  have stated that uncertainties in the future commitment of resources to  Alhurra have affected MBN\u2019s ability to, for example, plan for and use  existing overseas offices for Alhurra news. Further, BBG officials have said  MBN is still learning about the Middle Eastern media market. However,  given MBN\u2019s internal enhancement requests to the BBG to increase the  number of news bureaus in the region, among others, it should clarify, for  example, what implementation steps are necessary to maximize the use of  existing overseas offices.", "Third, MBN has not yet comprehensively outlined its challenges or  developed a strategic approach for how it plans to address its key  challenges to broadcasting in the Middle East. While MBN is planning to  expand its broadcast operations into Europe, it has not clearly identified  how its broadcasts will meet competitive challenges in the Middle East. As  an example, MBN has not indicated how it will address the implications of  the upcoming BBC Arabic-language television initiative.

Some risks identified by MBN include threats to the  security of its staff and bureaus in the field, particularly in Iraq, and the risk  of a terrorist attack on its facilities in the United States. There are some  risks that MBN has not identified or addressed. For example,  PriceWaterhouseCoopers, MBN\u2019s external auditor, noted that MBN has not  adequately addressed its risks related to information security. Doing so  would reduce the risk of security incidents and unauthorized system  activity, according to the auditor. PriceWaterhouseCoopers also found that  MBN\u2019s lack of a business continuity plan or an adequate disaster recovery  plan could result in slower recovery in the case of such an event, as well as  significant loss of revenue, inability to meet customer needs and third party  obligations, and potential noncompliance with legal requirements.

First, we  observed that, in 12 out of 14 cases, the BBG used nonprobability surveys,  which cannot be reliably projected to the broader population, to develop its  regional estimates for audience size and credibility. While it is difficult to  conduct probability surveys in hostile environments, such as those in Iraq  and Saudi Arabia, the BBG did not take certain steps that could have  increased the accuracy of its estimates and explained their limitations,  thereby increasing confidence in the data. Therefore, we are unable to  determine whether MBN actually met its performance targets for fiscal  year 2005.", "BBG has taken several important steps to enhance the validity and  reliability of its audience survey designs. For example, the BBG\u2019s  questionnaires are reviewed by multiple parties, and its contractors  extensively pretest the questionnaires in the field, conduct pilot studies,  and use throwaway surveys for training new subcontractors. In addition,  the BBG\u2019s contractors exercise quality control when collecting data and  receiving it from the field, including by conducting preliminary electronic  testing of the data, among other things.", "However, in 12 of 14 cases, we found the country-level estimates used for  generating Radio Sawa and Alhurra\u2019s fiscal year 2005 performance  indicators of audience size and credibility were not based on probability  survey results. Many of the surveys conducted used judgment sampling, a  form of nonprobability sampling, instead. BBG officials told us that its use  of nonprobability surveys for certain countries is due to either the cultural,  political, or security situation in those countries, which limits the selection  of individuals or the geographical areas that can be surveyed. In addition,  the International Broadcasting Bureau director of research stated that in  many developing countries, existing map and population data is not  adequate to support pure probability-based sampling. The Conference of  International Broadcasters\u2019 Audience Research Services, called CIBAR,  whose standards are specified as a source of guidance for BBG research  contractors, requires that audience measurement use samples based on the  principles of random probability and that other sampling methods should  only be used in cases where, for reasons of practicality or cost, proper  random samples cannot be used. (See appendix IV for more on the CIBAR  standards.)", "We recognize that many agencies face challenges in collecting credible  performance data and that, due to security risks and political  considerations in many Middle Eastern countries, it is not always possible  to expect BBG to use random samples. However, the BBG did not take  certain steps that could have explained and increased the reliability of its  estimates, such as fully documenting its research methods, measuring the  level of uncertainty surrounding its estimates, disclosing significant  limitations, limiting the scope of its projections to areas actually covered  by its surveys, and developing and implementing procedures for verifying  data.", "First, the BBG and its research contractors were unable to provide us with  certain documentation commonly required by international broadcasting  research standards. CIBAR requires that, in all measurement research, the  sampling methods used and other technical aspects of the survey be both  fully and accurately described in the project documentation and open to  independent scrutiny. We asked the BBG and its contractors to provide us  with detailed documentation\u2013including clear information on sampling  plans and related assumptions, response rates, and adjustments applied to  the data to reflect the effects of the survey design\u2013for all 14 of its Middle  Eastern country surveys used to develop its fiscal year 2005 performance  indicator estimates. For two cases, the BBG was unable to provide us with  any survey documentation, and for all but one case, the BBG and its  contractors were unable to provide us all the detailed information we requested. BBG officials acknowledged the lack of complete  documentation in contractor technical reports, and said it was due in part  to their failure to follow up with the contractors to obtain the details,  aswell as to the contractors\u2019 general practice of not generating such  detailed documentation.", "Second, the BBG has not sufficiently measured the level of uncertainty  surrounding MBN\u2019s performance estimates. CIBAR requires that in all  measurement research, technical aspects of the survey, including margins  of error and confidence levels where appropriate, be both fully and  accurately described in the project documentation. The BBG has not been  able to measure sampling errors for its surveys, in part because it has not  required contractors to document the information that is needed to  calculate the sampling errors accurately. Moreover, officials said that it is  not customary for their contractors to maintain this information.  Therefore, the BBG only has a rough idea of what the margins of error  might be for its surveys, further limiting confidence in the reliability of its  current performance information. One research official told us that he  believed that the overall margins of error for Radio Sawa and Alhurra\u2019s  audience size and credibility estimates are large, but said that currently the  agency cannot accurately calculate them.", "Third, the BBG lacks transparency in reporting data sources and significant  limitations affecting MBN\u2019s audience size and credibility performance  information. In reporting performance data, agencies should provide data  sources, disclose limitations, and discuss the implications of them. CIBAR  standards also recommend that proper care be exercised when reporting  estimates, to ensure that the type of audience covered by the estimate is  clearly stated and that, at all stages in the calculation and extrapolation  process, sources, assumptions, and methods be fully documented and  available for independent scrutiny. However, the BBG has not sufficiently  explained the specific methods used for generating estimates for its  performance indicators, such as the number and names of the countries  surveyed, methods of sampling used, sources of the population data, and  basic procedures used to create the estimates. Moreover, the BBG has  reported only two limitations for MBN performance indicators to date: (1)  that credibility ratings are highly dependent on volatile political factors;  and (2) that, depending on political, social, and media conditions,  measurement of audience size may either be easily attained or impossible.  However, the BBG has not explained many significant limitations, and their  resulting implications, on the data reliability of the performance  information for MBN. The largest identifiable limitations not reported are  that many of the BBG surveys are not based on probability sampling, cover  only part of the country, have very low response rates, or have high  substitution rates; therefore, those results cannot be reliably projected to  be representative of the larger population. In the case of the survey in  Morocco, we calculated that the survey only covered 35 percent of the  general population and had a 48 percent substitution rate, but the results  were projected to represent a broader population. In addition, we  calculated low response rates for a number of MBN\u2019s surveys; in the case of  the survey of Egypt, the response rate was about 19 percent. BBG research  staff explained that their stakeholders to date, including the BBG, have not  required such a level of detail in reporting, and specifically have not  required margins of error. However, a discussion on data limitations in  performance reporting can help decision makers determine their level of  confidence in the agency\u2019s ability to report on its performance goals and  indicators and identify actions needed to improve its ability to measure  performance.", "Fourth, we found the BBG has not taken sufficient steps to avoid  projections to areas outside the population surveyed. For example, the  elimination of projections to the rural population of Morocco, when only  urban areas were surveyed, or to those governorates of Jordan not  contained in the survey, would have resulted in estimates of audience size  and credibility with fewer limitations for those countries. In addition, BBG  project documentation does not clearly describe what steps have been  taken to restrict the scope of MBN\u2019s surveys to provinces or areas that have  sufficient map or population data. Probability sampling projected to those  areas only would result in more reliable estimates of audience size and  credibility.", "Fifth, we found the lack of verification procedures inhibits assessments of  BBG\u2019s data quality. Data reliability is increased by the use of verification  and validation procedures, such as checking performance data for  significant errors by formal evaluation or audit. However, BBG has not fully  implemented such procedures or formally documented policies and  procedures governing its research. BBG officials said they have  implemented some forms of verification, such as a research director  review, at various stages of performance data analysis. However, it is not  clear that the BBG always thoroughly verifies performance indicator  estimates and calculations used for reporting. For example, we identified  some errors in internal calculation spreadsheets for performance  estimates, in official external reporting, and in an informal presentation on  MBN performance. BBG officials have acknowledged that they need to  develop policies and procedures and implement more rigorous verification  of performance data. They said that, as a result of our review, they have  taken some steps to expand their verification procedures and will  document those and other research procedures in the BBG\u2019s research  contract and manual of operations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["MBN was established to broadcast accurate and relevant news and  information to the Middle East in order to advance freedom, democracy,  and long-term U.S. interests in the region.

Developing a strategic plan that  establishes specific objectives, provides an overall shared vision or  framework for decision-making, and comprehensively addresses  competitive challenges could enable MBN to identify efficiencies or  opportunities to address its competitors more effectively and increase  congressional confidence in its operations.", "Although MBN has developed a number of financial and administrative  controls, it could take additional steps to ensure its system of internal  control is fully implemented. MBN\u2019s planned internal control board needs  to establish protocols to oversee and monitor its internal control structure  and to ensure timely completion of MBN\u2019s financial audits. Additionally,  MBN should develop an internal control plan, conduct a comprehensive  risk assessment, and develop an organized training program for its staff.", "Further, MBN has developed journalistic standards for its broadcast  operations and has put in place a number of editorial procedures. However,  the network has not conducted annual program reviews called for in BBG  guidance. These reviews are a key mechanism for improving programming  and ensuring quality control.", "Finally, the BBG has established performance indicators and targets for  MBN services related to measures of audience size and program credibility.  For example, in fiscal year 2005, the BBG reported that Radio Sawa and  Alhurra had each achieved radio and television audiences of about 21.6  million. However, limitations in the survey methods and documentation  used for developing these estimates raise questions about the accuracy of  MBN\u2019s performance estimates. In addition, the BBG has not put in place  policies and procedures for verifying the accuracy of its performance  information. These weaknesses in methodology and documentation inhibit  an accurate assessment of whether the Radio Sawa and Alhurra  performance targets have been met. The accuracy of the MBN estimates  could be improved by more rigorous reliance on probability sampling,  wherever possible, and avoidance of projections to areas not contained  within the survey. At the same time, insistence on proper fieldwork  documentation from contractors, full disclosure of survey methods and  limitations, and greater transparency in the development of aggregate  audience estimates would further enhance confidence in MBN  performance estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve efforts to monitor performance and the efficiency and  effectiveness of the broadcasting activities of the Middle East Broadcasting  Networks, Inc., we recommend that the chairman of the BBG do the  following:  Require that MBN develop a long-term strategic plan, which  incorporates a shared vision for Alhurra and Radio Sawa operations and  details specific measurable objectives and implementation strategies for  the successful implementation of the goals in the plan.", "Require that MBN implement the remaining recommendations from the  Grant Thornton LLP report and require that its internal control board  meet on a regular basis to coordinate MBN\u2019s single audits and oversee  MBN\u2019s ongoing efforts to use sound internal control procedures.", "Develop a process for analyzing risk as part of strategic planning that  identifies approaches to mitigate the potential obstacles to efficiently  and effectively achieving MBN\u2019s operational objectives.", "Require MBN to develop a comprehensive training program covering  both internal controls and editorial procedures to meet the continuing  needs of all employees.", "Initiate a schedule of annual program reviews for Radio Sawa and  Alhurra to regularly ensure that the quality of Alhurra\u2019s broadcasts  conforms to applicable standards.", "Implement program quality performance indicators for MBN\u2019s broadcast  services, consistent with other BBG entities, to assess and compare  their performance and measure the contribution of these efforts to the  goals of the overall organization.", "Require research contractors to improve the methods used in audience  research to allow for probability sampling and document the sample  selection so that survey sampling errors can be calculated, where  possible.", "Identify and report significant methodological limitations and the  implications of them for performance indicators, including, where  applicable, sampling errors, margins of error, or confidence intervals.", "Develop, document, and report policies and procedures for verification  and analysis of performance indicator estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) provided written comments  on a draft of this report.

According to representatives of InterMedia, they recruited a large number  of panelists because the BBG wanted more input than usual. Panelists  listened to and evaluated 6 days worth of programming, responded to a  questionnaire that evaluated all of Radio Sawa\u2019s broadcast criteria,  answered open-ended questions, provided detailed feedback, and made  recommendations about the programming.

According to a BBG official, it was decided that  information obtained from the audience monitoring panel would capture  the issues that would normally be covered by the internal analysts in the  content and production analyses.", "However, even a detailed, well-thought-out questionnaire does not replace  the different perspectives internal and external control reviewers bring to  the review, according to a grantee official. According to an International  Broadcasting Bureau official, even though the three components of a  program review\u2013audience panels and internal and external reviewers\u2013use  nearly the same criteria, they provide different insights into the program\u2019s  quality, direction, and context. According to several media experts, while  audience panelists can evaluate news and information from their own  perspective, they are less qualified to evaluate a service\u2019s mission or judge  the extent to which a show complies with journalistic standards. In  particular, the absence of an internal review meant that Radio Sawa\u2019s  programming was not evaluated by people familiar with BBG and MBN  standards and controls.  Moreover, the external control listener\u2019s  evaluation is intended to give the service a sense of what the panel\u2019s  responses would be like if the environment were freer and more open,  information that a monitoring panel cannot provide.", "The BBG told us that it did not believe an internal evaluation was necessary  because the English translations of each of the panel reports enabled them  to examine and assess MBN\u2019s programming. The BBG also told us that it  did not use external control listeners in the review for several reasons: (1)  Radio Sawa\u2019s focus on youth and popular music would make it difficult for  a typical older control listener to evaluate Sawa\u2019s programs; (2) the BBG  lacked resources to use control listeners for the multiple countries in Radio  Sawa\u2019s review; (3) it would have been hard to find impartial listeners; and  (4) the four in-country panels ensured enough diversity of opinion so that  there was less need for a control reviewer. However, according to an  International Broadcasting Bureau official, the VOA is able to successfully  evaluate youth shows using its regular internal reviewers. Moreover, it may  be possible to use younger control listeners, or to use the older ones  selectively. For example, RFE/RL uses a control listener to evaluate the  news of Radio Farda.

GAO acknowledges in the report that MBN has participated in long- range planning in coordination with the BBG\u2019s update of its 2008-2012  strategic plan, and that MBN has developed a 2006 annual performance  plan as part of the OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool process.  However, contrary to the BBG\u2019s comments, the fiscal year 2006  performance plan document for MBN that we obtained did not contain  all of the elements of a stand-alone strategic plan. In addition, we were  told by the former executive director of the BBG, who is currently the  president of MBN, that the Radio Sawa strategic plan drafted in 2002 by  the BBG\u2013which the BBG stated in its comments contributed to its  considerable long-term planning for MBN--was never adopted by the  BBG. We were also told by MBN\u2019s former president that he had never  received a copy of the draft Radio Sawa strategic plan. 2. The BBG stated that MBN\u2019s Single Audit evaluates the effectiveness of  its internal control program. However, while MBN\u2019s Single Audits  address the fair presentation of the organization\u2019s financial statements,  its compliance with certain laws and regulations, and the organization\u2019s  internal control as it relates to financial reporting, MBN\u2019s 2005 Single  Audit as prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers does not\u2013contrary to  what the BBG stated in its comments--offer an opinion on the overall  effectiveness of MBN\u2019s internal control. Thus, the unqualified opinion  that MBN received on its fiscal year 2005 Single Audit does not provide  a broad assessment or opinion of MBN\u2019s internal control system. For  the purposes of our report, it was therefore necessary to consider other  assessments of MBN\u2019s financial and administrative controls, including  the Grant Thornton report.  3. MBN\u2019s grant agreement states that MBN should make every reasonable  effort to achieve the purpose of the grant in accordance with OMB  Circulars A-110, A-122, and A-133. Our report did not attempt to make  an assessment of MBN\u2019s compliance with its grant agreement, but  rather focused on the progress MBN has made in developing its system  of internal control and the ways in which MBN can continue to  strengthen this system. To that end, we drew upon the work of Grant  Thornton LLP, which assessed the status of MBN\u2019s controls against  relevant OMB Circulars and GAO guidance on internal control.   4. While the Grant Thornton recommendations are not obligatory, they  are based on best management practices from OMB and GAO.  According to officials, both the BBG and MBN accepted the results of  the report, which provides detailed insight into MBN\u2019s financial  operations, when it was completed in May 2004. Adopting the report\u2019s  remaining recommendations would help MBN in its efforts to build a  fully mature internal financial management operation. 5. The BBG stated that it believes its standards yield data of sufficient  reliability to allow it to estimate MBN\u2019s audiences and credibility.  However, the BBG offers no evidence for this. BBG\u2019s estimates for MBN  are based on judgment and not statistics, and its current methods do  not and cannot estimate the error in its estimates. As noted in the  report, in several instances the BBG and its contractors departed from  CIBAR research standards. For example, we analyzed 12 of the 14  country surveys conducted by BBG contractors for 2005. In the BBG\u2019s  fiscal year 2007 budget request, the BBG reported the results of each  country survey and an overall estimate for audience size of 21.5 for  Alhurra and 21.6 million for Radio Sawa. However, our analysis of the  12 surveys identified a number of methodological weaknesses,  including BBG\u2019s failure to fully document research methods, measure  the level of uncertainty surrounding its estimates, disclose significant  limitations, limit the scope of its projections to areas actually covered  by its surveys, and develop and consistently implement policies and  procedures for verifying data. These limitations were not reported in  BBG\u2019s audience survey estimates and prevent us from concluding that  the estimates are accurate and reliable. 6. We acknowledge in the report that there are challenges to conducting  audience research in the Middle East, and that there are tradeoffs  between cost and data reliability when conducting research. 7. As we noted in the report, it is difficult to conduct probability sampling  in many locations in the Middle East. But, it is not impossible.  Organizations, including the United States Census Bureau, have  collaborated on probability surveys in the Middle East, including in  Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The major problem of the BBG estimates is  their lack of transparency, and the lack of an explanation for the  methodology behind BBG\u2019s estimates.", "8.", "In conducting our data reliability assessment, as referenced in the  report, we largely used the international audience research guidelines  published by CIBAR. The BBG participated in drafting these standards,  which are specified as a source of guidance for BBG research  contractors. CIBAR standards recommend that proper care be  exercised when reporting estimates to ensure that the type of audience  covered by the estimate is clearly stated, and that, at all stages in the  calculation and extrapolation process, sources, assumptions, and  methods are fully documented and available for independent scrutiny.  As noted in the report, in several instances the BBG and its contractors  departed from CIBAR research standards, leading to weaknesses in  MBN\u2019s methodology and documentation. As a result, we were unable to  determine the accuracy of MBN\u2019s fiscal year 2005 audience size and  program credibility estimates.  9. The BBG stated that it believes the level of methodological detail it has  provided in public documents is comparable with that typically used by  other research organizations for studies in the Islamic world; therefore,  it believes it is consistent with industry practice. However, the Reports  Consolidation Act of 2000 requires federal agencies, such as the BBG,  to assess the completeness and reliability of the performance data in  their performance reports and to discuss any material inadequacies in  the completeness and reliability of their performance data, as well as  actions to address the inadequacies. In performance reporting such as  the BBG fiscal year 2007 budget request, the BBG reported the results  of its research for MBN as 21.5 million viewers for Alhurra and 21.6  million for Radio Sawa. However, the BBG did not sufficiently explain  the specific methods used for generating estimates for its performance  indicators, such as the number and names of the countries surveyed  (including the sizes of its samples), methods of sampling used, sources  of the population data, and basic procedures used to create the  estimates. Moreover, the BBG reported only two limitations for MBN  performance indicators to date: (1) that credibility ratings are highly  dependent on volatile political factors; and (2) that, depending on  political, social, and media conditions, measurement of audience size  may either be easily attained or impossible. Significant limitations not  reported are that many of the BBG surveys are not based on probability  sampling, cover only part of the country, have very low response rates,  or have high substitution rates. Therefore, the BBG does not provide a  full level of confidence in the credibility of its performance data for  MBN. In contrast, the Department of Transportation, has a separate  compendiums available online that provides source and accuracy  statements, which provide detail on the methods used to collect  performance data, sources of variation and bias in the data, and  methods used to verify and validate the data. 10. The BBG cannot calculate the sampling error for the BBG estimates of  audience size and credibility because the probability of selection is not  known. Although increased sample size will generally decrease  sampling error, it is impossible to accurately estimate the sampling  error of the BBG surveys because they are nonprobability surveys. As  the BBG has stated, its use of a simple random sampling formula when  calculating sampling errors for its surveys underestimates the sampling  error. This formula is not appropriate for the sample designs used by  MBN.  11. Although our recommendation asks the BBG to require research  contractors to improve the methods used in audience research to allow  for probability sampling and document the sample selection so that  survey sampling errors can be calculated, where possible, it is the  responsibility of the BBG to explain and justify the need to conduct  nonprobability samples."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Diana Glod, Melissa Pickworth, Eve Weisberg, Dorian Herring, and Joe  Carney made key contributions to this report.
