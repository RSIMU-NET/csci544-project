To better understand how the training needs of employed workers, including low-wage workers, is publicly supported, GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which local areas and states provide assistance to train employed workers, including funding training; (2) the focus of such training efforts and the kind of training provided; and (3) when targeting training to low-wage workers, the approaches state and local officials identified to address challenges in training this population."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, two-thirds of the 470 local workforce boards responding to our survey provided assistance to train employed workers, such as partnering with employers to develop training proposals or funding training. Nearly 40 percent specifically budgeted or spent funds on training these workers. The number of boards that reported funding training for employed workers varied by state, but most states had at least one workforce board that targeted funds on such training. At the state level, all 16 states that GAO contacted also funded training for employed workers. These states and local workforce boards reported funding training that addressed specific business and economic needs. Although many types of training for employed workers were funded, most often occupational training to upgrade skills, such as learning new computer applications, and basic skills training, such as in English and math, were emphasized and community or technical colleges were most frequently used to provide these services. In targeting training specifically for low-wage workers, state and local officials identified approaches to challenges that hindered individuals' and employers' participation in training. Officials developed approaches to address some of the personal issues that low-wage workers face that made participating in training difficult. They also developed ways to gain support from employers who were reluctant to participate in low-wage worker training, such as by partnering with employers to develop career paths that help retain employees within companies. However, officials reported that challenges to implementing successful training still exist. For example, they explained that the WIA performance measure that tracks the change in adult earnings after 6 months could limit training opportunities for employed workers, including low-wage workers. The wage gain for employed workers would not likely be as great as that for unemployed job seekers, and this might provide a disincentive to enrolling employed workers into training because their wage gain may negatively affect program performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Technological advances continue to transform the U.S. workforce and  economy.

Such training can  enable employed workers to advance in their jobs, opening up entry-level  positions for others.

We received  responses from 79 percent of the workforce boards surveyed. To  determine how states provided assistance for training employed workers,  including low-wage workers, we conducted telephone interviews with  officials in 16 states who were responsible for workforce development,  economic development, and TANF funds used for education and training.  We selected these states because, between 1998 and 2001, most of them  had used federal funds, such as demonstration grants, for training  employed workers. In obtaining information from state officials and local  workforce investment boards, we focused on program years 2000 and  2001. To obtain more in-depth information about the approaches state and  local officials use to address challenges in providing training specifically  for low-wage workers, we visited local areas in four of the states\u2014Florida,  Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota; these were chosen from the states whose  officials we interviewed by telephone. We selected these states for site  visits largely because experts and others had identified them as having  specific efforts for training employed workers, especially initiatives to help  low-wage workers retain employment and advance in their jobs. We also  discussed efforts to train employed workers with officials from the  Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education,  and representatives of associations such as the National Governors\u2019  Association, National Association of Workforce Boards, and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce.

For  training employed workers, the WIA funds used are from those  appropriated to provide services to all adults as well as dislocated  workers, funded at about $2.5 billion for program year 2001. WIA also  permits states to set aside up to 15 percent of WIA funds allocated for  adults, youth, and dislocated workers to their states to support a variety of  statewide workforce investment activities that can include implementing  innovative employed worker programs.

For this system, WIA created three sequential levels  of service\u2014core, intensive, and training. The initial core services, such as  job search assistance and preliminary employment counseling and  assessment, are available to all adults and WIA imposes no income  eligibility requirements for anyone receiving these core services. Intensive  services, such as case management and assistance in developing an  individual employment plan, and training require enrollment in WIA and  generally are provided to persons judged to need more assistance. In order  to move from the core level to the intensive level, an individual must be  unable to obtain or retain a job that pays enough to allow the person to be  self-sufficient, a level that is determined by either state or local workforce  boards. In addition, to move from the intensive level to the training level,  the individual must be unable to obtain other grant assistance, such as  Department of Education grants, for such training services.

WIA holds states accountable for achieving their performance levels by  tying those levels to financial sanctions and incentive funding. States  meeting or exceeding their measures may be eligible to receive incentive  grants that generally range from $750,000 to $3 million. States failing to  meet their expected performance measures may suffer financial sanctions.

Overall, welfare-to-work program services were  intended to help individuals get and keep unsubsidized employment.  Allowable activities included on-the-job training, postemployment services  financed through vouchers or contracts, and job retention and support  services.

For example, workforce boards we visited in Florida, Minnesota, Oregon,  and Texas became involved in funding or obtaining funding for local  initiatives to train health care workers, such as radiographers and certified  nursing assistants, that hospitals needed.", "Some states considered local economic conditions, such as unemployment  rates, in their grant award criteria in addition to, or instead of, giving  priority to certain economic sectors and occupations. For example,  California\u2019s Employment Training Panel must set aside at least $15 million  each year for areas of high unemployment. Similarly, in Illinois and  Indiana, the state economic development offices considered county  unemployment or community needs in awarding training funds. Florida\u2019s  workforce training grants gave priority to distressed rural areas and urban  enterprise zones in addition to targeting economic sectors.", "In addition, most state economic development offices (13 of 16) and more  than half of the state workforce development offices (9 of 16) we  contacted funded training that was tailored or customized to specific  employers\u2019 workforce needs. For economic development offices, such  customized training was not new: these offices have typically funded  training for specific companies as a means of encouraging economic  growth within their states, and in some cases have done so for a long time.  For example, California has funded training tailored to specific employers\u2019  needs since 1983 through its Employment Training Panel. This program  spent $86.4 million in program year 2000 to train about 70,000 workers;  nearly all of them were employed workers according to state officials.  However, for many state workforce development offices, funding  customized training was a shift in their approach to workforce training,  one that could strengthen the links between employees and jobs. With  customized training, local employers or industry associations typically  proposed the type of training needed when they applied for funding and  often selected the training providers. Examples of customized training  initiatives sponsored by workforce development offices include the  following:  In Indiana, the state workforce office has sponsored a high-skills, high- wage training initiative since 1998 to meet employers\u2019 specific needs for  skilled workers in information technology, manufacturing, and health. This  effort is part of a statewide initiative for lifelong learning for the existing  workforce.  In Hawaii, the workforce office established a grant program for employer  consortiums to develop new training that did not previously exist in the  state.  In Louisiana, the workforce office has funded a training program  customized for employers who had been in business for at least 3 years. It  required that the company provide evidence of its long-term commitment  to employee training.", "In the states we contacted, many customized training programs required  that grant applicants\u2014usually employers\u2014create partnerships with other  industry or educational organizations. For example, Oregon\u2019s workforce  development office required local businesses to work with educational  partners in developing grant proposals. One local workforce board we  visited in Oregon collaborated with a large teaching hospital and its union  to obtain funding for training hospital employees, and local one-stop staff  partnered with nursery consortia and community colleges to obtain funds  to upgrade the skills of agricultural workers. Similarly, in its high-skill  training grant program, New York\u2019s workforce development office  required employers to form partnerships with labor organizations, a  consortium of employers, or local workforce investment boards.", "In at least 11 of the 16 states we contacted, the programs also required  employers to provide matching funds for training employed workers,  which can help offset costs to the state for training as well as indicate the  strength of the employers\u2019 commitment to training. States that had  requirements for matching funds\u2014often a one-for-one match\u2014included  Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon,  Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. Utah\u2019s economic  development office required a lower match from rural employers, and  Indiana\u2019s match varied case-by-case. Sometimes states required other  kinds of corporate investments as a condition for obtaining funds for  training employees. For example, in Tennessee, companies participating in  a job skills training program for high technology jobs were required to  make a substantial investment in new technology. In addition, several  states included certain requirements in their eligibility criteria to address  potential concerns about whether public funds were being used to fund  training that businesses might otherwise have funded themselves. For  example, in Louisiana and West Virginia, the workforce office requires  employers to provide evidence satisfactory to the office that funds shall be  used to supplement and not supplant existing training efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employed Worker Training Focused on Occupational and Basic Skills Training Provided by Community and Other Colleges", "paragraphs": ["Although states reported funding many types of training for employed  workers, occupational skills training and basic skills training were the  most prevalent.

In Tennessee, for example, the  economic development office spent more than $27 million of state funds in  program years 2000 and 2001 on a job skills training initiative for workers  in high-skill, high-technology jobs, according to a state official. Nearly all  states also reported funding basic skills training, including in basic math  skills and ESL, for employed workers with low levels of education.

In addition, workforce officials we visited identified ways  to address employer reluctance to support training efforts. Despite  attempts to address these issues, however, challenges to implementing  successful training still exist.

However, many officials also  reported several approaches to training low-wage workers.", "Offering workplace ESL and literacy programs were some approaches  used by officials to address limited English and literacy skills among low- wage workers. For example, one workforce board in Minnesota used a  computer software program to develop literacy among immigrant  populations. Another state workforce official in Oregon reported  customizing ESL to teach language skills needed on the job. In addition,  some of the employers we visited provided training to their employees in  their native language or taught them vocational ESL. Officials we visited  in Texas offered a 5-week vocational ESL course before the start of the  certified nursing assistant training program primarily to help prepare  Vietnamese and Spanish speaking students who were not fluent in English.", "Many low-wage workers faced challenges securing reliable transportation  and childcare, particularly in rural areas and during evening hours. Several  state and local officials noted that assisting low-wage workers with  transportation and childcare enabled them to participate in training. One  program in Florida provided childcare and transportation to TANF-eligible  clients. In Minnesota, local officials told us that they provided  transportation for program participants. Participants used the agency\u2019s  shuttle bus free-of-charge until they received their second paycheck from  their employer. After the second paycheck, the individual paid a fee for the  shuttle and was encouraged and supported in finding transportation on  their own.", "Providing on-site, paid, or flexible training were methods used to address  scheduling conflicts and financial constraints experienced by low-wage  workers. Many workforce boards that identified approaches on our survey  cited various methods of providing training to low-wage workers that  helped officials address some of the challenges faced by low-wage  workers. These methods included offering training at one-stops or through  distance learning and teleconferencing courses. For example, an employer  in California paid employees for 40 hours of work, but allowed 20 hours of  on-site training during that time. In addition, some hospitals permitted  flexible schedules for employees who sought additional training for career  advancement.", "Offering additional assistance and incentives were approaches identified  by officials for improving low-wage workers\u2019 limited work maturity skills  such as punctuality and appropriate dress. Officials we visited in Texas  reported that they helped low-wage workers develop better skills for  workplace behavior. For example, they helped clients understand the need  to call their employer if something unexpected happens, like a flat tire,  that prevents them from coming to work.

According to state and local officials, employers\u2019  reservations about participation stemmed from different concerns,  including the fears that better trained employees would find jobs  elsewhere. Officials reported that other employers were hesitant to  participate in low-wage worker training because of paperwork  requirements or the time and expertise they believed were involved in  applying for state training grants. Despite these concerns, state and local  officials identified approaches to encourage employer participation.", "According to officials we contacted, some employers said that if their  employees participated in training, they would seek jobs elsewhere.  Officials addressed this perception by forming partnerships with  employers and educators and offering training that corresponded to  specific career paths within a company. For example, a workforce board  we visited in Oregon partnered with a local nursery, a landscaping  business, and a community college to train entry-level workers in  agriculture and landscaping to move up into higher-skilled and better  paying positions at the same company. These career paths also addressed  the concern, expressed by some employers, that too few employees were  qualified to fill positions beyond the entry level. Officials found other ways  to alleviate employers\u2019 fears. Officials in Oregon encouraged trainees at a  hospital to stay with their current employer by requiring them to sign a  statement of intent regarding training. The hospital trained employees  after they signed an agreement that asked for a commitment that they  remain with the employer for a specific amount of time in return for  training.", "State and local officials noted that some employers were also reluctant to  have their employees participate in government-funded training programs  because they believed that certain data collection and reporting  requirements were cumbersome. For example, state workforce officials  we contacted reported that some employers found it difficult to get  employees to fill out a one-page form regarding income as required to  determine eligibility for certain funds, such as TANF. In an effort to ease  the funding paperwork burden, state officials we contacted in West  Virginia were working towards reducing the application paperwork  required for employers to obtain worker-training dollars.", "Workforce officials also reported that some employers were hesitant to  apply for federally funded training grants because they believed that they  did not have the time or the expertise to apply for such grants. To address  this, workforce officials we visited in Oregon worked with union  representatives and training providers to co-write training grant proposals.  The workforce officials we visited told us that the involvement of the  union was a key factor in the training initiative\u2019s success. Prior to this  cooperative effort, the employer had not been responsive to workers\u2019  needs and the involvement of the union helped to bridge the gap between  worker and employer needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures and Other Funding Requirements May Limit Training Opportunities for Low-Wage Workers", "paragraphs": ["State and federal funding requirements\u2014such as WIA performance  measures, time limits, and participant eligibility\u2014may limit training  opportunities for some low-wage workers. Under WIA, performance  measures hold states accountable for the effectiveness of the training  program. If states fail to meet their expected performance levels, they may  suffer financial sanctions. State funding regulations for some training  initiatives, such as TANF-funded projects, required the funds to be used  within a specific time period. Because local areas must wait for states to  allocate and disburse the funding, local officials sometimes had less than  1 year to use the funding. Finally, individuals are sometimes eligible for  services based on their income, especially for TANF or WIA local funds.  Depending on the level at which local areas set eligibility requirements,  some low-wage workers may earn salaries that are still too high to be  eligible for services provided by these training funds.", "WIA established performance measures to provide greater accountability  and to demonstrate program effectiveness. These performance measures  gauge program results in areas such as job placement, employment  retention, and earnings change. (See table 1.) Labor holds states  accountable for meeting specific performance outcomes. If states fail to  meet their expected performance levels, they may suffer financial  sanctions; if states meet or exceed their levels, they may be eligible to  receive additional funds. A prior GAO report noted that the WIA  performance levels are of particular concern to state and local officials. If  a state fails to meet its performance levels for one year, Labor provides  technical assistance, if requested. If a state fails to meet its performance  levels for two consecutive years, it may be subject to up to a five percent  reduction in its annual WIA formula grant. Conversely, if a state exceeds  performance levels it may be eligible for incentive funds.", "State and local officials reported that the WIA performance measure that  tracks the change in adult earnings after six months could limit training  opportunities for employed workers, including low-wage workers. Some  workforce officials were reluctant to register employed workers for  training because the wage gain from unemployment to employment tended  to be greater than the wage gain for employed workers receiving a wage  increase or promotion as a result of skills upgrade training. For example, a  state official from Indiana noted that upgrading from a certified nursing  assistant to the next tier of the nursing field might only increase a worker\u2019s  earnings by 25 cents per hour. Yet, for the purposes of performance  measures, workforce boards may need to indicate a change in earnings  larger than this in order to avoid penalties. For example, one workforce  official from Michigan reported that the performance measure requires the  region to show an increase that equates to a $3.00 per hour raise. In a  previous GAO study, states reported that the need to meet these  performance measures may lead local staff to focus WIA-funded services  on unemployed job seekers who are most likely to succeed in their job  search or who are most able to make wage gains instead of employed  workers.", "Time limits for some funding sources were a challenge for some officials  trying to implement training programs, according to some state and local  workforce officials. In Florida, for example, officials we visited reported  that they had a state-imposed one-year time limit for using TANF funds for  education and training, which made it difficult for officials to plan a  training initiative, recruit eligible participants, and successfully implement  the training program. Similarly, state and local officials we contacted in  Oregon expressed frustration with the amount of effort required to ensure  the continuation of funding for the length of their training initiative. They  noted that funding for a one-year training grant for certified medical  assistants and radiographers expired seven months before the training  program ended. The local workforce board identified an approach to fund  the training for the remainder of the program by using other funding  sources. Although this workforce board was able to leverage other funds,  this solution is not always feasible.", "Finally, several officials reported that eligibility requirements for the WIA  local funds are a challenge because they might exclude some low-wage  workers from training opportunities. States or local areas set the income  limit for certain employment and training activities by determining the  wage level required for individuals to be able to support themselves. When  funds are limited, states and local areas must give priority for adult  intensive and training services to recipients of public assistance and other  low-income individuals. Officials on several workforce boards said that  these eligibility guidelines for their local areas, particularly the income  limit, made it challenging to serve some low-wage workers. For example,  local workforce board officials from California indicated that they would  like more flexibility than currently allowed under state WIA eligibility  requirements to serve clients who may earn salaries above the income  limit. The officials noted that some workers in need of skills upgrade could  not be served under WIA because they did not qualify based on their  income. To address this challenge, officials we visited at a local workforce  board in East Texas told us that they set the income limit high enough so  that they can serve most low-wage workers in their area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As of program year 2001, many states and local workforce boards were  beginning to make use of the flexibility allowed under WIA and welfare  reform to fund training for employed workers, including low-wage  workers. They used WIA state set-aside funds and local funds, as well as  TANF and state funds, as the basis for publicly funded training for  employed workers. In addition, they considered business needs in  determining how these funds were used to train employed workers.  Consequently, training for employed workers could better reflect the skills  that employers need from their workforce in a rapidly changing economy.  In addition, such skills may help employees better perform in their jobs  and advance in their careers.", "Training for employed workers is particularly critical for workers with  limited education and work skills, especially those earning low wages. For  such workers, obtaining training while employed may be critical to their  ability to retain their jobs or become economically self-sufficient. While  training low-wage workers involves particular challenges, workforce and  other officials have developed ways to implement training initiatives for  low-wage workers that may help mitigate some of these challenges. This is  especially necessary in the economic downturn following the boom in the  1990s when TANF and WIA were created.", "However, WIA\u2019s performance measure for the change in average earnings  may create a disincentive for states and local workforce boards to fund  training for employed workers because employed workers, particularly  low-wage workers, may be less likely than unemployed workers to  significantly increase their earnings after training. To the extent that state  and local workforce investment areas focus on unemployed workers to  ensure that they meet WIA\u2019s performance measure for earnings change\u2014 and thereby avoid penalties\u2014employed workers, and especially low-wage  workers, may have a more difficult time obtaining training that could help  them remain or advance in their jobs.

We included steps in both the data  collection and data analysis stages to minimize such non-sampling errors.  For example, survey specialists in combination with subject matter  specialists designed our questionnaire; we pretested the questionnaire to  ensure that questions were clear and were understood by respondents;  and to increase our response rate for the mail survey, we made a follow-up  mailing and called local workforce investment boards that did not respond  by a specified date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Semistructured Telephone Interviews", "paragraphs": ["To determine state efforts to train employed workers, including low-wage  workers, we conducted semistructured telephone interviews in   16 judgmentally selected states with state officials responsible for  workforce development, economic development, and TANF funds used for  education and training.
