Concerns have been raised that specialists may be more likely than primary care physicians to provide costly and unnecessary care. In addition, some believe that, in certain situations, patients benefit more from the integrated care that primary care physicians are trained to provide. Yet for a number of specific conditions, including heart attacks and severe asthma, studies have shown that patients treated by specialists are more likely to receive appropriate care and follow prescribed treatment regimens than patients treated by other physicians.", "Less is known about differences in treatment patterns between patients cared for by specialists and other physicians in health maintenance organizations (HMO). Specialist care is generally more expensive than care by other physicians, and HMOs often use primary care physicians as gatekeepers to refer patients to specialty services. According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and other sources, the proportion of physician appointments with specialists is smaller for HMO enrollees than for those with private fee-for-service insurance.", "To learn more about the effect of physician speciality on the care provided in HMOs, you asked us to examine potential differences in treatment patterns for HMO patients treated by specialists and those treated by generalist physicians. To explore these differences, we assessed follow-up treatment for heart attack survivors enrolled in Medicare HMOs. We chose to focus our examination on this group because the differences in the quality of cardiac care provided by cardiologists and generalists have been particularly well-documented and the effectiveness of specific treatments for coronary heart disease has been clearly demonstrated. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death for the Medicare population, and nearly 6 million Medicare beneficiaries\u201415 percent of the eligible population\u2014are currently enrolled in HMOs.", "To conduct our analysis, we applied three standards of care\u2014each centered on a drug therapy\u2014whose efficacy in reducing subsequent morbidity and death for heart attack survivors has been well established: long-term use of cholesterol-lowering medications, beta-blockers, and aspirin. Specifically, we determined (1) the proportion of Medicare heart attack survivors enrolled in HMOs who take cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and aspirin and (2) whether Medicare heart attack survivors in HMOs regularly treated by a cardiologist are more likely to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and aspirin than those who do not have regular cardiology appointments. We also examined the influence of background patient characteristics and other medical conditions on the use of these drugs.", "We surveyed Medicare HMO beneficiaries who were already a part of a larger study on heart attack treatment\u2014the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP), conducted by HCFA. CCP provided detailed clinical data for each of our respondents from their initial heart attack hospitalization in 1995. The survey was conducted in 1997, about 2 years after the reported heart attack, and the sample was restricted to individuals aged 65 to 84 when the heart attack occurred. CCP data allowed us to identify respondents with possible contraindications for beta-blockers or aspirin, but it did not include measurements of blood cholesterol levels.", "Because physician specialty data were not available for heart attack survivors under fee-for-service Medicare, this report does not compare the experiences of HMO patients and those in the traditional Medicare program. In addition, our report does not consider other aspects of care provided to heart attack survivors, the cost-effectiveness of care, or the procedures by which HMOs provide specialist care to enrollees.

This appears to be especially true for cardiac care, where changes in treatment paradigms occur frequently. Cardiologists also have the advantage of seeing a larger number of patients with heart conditions, so they have more experience with the range of variation in presenting symptoms and responses to therapy.", "Numerous studies comparing the performance of cardiologists and primary care physicians, or generalists, in providing patient care tend to support the view that cardiologists provide a higher level of cardiac care. For example, researchers have found that cardiologists demonstrate a better understanding of the appropriate use and relative efficacy of alternative treatments for heart attacks and congestive heart failure than generalists. Moreover, cardiologists are generally quicker to put successful innovations into practice and to discontinue using therapies shown to be less effective. This has been found in the treatment of unstable angina as well as heart attacks. Studies have also demonstrated that cardiologists are more likely to follow well-established treatment guidelines than generalists. Several studies report that cardiologists are more likely to prescribe cholesterol-lowering drugs to patients with elevated cholesterol levels and beta-blockers to heart attack survivors. A smaller group of studies has found that cardiologists achieve better outcomes\u2014including for inpatient care for heart attacks. Similar differences in practice patterns between specialists and generalists have been found in the treatment of noncardiac conditions as well, such as ulcers and strokes.", "The findings of these studies do not mean that cardiologists always provide superior care. First, each study reports an overall tendency, with considerable variation in performance among both cardiologists and noncardiologists. Moreover, some noncardiologists do better than others. For example, in several studies, the performance of internists comes closer to that of cardiologists (cardiology is actually a subspecialty within internal medicine) than family practitioners. Nonetheless, within cardiac care, studies reveal a fairly consistent pattern\u2014as physician specialization increases, so does the overall level of adherence to established standards of care.", "These studies, however, generally do not address the extent to which HMOs affect the pattern of care provided by cardiologists compared with that provided by noncardiologists. The handful of studies looking at physician specialty differences within an HMO setting have focused on other medical conditions. Specifically, we found two recent studies by researchers employed by HMOs that compared the treatment of asthma sufferers cared for by primary care physicians and allergy and asthma specialists.Statistically adjusting for disease severity and patient characteristics, both studies found that patients of specialists received more thorough and appropriate care. Specialists\u2019 patients more often reported taking medications recommended by national treatment guidelines, had improved day-to-day functioning, and had fewer asthma exacerbations requiring emergency room treatment. These findings suggest that treatment differences across specialties can persist within an HMO structure. However, in cardiac care, comparable differences in care provided by primary care providers and cardiologists might not be found if, for example, HMOs placed a higher priority on standardizing care for cardiac patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Appropriateness of Care for Heart Attack Survivors", "paragraphs": ["Our study compares the use of three specific pharmacological treatments among Medicare heart attack survivors who saw cardiologists regularly and those who did not. Although use of these drugs represents only a portion of the post-heart-attack care available, we chose to focus our analysis on this subset of treatments because (1) there is strong scientific evidence that these treatments are beneficial for a large proportion of heart attack survivors and (2) other data indicate that many patients who would benefit from these drugs are not using them.", "These two conditions do not apply to nearly the same extent to other aspects of care provided to heart attack survivors. For example, while there is considerable variation in the extent to which invasive procedures\u2014such as cardiac catheterizations, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery\u2014are performed on heart attack survivors, the evidence for these procedures is not as definitive as the evidence supporting the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and aspirin. As a result, existing clinical guidelines for their use rest primarily on expert judgment. For many cases, that judgment is either equivocal or divided. Thus, it is more difficult to determine whether any given group of patients is getting either too many or too few of these procedures.", "The value of cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and aspirin for heart attack survivors has been widely publicized through practice guidelines as well as numerous articles in prominent medical journals. It is therefore reasonable to expect physicians to know about these therapies and to provide them to most of their patients, while recognizing that the general benefits of these drugs may not apply to certain individual patients.", "Since we limited the scope of our study to these drugs, we cannot assume that our findings are indicative of relative performance in other aspects of care, such as the appropriate use of invasive procedures. However, restricting the scope of this study to a set of well-defined and well-supported therapies means that we can identify with greater certainty a substantial number of patients who stood to benefit from the treatments in question."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pharmacological Treatments Known to Be Beneficial", "paragraphs": ["Multiple, large-scale randomized clinical trials support the widespread use of three pharmacological treatments in caring for heart attack survivors.", "Cholesterol-lowering medications: A series of large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated the substantial therapeutic benefit of using \u201cstatin\u201d drugs (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) and other medications (in addition to proper diet and exercise) to lower the cholesterol level of people with coronary heart disease\u2014including those who have had a heart attack. These studies show a reduction in subsequent coronary-related deaths for heart attack survivors ranging from 20 percent (for those with normal cholesterol levels) to 42 percent (for those with high cholesterol). These studies have also shown a reduction in strokes of about 30 percent for both normal- and high-cholesterol patients. These trials have been published in prominent journals and extensively described in the national media. In 1993, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) issued practice guidelines that spelled out the implications of these trials for follow-up care of heart attack survivors.", "Whether a patient should get such therapy depends on his or her baseline level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The guidelines set an LDL goal for coronary heart disease patients of 100 mg/dL, well below the average level for the population as a whole. Those with baseline LDL levels of 130 mg/dL and above are definite candidates for cholesterol-lowering medications, although specific factors in individual cases can provide countervailing reasons not to initiate drug therapy. For those with baseline readings between 129 and 101, the guidelines recommend that physicians carefully weigh the expected benefits and risks of cholesterol-lowering therapy for each patient.", "Beta-Blockers: A second drug therapy whose benefits for heart attack survivors are well established in the clinical literature involves long-term use of beta-blockers. This class of drugs inhibits stimulation of the heart and reduces the force of heart muscle contractions, thereby decreasing both the workload placed on the heart and arrhythmias that can lead to sudden death. Beginning in the early 1980s, a series of large-scale clinical trials demonstrated that beta-blockers reduced overall mortality among heart attack survivors by about 25 percent. Subsequent studies provided additional confirmation of these effects. Another study found that among the elderly patients surveyed, those receiving beta-blockers were 43-percent less likely than nonrecipients to die in the 2 years following their heart attacks.", "In August 1990, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) jointly issued guidelines on the management of heart attacks that cited these studies in support of a general recommendation to treat heart attack survivors with beta-blockers for at least 2 years, with the exception of patients who had specific contraindications. Six years later, ACC and AHA issued revised guidelines that repeated this recommendation, while reducing somewhat the scope of the stipulated contraindications.", "In the years since the first beta-blocker trials were published, the proportion of heart attack patients considered eligible to use them has expanded. In particular, the therapeutic value of beta-blockers for many patients with moderately severe heart failure has become more evident over time. Thus, current ACC and AHA practice guidelines list only relative contraindications, meaning that in each case, the specific risks posed by beta-blockers for these patients should be weighed against the general benefits.", "Aspirin: The 1990 practice guidelines for treating heart attacks issued by ACC recommended long-term aspirin therapy for all post-heart-attack patients \u201cwho could tolerate it.\u201d In its 1996 revised guidelines, ACC specified that daily aspirin therapy should be continued indefinitely, with substitution of other antiplatelet agents only in the case of a \u201ctrue aspirin allergy.\u201d", "As with cholesterol-lowering medications and beta-blockers, multiple randomized clinical trials provided the basis for these recommendations.

Moreover, research has demonstrated that self-reported drug use is strongly related to more proximate measures of medication compliance, such as pharmacy records of prescriptions filled and counts of pills taken.", "While it is ultimately the patient who decides how faithfully to adhere to a treatment regimen, research has shown that physicians strongly influence patient behavior by, among other actions, prescribing certain medications, closely monitoring patient compliance, and by simplifying and adjusting regimens to encourage compliance."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Proportion of Medicare HMO Enrollees Who Take Drug Therapies Is Similar to General Population but Below Desired Levels", "paragraphs": ["Despite the strength of the clinical evidence, many patients who would benefit from drug therapies to treat coronary heart disease do not take the drugs.

NHLBI estimates that only about one-third of patients in the general population with coronary heart disease are receiving medications to lower their cholesterol. Further, based on cholesterol levels in the general population of elderly Americans, we estimate that 57 percent of our sample has LDL cholesterol levels of 130 or higher, and are therefore clear candidates for cholesterol-lowering drugs given current treatment guidelines for patients with established coronary heart disease.

As one comparison, 32 percent of Medicare fee-for-service heart attack survivors in the CCP study received prescriptions for beta blockers when they were discharged from the hospital. For the subset of our respondents identified in the CCP study as ideal candidates for beta-blockers, the usage rate was somewhat higher at 49 percent.

However, taking medications is an outcome that involves patient as well as physician behaviors, and differences in patient use of drug therapies could be due more to differences in patient characteristics than to differences in the treatment patterns of physicians. For example, patients who are most steadfast in their pharmaceutical regimens may also be the most likely to seek specialty care.", "We tested this alternative explanation by conducting multivariate statistical analyses to identify the variables associated with taking each type of drug and with having regular cardiology appointments. These analyses included variables known from the work of other researchers to influence the use of physician services or medication compliance, including self-reported current health status; background variables (such as education, current income, age, and race); and clinical variables measured at the time of hospitalization (such as heart attack severity and major comorbidities). Because these analyses found that the variables associated with having regular cardiology appointments and with taking heart drugs are different, it is unlikely that our finding\u2014that patients with regular cardiology appointments take these drugs more often\u2014is due to systematic differences between the patients who see cardiologists regularly and those who do not.

Studies have documented this phenomenon in both fee-for-service and HMO settings. However, it is both a special problem and a unique opportunity for HMOs and their members. It is a special problem because HMOs can restrict access to specialists, perhaps leading some enrollees to feel that they have been denied necessary care. It is a unique opportunity because these differences are not immutable and because HMOs, unlike fee-for-service insurers, can actively manage care. Thus, HMOs can educate the physicians they employ about treatment guidelines, review clinical records to ensure that patients are taking appropriate medications, or take other organizational actions to improve the quality of care provided by all types of physicians that are not possible in fee-for-service settings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HCFA and a panel of experts for their review. Based on their comments, we expanded the number of drugs we examined and explicitly addressed the possible confounding effects of patient characteristics. We also incorporated technical changes where appropriate. Several other issues that the reviewers raised are addressed here.", "First, some reviewers were concerned that our survey sample had the potential to introduce selection biases. In general, enrollees in Medicare HMOs who develop chronic conditions are more likely to revert to standard fee-for-service Medicare. Our sample, however, was limited to heart attack survivors enrolled in Medicare HMOs who remained enrolled for the roughly 2-year period from their heart attack until we interviewed them. If many patients were excluded from our sample because they had left HMOs between their heart attack and our survey, then our respondents could represent HMO enrollees who were disproportionately healthy and satisfied with medical care provided by HMOs. However, we found that the potential effect of any such selection bias was minimal because few patients in our initial sample\u2014less than 4 percent\u2014were dropped from the study because they had returned to fee-for-service Medicare between their heart attack hospitalizations and the survey period. Thus, because so few members of our sample left HMOs, we believe that it accurately reflects the population of Medicare patients who survived heart attacks that occurred while they were enrolled in HMOs.", "Second, some reviewers pointed out that our finding that heart attack survivors with regular cardiology appointments have more appropriate drug treatment may be the result of having regular physician appointments, not that the appointments are with a cardiologist. This explanation hypothesizes that the respondents in our comparison group have fewer physician contacts overall. Because we were interested specifically in heart-related medical care, our survey questions did not attempt to measure the overall level of physician contacts. Consequently, we are unable to rule out this explanation with direct evidence. However, two other aspects of our work\u2014a separate sensitivity analysis and the multivariate analyses\u2014provide indirect evidence that this alternative explanation is unlikely.", "We conducted a sensitivity analysis to judge the plausibility of this alternative explanation. For this analysis, we estimated how much lower the rate of regular physician contacts would have to be among those who did not see a cardiologist at all in order to explain their lower use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and beta-blockers. We found that a lower rate of regular physician visits could explain the lower use of cholesterol-lowering drugs among patients who had not seen a cardiologist only if no more than 1 in 10 of them had regularly seen their primary care doctor or another noncardiologist physician for the treatment of any medical condition. Similarly, to explain their lower use of beta-blockers, the proportion seeing a noncardiologist regularly would have to be no more than one-third. By contrast, among those who saw a cardiologist, two-thirds reported having regular appointments. Since these groups did not differ in self-reported health status and incidence of major comorbidities, we believe that it is implausible that such a high proportion of heart attack survivors who did not see a cardiologist would also lack regular contact with even their primary care provider.", "Our multivariate analyses included variables other than health that are known to be associated with the use of physician services, especially education, income, age, and gender. If frequency of physician contacts explained our findings, then including these variables in the multivariate analyses should have greatly diminished the statistical association between regular specialty care and drug usage. This did not occur. (See app. II for a description of our sensitivity and multivariate analyses).", "In addition, some reviewers noted that more care is not always better care. That is, while our results are consistent with the finding from the research literature that specialists provide more intensive care than generalists, there is the possibility that specialists may provide heart-related medications to patients whom the drug will not help more often than generalists, which would account for at least part of this difference. We agree that it is likely that some individual patients in our survey were not helped by these medications; however, we do not believe that our results can be attributed to a systematic tendency for patients with regular cardiology care to take these drugs inappropriately. The drugs we selected as indicators of appropriate care have been demonstrated to have great clinical benefits and few absolute contraindications. Moreover, for beta-blockers and aspirin, our statistical analyses documenting the importance of regular cardiology care controlled for the degree to which patients were ideal candidates for the therapy. Further, our results show that even patients under the regular care of cardiologists took these drugs at rates below the recommended guidelines\u2014a finding that is more consistent with the position that cardiologists provide too little appropriate care than it is with the view that they provide too many inappropriate treatments.", "Finally, some reviewers also suggested that our results may be due to differences in the out-of-pocket expenditures for these drugs between respondents with regular cardiology care and those without regular cardiology appointments. If patients with regular cardiology care systematically paid less for these drugs for any reason, their increased usage rates may be due to lower costs instead of to the care provided by cardiologists. While we do not know how much these drugs would have cost each respondent, we were able to identify heart attack survivors who belonged to HMO plans with pharmacy benefits and, thus, who presumably have lower drug costs. We found that the presence of a pharmacy benefit was not related to the self-reported use of any of these three drugs or to having regular cardiology care. Moreover, in a comparable study of heart attack survivors treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014where none of the patients had to pay more than minimal amounts for their drugs\u2014patients under regular cardiology care received cholesterol-lowering drugs much more often than those cared for by primary care physicians.", "As we arranged with your staff, unless you publicly announce the report\u2019s contents earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after it is issued.

They were identified as part of a larger study, the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP), conducted by HCFA. For this study, HCFA abstracted clinical data from hospital records for approximately 224,000 Medicare heart attack survivors. CCP sampled acute myocardial infarction admissions that occurred between February 1994 and July 1995. Each hospital was sampled for only a subset of the months during that period, and patients were included in the CCP data set only if they were hospitalized during the time their hospital was sampled.", "HMO patients are underrepresented in HCFA\u2019s claims data, from which the CCP sampling frame was constructed. In return for the fixed, per month amount that HMOs receive for each Medicare enrollee, they assume full responsibility for patient hospital bills. Hospitals are still supposed to submit \u201cno pay\u201d bills to HCFA for Medicare HMO patients, but this requirement is frequently not followed. As a result, there is often no record in HCFA\u2019s claims files for hospitalizations of HMO enrollees.

For example, only 6 percent of the Spanish-language interviews reported taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, compared to 33 percent for the sample as a whole and to 32 percent for the 22 Hispanic respondents who completed the interview in English. The Spanish-language interviews also reported lower usage rates for beta-blockers and aspirin than the other Hispanic respondents. We believe that our failure to provide a drug list in Spanish may have contributed to this low level of self-reported drug use. We also found that while 70 percent of those with Spanish-language interviews reported having regular cardiology appointments, only 43 percent of the sample as a whole and 19 percent of Hispanics who completed the interview in English reported having such appointments. We suspect that our physician coding scheme led us to substantially overestimate the proportion of these respondents with regular cardiology care. Almost all of the Spanish-language cases reside in southern Florida, an area with many physicians with similar last names practicing in close proximity. In such circumstances, our physician specialty coding rules were likely to have coded many generalist physicians as cardiologists.", "As table I.1 shows, our decision to exclude some cases from the analysis slightly increased our estimates of the proportion of respondents taking cholesterol-lowering drugs and beta-blockers and slightly decreased the percentage of respondents with regular appointments with a cardiologist (from 43 percent for all respondents to 40 percent for the analysis subset). Both of these differences result from excluding the low drug use but high cardiology appointment set of respondents who completed the interview in Spanish.

We estimate that approximately 57 percent of our sample had LDL levels of 130 mg/dL or greater.

Although we are unable to directly test this alternative explanation because we did not ask our respondents about the regularity of their contacts with physicians other than cardiologists, we addressed this concern by conducting a rough sensitivity analysis of the effects of having regular physician appointments on the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and beta-blockers.", "The sensitivity analysis starts with the assumption that the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and beta-blockers is equally appropriate for each of our three patient groups: those who saw cardiologists regularly, those who saw cardiologists occasionally, and those who saw only noncardiologist physicians. While there are specific reasons why a relatively small proportion of our respondents might not benefit from one or the other therapy (for example, an unusually low baseline LDL cholesterol level without drugs, or a specific clinical contraindication for beta-blockers, such as asthma), we do not expect these characteristics would affect the regularity of physician contacts for these patients. For instance, we know that the respondents seeing cardiologists regularly did not differ from other respondents in self-reported health status or incidence of comorbidities. Further, while those seeing cardiologists regularly did tend to have more severe heart attacks, lower heart attack severity does not make beta-blockers and cholesterol-lowering drugs any less beneficial for heart attack survivors. A heart attack of any severity puts a patient in the high-risk group for future heart attacks, according to NHLBI guidelines.", "Because of the structure of our survey, we know whether respondents who saw a cardiologist had regular or occasional appointments, but we do not have this information for respondents who saw only noncardiologists. That is why we cannot directly assess the effect of regular visits compared to that of physician specialty with respect to taking cholesterol-lowering medications and beta-blockers. However, by regrouping data from the main analysis to consider just those patients who saw a cardiologist at least occasionally (two-thirds regularly and one-third only occasionally), we can derive an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of having regular physician appointments for that subset of our respondents. Thus, we observed that 45 percent of those with regular appointments with cardiologists used cholesterol-lowering drugs, compared to 29 percent of those who saw cardiologists only occasionally. For beta-blockers, the comparable usage figures are 50 percent and 29 percent. (See table II.1.)", "Patients with regular cardiology appointments Patients with occasional cardiology appointments Patients with no cardiology appointments Patients who did not see a cardiologist or saw one only occasionally (B+C)", "Our main analysis compared group A with group D (see table 1); this analysis compares group A with group B to make inferences about group C. If, as suggested by the alternative explanation, the principal determinant of drug use is the regularity of physician appointments regardless of the physician\u2019s specialization, then one would expect the same proportion of patients who did not see a cardiologist to receive these drugs depending on whether they saw any other physician regularly or not. Thus, hypothetically, 45 percent of those respondents who saw their primary care doctor or other physician regularly should be taking cholesterol-lowering drugs and 50 percent of them should be taking beta-blockers. Similarly, among those with only occasional appointments with any physician, 29 percent should be taking cholesterol-lowering medications and (coincidentally) 29 percent of them should be taking beta-blockers.", "At the same time, we know from the survey responses what proportion of the group not seeing cardiologists actually used these drugs overall: 31 percent for cholesterol-lowering medications and 36 percent for beta-blockers. Working from these figures, we can derive what proportion of the group would have had to have seen any noncardiologist physician on a regular basis in order for these two assumptions to hold. If that estimated proportion is implausibly low, it would make it unlikely that the observed differences in drug use we found reflect simply the effect of regular visits and not physician specialty.", "Thus, for cholesterol-lowering drugs, respondents who did not see a cardiologist had a usage rate of 31 percent. Given the presumed usage rates\u201429 percent for respondents with occasional visits and 45 percent for those with regular physician appointments\u2014one can reach the observed aggregate level for respondents not seeing cardiologists only if the large majority\u201490 percent\u2014of this group saw physicians only occasionally: (29 percent x .90) + (45 percent x .10) = 31 percent overall. To the extent that more than 10 percent of this group saw their primary care physician regularly (and therefore had a 45-percent usage rate for these drugs), the overall rate of use would have to rise above the 31-percent level that we observed.", "The result of this calculation for beta-blockers is similar, though less dramatic. Thus, if respondents with regular noncardiology appointments are presumed to use beta-blockers at a rate of 50 percent, and those with occasional physician visits at a rate of 29 percent, then to reach the observed overall rate of 36 percent, 32 percent of this group would have to have regular physician visits and 68 percent occasional appointments: (29 percent x .68) + (50 percent x .32) = 36 percent overall. This would mean that two out of three of these respondents\u2014none of whom were seeing a cardiologist even occasionally and all of whom had been hospitalized for a heart attack within the last 2 years\u2014were not seeing even a primary care physician on a regular basis.", "For both types of drugs, the estimated rates of regular physician appointments from our sensitivity analysis (one-tenth and one-third, respectively) are considerably below the actual regular visit rate for patients who saw a cardiologist (two-thirds). Since the overall health of our respondents with regular cardiology care does not differ from that of the other members of our sample, we do not believe that differences of this magnitude are plausible. For that reason, it seems quite unlikely that our findings about the influence of regular cardiology care on the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and beta-blockers can be explained by differences in regular physician contacts among the heart attack survivors in our sample.", "As a further check on the robustness of these conclusions, we tested the potential impact of sampling error in our relatively small sample. All of the figures we used in the above calculations reflect the responses provided by the particular sample HCFA drew from the population of Medicare heart attack survivors in HMOs. The extent to which any other comparable sample might provide different results is captured by the standard error for the rates of drug use for each of the three respondent subgroups (those with regular cardiologist visits, occasional cardiologist visits, and no cardiologist visits). Testing for the effect of changes in each of these parameters, we found that variation in the rate of drug use by the group that had no contact with cardiologists had the largest impact on the derived estimate of regular physician visits for that group. If the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was actually one standard error higher for the group that had not seen a cardiologist (that is, 35 percent instead of 31 percent), then this would imply that 37 percent\u2014not 10 percent\u2014of these patients had regular contact with a physician of some sort. Similarly, the estimated rate of regular visits increased from 32 percent to 54 percent if overall use of beta-blockers by this group was raised by one standard error. There is one chance in six that the \u201ctrue\u201d mean is greater than the sum of the observed sample mean and the standard error. In other words, even with sampling error, there is a five in six chance that the estimated rate of regular physician visits for patients who did not see a cardiologist would be, at most, 37 percent in the analysis of cholesterol-lowering drugs and 54 percent for beta-blockers. Thus, the rate of inferred regular visits for patients who did not see a cardiologist is still clearly lower than that observed in our sample for patients who did see one at least occasionally (67 percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Analyses for Cholesterol- Lowering Drugs, Beta-Blockers, Aspirin, and Regular Cardiology Appointments", "paragraphs": ["For our major analyses, we compared the usage rates of cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and aspirin for respondents who had regularly scheduled cardiology visits with the rates for those who do not see a cardiologist regularly.
