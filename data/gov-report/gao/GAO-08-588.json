GAO identified 15 key attributes associated with these capabilities. While US-CERT's cyber analysis and warning capabilities include aspects of each of the key attributes, they do not fully incorporate all of them. For example, as part of its monitoring, US-CERT obtains information from numerous external information sources; however, it has not established a baseline of our nation's critical network assets and operations. In addition, while it investigates if identified anomalies constitute actual cyber threats or attacks as part of its analysis, it does not integrate its work into predictive analyses. Further, it provides warnings by developing and distributing a wide array of notifications; however, these notifications are not consistently actionable or timely. US-CERT faces a number of newly identified and ongoing challenges that impede it from fully incorporating the key attributes and thus being able to coordinate the national efforts to prepare for, prevent, and respond to cyber threats. The newly identified challenge is creating warnings that are consistently actionable and timely. Ongoing challenges that GAO previously identified, and made recommendations to address, include employing predictive analysis and operating without organizational stability and leadership within DHS, including possible overlapping roles and responsibilities. Until US-CERT addresses these challenges and fully incorporates all key attributes, it will not have the full complement of cyber analysis and warning capabilities essential to effectively performing its national mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The rapid increase in computer connectivity has revolutionized the way  The rapid increase in computer connectivity has revolutionized the way  that our government, our nation, and much of the world communicate and  that our government, our nation, and much of the world communicate and  conduct business.

These  attributes are displayed in table 4, which is followed by a detailed  description by capability of each attribute."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["Monitoring provides the data used to understand one\u2019s operating  environment and detect changes that indicate the presence of anomalies  that may be cyber attacks. It encompasses five key attributes:  1.  Establishing a baseline understanding of network assets and  normal network traffic volume and flow  In order to detect unusual activity in network traffic or changes in an  operating environment, organizations require knowledge of ordinary  traffic and environmental conditions. This knowledge forms the baseline  against which changes or anomalies can be detected, identified, and  mitigated. A baseline is established through activities such as creating an  accurate inventory of systems, prioritizing resources and assets,  maintaining an understanding of the expected volume and nature of  network traffic, and instituting operational procedures such as procedures  for handling incidents. Without a baseline, it may be difficult to effectively  detect threats or respond to a warning with the appropriate resources.  2.  Assessing risks to network assets  Assessments should be conducted to determine what risks are posed by  combinations of threats and vulnerabilities and inform the monitoring  capability so that it is focused on the most critical assets. According to  CERT\u00ae Coordination Center (CERT/CC) officials, having a baseline  knowledge of networks and systems and their associated risks in advance  helps individual organizations understand what threats they may be  susceptible to, what resources are at risk, and what the potential damage  of an attack might be. Risks should be prioritized and mitigated until a  reasonable acceptable level of risk is reached.  3.  Obtain internal information on network operations via  technical tools and user reports  Another key attribute is monitoring traffic on internal networks using (1)  network and information security-related technology tools and (2) reports  on network activity. As table 5 shows, various technologies can be used  for internal network monitoring to help compile and identify patterns in  network data. Each type of technology may detect anomalies that the  other types of software cannot.", "These technologies can be used to examine data logs from networks on a  24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week schedule in an effort to identify   (1) precursors and indicators of cyber threats or other anomalies and   (2) the occurrence of known attacks. The data logged from these  technologies are typically prepared using automated tools to help analysts  observe or detect a single anomaly or to discover patterns in data over  time. According to several federal and nonfederal entities, hands-on  monitoring by trained analysts is essential because it can be difficult for  automated tools to identify anomalies and incidents. For example, some  automated signature-based tools focus on known threats and may not  automatically recognize or alert analysts to new attack patterns or new  threat delivery techniques. Other intrusion detection systems can produce  large numbers of alerts indicating a problem when one does not exist  (false positives); therefore, an analyst must look into anomalies more  closely to see if detected intrusions are indications of a threat or simply an  equipment malfunction.  4.  Obtaining external information on threats, vulnerabilities, and  incidents through various relationships, alerts, and other  sources  External monitoring includes observing and receiving information that is  either publicly or not publicly available for the purpose of maintaining  environmental or situational awareness, detecting anomalies, and  providing data for analysis, warning, and response. External sources of  information include  formal relationships, such as with and between critical infrastructure  sector-related information sharing and analysis centers (ISAC); federal  agencies, including military, civilian, law enforcement, and intelligence  agencies; international computer emergency response team organizations;  the CERT/CC and vendors under contract for services;  informal relationships established on a personal basis between analysts  located at different operations centers;   alerts issued by federal, state, and local governments;    alerts issued by commercial external sources such as network security and    vulnerability databases, standards, and frameworks such as the National  Vulnerability Database, the Common Vulnerability and Exposures List,  Common Vulnerability Scoring System, and the Open Vulnerability  Assessment Language;   media outlets, such as television news and newspapers; and    Web sites, such as law enforcement entities\u2019 sites, known hacker and  criminal sites and chat rooms, and cooperative cyber analysis and warning  services. 5.  Detecting anomalous activities  Continuous monitoring occurs in order to detect significant changes from  the baseline operations or the occurrence of an attack through an already  known threat or vulnerability. It is ultimately the detection of an  anomaly\u2014observed internally or received from external information\u2014and  the recognition of its relevance that triggers analysis of the incident to  begin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Analysis uses technical methods in combination with contextual expertise  to hypothesize about the threat and associated risks concerning an  anomaly and, if necessary, determine mitigation solutions. It encompasses  four key attributes:  1.  Verifying that an anomaly is an incident  Once an anomaly is detected, it should be verified whether it is a genuine  cyber incident by determining that the data are from a trusted source and  are accurate. For example, if the anomaly was identified by an internal  sensor, analysts start by confirming that the sensor was working correctly  and not indicating a false positive. If the anomaly was reported by an  external source, analysts try to determine the trustworthiness of that  source and begin to identify internal and external corroborating sources.  Anomalies that are verified may require in-depth investigation and incident  handling or more observation through monitoring.  2.  Investigating the incident to identify the type of cyber attack,  estimate impacts, and collect evidence  Once the anomaly is verified as a potential, impending, or occurring  incident, analysts should combine information from multiple sources  and/or perform investigative testing using available tools. Analysis often  occurs through collaboration between analysts, the exchange of  notifications and warnings, and the use of analytical research techniques.  Analysts use these techniques to investigate the type of attack, its source  (where it originates), its target (whom it affects), and the immediate risk  to network assets and mission performance. In addition, these techniques  are used to compile evidence for law enforcement. Techniques for  investigation include    comparing and correlating additional monitoring data available with the  anomaly to determine what other internal and external entities are  experiencing;   comparing data about the anomaly with standardized databases to  determine if the threats are known; and   performing investigations, such as cyber forensic examinations, reverse  engineering, malware analysis, and isolating anomalies in a test  environment such as a honeypot or a sandbox.  3.  Identifying possible actions to mitigate the impact of the  Analysis should culminate in identifying essential details about an anomaly  such as what specific vulnerabilities are exploited or what impacts are  expected for a specific incident. Steps should then be taken to identify  alternative courses of action to mitigate the risks of the incident according  to the severity of the exploit, available resources, and mission priorities.  Such steps may include isolating the affected system to prevent further  compromise, disabling the affected service that is being exploited, or  blocking the connections providing the attacker a route into the network  environment. These courses of action may lead to more analysis or be  used to support the warning capability.  4.  Integrating results into predictive analysis of broader  implications or potential future attacks  Information resulting from analysis of an individual incident should be  used to determine any broader implications and predict and protect  against future threats. This type of effort, or predictive analysis, should  look beyond one specific incident to consider a broader set of incidents or  implications that may indicate a potential threat of importance. For  example, it may include detailed trend analysis of threats that have  occurred over a certain period of time that is issued in public reports that  discuss current trends, predict future incident activity, or emerging attack  methods. However, according to many experts, this type of predictive  analysis is complex and it is still difficult to predict future threats with  current data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Warning", "paragraphs": ["Warnings are intended to alert entities to the presence of anomalies, help  delineate the relevancy and immediacy of cyber attacks, provide  information on how to remediate vulnerabilities and mitigate incidents, or  make overall statements about the health and welfare of the Internet.  Warning includes three key attributes:  1.  Developing notifications that are targeted and actionable  Warning messages should be targeted to the appropriate audience and  provide details that are accurate, specific, and relevant enough to be acted  upon. Developing actionable notifications requires providing the right  incident information to the right person or group. If a single group is the  only target of a threat, a warning directly to it may be more appropriate  than a general public announcement. In addition, warnings are tailored to  address technical or nontechnical recipients. Some warnings may be more  appropriate for chief information officers, while other may include  technical details for network administrators. Although notifications and  warnings are delivered throughout incident handling, it is important to  reach a balance between releasing actionable information and disclosing  warnings too often, which can overwhelm the recipients and stretch  limited resources. By addressing the specific audience, warnings avoid  overwhelming recipients with extraneous or irrelevant information.", "Also, recipients of notifications and warnings need to be able to use them  to protect or defend their networks against cyber attacks. For example,  many organizations have designated thresholds that determine how and  when warnings are issued. To do so, the messages must include specific  and accurate information about the incident as it relates to the recipient\u2019s  monitoring, analysis, or response capabilities. An actionable warning may  also include recommendations about how to respond to an incident.  Federal and nonfederal entities also noted that sensitivity of information  and privacy are key considerations when trying to develop an actionable  warning. Warnings are sanitized or stripped of identifying or proprietary  information in order to protect the privacy of individuals or entities  involved in the incident. In addition, the federal government and its private  sector partners must also adhere to procedures to make sure that they  share useful information at the appropriate clearance level.  2.  Providing notifications in a timely manner  Warnings are intended to give information to recipients as early as  possible\u2014preferably in advance of a cyber attack\u2014to give them time to  take appropriate action. In addition, the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) provides guidance to federal agencies that  describes when incidents are considered reportable and how long they  may take to report them to US-CERT. Similarly, several ISACs stated that  they have procedures that determine when and how warnings are issued  and when and how members should report incidents.  3. Distributing notifications using the most appropriate  communications methods  Once a warning is developed, it is important to determine the best method  for getting that message out without overwhelming the public or incident  handlers. Warnings can be provided both informally and formally. Informal  warnings between colleagues with established trusted relationships can  happen quickly and without significant regard to the organizational  structure. Formal warnings, which are typically held to a higher standard  of accuracy by recipients than informal warnings, come in many forms,  such as e-mail bulletins, vulnerability alerts, Web postings, targeted  warnings to a specific entity, or broad security notices to the general  public. In addition to specific formal warnings, operations centers that  perform analysis and warning for multiple organizations, such as the  ISACs and commercial vendors, use level-based or color-coded alert  systems on their Web sites to quickly notify members and the public of the  general threat status of the infrastructure or Internet. Changing from one  level or color to another indicates that the threat level is increasing or  decreasing. These same organizations send alerts about threats and  vulnerabilities to members only or may issue specific warnings to a single  organization that has been identified through analysis as being targeted by  a cyber threat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response", "paragraphs": ["Response includes actions to contain an incident, manage the protection  of network operations, and recover from damages when vulnerabilities are  revealed or when cyber incidents occur. It encompasses three key  attributes:  1.  Containing and mitigating the incident  When an incident is identified, immediate steps should be taken to protect  network assets. Decisions are made to control further impacts on the  network and then eliminate the threat. These actions may include  installing a software patch, blocking a port known to be used by a  particular threat, or deploying other appropriate network resources. In the  case of a serious threat, the decision may be to turn off the network  gateway and temporarily isolate the network from the Internet, depending  upon what assets are at risk. One industry expert noted that investigation  may occur before any mitigation steps are taken in order to consider the  necessity of law enforcement involvement. On the other hand, if little is  known about a threat and it does not appear to endanger critical assets, a  decision might be made to watch the threat emerge in a contained area to  allow for further monitoring and analysis. Decisions to act or not are  based on acceptable risks, available resources, and ability to remedy the  known threat. In addition, decisions must be made in the context of the  impact that actions will have on other related efforts, such as a law  enforcement investigation.  2.  Recovering from damage and remediating vulnerabilities  Once an incident is contained and mitigated, restoring damaged areas of  the network to return it to its baseline becomes a priority. To understand  the damage, a cyber damage or loss assessment may be conducted to  identify, among other things, how the incident was discovered, what  network(s) were affected, when the incident occurred, who attacked the  network and by what methods, what was the intention of the attacker,  what occurred during the attack, and what is the impact or severity of the  incident. The recovery efforts may involve restoring or reinstalling  computers, network devices, applications, or systems that have been  compromised.", "Taking action to remediate vulnerabilities in a network may also result  from analysis and incident management. Entities work to discover and  reduce the number of vulnerabilities in their computers, network devices,  applications, or systems.  3.  Evaluating actions and incorporating lessons learned  Entities should ensure that threat data, results, and lessons learned are  evaluated and appropriately incorporated to improve the overall cyber  analysis and warning capability. For example, teams can be used to  simulate network threats by purposefully attacking a network in order to  see how the network responds. From these simulations, an evaluation can  be made about the response, and recommendations on how to improve  can be developed. In addition, cyber simulations allow critical  infrastructure organizations to prepare for threat scenarios and to test  analysis, warning, and response capabilities. NIST guidance also states  that holding lessons learned meetings after major incidents is helpful in  improving security measures and the incident handling process itself."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "US-CERT\u2019s Capabilities Include Some but Not All Aspects of Key Attributes", "paragraphs": ["US-CERT has established cyber analysis and warning capabilities that  include aspects of each of the key attributes.

In addition, owners of classified or  law enforcement information must review and agree to the release of  related information. Therefore, the organization\u2019s products are subjected  to a stringent review and revision process that could adversely affect the  timeliness of its products\u2014potentially adding days to the release if  classified or law enforcement information must be removed from the  product. For example, an official from a cybersecurity-focused  organization at a university stated that the alerts from US-CERT generally  arrive a day or two after they might have been helpful. An official from  another private entity stated that the bureaucratic process US-CERT must  follow prevents it from providing useful alerts in a timely manner and that  as a result, it does not have the credibility to drive a reaction when an alert  is finally issued. Another private sector official stated that, in some cases,  the organization gets information on cyber incidents and attacks faster  from media sources than US-CERT because its analysts need time to verify  the reliability of the data they receive.", "In addition, according to federal officials responsible for determining  cyber-related threats, US-CERT, as well as other organizations with  cybersecurity-related responsibilities, must also balance the need to  develop and release warnings with the activities of other organizations,  such as law enforcement and intelligence support, to identify and mitigate  cyber threats. For example, the release of a warning to address a threat or  attack may also alert the intruders that their methods have been  discovered and cause them to change their methods prior to the  completion of an investigation about their activities.", "Further, when there is sensitive information to share, US-CERT officials  stated that on numerous occasions, they were unable to share the details  of threats to customers\u2019 networks because no one within the federal  agency or nonfederal entity possessed a security clearance high enough to  receive the information. In some organizations, the individuals who do  possess security clearances are in the upper echelons of the organization  and do not possess a cyber or information security background. As a  result, they are not always able to accurately comprehend and relay the  threat information to those who would actually handle the mitigation  efforts. In September 2007, we reported that DHS lacked a rapid, efficient  process for disseminating sensitive information to private industry owners  and operators of critical infrastructures. We recommended that DHS  establish a rapid and secure process for sharing sensitive vulnerability  information with critical infrastructure stakeholders, including vendors,  owners, and operators; however, DHS has not yet fulfilled this  recommendation.", "To provide actionable information to its customers, the organization  attempts to combine incident information with related cyber threat  information to determine the seriousness of the attack. However,  according to the Acting Director of US-CERT, its efforts are limited by  other federal entities\u2019 abilities to determine specific cyber threats to the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. One reason for the lack of cyber threat data  is that the task is complex and difficult and there are no established,  generally accepted methodologies for performing such analysis. In  addition, such entities are hampered by the limited number of analysts  dedicated to cyber threat identification. For example, in January 2008, the  Director of HITRAC stated that only 5 percent of HITRAC\u2019s total number  of analyst positions was focused on analyzing and identifying cyber threats  to our nation\u2019s critical information infrastructure.

Since 2001, we have identified  the challenges associated with establishing strategic, predictive analysis  and warning and have made recommendations that responsible executive  branch officials and agencies establish such capabilities, including  developing methodologies. According to the Acting Director of US-CERT,  it has not been able to establish such capabilities because there is not a  generally accepted methodology for performing predictive cyber analysis  and warning. In addition, officials from US-CERT and other federal and  nonfederal entities with cyber analysis and warning capabilities stated that  while they can determine the motivations for the various threat sources to  use cyber attacks, it is a formidable task to foresee prior to attacks how  those threats would actually conduct attacks and to establish indicators to  recognize that such cyber attacks are about to occur.

For example, nonfederal entities do not consistently  fully disclose incident and other data\u2014they filter sensitive details from the  data reported, thus reducing its value to US-CERT. The lack of such  relationships negatively affects the organization\u2019s cyber analysis and  warning capability.", "In 2005, we reported that entities within critical infrastructure sectors  possess an inherent disincentive to share cybersecurity information with  DHS. Much of their concern was that the potential release of sensitive  information could increase the threat they face. In addition, when  information was shared, it was not clear whether the information would  be shared with other entities, such as other federal entities, state and local  entities, law enforcement, or various regulators, or how it would be used  or protected from disclosure. Alternatively, sector representatives  expressed concerns that DHS was not effectively communicating  information with them and had not matched private sector efforts to share  valuable information with a corresponding level of trusted information  sharing. We also identified information sharing in support of homeland  security as a high-risk area in 2005, and we noted that establishing an  effective two-way exchange of information to help detect, prevent, and  mitigate potential terrorist attacks requires an extraordinary level of  cooperation and perseverance among federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector.", "Federal and nonfederal officials raised similar concerns about the ability  to develop trusted relationships and share information with and between  cyber analysis and warning entities, including US-CERT. For example,  frequent staff turnover at NCSD and US-CERT hindered the ability to build  trusted relationships with both public and private entities. Federal and  nonfederal officials stated that reliance was placed on personal  relationships to support sharing of sensitive information about  cybersecurity and cyber incidents. However, according to the NCSD  director, six senior staff members within the Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications (the national focal point for addressing cybersecurity  issues) were leaving for various reasons, affecting the ability to develop  such relationships. In addition, private sector officials stated that their  organizations continued to be hesitant to share information on  vulnerabilities and threats because of the fear that such sharing might  negatively affect their financial bottom line. For example, private sector  officials stated that it was difficult to share unfiltered information with  their respective infrastructure sector ISAC because a competitor operated  the ISAC, thus negatively affecting the information received by US-CERT.", "Having sufficient analytical and technical capabilities\u2014Obtaining  and retaining adequately trained cyber analysts and acquiring up-to-date  technological tools to implement the analysis capability attributes is an  ongoing challenge to US-CERT and other analysis and warning centers,  hindering their ability to respond to increasingly fast, nimble, and  sophisticated cyber attacks. As we have reported, NCSD has had difficulty  hiring personnel to fill vacant positions. We reported that once it found  qualified candidates, some candidates decided not to apply or withdrew  their applications because it took too long to be hired. This is still a  concern because current staff has limited organizational backup and, in  some cases, performs multiple roles. In addition, a private sector official  stated that it is not clear whether or not the government has the number of  technical analysts necessary to perform analysis on large and complex  data sets that are generated whether or not an incident is in progress or  not.", "Keeping cyber analysts trained and up to date on the latest cybersecurity  tools and techniques can be difficult. For example, a DOD official  representing one of its cyber analysis and warning centers stated that its  analysts must develop their expertise on the job because there is no formal  training program available that teaches them how to detect and perform  analysis of an anomaly or intrusion. A private sector official stated that  while analysts are often trained to use existing tools, their understanding  of the key attributes of analysis is often limited, resulting in a solution too  late to be helpful.", "Analysts also need the appropriate technological tools to handle the  volume, velocity, and variety of malicious data and activity they are faced  with, according to federal officials. For example, although the Einstein  flow data are collected in real time, the actual analysis is manually  intensive and does not occur simultaneously or in real time. Another  limiting factor of Einstein data is that US-CERT is unable to analyze the  content of the potentially malicious traffic and must rely on the affected  agency to perform any analysis of the content of the traffic. Thus both the  reaction time to determine the intent of the anomalous activity and the  necessary actions to address it are significantly slowed.

While DHS has taken steps to fill key positions,  organizational instability among cybersecurity officials continues to affect  NCSD and thus US-CERT. For example, at least six senior staff members  were leaving DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications,  including the NCSD Director. Losing senior staff members in such large  numbers has negatively affected the agency\u2019s long-term planning and  hampered the ability of NCSD/US-CERT to establish trusted relationships  with public and private entities and to build adequate functions to carry  out its mission, including expanded cyber analysis and warning  capabilities, according to the official.", "Furthermore, when new senior leadership has joined DHS,  NCSD/US-CERT\u2019s objectives were reassessed and redirected, thus  affecting NCSD\u2019s ability to have a consistent long-term strategy, according  to the former official. For example, senior officials wanted to broaden the  role and focus of US-CERT by having it provide centralized network  monitoring for the entire federal government on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a- week basis. However, the Director of NCSD disagreed with this strategy,  stating that each federal agency should have its own 24-hour-a-day, 7-day- a-week incident-handling capability (either in-house or contracted out) to  respond to incidents affecting its own network. He viewed US-CERT as a  fusion center that would provide analysis and warning for national-level  incidents, support federal agency incident-handling capabilities during  crisis situations, and offer a mechanism for federal agencies to coordinate  with law enforcement.", "The organization\u2019s future position in the government\u2019s efforts to establish  a national-level cyber analysis and warning capability is uncertain.

We also  toured the Joint Task Force\u2019s Global Network Operations Center; the  Navy\u2019s Cyber Defense Operation Command Center; and the Navy Marine  Corps Intranet Network\u2019s Operations Center, Computer Incident Response  Team Laboratory, Request Management Center, and Enterprise Global  Networks Operations Center.", "Department of Energy: the Associate Chief Information Officer for Cyber  Security for the Department of Energy and other relevant officials, and the  Chief Information Officer of the National Nuclear Security Administration  and other relevant officials.", "Department of Homeland Security: the Director of the National Cyber  Security Division, the Acting Director of the National Cyber Security  Division, and the Acting Director of US-CERT.", "National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Director of the  Information Technology Laboratory and officials from the Information  Technology Laboratory\u2019s Computer Security Division.", "Private sector: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s CERT\u00ae Coordination Center,  Internet Storm Center, LUMETA, Microsoft, MITRE, National Association  of State Chief Information Officers, SANS Institute, SRI International, and  Symantec.", "Information sharing and analysis centers representing the following  sectors: financial services, information technology, states, surface  transportation, and research and education.", "Federal agencies in the intelligence community.", "On the basis of the evidence gathered and our observations regarding each  entity\u2019s capabilities and operations, we determined the key common  attributes of cyber analysis and warning capabilities. To verify the  attributes we identified, we solicited comments from each entity regarding  the attributes identified and incorporated the comments as appropriate.", "To determine US-CERT\u2019s current national analysis and warning  capabilities and compare them with the attributes identified to determine  whether there were any gaps, we gathered and analyzed a variety of US- CERT policies, procedures, and program plans to identify the  organization\u2019s key activities related to cyber analysis and warning. We also  observed US-CERT operations. In addition, we held interviews with key  US-CERT officials, including the Director and Acting Director of the  National Cyber Security Division, the Acting Director and Deputy Director  of the US-CERT, and other relevant officials, to further clarify and confirm  the key initiatives we identified through our analysis of the  aforementioned documents. In addition, we interviewed the Director of  Intelligence for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Homeland  Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center to determine that  organization\u2019s interaction with US-CERT and its role regarding identifying  cyber threats. We also interviewed the Deputy Director of the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s National Cybersecurity Center to obtain  information about its concept-of-operations document. We then compared  those activities to the key attributes of cyber analysis and warning  capabilities in order to determine US-CERT\u2019s ability to provide cyber  analysis and warning and identify any related gaps.", "To identify US-CERT\u2019s challenges to developing and implementing the key  attributes and a successful national cyber analysis and warning capability,  we gathered and analyzed relevant documents, such as past GAO reports  and studies by various cybersecurity-related entities, and interviewed key  federal and nonfederal officials regarding the challenges associated with  cyber analysis and warning. On the basis of the information received and  our knowledge of the issues, we determined the major challenges to  developing and implementing the key attributes and a successful national  cyber analysis and warning capability.", "We performed this performance audit between June 2007 and July 2008 in  the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area; Atlanta, Georgia; Bloomington,  Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Norfolk, Virginia; in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.
