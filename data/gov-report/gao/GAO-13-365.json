Specifically, GAO examined (1) government strategies and programs other advanced economies have implemented to approach issues similar to those facing U.S. manufacturing, and (2) the key distinctions between government approaches to support manufacturing in other advanced economies and those in the United States. Based on input from experts and federal officials, and an analysis of manufacturing programs in other advanced countries, GAO selected Canada, Germany, Japan, and South Korea for study. In each country, GAO interviewed program officials and reviewed documents describing their programs. To identify distinctions between foreign and U.S. approaches to supporting manufacturing, GAO researched comparable programs in the United States, and interviewed staff administering those programs.", "GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO received only technical comments on this report from federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The four countries GAO analyzed--Canada, Germany, Japan, and South Korea--offer a varied mix of programs to support their manufacturing sectors. For example, Canada is shifting emphasis from its primary research and development (R&D) tax credit toward direct support to manufacturers to encourage innovation, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Germany has established applied institutes and clusters of researchers and manufacturers to conduct R&D in priority areas, as well as a national dual training system that combines classroom study with workplace training, and develops national vocational skills standards and credentials in 350 occupations. Japan has implemented science and technology programs--with a major focus on alternative energy projects--as part of a comprehensive manufacturing strategy. South Korea has substantially expanded investments in R&D, including the development of a network of technoparks--regional innovation centers that provide R&D facilities, business incubation, and education and production assistance to industry.", "When compared to the United States, the countries in GAO's study offer some key distinctions in government programs to support the manufacturing sector in the areas of innovation, trade, and training.", "While the United States and the other four countries all provide support for innovation and R&D, the foreign programs place greater emphasis on commercialization to help manufacturers bridge the gap between innovative ideas and sales. These include programs that support infrastructure as well as hands-on technical and product development services to firms, and that foster collaboration between manufacturers and researchers. In contrast, the United States relies heavily on competitive funding for R&D projects with commercial potential.", "Within trade policy, the United States and the four countries in GAO's study provide similar services, but there are several differences in how they are delivered. For example, the United States is an acknowledged leader in intellectual property protection, but the U.S. government plays a less prominent role than the Japanese government in developing technological standards on industrial products.", "A key difference related to training programs pertains to the sustained role of government in coordinating stakeholder input into a national system of vocational skills training and credentialing, which helps provide a supply of skilled workers for manufacturers. This was particularly evident in Germany. In contrast, the United States largely devolves vocational training to states and localities and does not have a national system to issue industry-recognized credentials. However, the U.S. manufacturing industry, with participation from the federal government, has recently launched an effort to establish nationally portable, industry-recognized credentials for the manufacturing sector.", "Overall, GAO's analysis shows the broad extent to which four countries who are U.S. competitors are leveraging the public sector to help their manufacturing industries maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing global economy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Even though certain measures show that the manufacturing sector in the  United States remains competitive worldwide, over the last decade it has  lost over one-third of its workforce. There are concerns that this decline in  employment indicates a loss of international competitiveness as well as  shrinking job opportunities for middle-class workers. Other developed  economies have also faced manufacturing job losses and have had  concerns about manufacturing competitiveness, particularly as China has  claimed a rapidly increasing share of global manufacturing production.  There may be important insights for the United States to glean from the  manufacturing policies and strategies of similarly-situated countries,  which are facing some of the same challenges of increased competition in  manufacturing from developing countries. We were asked to identify  innovative manufacturing programs from other countries that may help  inform U.S. policy. Specifically, we examined the following questions:  1.  What government strategies and programs have other advanced  economies implemented to approach issues similar to those facing  manufacturing in the United States?  2.  What key distinctions exist between policy approaches to support  manufacturing in other advanced economies and those in the United  States?", "To identify foreign countries and innovative manufacturing programs that  may help inform U.S. manufacturing policy, we interviewed a range of  manufacturing experts about key manufacturing issues and obtained their  views about which foreign countries had innovative manufacturing  programs. We selected four comparison countries to study\u2014Canada,  Germany, Japan, and South Korea\u2014based on recommendations from  experts, including U.S. officials from the Departments of Commerce  (Commerce) and Labor (Labor), consideration of the countries\u2019 economic  and political similarities to the United States, and information from our  own research of foreign programs that support manufacturing. We then  worked with officials from the U.S. Department of State (State) stationed  in the selected four countries and foreign embassy officials to select  specific programs for our review. We did not attempt to perform a  comprehensive review of manufacturing programs in the four selected  foreign countries, nor did we seek information in all countries about  programs in each of our three key policy categories\u2014innovation, trade,  and training. To learn about our selected foreign programs, we met with  foreign officials administering these programs and reviewed documents  they provided. To identify key distinctions between foreign and U.S.  approaches to manufacturing, we researched comparable programs in  the United States, selected in part based on suggestions from Commerce  and Labor, and interviewed staff administering those programs. We did  not attempt to do a comprehensive review of U.S. manufacturing  programs, nor attempt to assess the effectiveness of any country\u2019s  programs.", "This report uses data obtained from large U.S. and international agencies  and from foreign manufacturing agencies. We assessed the reliability of  data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Bureau of Economic  Analysis, the World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) by reviewing literature provided by  the organizations regarding their methodology for compiling data,  including measures to ensure data quality and comparability across  countries. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. We did not independently attempt to confirm the  reliability of data provided by foreign manufacturing agencies except  where documentary evidence provided by those agencies allowed us to;  we did confirm the accuracy of the figures and our use of them by having  foreign officials review relevant excerpts of the report. We found these  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For data on export  promotion, we assessed the reliability of data from the World Trade  Organization by reviewing literature provided by that organization  regarding its methodology for compiling data, reviewed the methodology  of an International Trade Administration study that compared and  analyzed foreign countries\u2019 export promotion budget levels, and accessed  the websites of Canadian, German, Japanese, and South Korean export  promotion agencies to obtain the number of countries in which those  countries offered export promotion services; we found the data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Appendix I contains additional information about  our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2012 to July 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. manufacturing sector comprises businesses that are engaged in  the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials,  substances, or components into new products, including sectors such as  machinery, textiles, apparel, food production, and chemicals. However,  U.S. policy makers have become focused on competing in high-end, or  \u201cadvanced manufacturing.\u201d While no consensus definition of advanced  manufacturing exists, it refers generally to the production of scientifically-  and technologically-intensive products, in which the economic value  derives from inputs of knowledge and design more than it reflects  traditional inputs such as labor and materials. Robotics,  nanomanufacturing, and electric vehicles are examples of advanced  manufacturing sub-industries.", "Statistics present a mixed picture about the health of U.S. manufacturing,  both relative to the rest of the U.S. economy and to other countries\u2019  manufacturing sectors. According to data from BLS, manufacturing  employment has fallen from 17.6 million workers in 1998 to 11.5 million in  early 2010, a decline of over one-third over a period in which total U.S.  employment grew somewhat. However, the decline in U.S. manufacturing  employment is not a new phenomenon, and a longer-term view shows a  steady decline of manufacturing\u2019s share of all American jobs. As figure 1  shows, the percentage of U.S. nonfarm workers in manufacturing has  dropped steadily since the end of World War II, from about 35 percent in  1945 to about 9 percent in 2012. Since bottoming out in 2010,  manufacturing employment rebounded slowly up to about 12 million  workers at the end of 2012. Also, other advanced economies, such as  Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, suffered large  manufacturing job losses from 1998 to 2011, suggesting that global  economic forces have affected manufacturing employment in addition to  any factors that may be unique to the United States.", "Similar to the employment trend, manufacturing has accounted for a  decreasing share of U.S. economic output over the last several decades,  from about 28 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the early  1950\u2019s to a recent low of 11 percent in 2009 (see fig. 2).", "Moreover, the decrease in manufacturing\u2019s share of employment and  GDP could reflect increasing worker productivity in manufacturing and the  emergence and growth of other U.S. industries. According to data from  BLS, U.S. manufacturing productivity, measured as output per hour, rose  55.7 percent from 2002 to 2011, exceeded only by the Czech Republic,  South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan among 19 measured countries.  Furthermore, after contracting in 2008 and 2009, manufacturing  contributed more to the percent change in U.S. GDP than any other  industry group in 2010 and 2012, as well as playing a leading role in  somewhat weaker GDP growth in 2011.", "When compared to the manufacturing sectors in other countries, some  statistics show that the United States performs well. Figure 3 shows the  change in manufacturing value-added for Canada, China, Germany,  Japan, South Korea, and the United States from 1998 to 2010, in  constant year 2000 U.S. dollars. The figure shows that China and South  Korea have experienced a rapid increase in manufacturing production  over this period, while U.S. manufacturing value-added has grown about  as fast as that in Japan, Germany, and Canada.", "Some manufacturing experts, however, maintain that official statistics  misrepresent the state of U.S. manufacturing because productivity and  value-added statistics do not properly account for the value of imported  inputs in goods manufactured in the United States. As these imports  become cheaper, or as manufacturers shift to lower-cost imported inputs,  the value-added of the resulting manufactured good rises, suggesting  more manufacturing \u201cproduction,\u201d even though nothing meaningful may  have changed about manufacturing competitiveness. The Information  Technology and Innovation Foundation, an innovation policy think tank,  estimated in a 2012 report that official statistics overstate productivity  growth from 2000-2010 by 122 percent.", "Not all experts agree on what role, if any, the government should play in  supporting manufacturing. Economic theory generally suggests that  government intervention into private sector activity is justified by \u201cmarket  failure\u201d\u2014situations in which the private market under- or over-produces a  good because private interests differ from society\u2019s. Those supportive of  enhancing productivity in manufacturing suggest that government policy  should target the sector in order to remedy market failures that may  hinder innovation\u2014the development and application of new knowledge.  Innovation underpins improvements in the way capital and labor are  combined to create new products and increase productivity. This makes it  critical for the broader economy and particularly important for  manufacturing.", "An important element of innovation is research and development (R&D),  the testing and application of new ideas. R&D is seen as a key source of  innovation and its application to new products and technologies. The  private sector, however, faces disincentives to investing in R&D\u2014 it may  be expensive, it often fails, willing firms may lack sufficient finances, and  successful R&D may produce benefits that the investing firm cannot  capture \u2014 leading to possible underinvestment in R&D and  underproduction in innovation without government support. These  disincentives may be particularly difficult to overcome for small- and  medium-sized enterprises (SME). Though innovation policy can address  market failure across all sectors of the economy, advocates of targeted  innovation policy argue that it may provide particular benefit to  manufacturing. They note that the sector depends on continually creating  new ideas for products and ways to make those products. They also  observe that manufacturing is a significant source of R&D; according to  the National Science Foundation, the sector accounted for 70 percent of  private-sector spending on R&D in the United States in 2008.", "In practical terms, to support needed innovation, the government may  intervene through various policies, some of which may have a focus on  the manufacturing sector. These include:", "Public support for \u201cbasic\u201d R&D in science and engineering, which,  while conducted without specific commercial applications in mind, can  spur private-sector innovation. The public sector may be well-suited to  conducting basic R&D directly, through government scientific  agencies, public universities, and other research institutions, because  it is unlikely that most private firms would conduct this type of general  research without a potentially profitable application in mind.", "Public support for private-sector \u201capplied\u201d R&D, research that seeks to  solve practical problems or develop new products and  commercialization. Applied R&D is seen as a key component in  helping innovators overcome the so-called \u201cvalley of death\u201d, the  difficult transition between new ideas and commercially viable  manufacturing products or processes. Support for applied R&D could  take various forms:", "Subsidies for private investment in R&D, through direct funding or  tax incentives, and assistance with financing for private R&D  projects with commercialization potential, which may overcome  the difficulty some firms may face in obtaining funding from private  financial markets. However, it may be difficult for the government  to figure out which firms merit subsidy because of the lack of  information or foresight into an individual firm\u2019s growth prospects.", "Public infrastructure investment that facilitates R&D and  knowledge transfer, such as research laboratories, transportation  investment, and \u201cknowledge\u201d infrastructure such as broadband  telecommunications, the development of measurement techniques  and databases, and the dissemination of technical expertise.  Experts have referred to such widely-accessible infrastructure or  knowledge as the \u201cindustrial commons\u201d that provides a base for  innovation and production, and see investment in these commons  as an important source of new ideas for products or processes  and solutions to existing problems.", "Public support for innovation clusters \u2014 regional concentrations of  large and small companies that develop creative products and  services, along with specialized suppliers, service providers,  universities, and associated institutions. Firms in a cluster may be  able to share knowledge and transact business at lower cost than  if they were far apart, possibly leading to increased innovation.", "However, the effectiveness of cluster policy has not been  established; the formation of successful clusters in the United  States, such as California\u2019s Silicon Valley, suggests that  government support for clusters may not be necessary.", "For more on nontariff barriers, see GAO, Export-Import Bank, Reaching New Targets  for Environmentally Beneficial Exports Presents Major Challenges for Bank, GAO-10-682  (Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2010); and International Trade: Four Free Trade Agreements  GAO Reviewed Have Resulted in Commercial Benefits, but Challenges on Labor and  Environment Remain, GAO-09-439 (Washington, D.C.: July 2009). manufactured goods represented 86 percent of all U.S. goods  exported and 60 percent of total U.S. exports.", "Figure 4 provides a summary of some key types of support that  governments can provide to support innovation, training, and trade, which  can benefit manufacturing and other sectors.", "In the United States, the federal government has generally taken the lead  in supporting basic research, providing the economic framework, and  constructing infrastructure. Commerce administers manufacturing  programs through sub-agencies such as the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST), the Economic Development  Administration (EDA), and the International Trade Administration. Other  U.S. agencies support manufacturing as part of their program activities,  including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science  Foundation. Labor administers training programs for job seekers through  the Employment and Training Administration. In addition, tax breaks such  as the R&D tax credit further benefit manufacturers (although these  provisions do not apply exclusively to manufacturers). States and  localities have the main responsibility for education and also are most  active in promoting regional economic development, including measures  that support innovation.

In 2010, according to the Canadian government, Canada continued to lag  behind other advanced economies in terms of business innovation  performance despite a high level of federal support for R&D. In response,  Canada\u2019s 2010 budget called for a comprehensive review of all federal  support for R&D. The resulting report\u2014commonly referred to as the  Jenkins report\u2014catalogued a set of 60 R&D programs worth about $5  billion Canadian in fiscal year 2010-2011. The Jenkins report found that  Canada\u2019s support for business innovation was heavily weighted toward  the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax  credit, but that the calculation of some SR&ED expenses was highly  complex, which resulted in excessive compliance costs for SMEs in  particular. The report also found that other countries relied less than  Canada on indirect tax incentives to stimulate innovation, and that  Canadian federal policy should provide more effective support to  innovative firms, particularly SMEs, to help them grow and become  competitive. To address these findings, the Jenkins report recommended  simplifying the SR&ED and redeploying the savings from this toward  more direct support to SMEs in order to encourage innovation. To further  expand opportunities for innovation in Canada, the Jenkins report also  recommended that the government provide innovative firms with more  access to venture capital, and make better use of government  procurement by leveraging the government\u2019s substantial purchasing  power to create demand for leading-edge goods, services, and  technologies from Canadian enterprises.", "Canada\u2019s 2012 national budget, in turn, contained several changes that  acted on the Jenkins report recommendations. According to Canadian  budget documents, effective 2014, the SR&ED tax credit will be reduced;  the budget of the Industrial Research and Assistance Program, which  employs a national network of technical advisors who work directly with  SMEs to help them grow through the commercialization of innovative  products and services, was increased. The 2012 budget also announced  a new $400 million venture capital fund to support innovative start-up  firms. To address the report\u2019s recommendation on procurement, the  Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program was made permanent  in order to assist SMEs in doing business with the government of  Canada.", "Table 1 highlights examples of manufacturing-related programs in  Canada. For further information on Canadian programs included in this  review, see Appendix III.", "Despite slow economic growth at the turn of the century and contraction  in 2008-2009, the German economy has grown steadily over recent  years. According to German officials, this growth has been in part a result  of the strength of Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector, which accounts for  about 22 percent of GDP. German officials told us that after the recession  of 2008-2009, manufacturing recovered relatively quickly in part because  of an arrangement between unions, employers, and the government  through which (1) employers reduced their employees\u2019 hours to avoid  layoffs, and (2) the government subsidized a portion of employees\u2019 lost  salaries. According to German officials, this arrangement allowed  businesses to continue to operate through the economic downturn, and  then expand workers\u2019 hours once the economy recovered. A 2012 OECD  report estimates that the agreement may have prevented up to 500,000  layoffs.", "To make the most of existing growth potential and open new prospects  for German industry, the German government issued its High Tech  Strategy 2020 in 2006. The strategy guides the specific efforts across  national government agencies and programs. Specifically, it states that in  order for Germany to become a leader in solving global challenges, the  government will need to stimulate R&D in five priority areas: (1) climate  and energy, (2) health and nutrition, (3) mobility, (4) security, and (5)  communication. The German government has, in turn, recently  established several programs to promote innovation in these areas.", "The High Tech Strategy 2020 provides a framework for recent programs  that encourage applied research and innovation, particularly in SMEs,  and also for a program that supports business clusters that conduct R&D  in the strategy\u2019s five priority areas.

However, the national government has  identified innovation as a challenge across the SME sector. In response,  according to German officials and German government documents, the  German government has in recent years initiated a group of programs  intended to strengthen innovation in SMEs. These programs\u2014all initiated  in 2006 or later\u2014include the following:", "The Central Innovation Program for SMEs, which is Germany\u2019s  largest program to support innovation in SMEs, provides grant funding  to pursue innovative ideas that show high potential for  commercialization.", "The HighTech Grunderfonds program is a public-private venture  capital fund that invests in innovative start-up companies.", "Signo provides federal assistance to SMEs in securing intellectual  property for innovative products and helps SMEs file for patents with  the German Patent and Trademark Office.", "According to German officials and German government documents, as  part of its High Tech Strategy, Germany also established the  Spitzencluster program to continue the national emphasis on innovation  by funding business clusters judged through a competitive application  process to be the best, or \u201cleading edge\u201d clusters in the country.", "In addition to these more recent programs, according to representatives  of Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institutes, skilled Fraunhofer researchers  pursue joint applied R&D projects with businesses that result in  commercializable processes and products. Germany established the  Fraunhofer Institutes, a nationwide network of 60 applied research  facilities with research expert staff, in 1949 as part of efforts to rebuild its  research infrastructure after World War II, according to Fraunhofer  officials. Fraunhofer\u2019s applied research projects include the following  categories of specialization: (1) materials and components, (2)  microelectronics, (3) information and communications technology, (4)  production, (5) light and surfaces, and (6) life sciences. Fraunhofer  officials told us that Fraunhofer Institutes are co-located with universities,  which allows companies access to skilled researchers.", "In contrast to Germany\u2019s newer programs to support innovation,  Germany\u2019s main national system to support the export of manufactured  goods has a much longer history of providing support to the  manufacturing sector. According to German officials, Germany is a  leading exporter of manufactured technology goods. German officials also  told us that Germany\u2019s long-established export promotion organization,  the Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, brings together  an agency of the national government and all exporting businesses to  share export information. Germany fosters export activities in two main  ways: (1) by selectively establishing partnerships abroad, and (2) by  providing assistance for trade fair attendance and participation in trade  delegations.", "In addition to programs in innovation and trade, Germany also maintains  a dual training system, which was established in law in 1970 but has  existed in practice for centuries, according to German officials. German  officials explained that the dual training system\u2014through which German  high school-age students complete apprenticeships in skilled trades\u2014is a  cooperative effort among business, labor, federal and state government  representatives, coordinated by the Federal Institute for Vocational  Education and Training. The Federal Institute for Vocational Education  and Training, an institute of the national government, is responsible for  regularly incorporating stakeholder feedback into the process of creating  and updating skills certification standards. The executive board of the  Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training includes  representatives from German unions, employers\u2019 associations, federal  agencies, and state governments.

Japan\u2019s manufacturing sector has been  recognized in the past for its ability to make incremental improvements to  manufactured products\u2014for example, small just-in-time improvements  made specifically for a subsequent phase of the manufacturing process\u2014 illustrated by the often-copied lean manufacturing practices that a well- known automobile manufacturer developed over several decades.  Officials from Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), the  country\u2019s main ministry for manufacturing policy, identified genbaryoku\u2014 capabilities to find and solve problems in the field\u2014as a unique source of  strength in Japan\u2019s manufacturing industry. According to these officials,  this capability helped Japan to restore its economy quickly after damage  from the earthquake. In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima crisis, many  SMEs went out of business, and global companies, including automobile  manufacturers, faced delays in delivery of inputs and in production,  according to Japanese officials. As a result, METI officials said that the  Japanese government and automobile industry started working to  establish more diverse and reliable supply networks.", "In 2007, the Japanese government published a comprehensive  innovation plan: the \u201cInnovation 25\u201d initiative, a long-term strategy for  innovation in engineering, information technology, and other fields by the  year 2025. This initiative established a cabinet-level minister for  innovation and called for several new policies, including: 1) reviewing  regulations to establish an environment that supports innovation, (2)  promoting the use of new technologies in the public sector, and (3)  strengthening activities for international standardization. According to the  Center for Strategic and International Studies, this plan introduced the  concept of an innovation \u201cecosystem\u201d in Japan, which emphasizes  collaboration among universities, research institutes, the private sector,  and government\u2014similar to clusters\u2014rather than the private sector acting  alone to develop and commercialize innovations.", "Japan developed its most recent 5-year Science and Technology Basic  Plan in 2011. This plan is aimed at reconstruction and revival from the  Fukushima disaster and realizing sustainable growth, for example, by  focusing on green innovation. The goal of this Basic Plan is to provide a  concrete plan for implementing Japan\u2019s comprehensive New Growth  Strategy introduced in the same year. As an outgrowth of the third  science and technology plan, the Japanese government initiated several  regional innovation cluster programs to enhance Japan\u2019s  competitiveness. One of these programs, the Industrial Cluster Project, is  composed of groups of local SMEs and venture businesses that use  research obtained from universities and other institutions. One of 18 such  clusters in Japan\u2014the Technology Advanced Metropolitan Area (TAMA)  Association\u2014has over 600 entities, including universities, financial  institutions, local governments, businesses, and industry groups,  according to one TAMA Association official. The TAMA Association  supports local SME manufacturers by matching them with larger  businesses that have complementary needs at the national, regional, and  local levels to improve R&D and commercialization of technology and  products. For example, the TAMA Association connects manufacturers in  need of a particular type of R&D to university researchers with projects in  that field.", "In response to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan has  intertwined energy issues\u2014especially alternative energy projects\u2014in its  manufacturing policy. The national government has laid out detailed  alternative energy policies through its 2011 and 2012 comprehensive  Rebirth of Japan strategies. Among other things, the 2011 strategy  outlines support for: (1) adopting renewable energies; (2) developing R&D  hubs consisting of universities, research institutions, and private firms for  industrial development and job creation purposes; and (3) adopting  electric, heat, and other energy supply systems that make use of regional  resources. The 2012 strategy outlines increased R&D for creating  innovative green parts and materials, developing green vehicles, and  improving battery performance. METI established the Next Generation  Vehicle (NGV) Program, a key alternative energy initiative. According to  METI officials, NGV\u2019s strategy takes an integrated approach involving six  components: (1) development and production of the vehicles; (2) battery  R&D and technology; (3) rare metal and resource recycling systems; (4)  installation and infrastructure of chargers; (5) vehicle systems; and (6)  international standards for battery performance and safety evaluation  methods\u2014and associated roadmaps. According to METI officials, NGV  identifies diffusion targets for alternative-fuel vehicles and the  development of related technologies. For example, one of its goals is to  develop advanced batteries for automobiles that will also have other  uses, such as powering homes. As part of the NGV Program, Japan\u2019s  government, in conjunction with industrial leaders, seeks to influence  international technological standards for related manufacturing  accessories, including battery performance and chargers, for which  various countries are developing competing models. The government  also funds alternative energy projects, as well as other R&D intensive  private-sector projects with commercial potential, through the New Energy  and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). According  to NEDO officials, NEDO connects university researchers and industry to  collaborate on joint research, such as R&D in support of batteries and  hydrogen fuel cells for electric vehicles.", "The Rebirth of Japan strategies also include significant support for  strengthening SMEs. For example, the 2011 strategy outlines overcoming  the \u201cvalley of death\u201d\u2014the gap between innovative ideas and  commercializable production\u2014by promoting cooperation between  industry, academia, and the government; encouraging joint R&D projects;  and supporting overseas business for SMEs. The government also  encourages SME technological innovation by offering technical and  business support through a national network of Public Industrial  Technology Research Institutes\u2014known as Kohsetsushi centers.  According to Japanese officials, these centers provide SME  manufacturers with a range of services including technology guidance;  technical assistance and training; networking; testing, analysis, and  instrumentation; and access to open laboratories and test beds, and they  typically offer technical consultation services free of charge. Kohsetsushi  Centers support Japanese SME manufacturers in adopting emerging  technologies, including nanotechnology and robotics. For example, the  Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Technology Research Institute (TIRI) serves  about a quarter of Tokyo\u2019s 40,000 manufacturers across three locations,  primarily by providing services, information, and testing equipment and  facilities to SMEs, according to TIRI officials.", "In addition, the Kawasaki Business Incubation Center rents offices and  lab space to SMEs and entrepreneurs and provides some free services,  such as introductions to potential partners and funding entities and  support for completing applications for government subsidies or loans and  establishing a registered corporation, according to Kawasaki Business  Incubation Center officials. The center is located in close proximity to a  number of larger companies and research institutes, which incubation  officials told us helps facilitate collaboration. The center also provides  training sessions on topics including machine operation to help  companies acquire necessary technical skills. Having these resources  nearby helps companies to move from basic R&D to practical applications  in commercial products, and eventually to mass production since many of  the tools needed for designing and manufacturing are in one place,  according to Kawasaki City officials.", "Table 3 highlights examples of manufacturing-related programs in Japan.

According to the United States Agency for International  Development, it is the only country to make this shift to date. Between  1999 and 2011, South Korean manufacturing output (in current U.S.  dollars) has almost tripled. This rise has coincided with an increase in its  investment in R&D, from approximately 2.2 percent of GDP in 1999 to  approximately 3.4 percent in 2008, according to OECD statistics. As table  4 shows, South Korea\u2019s percentage increase in R&D spending over this  period exceeded that of the other countries in our study, and as of 2009,  South Korea spent more on R&D as a percentage of GDP than the other  countries.", "The South Korean government has invested in various research  institutes, including those that are state-financed, university-based, and  private-sector driven. According to Commerce officials in South Korea,  every government ministry invests in several research institutes. For  example, the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning supports  approximately 25 research institutes, including the Electronics and  Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), according to ETRI  officials.

In contrast, the United States spends a  relatively high amount on competitive funding for R&D projects with  commercial potential. Within trade policy, countries in our study all  provide similar services but there are several differences in how they are  delivered. For example, the United States is an acknowledged leader in  intellectual property protection, but the United States government plays a  less prominent role than Japan in developing technological standards.

The programs they implement to  achieve these goals place a particular emphasis on bringing SMEs into  the innovation process. Innovation programs abroad incorporate three  broad strategies: (1) providing technical support and product development  for client firms, especially SMEs; (2) fostering collaboration between  manufacturers and researchers, as well as between small and large  manufacturers; and (3) providing competitive grants for private-sector  R&D efforts with commercial potential. While the United States offers  many similar types of programs, the programs we identified offer  somewhat less extensive support for technical support and product  development than those in some foreign countries, but relatively high  funding for R&D grants.", "Canada, Germany, and Japan have set up national networks of centers  that provide a wide range of hands-on technical and business support  services to manufacturing firms, especially SMEs. The focus of many of  these programs suggests that they see SMEs as a rich potential source of  innovation that market barriers, such as the financial risks of conducting  R&D, might impede without government support. For example, Japan\u2019s  Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Research Institute (TIRI), one center among  the national Kohsetsushi network of 182 centers, offers a wide array of  services and facilities to SMEs, including testing services, laboratories for  product development, information on international technical standards,  and intellectual property support. TIRI also offers collaborative research  partners for SMEs to engage in R&D for product and technology  development. Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institutes also operate an extensive  network of nationwide centers\u2014serving both SMEs and large  manufacturers\u2014that offer university-affiliated research expertise to  clients. According to Fraunhofer officials, product and technology  commercialization are central objectives of their centers.

MEP operates a national network of 60 centers to provide support to SME  manufacturers, focusing on helping manufacturers in five key areas: (1)  technology acceleration, (2) supplier development, (3) sustainability, (4)  workforce, and (5) continuous improvement. Specifically, MEP centers  enter into contracts with companies to deliver technical assistance to  improve their manufacturing processes and productivity, expand capacity,  adopt new technologies, utilize best management practices, and  accelerate company growth. However, MEP officials with whom we spoke  said that MEP centers offer a more limited focus on commercialization,  and do not typically offer testing equipment or widespread expertise in  product commercialization. Instead, MEP may connect client firms to third  parties offering specific services.", "As table 6 shows, Canada, Germany, and Japan invest more money and  resources in their technical support programs than the United States does  in MEP. According to NIST officials, MEP receives about $100 million in  government funding, and two-thirds of its revenues comes from other  sources such as client fees, states, or other partner resources. Canada\u2019s  IRAP, in comparison, had funding of $143 million (U.S.) in 2011-12, with  an expanded budget of $257.6 million for 2012-13, a much higher  investment relative to the size of the economy or the manufacturing  sector than the United States.

South Korea\u2019s  Daedeok Innopolis consists of universities, research institutes,  government and government-invested institutions, corporate research  institutes and venture corporations. These programs may encourage  opportunities for applied R&D and product development not only through  access to facilities, but also through interaction among companies in  close physical proximity to each other. According to program officials,  Japan\u2019s TAMA Association, one site among 18 in the country\u2019s Industrial  Cluster project, and South Korea\u2019s Daedeok Innopolis help SMEs match  technologies they develop with larger companies that may be able to  apply these technologies to products they make, or processes for making  them, which may increase technology dissemination. Germany\u2019s  Spitzencluster program has encouraged cluster formation by providing  funding to clusters judged to be among the country\u2019s best, or \u201cleading  edge\u201d; the program has awarded three rounds of funding of up to  approximately $257 million per round to 15 total selected clusters.  Canada offers manufacturers access to research facilities to conduct  R&D in various scientific fields through its National Research Council.", "In the United States, the federal government has recently begun to  increase support for clusters.

SBA\u2019s 1-year evaluation of the initiative showed positive results, including  over two-thirds of participating businesses reporting development of a  new product, and over half commercializing new technology. In 2011,  several federal partners, led by the Economic Development  Administration, funded the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge  (JIAC), the first interagency cluster initiative. JIAC provided $37 million to  20 existing clusters. Later in 2011, $9 million was awarded to 13 clusters  in rural areas. In 2012, the 3rd JIAC awarded $20.2 million to 10 existing  clusters focusing on Advanced Manufacturing.", "Table 7 provides a comparison of spending across countries on cluster  support programs.", "Another way countries support commercialization is through competitive  funding programs that evaluate and fund private manufacturing R&D  projects with commercial potential. Japan\u2019s New Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Organization (NEDO) was established in 1980  to promote the development of new energy technologies but has since  broadened its scope to fund industrial R&D projects. NEDO officials said  that a typical project they fund would have a budget of $12.5 million for  five years. NEDO\u2019s overall budget for 2012 was approximately $1.6  billion. Germany funds R&D through the Central Innovation Program for  SMEs, which focuses on SMEs and business-related research  establishments cooperating with them. The program funds up to half of a  business\u2019s costs for technical support, technology transfer, training, and  other activities in the development of a new product or process, and has  government funding of about $643 million per year. The Canadian  Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP), with funding of  approximately $32 million (U.S.) per year, is a federal program that helps  companies bridge the pre-commercialization gap for their innovative  goods and services, in part by testing innovative goods and services  within the Canadian government before taking them to the marketplace.", "The United States devotes a large amount of money to competitively- awarded R&D funding relative to other countries we studied. SBA  administers two large funding programs through the Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer  (STTR) programs. The funds for the SBIR program are provided by  federal agencies with an extramural budget of at least $100 million for  research or R&D, and for STTR by agencies with extramural research or  R&D budgets of at least $1 billion; SBA oversees the programs and the  efforts of these agencies. According to SBA officials, the SBIR and STTR  programs had combined budgets of approximately $2.5 billion in 2012 to  fund awards in successive phases, designed to promote technological  innovation and economic growth within small businesses. Generally, the  agencies participating in the SBIR and STTR programs offer up to  $150,000 to awardees for an initial 6-month period of performance, and  those applicants who receive a subsequent phase award typically receive  up to $1 million for a 2\u2013year period of performance. SBA officials said that  projects are often evaluated for potential commercial applications to the  evaluating agency itself, such as the Department of Defense, as opposed  to potential demand for the product from the private sector (although this  varies by agency). This aspect of SBIR/STTR takes a similar approach to  Canada\u2019s CICP in that it uses government procurement as a means for  potentially introducing innovative products into the larger market.

In addition, support for training and for the  skilled trades is deeply embedded in German society, and about 55  percent of high school students enter the dual training system each year.", "In contrast, the United States and Canada have a more decentralized  system of skills training programs, with management of these programs  largely devolved to states and localities. In the United States, Labor has a  major role in administering a number of federally-funded skills training  programs, including those under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998  (WIA), which largely target dislocated workers and economically  disadvantaged adults and youth. WIA programs are overseen at the  local level by Workforce Investment Boards, committees of local  business, labor, and government representatives, with services provided  through local American Job Centers.

However, their manufacturing approaches suggest some key areas that  the United States may wish to consider as it continues to formulate its  manufacturing strategy and programs to carry out that strategy. Each of  the foreign countries took a multi-faceted and hands-on approach to spur  innovation in ways that are intended to lead to commercialization,  suggesting that no one program or mechanism can fully address the  challenge of bridging the gap between innovative ideas and  manufacturing sales. In addition, we noted the sustained government  commitment to managing a national system of vocational skills training  and credentialing that facilitates consensus among business, labor, and  education. This was particularly evident in Germany. The United States  has no corollary, and due to major cultural differences it is unlikely that we  would consider a similar system of the same scale.
