These challenges are (1) selecting the most qualified applicants, (2) effectively overseeing grantees, (3) measuring the results of grants, and (4) effectively managing grants staff and resources. In recent years, EPA has taken a series of actions to address these challenges by, among other things, issuing policies, conducting training, and developing a new data system for grants management. However, these past actions had mixed results because of the complexity of the problems, weaknesses in design and implementation, and insufficient management emphasis. EPA's 2002 competition and oversight policies and 2003 grants management plan focus on the major challenges GAO identified, but will require strengthening, enhanced accountability, and a sustained commitment to succeed. For example, EPA's new oversight policy mandates more in-depth monitoring of grantees but it does not build in a process for analyzing the results of the in-depth monitoring to address systemic grantee problems. Such analysis could better target EPA's oversight efforts. In addition, its 5-year grants management plan does offer, for the first time, a comprehensive road map with objectives, goals, and milestones for addressing grants management challenges. However, the plan does not completely address how EPA will hold all managers and staff accountable for successfully fulfilling their management responsibilities. Therefore, EPA cannot ensure the sustained commitment required for the plan's success. Although information on promising grants management practices is limited, the federal agencies and other organizations GAO contacted identified some practices for each of EPA's four major challenges that may further assist EPA in improving its grants management. For example, one federal agency takes into account applicants' potential to achieve results when selecting grantees. A private foundation conducts preaward reviews of some applicants to learn about the organization and assess its fiscal health. In addition, GAO has developed a guide for federal agencies to use to hold managers and staff accountable for achieving desired agency results. This guide could be useful in helping EPA ensure accountability for grants management performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has faced persistent  challenges in managing its grants, which constitute over one-half of the  agency\u2019s budget, or about $4 billion annually. To support its mission of  protecting human health and the environment, in fiscal year 2002, EPA  awarded grants to a variety of recipients, including state and local  governments, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations. As of  September 30, 2002, there were 4,100 grant recipients. Given the size and  diversity of EPA\u2019s programs, its ability to efficiently and effectively  accomplish its mission largely depends on how well it manages its grant  resources and builds accountability into its efforts.", "Congressional hearings in 1996, 1999, and 2003 have focused on EPA\u2019s  problems in effectively managing its grants. We and EPA\u2019s Inspector  General have reported on a number of weaknesses throughout the grants  management process\u2014from awarding grants to measuring grant results.  EPA\u2019s efforts to address its grants management problems have not fully  resolved them. Because EPA has faced persistent problems in managing  grants, we designated its grants management as a major management  challenge in January 2003.", "Late in 2002, EPA launched new efforts to address some of its grants  management problems. It issued two new policies\u2014one to promote  competition in awarding grants and one to improve its oversight of grants.  Furthermore, in April 2003, EPA issued a 5-year grants management plan to  address its long-standing grants management problems.", "You asked us to determine the (1) major challenges EPA faces in managing  its grants and how it has addressed these challenges in the past, (2) extent  to which EPA\u2019s recently issued policies and grants management plan  address these challenges, and (3) promising practices, if any, that could  assist EPA in addressing these challenges.", "To identify the challenges EPA faces in managing its grants and to examine  how it has addressed these challenges in the past, we (1) analyzed 93  reports on EPA\u2019s grants management, including our reports, EPA\u2019s  Inspector General reports, and EPA\u2019s internal management reviews  conducted from 1996 through 2003, (2) systematically reviewed and  recorded information from the 1,232 records of calendar year 2002 in-depth  reviews of grantee performance\u2014from financial management to progress  in achieving grant objectives, and (3) interviewed EPA officials and  reviewed documents obtained from them. To determine the extent to  which EPA\u2019s recently issued policies and grants management plan address  these challenges, we (1) reviewed the new policies and plan and  interviewed EPA officials responsible for key aspects of the plan, (2)  attended EPA\u2019s grants management training courses, and (3) observed five  EPA in-depth reviews of grantees. To identify what promising practices, if  any, could assist EPA in addressing these challenges, we interviewed  officials in six federal agencies, including the five largest grants-awarding  agencies, and in private sector organizations and reviewed documentation  from them.

The Office of Grants and Debarment  develops grant policy and guidance. It also carries out certain types of  administrative and financial functions for the grants approved by the  headquarters program offices, such as awarding grants and overseeing the  financial management of these grants. On the programmatic side,  headquarters program offices establish and implement national policies for  their grant programs, and set funding priorities. They are also responsible  for the technical and programmatic oversight of their grants. In the regions,  grants management offices carry out certain administrative and financial  functions for the grants, such as awarding grants approved by the regional  program offices, while the regional program staff provide technical and  programmatic oversight of their grantees.", "As of June 2003, 109 grants specialists in the Office of Grants and  Debarment and the regional grants management offices were largely  responsible for administrative and financial grant functions. Furthermore,  1,835 project officers were actively managing grants in headquarters and  regional program offices. These project officers are responsible for the  technical and programmatic management of grants. Unlike grant  specialists, however, project officers generally have other primary  responsibilities, such as using the scientific and technical expertise for  which they were hired.", "In fiscal year 2002, EPA took 8,070 grant actions totaling about $4.2  billion. These awards were made to six main categories of recipients as  shown in figure 2.", "EPA offers two types of grants\u2014nondiscretionary and discretionary:   Nondiscretionary grants support water infrastructure projects, such as  the drinking water and clean water state revolving fund programs, and  continuing environmental programs, such as the Clean Air Program for  monitoring and enforcing Clean Air Act regulations.   For these grants,  Congress directs awards to one or more classes of prospective  recipients who meet specific eligibility criteria; the grants are often  awarded on the basis of formulas prescribed by law or agency  regulation. In fiscal year 2002, EPA awarded about $3.5 billion in  nondiscretionary grants. EPA awarded these grants primarily to states  or other governmental entities.", "Discretionary grants fund a variety of activities, such as environmental  research and training. EPA has the discretion to independently  determine the recipients and funding levels for these grants. In fiscal  year 2002, EPA awarded about $719 million in discretionary grants. EPA  awarded discretionary grants primarily to nonprofit organizations,  universities, and government entities.", "The grant process has the following four phases:   Preaward. EPA reviews the application paperwork and makes an award  decision.", "Award. EPA prepares the grant documents and instructs the grantee on  technical requirements, and the grantee signs an agreement to comply  with all requirements.", "Postaward. After awarding the grant, EPA provides technical assistance,  oversees the work, and provides payments to the grantee; the grantee  completes the work, and the project ends.", "Closeout of the award. EPA ensures that all technical work and  administrative requirements have been completed; EPA prepares  closeout documents and notifies the grantee that the grant is completed.", "EPA\u2019s grantees are subject to the same type of financial management  oversight as the recipients of other federal assistance. Specifically, the  Single Audit Act requires grantees to have an audit of their financial  statements and federal awards or a program specific audit if they spend  $300,000 or more in federal awards in a fiscal year. Grantees submit these  audits to a central clearinghouse operated by the Bureau of the Census,  which then forwards the audit findings to the appropriate agency for any  necessary action. However, the act does not cover all grants and all aspects  of grants management and, therefore, agencies must take additional steps  to ensure that federal funds are spent appropriately.", "In addition, EPA conducts in-depth reviews to analyze grantees\u2019  compliance with grant regulations and specific grant requirements.  Furthermore, to determine how well offices and regions oversee grantees,  EPA conducts three types of internal management reviews that address  grants management: (1) Management Oversight Reviews, which assess  grants management activities in regional offices; (2) Management  Effectiveness Reviews, which are self-assessments of grants management  activities performed by EPA\u2019s headquarters and regional offices; and (3)", "Post-Award Validation Reviews, which assess the effectiveness of  initiatives EPA has taken to improve oversight efforts.", "EPA has faced persistent problems in managing its grants. EPA\u2019s Inspector  General testified before Congress in 1996 and again in 1999 that EPA did  not fulfill its obligation to properly monitor grants. Acknowledging these  problems, EPA identified oversight, including grant closeouts, as a material  weakness\u2014an accounting and internal control system weakness that the  EPA Administrator must report to the President and Congress. EPA\u2019s  fiscal year 1999 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act report indicated  that this oversight material weakness had been corrected, but the Inspector  General testified that the weakness continued. In 2002, the Inspector  General again recommended that EPA designate grants management as a  material weakness. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also  recommended in 2002 that EPA designate grants management as a material  weakness. In its fiscal year 2002 Annual Report, EPA ultimately decided to  maintain this issue as an agency-level weakness, which is a lower level of  risk than a material weakness. EPA reached this decision because it  believes its ongoing corrective action efforts will help to resolve  outstanding grants management challenges. However, in adding EPA\u2019s  grants management to our list of EPA\u2019s major management challenges in  January 2003, we signaled our concern that EPA has not yet taken  sufficient action to ensure that it can manage its grants effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Key Grants Management Challenges Persist despite EPA\u2019s Past Efforts to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["We identified four key challenges that EPA continues to face in managing  its grants despite efforts to address them.

For discretionary grants, the agency requires project officers  to evaluate grant applications and recommend funding those that will most  effectively contribute to EPA\u2019s program objectives and priorities. But  project officers have not always performed all of the steps required to  review grant applications. According to a 2003 Inspector General report,  project officers did not always, among other things, (1) ensure a link  between the project funded and EPA\u2019s mission, (2) assess the probability of  success prior to the award, and (3) determine the reasonableness of  proposed project costs. As a result, EPA may have lost the opportunity to  fund other projects that could have better achieved its mission.", "The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 encourages  agencies to use competition in awarding grants. To encourage competition,  EPA issued a grants competition policy in 1995. However, EPA\u2019s policy did  not result in meaningful competition throughout the agency, according to  EPA officials. Furthermore, EPA\u2019s own internal management reviews and  a 2001 Inspector General report found that EPA has not always encouraged  competition.", "Finally, EPA has not always engaged in widespread solicitation when it  could be beneficial to do so. Widespread solicitation would provide greater  assurance that EPA receives proposals from a variety of eligible and highly  qualified applicants who otherwise may not have known about grant  opportunities. According to a 2001 EPA Inspector General report,  program officials indicated that widespread solicitation was not necessary  because \u201cword gets out\u201d to eligible applicants. Applicants often sent their  proposals directly to these program officials, who funded them using  \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d as the justification for a noncompetitive award. This  procedure created the appearance of preferential treatment by not offering  the same opportunities to all potential applicants. In addition, the agency  provided incomplete or inconsistent public information on its grant  programs in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

However, project officers did not  proactively ensure the recipient submitted the reports on time or that the  reports included the required financial information. According to our  analysis of EPA\u2019s 2002 in-depth reviews, 15 percent of the reviews identified  a problem with grantees\u2019 submitting complete progress reports on time.", "Furthermore, EPA\u2019s guidance emphasizes the importance of documenting  oversight efforts, in part, because a lack of documentation raises questions  about the extent of the monitoring conducted. However, project officers  and grants specialists have not always documented their monitoring  activities. According to a 2002 EPA internal management review, for  example, one grants management office developed a form to make it easier  to ensure monitoring activities were completed, but the form was missing  from 50 percent of the grant files reviewed. Even when staff used the  monitoring form, they did not always complete it. Furthermore, project  officers did not always document that they had monitored the required five  key areas under the policy, such as ensuring compliance with the terms and  conditions of the grant award.", "Finally, EPA has not effectively ensured that grantees comply with the  following grant requirements and objectives:  Adequate financial and internal controls. In 2001, we reported that  EPA\u2019s oversight of nonprofit grantees\u2019 costs did not ensure that grantees  used funds for costs allowed under OMB\u2019s guidance. For example, EPA  did not include transaction testing, which can identify unallowable  expenditures, such as lobbying.", "Compliance with grant regulations. In 2002, according to the Inspector  General, EPA did not monitor grantees\u2019 procurements to determine if  the grantees were using a competitive process to obtain the best  products, at the best price, from the most qualified firms. In addition,  in 1999 and again in 2002, the Inspector General reported conflict-of- interest problems because grant recipients had awarded contracts to  parties who had helped them prepare their grants and, therefore, had  advance knowledge about grantees\u2019 plans to award contracts. Our  review of EPA\u2019s 2002 in-depth reviews also found that a number of  compliance problems persist. (See table 7 in app. III.)

According to  our analysis of EPA\u2019s in-depth reviews, the agency conducted 1,232 reviews  in 2002. Table 1 shows that these reviews were conducted almost equally  on-site and off-site, and for a variety of different types of grantees.", "EPA also more evenly distributed, and increased the number of, on-site  reviews among its program and regional offices between 2001 and 2002.  According to the Inspector General, EPA conducted 466 on-site, in-depth  reviews in 2001, but 265 of these, or 57 percent, were conducted by only  two of EPA\u2019s offices. However, according to our analysis of the 2002 in- depth reviews, on-site reviews were more evenly distributed: 588 on-site  reviews, with the two EPA offices that conducted the most reviews  representing approximately 28 percent of the total.

According to our analysis, in 2002, EPA  grants specialists and project officers identified 1,250 problems in 21 areas.  (See table 7 in app. III.)   Tables 2 and 3 show the most frequently identified  problems for the 189 administrative and 1,017 programmatic reviews.   For  example, 73 of 189 administrative reviews found problems with grantees\u2019  written procedures, while 308 of the 1,017 programmatic reviews identified  technical issues.", "The differences in types of problems frequently identified, as shown in  tables 2 and 3, reflect differences in the focus of administrative and  programmatic reviews. Table 4 describes the nature of these problems.  (See table 12 in app. III for a description of all the problems.)", "In response to these problems, EPA required or recommended that  grantees take corrective actions for about half, or 640, of the 1,250  problems identified. (See table 13 in app. III.) For example, EPA found that  one grantee had not adequately separated duties to provide checks and  balances with the grantee\u2019s organization. That is, the executive director  was also the project manager, payment authorizer, contract executor, and  payroll officer. EPA recommended that the organization separate these  responsibilities to ensure proper handling of federal funds.", "EPA also took more significant actions against some grantees. These  significant actions include the following:  Suspension order\u2014EPA requires a grantee to stop work and take action  to minimize its grant-related expenditures until it resolves EPA\u2019s areas of  concern.", "Payment holds\u2014EPA decides it will not make any more payments to a  grantee until the grantee has resolved an area of concern.", "Disallowance of costs\u2014EPA disallows a grantee\u2019s expenditures when it  determines that the grantee did not spend its grant funds in accordance  with federal cost principles or its particular grant agreement.", "Debarment\u2014EPA declares that a particular organization or individual is  not eligible to receive grants for a specific period of time.", "Termination\u2014EPA cancels the grant.", "In our analysis of EPA\u2019s 2002 in-depth reviews, we identified 47 significant  actions against its grantees. The most frequent action taken was  withholding payment: 15 of the 47 significant actions. In no cases did EPA  debar a grantee. Nonprofit organizations and tribes each received 21 of  these actions, states received 5, and local governments and universities  received none. (See table 16 in app. III.) EPA\u2019s significant actions included  the following, for example:   Region 8 issued a payment hold against one of its tribal grantees after  questioning costs because the recipient appeared to be performing work  outside the scope of the grant agreement. The region determined that  the remaining $27,459 in the grantee\u2019s account should be withheld until  the tribe submitted documentation to demonstrate that the questioned  costs were allowable.", "Region 3 disallowed costs for one of its nonprofit grantees. The region  disallowed $51,085 based on a conflict-of-interest, lack of competition in  the subagreement, and lack of supporting documentation in accounting  records.", "The Grants Administration Division terminated a grant for a nonprofit  grantee. EPA took this action because the grantee actually had no paid  employees of its own but instead used the employees of a for-profit  company to conduct the work. This arrangement created an apparent  conflict of interest.", "Region 4 withheld $40,000 of funding from a state because it found that  the state had not agreed to fully implement its responsibilities as defined  by the grant.", "EPA data also showed that the agency took other significant actions in 2002  that did not result from in-depth reviews. According to our analysis, EPA  took 24 other significant actions because of problems identified during an  investigation by EPA\u2019s Inspector General or during oversight of grantees in  actions other than in-depth reviews.", "On another positive note, EPA improved its closeout of grants after it  developed specific procedures for closing out nonconstruction grants and  identified a strategy for closing out construction grants. This strategy  assessed impediments to closing out grants and actions to address these  impediments. EPA had successfully resolved its backlog by 2002. As a  result, EPA has eliminated this backlog as a material weakness, and thus it  better ensures that grant commitments have been met.", "Despite these positive steps, EPA\u2019s actions did not address the need to  develop information on systemic problems with grantees to better target its  oversight efforts\u2014a weakness in policy design. EPA could not develop  systemic information for three reasons. First, EPA did not use a statistical  approach to selecting grantees for in-depth reviews. In particular, EPA  allowed each of its offices to determine how many in-depth reviews the  office would conduct\u2014from at least 5 to 10 percent of grantees\u2014and what  criteria the office would use to select grantees for in-depth reviews. The  policy\u2019s flexibility in selecting grantees was premised on the belief that  those closest to grantees, such as a program or regional office, could best  decide on which grantees to select for oversight. However, if EPA used a  statistical approach to grantee selection, it could then project the results of  the reviews to all EPA grantees. Since EPA did not use such a sampling  plan in conducting its 2002 reviews, neither EPA nor we could use data  from these reviews to determine the overall compliance of grantees.  Furthermore, without a statistical approach, EPA cannot determine  whether 5, 10, or any other percentage, adequately provides it with a  comprehensive assessment of its grantees.", "Second, EPA does not have a standard reporting format to ensure  consistency and clarity in reporting review results. Review results include  such items as problems identified and corrective actions required to  address these problems. As we found in our analysis of the 2002 in-depth  reviews, EPA officials across the agency report in various formats that do  not always clearly present the results of the review.   For example, some  EPA officials provided a narrative report on the results of their reviews,  while others completed a protocol that they used in conducting their  review. We found 349 instances where the project officer or grants  management specialist did not clearly explain whether he or she had  discovered a problem or not.", "Finally, EPA did not develop data elements for its grantee compliance  database or a plan for using that data to identify and act on systemic  problems. We found that valuable information could be collected from the  2002 in-depth reviews for assessing such issues as the (1) types of grantees  having problems, (2) types of problem areas needing further attention, (3)  types of reviews\u2014on-site or off-site\u2014that provide the best insights into  certain problems areas, and (4) corrective actions required or  recommended to resolve problems.", "With such information, EPA could, over time, identify problem areas and  develop trends to assess the effectiveness of corrective actions in order to  better target its oversight efforts. In particular, according to our analysis of  EPA\u2019s 2002 in-depth reviews, administrative reviews identify more  problems when conducted on site, while the number of problems identified  by programmatic reviews does not differ by on-site or off-site reviews. (See  table 10 in app. III.) However, nearly half of the programmatic reviews,  which constituted more than 80 percent of the 2002 reviews, were  conducted on site. (See table 5 in app. III.) Since on-site reviews are  resource intensive because of travel costs and staff used, a systematic  analysis could enable EPA to better target its resources. Similarly, EPA  could incorporate other information into its grantee compliance database,  such as Inspector General reports, to identify problem areas, and target  oversight resources. In addition, EPA could use the database to track the  resolution of problems.", "The weaknesses in the policies are compounded by the fact that EPA did  not always effectively implement its oversight policies. Specifically, EPA  used its database to collect and store in-depth reviews, but not all EPA  offices were required under the policies to enter the results of their reviews  into the database, and not all of the offices required to enter information  into the database did so. Moreover, EPA officials acknowledged the agency  did not have an effective method to verify the number of in-depth reviews it  reported to Congress. We found that our total number of in-depth  reviews\u20141,232\u2014was about the same as EPA\u2019s total\u20141,208\u2014but we found  discrepancies, on an office-by-office basis, in the number of reviews  conducted. (See table 6 in app. III.) For example, in one office we identified  176 more reviews than EPA did, and in another office we identified 76  fewer reviews than EPA did. Finally, we found that EPA\u2019s in-depth reviews  did not always indicate whether these reviews had used a protocol. For  example, in 294 of the 893 nonmandated reviews, it was unclear whether  the grants specialist or project officer used a protocol. (See tables 14 and  15 in app. III.)", "The Inspector General has also reported on problems with EPA\u2019s  implementation of its actions to address oversight problems. In 2002, the  Inspector General found, among other things, inconsistent performance of  monitoring responsibilities, inadequate preparation of monitoring plans,  and inadequate internal management reviews. For example, the Inspector  General found that EPA did not use the internal management reviews to  draw overall conclusions on the effectiveness of oversight and did not  quantify its review results. Furthermore, some senior resource officials did  not emphasize the importance of grants oversight. According to these  officials, the minimal control they have over the regional program offices\u2019  priorities contributes to problems in effective grants management  oversight. The Inspector General found that EPA lacked an official who is  clearly responsible for monitoring the regional program offices\u2019 priorities  for overseeing grants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Efforts to Address the Complex Problem of Measuring Environmental Results Have Not Consistently Ensured That Grantees Achieve Them", "paragraphs": ["Planning for grants to achieve environmental results\u2014and measuring  results\u2014is a difficult, complex challenge.

Output measures are inherently easier to develop  and report on than environmental results measures. In contrast, defensible  outcome measures are substantially more difficult to develop because of  the (1) absence of baseline data against which environmental  improvements can be measured, (2) inherent problems in quantifying  certain results, (3) difficulty of linking program activities with  environmental results because multiple conditions influence  environmental results, and (4) resources needed for measurement.", "Nonetheless, EPA has focused on grants\u2019 environmental results in its  partnership with the states under the National Environmental Performance  Partnership System. Under this system, states may enter into \u201cPerformance  Partnership Agreements\u201d with their EPA regional offices. The partners use  a common set of national environmental indicators (\u201ccore performance  measures\u201d). In developing these performance measures, EPA and state  officials have sought to move beyond counting the number of actions  conducted and toward environmental outcomes.", "However, EPA has awarded some discretionary grants before considering  how the results of the grantees\u2019 work would contribute to achieving  environmental results. In 2001, we reported that EPA program officials  treated EPA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives as a clerical tool for  categorizing grants after the funds were already awarded rather than as a  tool to guide grant selection, although the grants generally were aligned  with EPA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives. By assessing the relevance of  these grants to EPA\u2019s strategic plan after awarding the grant, EPA cannot  ensure that it is awarding grants that will best help it accomplish its  mission.", "EPA has also not developed environmental measures and outcomes for all  of its grant programs. In 2000, we reported that EPA did not have program  criteria to measure the effectiveness of its STAR program. Instead, EPA  focused on the procedures and processes for awarding grants. As a result,  EPA was uncertain about what the program was achieving. Similarly, OMB  recently evaluated four EPA grant programs to assess their effectiveness in  achieving and measuring results. According to this evaluation, these four  programs lacked outcome-based measures\u2014measures that demonstrated  the impact of the programs on improving human health and the  environment. It concluded that one of EPA\u2019s major challenges was  demonstrating program effectiveness in achieving public health and  environmental results. Furthermore, as we reported in 1999, the National  Environmental Performance Partnership System was hampered by the  technical problems we noted earlier, such as the absence of baseline data  against which environmental improvements could be measured.", "Finally, EPA often does not require grantees to submit work plans that  explain how a project will achieve measurable environmental results. The  grantee work plan should describe the project, its objectives, the method  the grantee will use to accomplish the objectives, and expected outcomes.  The project officer uses the work plan to evaluate performance under the  grant agreement. In 2002, EPA\u2019s Inspector General reported that EPA  approved some grantees\u2019 work plans without determining the projects\u2019  long-term human health and environmental outcomes. In fact, for almost  half of the 42 discretionary grants the Inspector General reviewed, EPA did  not even attempt to measure the projects\u2019 outcomes. Instead, EPA funded  grants on the basis of work plans that focused on short-term procedural  results, such as meetings or conferences. In some cases, it was unclear  what the grant had accomplished. In 2003, the Inspector General again  found the project officers had not negotiated environmental outcomes in  work plans. The Inspector General found that 42 percent of the grant work  plans reviewed\u2014both discretionary and nondiscretionary grants\u2014lacked  negotiated environmental outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Not Always Effectively Managed Its Grants Staff and Resources despite Some Past Efforts", "paragraphs": ["EPA has not always appropriately allocated the workload for staff  managing grants, provided them with adequate training, or held them  accountable.

Additionally, in one regional office, project officers and grant  specialists did not promptly provide required approvals for certain grants  management tasks, in part because their competing workloads prevented  them from processing approvals on time. Finally, in 2002, the Inspector  General reported that there was considerable uncertainty over the size of  the workload that grants specialists and project officers could manage  effectively.

According to EPA\u2019s  internal management reviews from 1997 through 2002, some staff managing  grants had not completed the basic training required to manage grants.  Other staff may have completed the basic training but need additional  training to refresh their skills or to become familiar with all of their grants  management responsibilities and requirements. For example, in some  instances, project officers were not familiar with the five key areas they  were to review when monitoring grantees, such as the financial aspects of a  grantee\u2019s performance. According to a senior EPA official, with such a  small percentage of some project officers spending time on grants  management duties, it is difficult for EPA to ensure that its 1,835 project  officers who are actively managing grants have the level of training they  need.", "Furthermore, the agency has not always held its staff\u2014such as project  officers\u2014accountable for fulfilling grants management responsibilities.  According to the Inspector General and internal management reviews, EPA  has not clearly defined project officers\u2019 grants management responsibilities  in their position descriptions and performance agreements. Without  specific standards for grants management in performance agreements, it is  difficult for EPA to hold staff accountable. It is, therefore, not surprising  that, according to the Inspector General, project officers faced no  consequences for failing to effectively perform grants management duties.  Compounding the problem, agency leadership has not always emphasized  the importance of project officers\u2019 grants management duties.", "It may be difficult to hold project officers accountable because many  project officers spend only a small proportion of their time managing  grants. For example, a recent EPA workload assessment noted that  approximately 35 percent of the agency\u2019s project officers manage only one  grant, instead devoting the bulk of their time to their scientific and  technical responsibilities.", "EPA has also not adequately managed its resources to support grant staff in  performing their duties. Some EPA internal management reviews noted a  lack of resource commitment\u2014time and money\u2014to conduct grant  management activities and develop staff.

While these steps were primarily designed to improve the  training of project officers, grants specialists also have received some  training, and EPA has recently pilot-tested a standard training course  specifically designed for them. EPA managers and staff have also received  other types of training to enhance grants management skills. For example,  EPA has piloted a 1-day course on grants management for managers and  supervisors. The Office of Grants and Debarment also provides training on  specific aspects of grants management\u2014such as postaward monitoring\u2014 as requested by program or regional offices.

In 2002, EPA\u2019s  Inspector General reported that the agency did not have adequate internal  controls in place to ensure that project officers complied with the training  requirements.

In particular,  while offices can request specific training from the Office of Grants and  Debarment, EPA does not have a process to ensure that all staff receive the  training needed to implement new policies and regulatory requirements in  a timely manner. For instance, when EPA issued new post-award  monitoring policies to improve its grants oversight, project officers did not  receive training on these new requirements unless their program or  regional office specifically requested that training or it was time for the  officers to take the refresher course. EPA also does not measure the impact  of its training programs by determining the baseline level of skills that  employees possess before taking training and determining what, if any,  skills have improved as a result of the training. Nor does EPA link its  training activities with improved performance on the job, especially in  targeted areas such as monitoring contacts with grantees and  documentation of files. As a result, EPA cannot hold either the trainers or  the trainees accountable for improving grants management skills and  performance.", "EPA has also taken steps to improve another critical resource\u2014its primary  data system for managing grants. In 1997, it began developing the  Integrated Grants Management System (IGMS), which, according to an  EPA official, will facilitate oversight by allowing electronic management  throughout the life of a grant. EPA is developing the system through a  series of modules (databases). EPA estimates that once IGMS becomes  fully operational, it will save roughly $1.6 million annually. EPA believes  IGMS could help resolve some of the long-standing problems in grants  management by implementing controls to prevent the submission of  certain documents without required elements and to provide electronic  reminders of when certain activities or documents are due. Additionally,  EPA designed the system to reduce the potential for data entry errors. In  2001, EPA began implementing the module for the application and award  phases of a grant. Using IGMS, EPA expects to electronically review the  grantee\u2019s application, prepare and review EPA\u2019s documents, and approve  the award. In April 2003, EPA began using IGMS\u2019 postaward module. This  module allows project officers to electronically enter project milestones  into the system, communicate with other staff involved in overseeing  grants, receive reports from grantees, and initiate closeout activities. EPA  expects that grants specialists and regional program staff will use IGMS to  electronically manage grants by September 2004 and headquarters program  staff by the end of 2006.", "Despite this promising development, the implementation period for IGMS  has been lengthy. This delay was due in part to Y2K concerns, the  complexity of the system for grants management, and the addition of other  major business processes into the system. Consequently, EPA has had to  plan a lengthy implementation schedule in order to ensure that it can  properly roll out the system to all of the programs and regions with its  available training and user-support resources.

The policy applies to most discretionary grant  programs or individual grants of more than $75,000. It exempts individual  grants only if they meet certain criteria, such as national security interests.  Exemptions require detailed, written justification and approval. The policy  also promotes widespread solicitation for competed grants by establishing  specific requirements for announcing funding opportunities in, for  example, the Federal Register and on Web sites.", "Because the competition policy represents a major change in the way EPA  awards discretionary grants, the agency created the position of a senior- level competition advocate for grants.

Once individual project  officers\u2019 performance standards are established for the approximately  1,800 project officers, strong support by managers at all levels, as well as  regular communication on performance expectations and feedback, will be  key to ensuring that staff with grants management duties successfully meet  their responsibilities.", "Although EPA\u2019s current performance management system can  accommodate development of performance standards tailored to each  project officer\u2019s specific grants management responsibilities, the current  system provides only two choices for measuring performance\u2014 satisfactory or unsatisfactory, which may make it difficult to make  meaningful distinctions in performance. Such an approach may not provide  enough meaningful information and dispersion in ratings to recognize and  reward top performers, help everyone attain their maximum potential, and  deal with poor performers.", "Furthermore, it is difficult to implement performance standards that will  hold project officers accountable for grants management because these  officers have a variety of responsibilities and some project officers manage  few grants, and because grants management responsibilities often fall into  the category of \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d To address this issue, EPA  officials are considering, among other options, whether the agency needs  to develop a smaller cadre of well-trained project officers to oversee  grantees, rather than rely on approximately 1,800 project officers with  different levels of grants management responsibilities and skills. Some EPA  officials believe that having a cadre may help the agency more effectively  implement revised grants management performance standards because  fewer officers with greater expertise would oversee a larger percentage of  the grants.", "EPA will also have difficulty achieving the plan\u2019s goals if all managers and  staff are not held accountable for grants management.

EPA\u2019s new policies and 5-year grants management plan  show promise, but they are missing several critical elements necessary for  the agency to address past grants management weaknesses. Specifically,  EPA\u2019s new oversight policy lacks (1) statistical methods to identify grantees  for review, (2) a standard reporting format to ensure consistency and  clarity in report results, and (3) a plan for integrating and analyzing  compliance information from multiple sources. These actions would help  EPA identify systemic problems with its grantees and better target its  oversight resources. EPA\u2019s plan does not adequately address the need to  assess grantees\u2019 progress towards achieving environmental outcomes. If  project officers tracked grantees\u2019 progress during in-depth reviews, they  would better help the agency manage grants for results. Finally, in our view,  EPA\u2019s plan does not go far enough to ensure that all managers and staff with  grant management responsibilities are held accountable for fulfilling their  grants management responsibilities. Until EPA holds all managers and staff  accountable for these responsibilities, it cannot be assured that it will  achieve the objectives of its grants management plan.", "EPA recognizes the importance of continuously improving its grants  management practices. To this end, we believe EPA could benefit from  considering the practical approaches successfully implemented by other  federal agencies and organizations. It could also benefit from using our  guide to establish effective training programs to develop relevant staff  skills and a performance management system to hold staff accountable for  using these skills to carry out their grants management responsibilities.", "Given EPA\u2019s uneven performance in improving its grants management, it is  too early to tell if its new policies and comprehensive 5-year grants  management plan will succeed more than past initiatives. While the plan  shows promise, we believe that congressional oversight is important to  ensure that EPA\u2019s Administrator, managers, and staff implement the plan in  a sustained, coordinated fashion to meet the plan\u2019s ambitious targets and  time frames.

Furthermore, to strengthen EPA\u2019s efforts  we recommend   incorporating appropriate statistical techniques in selecting grantees for   requiring EPA staff to use a standard reporting format for in-depth  reviews so that the results can be entered into the grant databases and  analyzed agencywide;   developing a plan, including modifications to the grantee compliance  database, to use data from its various oversight efforts\u2014in-depth  reviews, significant actions, corrective actions taken, and other  compliance information\u2014to fully identify systemic problems, inform  grants management officials of areas that need to be addressed, and  take corrective action as needed;      modifying its in-depth review protocols to include questions on the  status of grantees\u2019 progress in measuring and achieving environmental  outcomes;   incorporating accountability for grants management responsibilities  through performance standards that address grants management for all  managers and staff in headquarters and the regions responsible for  grants management and holding managers and staff accountable for  meeting these standards; and  evaluating the promising practices identified in this report and  implementing those that could potentially improve EPA grants  management.", "To better inform Congress about EPA\u2019s achievements in improving grants  management, we recommend that the Administrator of EPA report on the  agency\u2019s accomplishments in meeting the goals and objectives developed in  the grants management plan and other actions to improve grants  management, beginning with its 2003 annual report to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EPA for its review and comment.

To analyze the findings from these reviews, we  summarized the findings from each report and then grouped the findings  using the long-table method of analysis. From those groups, we identified  four broad grants management challenges. We next interviewed and  obtained documents from EPA officials to determine the actions they have  taken in the past to address these challenges. We also obtained the records  of 1,232 in-depth grantee reviews conducted in 2002 and analyzed each one  using a data collection instrument. We conducted inter-rater reliability tests  to ensure that information from in-depth reviews was entered consistently  by each reviewer. In the event a document item was unclear, reviewers  flagged the case and consulted to determine the appropriate response. We  requested that EPA send documents for all evaluative reviews conducted in  calendar year 2002. Since EPA does not have information on the exact  number of reviews it conducts each year, we were not able to verify  whether we received information on the total population of evaluative  reviews conducted in 2002. Because we could not verify the total number  of reviews conducted and because some regions and program offices  conduct a small number of reviews, we requested documents for all in- depth evaluative reviews in 2002 (rather than a sample) to ensure coverage  of all 10 regions and 10 program offices.", "To determine the extent to which EPA\u2019s recently issued policies and grants  management plan address these challenges, we reviewed the new policies  and plan and interviewed EPA officials responsible for implementing key  aspects of the plan.
