For fiscal year 2012, IRS requested about $2.67 billion for IT. Given the size and significance of these investments, GAO was asked to evaluate IRS's capabilities for managing its IT investments. To address this objective, GAO reviewed IRS policies and procedures and assessed them using GAO's IT investment management (ITIM) framework and associated methodology, focusing on the framework's stage relevant to building a foundation for investment management (Stage 2). GAO also interviewed officials responsible for IRS's investment management process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has established most of the foundational practices needed to manage its IT investments. Specifically, the agency has executed 30 of the 38 key practices identified by the ITIM framework as foundational for successful IT investment management, including all the practices needed to provide investment oversight and capture investment information. For example, IRS has defined and implemented a tiered governance structure to oversee its projects and has several mechanisms for the boards to regularly review IT investments' performance. The agency has also established procedures for identifying and collecting information about its investments to inform decision making. Despite these strengths, IRS can improve its investment management process in two key areas. First, IRS does not have an enterprisewide IT investment board with sufficient representation from IT and business units that is responsible for the entire investment management process, and as a result may not be optimizing its decision-making process. Specifically, project selection is carried out by a team of two senior executives representing IRS's deputy commissioners, rather than a larger body composed of representatives from both IT and business units, and as a result, the perspective and expertise represented are not as broad as they would be with a larger board. Further, because the responsibility for the select and control phases lies with different groups rather than a single body, results of one process are not used to inform decisions made in the other, as would happen with a single board responsible for implementing all phases of the investment management process. IRS stated that it plans to address this coordination issue. Second, IRS does not have a process, including defined criteria, for reselecting (i.e., deciding whether to continue funding) ongoing projects.

In particular, we have reported on  program management capabilities and controls that are critical to the  effective management of this program, such as cost and schedule  estimates, requirements development and management, and  postimplementation reviews of deployed projects. Accordingly, we  have made numerous recommendations aimed at strengthening these  controls and capabilities. Most recently, in our May 2010 review of the  Business Systems Modernization program, we reported that while IRS  had done much to define the phases of its Customer Account Data  Engine 2 strategy for managing individual taxpayer accounts, the  agency had not defined specific time frames for addressing key  planning activities for the second phase, including defining core  requirements. We recommended that IRS take several actions to  improve program management capabilities and controls, including  defining specific time frames for planning activities for the second  phase to guide progress. In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS  stated it would review the recommendations and provide a detailed  corrective action plan to address them. \uf0b7  As part of our annual audit of IRS\u2019s financial statements, we assess  the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s information security controls over its  key financial and tax processing systems, information, and  interconnected networks. In March 2011, we reported that although  IRS had made progress in correcting information security weaknesses  that we have reported previously, many weaknesses had not been  corrected, and we identified many new weaknesses during our audit  of its fiscal year 2010 financial statements. Specifically, 65 out of 88  previously reported weaknesses\u2014about 74 percent\u2014had not yet  been corrected. In addition, we identified 37 new weaknesses. These  weaknesses relate to access controls, configuration management,  and segregation of duties. Weaknesses in these areas increase the  likelihood of errors in financial data that result in misstatement and  expose sensitive information and systems to unauthorized use,  disclosure, modification, and loss. An underlying reason for these  weaknesses\u2014both old and new\u2014is that IRS has not yet fully  implemented key components of a comprehensive information  security program. These weaknesses continue to jeopardize the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the financial and sensitive  taxpayer information processed by IRS\u2019s systems and, considered  collectively, were the basis of our determination that IRS had a  material weakness in internal control over its financial reporting  related to information security in fiscal year 2010.", "In March 2011, we provided an update on IRS\u2019s implementation of its  Customer Account Data Engine 2 strategy for managing individual  taxpayer accounts, noting weaknesses in the agency\u2019s efforts to  improve the credibility of cost estimates and that IRS had not yet  finalized expected benefits or set related quantitative targets for the  second phase. We recommended that IRS (1) improve the credibility  of revised cost estimates by including all costs or provide a rationale  for excluding costs, and adjust costs for inflation, and (2) identify all of  the second phase benefits, set the related targets, and identify how  systems and business process might be affected.

The  process is intended to identify the specific business need an investment is  expected to address and determine its alignment with the IRS strategic  plan. Only investments that best support IRS\u2019s strategic plan and  priorities are to be promoted through the preselect process and progress  to the following phases. During this phase, a business owner prepares a  two-page business case summary that, among other things, documents  alignment with the agency priorities established by IRS\u2019s Senior  Executive Team. In addition, a preliminary economic analysis  accompanies the business case for each proposal. The Strategy and  Capital Planning office is to provide the ERT with an initial overview of the  submissions ensuring the data are complete and consistent with Senior  Executive Team priorities and the IRS strategic vision. The ERT is to  review these documents and determines whether the proposals can move  forward.", "The select phase is the process by which proposals approved during the  preselect phase are further reviewed by the ERT and selected for  inclusion in IRS\u2019s budget submission. Business cases are further  developed from the two-page summary that is prepared for the preselect  phase, to include added information such as three technical alternatives,  a risk analysis, and performance measures. A solution concept and cost  estimate document that further refines the investment proposal and  strengthens the business case is also developed. The investment  summary is to be provided to the Deputy Commissioners to be used to  determine which investments are to be considered for inclusion in the  agency\u2019s portfolio. The ERT makes recommendations based on an  investment\u2019s strategic value assessment, benefits, economic/risk  assessments, standards, performance measures, and major project  milestones and deliverables and works with the Deputy Commissioners to  reach consensus on the proposals to recommend for the agency\u2019s budget  submission, which then go to the Commissioner for final approval. The  investments selected by the Commissioner are forwarded to the  Department of the Treasury and then to OMB for funding approval. Once  IRS\u2019s budget appropriation is funded, the investments proceed to the  control phase.", "The purpose of the control phase is to provide oversight of projects that  have been selected or are already under way. Prior to entering the control  phase, an investment must have a developed project plan that includes  objectives, an acquisition plan, risk management plan, schedule,  deliverables, and projected/actual cost and benefits. Additionally the  investment must have established a governance board investment review  schedule and obtained governance approval to enter the control phase.  During the control phase, Organizational Level Governance Boards and  Management Level Governance Boards are to oversee nonmajor projects  within their respective areas of responsibility and lend support to the  ESCs. The ESCs serve as advisory boards to the MEG, IRS\u2019s highest- level governance board in overseeing IT projects. The ESCs are to  monitor and track the progress and performance of ongoing IT  investments against projected cost, schedule, and performance  measures, and against quantitative and qualitative measures delivered  through various mechanisms including health assessments, reviews of  corrective actions plans, and milestone exit reviews. Specifically, a  monthly health assessment is conducted to determine the extent to which  investments are being effectively managed by reviewing key indicators  such as cost and schedule. The health assessments are submitted to the  ESCs for review and used by project managers to manage the project. A  corrective action plan or baseline change request must be submitted and  approved by the appropriate governance boards for investments that vary  more than 10 percent from their original baseline in cost, schedule, or  scope. The S&CP\u2019s Investment Management Office works with the  project managers to validate all data used in investment reviews for  accuracy and completeness.", "During the control phase, the ESCs conduct milestone reviews to  determine whether an investment is ready to proceed to the next stage of  development. The IRS Chief Technology Officer is provided with  summary IT portfolio cost and schedule reports, which include information  on relevant performance measures. After an investment is deemed ready  for deployment based on the decision of the Chief Technology Officer and  governance bodies, it proceeds to the evaluate phase.", "The evaluate phase involves an annual process to determine the extent  to which a major IT investment has met its intended objectives and  yielded expected benefits. Once the investment has been implemented, it  should be continually monitored for performance, reliability, maintenance  activities, cost, resource allocation, defects, problems, and changes.  There are two subprocesses that are undertaken depending on the age  and life-cycle stage of the investment: the postimplementation review and  the operational analysis. Nonmajor investments are not required to  undergo either of these processes.  \uf0b7  A postimplementation review is done to identify an IT investment\u2019s  impact on mission performance, focusing on the investment\u2019s impact  on stakeholders and customers as well as its ability to deliver results  and meet baseline goals. It is intended to identify potential  improvements to IT project management practices and is performed  by completing an assessment that compares expected performance  goals established during the select phase with actual results, and to  identify lessons learned for both the investment and the investment  management process. The postimplementation review is required  annually for all major IT investments that (1) fully exited the  acquisition phase and moved into operations and maintenance in the  past 6-12 months, (2) implemented a major release or modification, or  (3) were retired or terminated during either development or  operations. Once the postimplementation review data have been  collected and reviewed, the project sponsor is to provide a formal  presentation to the Chief Technology Officer that summarizes the  investment evaluation as well as provide recommendations.  According to IRS, because of resource constraints,  postimplementation reviews are being performed only for Business  Systems Modernization projects. \uf0b7  An operational analysis is to be conducted once an investment or  meaningful project segment has moved into the operations and  maintenance stage and has had a postimplementation review  conducted. The purpose of an operational analysis is to identify  investments that are potential candidates for modification,  acceleration, replacement, or retirement. It is to be done by assessing  the ability of a mature system or application to continue meeting user  needs and performance goals based upon the performance of the  system relative to the cost of replacing the system. If the system is  determined to be a potential candidate for replacement or  modification, a business case will need to be developed in the  preselect phase. The operational analysis is to be performed  biannually for all major investments in operations and maintenance,  but not for any major investments already identified as requiring  replacement. If any changes to the investment\u2019s acquisition baseline  goals are required, the appropriate governance authority must  approve them. Project managers are to report the operational analysis  results on an annual basis as part of their budget submission. These  results may also be submitted as lessons learned back into the other  phases of the investment management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ITIM Maturity Framework", "paragraphs": ["To provide a method for evaluating and assessing how well an agency is  selecting and managing its IT resources, GAO developed the ITIM  framework. The ITIM framework is a maturity model composed of five  progressive stages of maturity that an agency can achieve in its  investment management capabilities. It was developed on the basis of  our research into the IT investment management practices of leading  private- and public-sector organizations. In each of the five stages, the  framework identifies critical processes for making successful IT  investments. The maturity stages are cumulative; that is, in order to attain  a higher stage, the agency must have institutionalized all of the critical  processes at the lower stages.", "The framework can be used to assess the maturity of an agency\u2019s  investment management processes and as a tool for organizational  improvement. The overriding purpose of the framework is to encourage  investment processes that increase business value and mission  performance, reduce risk, and increase accountability and transparency  in the decision process. We have used the framework in several of our  evaluations, and a number of agencies have adopted it. These agencies  have used ITIM for purposes ranging from self-assessment to the  redesign of their IT investment management processes.", "ITIM\u2019s five maturity stages represent steps toward achieving stable and  mature processes for managing IT investments. Each stage builds on the  lower stages; the successful attainment of each stage leads to  improvement in the organization\u2019s ability to manage its investments. With  the exception of the first stage, each maturity stage is composed of  critical processes that must be implemented and institutionalized in order  for the organization to achieve that stage. These critical processes are  further broken down into key practices that describe the types of activities  that an organization should be performing to successfully implement each  critical process. It is not unusual for an organization to be performing key  practices from more than one maturity stage at the same time, but efforts  to improve investment management capabilities should focus on  implementing all lower-stage practices before addressing higher-stage  practices.", "In the ITIM framework, Stage 2 critical processes lay the foundation for  sound IT investment processes by helping the agency to attain  successful, predictable, and repeatable investment control processes at  the project level. Specifically, Stage 2 encompasses building a sound  investment management foundation by establishing basic capabilities for  selecting new IT projects. It involves developing the capability to control  projects so that they finish predictably within established cost and  schedule expectations and having the capability to identify potential  exposures to risk and put in place strategies to mitigate that risk. It also  involves instituting an IT investment board, which includes defining its  membership, guidance policies, operations, roles, responsibilities, and  authorities for one or, if applicable, more IT investment boards within the  organization, and, if appropriate, each board\u2019s support staff. The basic  selection processes established in Stage 2 lay the foundation for more  mature selection capabilities in Stage 3, which represents a major step  forward in maturity, in which the agency moves from project-centric  processes to a portfolio approach, evaluating potential investments by  how well they support the agency\u2019s mission, strategies, and goals.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed  and ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options. It focuses on  establishing a consistent, well-defined perspective on the IT investment  portfolio and maintaining mature, integrated selection (and reselection),  control, and evaluation processes, which are to be evaluated during  postimplementation reviews. This portfolio perspective allows decision  makers to consider the interaction among investments and the  contributions to organizational mission goals and strategies that could be  made by alternative portfolio selections, rather than to focus exclusively  on the balance between the costs and benefits of individual investments.", "Stages 4 and 5 require the use of evaluation techniques to continuously  improve both the investment portfolio and the investment processes in  order to better achieve strategic outcomes. At Stage 4 maturity, an  organization has the capacity to conduct IT succession activities and,  therefore, can plan and implement the deselection of obsolete, high-risk,  or low-value IT investments. An organization with Stage 5 maturity  conducts proactive monitoring for breakthrough information technologies  that will enable it to change and improve its business performance.

The organization  selects board members who are knowledgeable about policies and  procedures for managing investments. Organizations at the Stage 2 level  of maturity also take steps to ensure that executives and line managers  support and carry out the decisions of the investment board.

Specifically,  the select phase is primarily carried out by two senior executives (the  Executive Review Team), working with several individuals, rather than a  larger body composed of representatives from IRS\u2019s IT and business  units, and as a result, the perspective and expertise represented are not  as broad as they would be with a larger board. Further, the responsibility  for the select and control phases lies with two different groups rather than  a single body, and it is not clear whether or how these groups are  coordinating to ensure that the results of one phase are used to inform  decisions made in the other, as would happen with a single board  responsible for implementing all phases of the investment management  process.

In addition, the Associate  Chief Information Officer for Strategy and Planning stated that \u201ctouch- points\u201d between the investment management phases would be included  in the investment management guidance that is expected to be updated  by the end of the fiscal year. However, until IRS takes these actions and  provides for broader business and IT representation among the groups  responsible for carrying out the selection phase, it will have less  assurance that its decision-making process is being optimized.", "Table 4 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for instituting the investment board at the Stage 2 level of  maturity and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "Defining business needs for each IT project helps to ensure that projects  and systems support an organization\u2019s business needs and meet users\u2019  needs. This critical process ensures that an organization\u2019s business  objectives and its IT management strategy are linked. According to the  ITIM, effectively meeting business needs requires, among other things,  (1) documenting business needs with stated goals and objectives, (2)  identifying specific users and other beneficiaries of IT projects and  systems, (3) providing adequate resources to ensure that projects and  systems support the organization\u2019s business needs and meet users\u2019  needs, and (4) periodically evaluating the alignment of IT projects and  systems with the organization\u2019s strategic goals and objectives. (The  complete list of key practices is provided in table 5.)", "IRS has executed five of the seven key practices for ensuring business  needs are met. Specifically, IRS has documented its business mission,  with stated goals and objectives, in its IRS Strategic Plan for fiscal years  2009-2013. In addition, resources are devoted to ensuring that IT projects  and systems support the organization\u2019s business needs and meet users\u2019  needs, including a portfolio management tool, several investment support  groups, and a business case template in which new project proposals are  required to show alignment with strategic goals and Senior Executive  Team priorities.", "Further, IRS defines and documents business needs for both proposed  and ongoing IT projects in its portfolio management tool. In addition,  IRS\u2019s enterprise life-cycle guidance calls for users to participate in project  management throughout each project\u2019s life cycle. For the four projects we  reviewed, we verified that business needs and specific users and other  beneficiaries were identified and documented in the portfolio  management tool. In addition, we verified that users are involved in  project management throughout the life cycle of the projects.", "Finally, IRS has several processes for defining and documenting  business needs for proposed and ongoing projects and systems,  including the preselect process in which proposed investments are  aligned with the Senior Executive Team priorities that reflect strategic  goals and objectives and the annual update of IRS\u2019s Enterprise Transition  Plan. This document, which provides a 3- to 5-year road map for  deploying IT investments, among other things, aligns investments with  IRS\u2019s business domains (i.e., functions). Last year, IRS also initiated a  Business-Technology Alignment initiative to align business units\u2019 strategic  focus areas with key technologies. We verified that the four projects we  reviewed were aligned with strategic goals and objectives.", "However, while IRS has documented procedures for ensuring that IT  projects and systems support IRS\u2019s business needs, these procedures do  not address actions to be taken when ongoing projects no longer support  business needs. In addition, while IRS stated that proposed projects that  do not align with the Senior Executive Team priorities are not accepted,  the agency did not describe a process for taking corrective actions when  ongoing projects are not aligned with business needs or provide  supporting examples. Until IRS performs all the key practices associated  with the Meeting Business Needs critical process, it will have less  assurance that it is investing in only those projects that are needed to  meet the agency\u2019s business needs.", "Table 5 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for meeting business needs at the Stage 2 level of  maturity and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "Selecting new IT proposals and reselecting ongoing investments require  a well-defined and disciplined process to provide the agency\u2019s investment  boards, business units, and developers with a common understanding of  the process and the cost, benefit, schedule, and risk criteria that will be  used both to select new projects and to reselect ongoing projects for  continued funding. According to the ITIM, this critical process requires,  among other things, (1) providing adequate resources for investment  selection activities, (2) making funding decisions for new proposals  according to an established process, and (3) using a defined selection  process to select new investments and reselect ongoing investments.  (The complete list of key practices is provided in table 6.)", "IRS has executed 6 of the 10 key practices associated with selecting an  investment. The agency has aligned its funding decisions with its  selection process for new and ongoing investments by having the  Financial Management Services group issue guidance that integrates the  funding initiatives with the investment selection process. IRS\u2019s portfolio  management tool contains forms for entering information related to the  select phase. We verified that the four systems we reviewed\u2014the  Integrated Customer Communication Environment system, the Integration  Collection System, the Integrated Data Retrieval System, and the  Security Audit and Analysis System\u2014used the forms in the portfolio  management tool for entering select data. IRS has also documented  criteria for analyzing, prioritizing, and selecting new investments in its  capital planning guide that address its strategic goals.", "However, weaknesses remain in the organization\u2019s ability to select  investments. Although IRS has documentation that addresses the  investment selection process, the guidance does not fully document the  current process being used. For example, the guidance does not specify  the roles and responsibilities of the ERT that has been involved in the  selection process over the last 2 years. As previously noted, IRS  recognizes this shortcoming in its documentation and stated that it plans  to address it by the end of the fiscal year. Until IRS has documented  policies and procedures that reflect the current process for selecting new  investments, there is a risk that projects will not be selected in a  consistent manner and IRS will not have the transparency that is needed  to increase effectiveness.", "In addition, IRS has not established a process, including supporting  criteria, for analyzing, prioritizing, and reselecting ongoing investments.  MITS senior managers are expected to use a series of questions to  evaluate their continued need for IT investments\u2014in particular those in  operations and maintenance\u2014however, these questions are more  focused on identifying savings and efficiencies than on evaluating the  need for continued funding. Examples of these questions include the  following: (1) Is there a less expensive option to provide maintenance  support? (2) Can multiple project resources be combined to reduce  costs? Until IRS establishes a process including criteria for reselecting  investments, it will not be adequately assured that it is objectively  continuing to fund the right projects. Considering that investments in  operations and maintenance represent $1.88 billion, or 70 percent of  IRS\u2019s total IT budget request of $2.67 billion for fiscal year 2012, IRS  could be funding millions of dollars in investments that are no longer  needed and which could be made available for investments that better  support the agency\u2019s needs.", "Table 6 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for selecting an investment at the Stage 2 level of maturity  and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "An organization should effectively oversee its IT projects throughout all  phases of their life cycles. An investment board should observe each  project\u2019s performance and progress toward predefined cost and schedule  expectations as well as each project\u2019s anticipated benefits and risk  exposure. This does not mean that a departmental board should  micromanage each project to provide effective oversight; rather, it means  that the departmental board should be actively involved in all IT  investments and proposals that are high cost or high risk or have  significant scope and duration and, at a minimum, should have a  mechanism for maintaining visibility of other investments. The board  should also employ early-warning systems that enable it to take corrective  actions at the first sign of cost, schedule, and performance slippages.  According to the ITIM, effective project oversight requires, among other  things, (1) having written policies and procedures for management  oversight; (2) developing and maintaining an approved management plan  for each IT project; (3) making up-to-date cost and schedule data for each  project available to the oversight boards; (4) having regular reviews by  each investment board of each project\u2019s performance against stated  expectations; and (5) ensuring that corrective actions for each  underperforming project are documented, agreed to, implemented, and  tracked until the desired outcome is achieved. (The complete list of key  practices is provided in table 7.)", "IRS has executed all seven key practices associated with effective project  oversight. The agency has developed written policies and procedures for  management oversight of its investments. These include (1) a tiered  escalation guide that outlines the process for elevating a project to a  higher level of control or governance for review, mitigation, and resolution  when resolution cannot be reached at a project\u2019s respective level of  control or governance, and (2) written procedures and a template for  conducting milestone exit reviews to assess a project\u2019s readiness for  moving to the next phase of its life cycle or exiting a milestone.", "In addition, the agency has adequate resources for overseeing IT projects  that lend support to the MEG, IRS\u2019s highest governance board for  overseeing projects during the control phase. To support the MEG, IRS  has lower-level governance bodies\u2014ESCs, Organizational Level  Governance Boards, and Management Level Governance Boards\u2014for  overseeing the agency\u2019s IT investments. For example, each quarter, the  ESC cochairs review projects that are experiencing significant cost  variances and schedule slippages. The agency also maintains an  automated system for tracking project action items assigned during  governance board meetings until mitigated. IRS also requires project  management plans that document cost, schedule, benefit, and risk  expectations. We verified that these project management plans were  developed for the four projects we reviewed.", "Table 7 shows the rating for each key practice required to provide  investment oversight and summarizes the evidence that supports these  ratings.", "To make informed decisions regarding IT investments, an organization  must be able to acquire, store, and retrieve pertinent information about  each investment. During this critical process, the organization identifies its  IT assets and uses a comprehensive repository to store pertinent  investment information. This repository of IT investment information is  used to track the organization\u2019s IT resources to provide insights and  trends about major IT cost and management drivers. The information in  the repository serves to highlight lessons learned and to support current  and future investment decisions. According to the ITIM framework,  effectively capturing investment information requires, among other things,  (1) developing documented policies and procedures for identifying and  collecting information about IT projects and systems to support the  investment management process, (2) assigning an official with  responsibility for ensuring that the investment information collected meets  the needs of the investment management process, (3) collecting and  retaining easily accessible relevant investment information relating to  identified IT investments, and (4) ensuring that information repositories  are used by decision makers to support investment management and  related decisions.", "IRS has executed all six practices associated with capturing investment  information. For example, according to IRS officials, the Chief Technology  Officer is responsible for ensuring that collected investment information  meets the needs of the investment management process. Also, the  agency has adequate resources for supporting the process, including the  Investment Planning and Selection Office, the Estimation Program Office,  and the Investment Management Office, which work together in the  development and compilation of relevant investment information.  Additionally, IRS has a number of tools to identify and collect investment  information, including a portfolio management tool and project and action  item tracking systems. Captured investment information is easily  accessible to decision makers through reports generated by IRS\u2019s  portfolio management tool, quarterly briefings, and monthly health  assessments that use six key performance indicators to determine an  investment\u2019s status.", "Table 8 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement this  Stage 2 critical process and summarizes the evidence that supports these  ratings.", "Once an agency has attained Stage 2 maturity, it needs to implement  critical processes for managing its investments as a portfolio (Stage 3).  Such capabilities enable an agency to consider its investments  comprehensively, so that collectively the investments optimally address  the organization\u2019s mission, strategic goals, and objectives. Managing IT  investments as a portfolio also allows an organization to determine its  priorities and make decisions about which projects to fund and continue  to fund based on analyses of the relative organizational value and risks of  all projects, including projects that are proposed, under development, and  in operation. Although investments may initially be organized into  subordinate portfolios\u2014based on, for example, business lines or life-cycle  stages\u2014and managed by subordinate investment boards, they should  ultimately be aggregated into this enterprise-level portfolio. According to  the ITIM framework, Stage 3 maturity includes (1) defining the portfolio  criteria, (2) creating the portfolio, (3) evaluating the portfolio, and (4)  conducting postimplementation reviews.", "During our review, we noted activities the agency had performed to  manage its investments as a portfolio. For example, under the critical  process for creating the portfolio, the agency provided evidence that it  was capturing and maintaining investment information for future reference  and that it had developed an Enterprise Portfolio and Sequencing Plan to  guide its IT investments. IRS also has begun addressing the critical  process for conducting postimplementation reviews. The agency has  developed guidance that (1) specifies that the review should be  conducted 6-12 months after a project\u2019s deployment, (2) defines roles and  responsibilities for conducting the review, and (3) identifies templates for  supporting the process. IRS provided examples of the results of two such  reviews. According to IRS officials, the agency has not concentrated on  implementing Stage 3 key practices because the agency has focused its  resources on establishing the Stage 2 practices associated with building  the IT investment management foundation. Full implantation of the Stage  3 critical processes associated with portfolio management will provide  IRS with the capability to determine whether it is selecting the mix of  products that best meet the agency\u2019s mission needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of IT to IRS\u2019s mission, it is critical that the agency  adopt an effective institutional approach to IT investment management.  To its credit, IRS has implemented most of the key practices for such an  approach, laying the groundwork for greater maturity.

This should provide greater assurance that projects\u2019 progress  in meeting cost, schedule, risk, and benefit expectations is tracked and  that corrective actions are taken when these expectations are not being  met.", "However, IRS has yet to fully document its investment management  process, which increases the risk that the process will not be  implemented consistently or institutionalized. In addition, because of the  Executive Review Team\u2019s composition and the manner in which  responsibilities for the select and control phases are assigned, IRS may  not be optimizing its investment decision-making process. Finally, IRS  has not established a structured process, including supporting criteria, for  reselecting these projects.

A key practice was rated as \u201cnot executed\u201d when we found  insufficient evidence of a practice during the review or when we  determined that there were significant weaknesses in IRS\u2019s execution of  the key practice. In addition, IRS was provided with the opportunity to  produce evidence for key practices rated as not executed.

The four projects are described  below:  \uf0b7  The Integrated Collection System is a major information system within  IRS\u2019s filing and payment compliance business domain that is to  improve revenue collections by providing electronic case processing  to revenue officers and their managers. The Integration Collection  System is to enable field revenue officers access to the most current  taxpayer information using laptop computers for quicker case  resolution and improved customer service. The system has  investments in development and operations and maintenance. It is a  major system and had a fiscal year 2010 cost of approximately $9.1  million. \uf0b7  The Integrated Customer Communication Environment, within the  customer service business domain, is to support issue resolution by  providing taxpayers with fast and efficient access to the information  they need for pre- and postfiling. These applications use voice  response, Internet, and other computer technology to provide quick,  accurate, and convenient service to taxpayers 24 hours a day in real  time. The system has investments in development and operations and  maintenance. It is a major system and had a fiscal year 2010 cost of  approximately $16.6 million. \uf0b7  The Integrated Data Retrieval System is a mission-critical system  within IRS\u2019s managing taxpayer accounts business domain, consisting  of databases and operating programs that support IRS employees  working active tax cases within each business function across the  entire IRS. This system manages data that have been retrieved from  the Tax Master Files, allowing IRS employees to take specific actions  on taxpayer account issues, track status, and post transaction  updates back to the Master Files. The system has investments in  development and operations and maintenance. It is a major system  and had a fiscal year 2010 cost of approximately $19.6 million. \uf0b7  The Security Audit and Analysis System, within the security services  and privacy business domain, implements a data warehousing  solution to provide online analytical processing of audit trail data. The  system is to enable IRS to detect potential unauthorized accesses to  IRS systems and provide analysis capabilities and reporting on data  for all modernized and some current processing environment  applications. The system has investments in development and  operations and maintenance. It is a nonmajor investment and had a  fiscal year 2010 cost of approximately $1.6 million.", "For these four projects, we reviewed the portfolio management tool  documentation associated with each project and status reports.
