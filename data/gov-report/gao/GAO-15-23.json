As of August 2014, 77 percent (164 of the 214) of eligible tribes had retained their implementation authority. Tribes that lacked the resources, among other factors, to implement SORNA either delegated their own authority, or the SMART Office delegated the tribe's authority, to a state. According to the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART Office)\u2014the office SORNA established within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to administer and assist jurisdictions with implementing the law\u201443 percent (71 of 164) of tribes that retained their authority to implement SORNA have substantially implemented the act; the SMART Office has not yet made a final determination on 43 percent (70 of 164); and 13 percent (22 of 164) have not submitted complete packages. The SMART Office determined that 1 tribe has not yet substantially implemented SORNA.", "In GAO's survey of tribes that retained their authority, the four most frequently reported implementation challenges included inability to submit convicted sex offender information to federal databases, lack of notification from state prisons upon the release of sex offenders, lack of staff, and inability to cover the costs of SORNA implementation. Federal agencies have taken steps to address these challenges, but more could be done. For example, DOJ and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Department of the Interior (Interior) have formed a working group to better coordinate federal efforts to address tribes' difficulties submitting convicted sex offender information to federal databases. However, some states have not notified tribes\u2014those that retained their SORNA authority, as well as ineligible and delegated tribes\u2014when sex offenders who will be or have been released from state prison register with the state and indicate that they intend to live, work or attend school on tribal land, as SORNA requires; and while the SMART Office has taken some actions, more could be done to encourage states to provide notification to tribes. Such notification would help tribes identify and monitor sex offenders who live on their lands and enforce tribal laws pertaining to sex offenders. The SMART Office, U.S. Marshals Service, and BIA provided financial assistance, equipment, and staff to help tribes address their resource needs. However, BIA offered assistance only to tribes for which BIA provides direct law enforcement services, which account for only 20 percent of the tribes that retained their SORNA implementation authority, even though BIA is responsible for assisting and advising all federally recognized tribes regarding their law enforcement and public safety needs. Taking steps to ascertain what, if any, resource or other needs all tribes that retained their authority may have could better position BIA to support the tribes' efforts to implement the act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, the SMART Office encourage states to notify tribes about offenders who plan to live, work, or attend school on tribal land upon release from prison.

According to DOJ,  tribal nations are disproportionately affected by violent crime, particularly  violent crime against women. Starting in 1994, Congress passed several  laws that required states to establish sex offender registries\u2014which are  systems that enable law enforcement officials to monitor convicted sex  offenders who live in the state, and to establish notification systems to  alert the public about these offenders. Since these sex offender  registration and notification laws applied only to states and territories,  there were public safety concerns that convicted sex offenders would  move to tribal lands to avoid registration. To protect the public, including  tribal nations, from sex offenders, in 2006, Congress passed the Sex  Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) as Title I of the Adam  Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Adam Walsh Act). SORNA  sought to introduce comprehensive standards to make state and territory  sex offender registration systems more uniform. It also provided certain  tribes the opportunity to create sex offender registration and notification  systems where, for most tribes, these systems did not previously exist.  The initial statutory deadline for implementing SORNA was July 2009\u20143  years after the Adam Walsh Act was enacted. However, given that none  of the jurisdictions had substantially implemented SORNA by the original  deadline, the Attorney General exercised his authority under SORNA to  authorize two 1-year extensions of the deadline to July 2011.", "SORNA establishes that federally recognized tribes, with the exception of  those tribes that are subject to the criminal jurisdiction of a state, under a  specific federal statute, are eligible to implement the act.  SORNA grants  authority to the states where ineligible tribes are located to implement the  act on behalf of these tribes. In 2013, we reported that 19 of 56 states  and territories had substantially implemented SORNA.majority of nonimplemented jurisdictions reported that generating the  political will to incorporate the necessary changes to their state laws and  related policies or reconciling legal conflicts between SORNA and state  laws were among the greatest challenges to implementation. Since our  2013 report, the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring,  Apprehension, Registering, and Tracking (SMART Office)\u2014the office  responsible for administering the standards for SORNA implementation\u2014 has determined that 1 additional state has substantially implemented  SORNA.", "We noted that a  Recognizing that tribes may vary in their capacities for discharging the  sex offender registration and notification functions, SORNA made special  provisions for eligible tribes to elect either to act as registration  jurisdictions or to delegate their registration and notification functions to  the states. SORNA requires delegation for tribes subject to state criminal  jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162, tribes that do not elect to  implement SORNA, and tribes that the Attorney General determines have  not substantially implemented the act and are not likely to become  capable of doing so within a reasonable amount of time.", "Considering the unique circumstances tribes face with eligibility and  capability to implement the act, you asked us to assess the status of  tribes\u2019 efforts to implement SORNA and the challenges they face with  implementation. Specifically, this report addresses the following  questions:", "To what extent have eligible tribes retained their authority to  implement SORNA, and for those that did, what is their  implementation status?", "What implementation challenges, if any, have tribes that retained their  authority to implement SORNA reported, and what steps have federal  agencies and others taken or could they take to address these  challenges?", "To what extent are states incorporating ineligible and delegated tribes  into their state sex offender registration and notification systems?", "To address our first objective, we reviewed the SMART Office\u2019s data of  eligible tribes\u2019 implementation status as of August 2014 to identify (1)  tribes that have retained their authority to implement SORNA, (2) tribes  that have delegated their implementation authority to a state, and (3)  tribes whose implementation authority the SMART Office delegated to a  state. To address the reliability of the SMART Office\u2019s data on tribes\u2019  implementation status, among other steps, we obtained written responses  to our questions on how SMART Office representatives who use and  maintain the data ensure the data\u2019s reliability. We found the data  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of identifying tribes\u2019 SORNA  implementation status. In addition, we surveyed the SORNA points of  contact for each of the tribes that retained their authority to implement  SORNA to obtain more detailed information on these tribes\u2019  implementation status.

To  determine if any additional actions could address such challenges, we  compared our survey results against SORNA provisions as well as the  National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification  (National Guidelines).", "To address our third objective, we interviewed state SORNA and sex  offender registry officials from all 6 states where ineligible tribes are  located as well as 8 ineligible tribes\u2014at least 1 each from the 6 states.  We selected the tribes based on whether they submitted a resolution to  implement SORNA in spite of their ineligibility, and the challenges the  states in which the tribes are located reportedly faced with SORNA  implementation. The information from these interviews enabled us to determine if these states include the ineligible tribes in their state SORNA  registration and notification systems, as SORNA requires, as well as to  identify the challenges, if any, the states and tribes face with having the  states implement SORNA on the tribes\u2019 behalf. We also interviewed tribal  leaders from 4 delegated tribes that opted out or were delegated by the  SMART Office, and solicited perspectives of sex offender registry officials  in the 15 states to which tribes\u2019 SORNA authority has been delegated.", "To supplement the information we received from our interviews as well as  our survey of tribes that retained their authority, we interviewed officials  from three relevant national associations: the National Congress of  American Indians, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and  the National Criminal Justice Association, to obtain their perspectives on  the challenges that tribes face with implementation, and the actions that  the SMART Office and others have taken to address these challenges.

Further, the standards require these  offenders to register and keep the registration current in the jurisdictions  in which they live, work, and attend school. SORNA implementing  jurisdictions are to maintain a jurisdiction-wide sex offender registry and  website and adopt registration requirements that are at least as strict as  those SORNA established. Convicted sex offenders are required to  continue to update or verify their registration information, the duration and  frequency of which depends on the seriousness of the crimes they  committed. For example, SORNA requires a lifetime registration for  convicted offenses in the most serious class such as aggravated sexual  abuse (tier III), a 25-year registration for many felony sex offenses or  sexual exploitation crimes with minors (tier II), and a 15-year registration  for convicted offenses that do not support a higher classification such as  possession of child pornography (tier I).

The officer can also enforce  any requirements that the officer\u2019s jurisdiction may have with regard to  convicted sex offenders. For example, according to tribal officials, some  tribal jurisdictions banish convicted sex offenders from their lands or  prohibit offenders from living or working within proximity to schools or day  care centers.", "Federal and state, as well as local, law enforcement agencies have  undertaken efforts to help address such barriers, although the efforts  have some limitations, as discussed below.", "Memorandums of agreement (MOA).

However, the DOJ and BIA officials  and representatives from the National Criminal Justice Association and  the National Congress of American Indians that we interviewed noted that  not all tribes have good relationships with state or local law enforcement  agencies, and that these agencies may not be willing to assist the tribes.  In addition, according to DOJ, tribal, and local law enforcement officials,  when another law enforcement agency enters information into NSOR on  behalf of a tribe, the information is often not associated with the tribe  because state or local law enforcement agencies frequently use their own  Originating Agency Identifier number (ORI), as opposed to the tribe\u2019s  number, in NSOR. As a result, the convicted sex offender appears in  NSOR as having registered with the entity that submitted the information  as opposed to the tribe.", "Representatives we interviewed from the SMART Office and CJIS, as  well as local and tribal law enforcement, stated that these data entry  practices can also lead to imprecise data in NSOR. For example, at our  request, CJIS identified 22 tribes as having a total of 247 registered sex  offenders in NSOR. However, 120 of 129 tribes that responded to our  survey reported that they had a total of 2,167 registered sex offenders on  their lands. According to CJIS officials, this discrepancy should not pose a  public safety threat because an officer querying an individual in NCIC will  know immediately if the individual is a convicted sex offender. Further,  CJIS and USMS officials said that the FBI and USMS generally do not  use NSOR as their primary source for informing decisions, such as  funding or resource allocation for sex offender related operations.", "Collaboration to remove state barriers to tribes\u2019 NCIC access. The  SMART Office has collaborated with state and tribal officials in three  states to successfully address state policies preventing tribes in these  states from submitting information to NSOR through the state criminal  justice database. SMART Office representatives told us that until recently,  tribes in Arizona and Washington were unable to submit convicted sex  offender information to NSOR because of various state statutes or  policies. SMART Office representatives reportedly worked closely with  state and tribal officials to provide alternative conduits that will allow tribes  to submit convicted sex offender information directly to NSOR. SMART  Office representatives also reported that they have tried to persuade  officials in at least 2 other states to implement similar solutions, but  without success.", "Justice Telecommunications System (JUST).

First, 1 state has  determined that tribal law enforcement agencies do not meet the state\u2019s  definition of a law enforcement agency, in which case the state would not  provide this notice. Second, in the absence of state laws or policies to  notify tribes, some states let the counties decide on their own whether or  not to notify tribal law enforcement, but as we reported earlier in this  report, this could be a concern if the tribal and county law enforcement  officials do not have a good working relationship.", "With respect to the requirement that states notify schools and public  housing agencies, the National Guidelines indicate that it is potentially  challenging for states to proactively notify schools and public housing  agencies because of problems such as identifying comprehensive lists of  recipients and maintaining up-to-date contact information for each school  and public housing agency. For example, Oklahoma has approximately  1,800 public schools. SMART officials stated that California and Alaska,  which have the vast majority of ineligible tribes, might find it particularly  challenging. Therefore, the National Guidelines allow states to satisfy the  requirement to immediately notify schools and public housing agencies,  as well as other community and social service organizations, by posting  information on the state\u2019s sex offender public website within 3 days of the  offender\u2019s registration or update, provided that the website includes an  automatic notification function whereby requesters may receive e-mails  when new information pertaining to a ZIP code or geographic radius area  is available. However, this poses challenges. First, tribes can only  search by name, ZIP code, county, city or geographic radius, and as we  discussed previously, it would be difficult for the tribe to know whether a  convicted sex offender who lives within the same ZIP code as the tribe  actually lives on tribal land. Second, some states have opted not to  include all convicted sex offenders on their public websites, as SORNA  allows. For example, jurisdictions can exclude information about tier I  offenders whose victims were not minors.", "Also, with regard to tribes, an alternative to directly notifying the school or  public housing agency located on tribal land could be that the state notify  the tribal council or another entity that the tribe deems appropriate. Given  the relatively small number of tribes in most states, the number of tribes is  likely to be much lower than the number of public housing agencies and  schools, making it easier to obtain contact information on tribes and notify  them of released offenders. For example, Nevada has 673 public schools,  but only 11 delegated tribes, and is the state with the greatest number of  delegated tribes. States with ineligible tribes, however, may have a larger  number of tribes and find it more difficult to contact each tribe. For  example, Alaska and California in particular could find it difficult  considering that 226 and 108 ineligible tribes have territory in these  states, respectively.", "According to the SMART Office, it has taken steps to inform both  implementing and nonimplementing states about tribes whose authority  has been delegated to the state, and has provided states with points of  contact for these tribes. However, the SMART Office has not explicitly  advised states, as part of these efforts, to notify delegated tribes about  registered sex offenders who intend to live, work, or attend school on  tribal land upon release from state prison. Given that the SMART Office  conducts annual compliance reviews of implementing states and  conducts ongoing outreach to implementing as well as nonimplementing  states on a range of SORNA issues, the office is well positioned to  provide explicit guidance to states regarding the necessary steps to  implement SORNA\u2019s notification requirement for ineligible and delegated  tribes. Also, through its outreach and compliance reviews, the SMART  Office has the opportunity to consult with states on steps they can take to  overcome some of the barriers that make it difficult for states to provide  these notifications.

Several agencies provided assistance to help  tribes address these challenges, but according to tribes that responded to  our survey, additional assistance and communication, particularly from  BIA, would be beneficial.

Further, these actions would enhance DOJ\u2019s initiative to  increase public safety in tribal communities by providing the federal  support these communities need to overcome the unique law  enforcement challenges they face, which, as noted by the Attorney  General in his 2009 launching of the initiative, had resulted in  unacceptable rates of violence against women and children in tribal  communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that tribes that retained their SORNA implementation  authority, as well as ineligible and delegated tribes, are notified when  convicted sex offenders who intend to live, work, or attend school on tribal  land initially register or update a registration, we recommend that the  Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs direct the  SMART Office to take the following two actions:", "Amend its substantial implementation assurance guidance to require  its evaluators to determine whether substantially implemented states  are notifying tribes that retained their authority to implement SORNA,  as well as ineligible and delegated tribes, as required, and use this  information in the office\u2019s ongoing outreach to the states.", "Encourage implementing as well as nonimplementing states, as part  of the office\u2019s ongoing outreach to these states, to develop policies  and procedures to notify tribes that retained their authority to  implement SORNA, as well as ineligible and delegated tribes, about  convicted sex offenders who registered or updated a registration with  the state\u2014either prior or subsequent to their release from state  prison\u2014and indicated that they will be living, working, or attending  school on tribal lands.

DOI noted that the department  plans to send correspondence to each of these tribes to determine if the  tribes need BIA assistance with SORNA implementation and will provide  the necessary assistance to these tribes, considering the department\u2019s  authority, access, and resources. Further, DOI stated that it will reach out  to states and other entities outside of OJS\u2019s control that may be posing  challenges to tribes\u2019 ability to comply with SORNA. We believe that these  are beneficial steps that, once fully implemented, would address our  recommendation and help address resource or other needs that have  made it difficult for some tribes to substantially implement the act.", "In addition to taking actions to address our recommendation, DOI also  identified additional efforts that BIA OJS has under way to help ensure  tribes are able to implement SORNA. For example, BIA OJS has renewed  its relationship with the SMART Office so as to receive internal policy and  procedure updates, as well as training opportunities for OJS employees  on SORNA.", "DOJ agreed with our recommendation that the SMART Office amend its  substantial implementation assurance guidance to require its evaluators  to determine whether substantially implemented states are notifying tribes  that retained their authority to implement SORNA, as well as ineligible  and delegated tribes. The department also noted in its response that the  SMART Office will continue to propose individualized solutions for  jurisdictions with legislation or public policy practices that inhibit or  prohibit working with tribal law enforcement.", "DOJ also agreed with our recommendation to encourage implementing as  well as nonimplementing states to develop policies and procedures to  notify all tribes about sex offenders who would be living, working, or  attending school on tribal lands, either prior or subsequent to their release  from state prison. In its letter, DOJ noted that the SMART Office will  request in future substantial implementation reviews that states provide  information on how state incarceration facilities notify tribes when sex  offenders are released and have indicated that they will be living, working,  or attending school on tribal land. Accordingly, the SMART office will use  the information solicited from these reviews in its ongoing outreach to  implementing as well as nonimplementing states to help improve their  communication with tribes. DOJ stated that to the extent possible, the  department will encourage the sharing of sex offender information  through the SORNA Exchange Portal\u2014the tool that facilitates the  exchange of information about sex offenders moving to other SORNA  jurisdictions\u2014as well as through extensive outreach and education to  states on how they can use public notification to share information with  ineligible and delegated tribes that do not have access to this portal.

However, we noted in this report that at the time of our review, DOJ and  BIA had established a Tribal Public Safety Working Group to identify  which tribes lack access to federal databases and to work on the  appropriate solution based on the unique circumstances of each tribe.

We used  the survey to identify the implementation status of tribes that retained  their authority to implement SORNA; the challenges they face with  implementation; and the steps that tribes, as well as state, local, and  federal government entities, are taking or could take to address  implementation challenges. Additionally, we used the survey to obtain the  tribal officials\u2019 perspectives on the SMART Office\u2019s guidance and the  criteria it used to determine whether or not a jurisdiction has substantially  implemented SORNA. We collaborated closely with a GAO social science  survey specialist and conducted an expert review as well as pretests with  4 tribes that retained their authority to implement SORNA; doing so  helped us to develop and refine our survey questions, clarify any  ambiguous portions of the survey, and identify any potentially biased  questions. We launched our web-based survey on April 1, 2014, and  closed out the survey on June 30, 2014. Login information for the web-  These officials included tribal chiefs as well as  based survey was e-mailed to all participants, and we sent three follow-up  e-mail messages to all nonrespondents and contacted the remaining  nonrespondents by telephone. We received responses from 80 percent  (129 of 161) of all tribes surveyed. Not all survey respondents provided  answers to all survey questions. Because the survey was conducted with  all tribes that retained their authority to implement SORNA, there are no  sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce nonsampling errors. For example, differences in  how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of information  available to respondents, or the types of people who do not respond can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We included steps  in both the data collection and data analysis stages to minimize such  nonsampling errors. We also made multiple contact attempts with  nonrespondents during the survey by e-mail and telephone. Since this  was a web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into  the electronic questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a  database, minimizing error. We examined the survey results and  performed computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and other  indications of error. A second independent analyst checked the accuracy  of all computer analyses.", "To address our first objective, we also reviewed the SMART Office\u2019s data  on eligible tribes\u2019 implementation status to identify (1) tribes that have  retained their authority to implement SORNA, (2) tribes that have  delegated their implementation authority to a state, and (3) tribes whose  implementation authority was delegated to a state by the SMART Office.  To assess the reliability of the SMART Office\u2019s data on tribes\u2019  implementation status, we (1) obtained written responses to our questions  on how SMART Office representatives who use and maintain the data  ensure the data\u2019s reliability; (2) checked the data for missing information,  and obvious errors; and (3) compared the data regarding tribes\u2019  responses against our survey questions regarding their implementation  status and, where applicable, interviewed SMART Office officials to  determine the reason(s) for and resolve any differences. We found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of identifying tribes\u2019 SORNA  implementation status. We also used our survey to determine how long it  took tribes to prepare and submit a complete implementation package for  SMART Office review, the reasons why some tribes have not submitted a  complete package, and when the latter anticipate submitting a complete  package.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed Department of Justice  (DOJ) headquarters officials from the SMART Office, Office of Tribal  Justice (OTJ), U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), as well as Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officials  within the Department of the Interior, to determine the implementation  challenges tribes have reported and steps the agencies, the tribes, and  others have taken to address the challenges. In addition, we interviewed  FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) officials to  determine CJIS policies and procedures for granting tribes access to  federal criminal justice databases, which are required for SORNA  implementation. We also interviewed state, tribal, as well as local law  enforcement officials from 5 states\u2014Florida, Michigan, Nevada, New  York, and Oklahoma. We selected these 5 states because each contains  territory of tribes that retained their authority to implement SORNA and  because the states vary with regard to their SORNA implementation  status and geographic diversity. In each of the 5 states, we interviewed  CJIS System Agency (CSA) officials, the designated state SORNA  contact, or state sex offender registry officials to obtain information about  state laws, policies, and procedures for granting tribes access to federal  criminal justice databases. We also interviewed tribal leaders from 9  eligible tribes in these 5 states\u20145 of these tribes retained their authority  to implement SORNA. We selected the 9 tribes based on factors such as  the tribes\u2019 implementation status, whether the tribes are direct service  tribes, and whether the tribes have agreements for SORNA  implementation with any local law enforcement agencies, as well as the  challenges that the SMART Office and others reported that these tribes  face with implementation. In addition to the 5 states, we contacted  officials in 20 states to determine whether these states require their state  departments of corrections or registries to notify tribes that have retained  their authorities to implement SORNA upon releasing a sex offender who  plans to live, work or attend school on tribal lands. Officials from 15 of the  20 states responded to our request. These 15 states plus the 5 we visited  included states identified by tribes that responded to our survey as those  that do not notify tribes upon releasing sex offenders who plan to live,  work, or attend school on tribal lands, as well as states that have  substantially implemented SORNA and also have tribes that have  retained their authority to implement SORNA. Finally, we interviewed  officials from four local law enforcement agencies in proximity to the  selected tribes and with whom the tribes had an agreement for SORNA  implementation, as well as officials from the two BIA Office of Justice  Services (OJS) regional districts with the most direct service tribes that  are implementing SORNA to determine what, if any, assistance they have  provided the tribes with SORNA implementation.

We selected the tribes based on  their SORNA implementation status, whether they submitted a resolution  to implement SORNA in spite of their ineligibility, and the challenges the  tribes reportedly faced with SORNA implementation. We also  interviewed tribal leaders from 4 tribes that opted out of SORNA and  delegated their registration and notification functions to the state, and  solicited responses to written questions from sex offender registry officials  in the 15 states to which tribes\u2019 authority have been delegated, to  determine how states are incorporating delegated tribes into their state  sex offender registration and notification systems, as SORNA requires.", "To supplement the information we received from our interviews as well as  our survey of tribes that retained their SORNA authority, we interviewed  officials from three relevant national associations: the National Congress  of American Indians, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and  the National Criminal Justice Association, to obtain their perspectives on  SORNA eligibility criteria, the SMART Office\u2019s delegation criteria and  process, the challenges that tribes face with implementation, and the  actions that the SMART Office and others have taken to address these  challenges.
