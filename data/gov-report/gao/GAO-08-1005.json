This year's plans contain information on current overseas basing strategies and infrastructure requirements and the challenges that DOD faces implementing the plans. The plans also generally address GAO's recommendations except that the U.S. Pacific Command plan does not provide an update of the Air Force's training challenges in South Korea, despite GAO's prior recommendation that it should describe the challenges and their potential effects on infrastructure and funding requirements. DOD officials said that since last year the South Korean government and the U.S. Air Force have taken several steps to address these training challenges. According to DOD officials, efforts to incorporate last-minute changes in basing plans and projects and the lengthy review and approval process have contributed to the fiscal year 2009 plans' lateness. While the congressional requirement for the overseas master plans expired with the fiscal year 2009 plans, DOD said that it intends to provide Congress annual updates of its global defense posture through 2014 and that these updates would replace the master plans as DOD's overseas planning report to Congress. Since DOD will continue to provide annually updated global defense posture reports, it has an opportunity to reexamine its timeline for producing future reports earlier to provide Congress with time for review. DOD has developed a basic framework for the military buildup on Guam but has not issued the congressionally required master plan that was initially due in December 2006, and which Congress later extended to September 2008. The Joint Guam Program Office, which is planning and managing the proposed military buildup, is coordinating the multi-service development of a working-level plan for DOD that is to be submitted to Congress by the 2008 deadline. However, this is a onetime requirement, and DOD officials said that the plan will be a snapshot of the status of the planning process and will not be considered a comprehensive master plan for several reasons. First, while the required environmental impact statement and the resulting record of decision will influence many key decisions about the buildup of military forces and infrastructure on Guam, these documents are not expected to be completed until January 2010. Also, officials of the Joint Guam Program Office said that they expect to complete a comprehensive master plan within 90 days after these required documents are finalized. Second, plans for the detailed force composition of units relocating to Guam, associated facility requirements, and implications for other services' realignments on Guam continue to be refined. Third, additional time is needed to fully address the challenges related to funding uncertainties, operational requirements, and Guam's economic and infrastructure requirements. However, without a comprehensive master plan, Congress may have limited data on requirements on which to make informed appropriation decisions and to carry out its oversight responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In its ongoing global realignment of U.S. forces and installations, the  Department of Defense (DOD) plans to reduce the number of troops  permanently stationed overseas and consolidate overseas bases.

For example,  the command noted that the funding for this program has decreased from  an estimated $1 billion in 1993 to $242 million. U.S. Forces Japan  anticipates that the government of Japan will continue to reduce these  funds because of Japan\u2019s commitment to provide several other forms of  host nation support (i.e., utilities and Japanese labor force) and funding  for the U.S.-Japan Defense Policy Review Initiative under which the  Marine Corps forces are moving from Okinawa to Guam.

For the last 4 years, the overseas master plans have been an  important means for keeping Congress informed of the challenges DOD  faces and the costs associated with such efforts. However, DOD has  submitted the plans to the congressional defense committees months after  the annual budget submissions even though the congressional reporting  requirement directs that updates of the plans be provided with each yearly  budget submission. Recently, a congressional committee report expressed  concern about the department\u2019s frequent failure to comply with deadlines  for submitting mandated reports and reiterated the importance of  receiving the reports in a timely manner.

Because of the uncertainty in DOD\u2019s plans for the military  buildup, we continue to believe that this approach has merit and that the  defense committees would find annual updates of the Joint Guam Program  Office\u2019s working-level plan for Guam useful to inform congressional  decisions and ensure proper congressional oversight from September 2008  to the date on which the office completes its comprehensive master plan,  currently expected no sooner than 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To inform congressional decisions and ensure proper congressional  oversight, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  two actions:    Direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics to initiate a process of developing global defense posture  updates earlier each year so that DOD can provide the congressional  defense committees the overseas planning report with the administration\u2019s  annual budget submission.", "Direct the Executive Director of the Joint Guam Program Office to provide  the congressional defense committees with annual updates of the Guam  working-level plan until a comprehensive master plan is finalized and  submitted to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially agreed with  our recommendation to initiate a process of developing future overseas  master plans earlier each year so that DOD can provide them to the  congressional defense committees with the administration\u2019s annual budget  submission, and agreed with our recommendation to provide the  congressional defense committees with annual updates of the Guam  working-level plan until a comprehensive master plan is finalized and  submitted to Congress.

We  compared and contrasted the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 overseas master  plans in order to identify improvements and updated challenges in the  plans. We also assessed the quantity and quality of the data describing the  base categories, host nation funding levels, facility requirements and costs,  environmental remediation issues, and other issues affecting the  implementation of the plans. To discuss the reporting requirements, host  nation agreements and funding levels, U.S. funding levels and sources,  environmental remediation and restoration issues, property returns,  residual value, and training requirements, we met with officials from OSD;  U.S. Pacific Command; U.S. Army Pacific; U.S. Pacific Fleet; U.S. Marine  Forces Pacific; U.S. Pacific Air Forces; U.S. Forces Korea; U.S. Eighth  Army; Seventh Air Force; U.S. Naval Forces Korea; U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Far East District; U.S. Forces Japan; U.S. Army Japan; U.S. Air  Forces Japan; U.S. Naval Forces Japan; U.S. Marine Forces Japan; Naval  Facilities Engineering Command Far East, Japan; U.S. European  Command; U.S. Army Europe; U.S. Naval Forces Europe; U.S. Air Force  Europe; U.S. Central Command; and U.S. Special Operations Command.  We also analyzed available reports, documents, policies, directives,  international agreements, and guidance to keep abreast of ongoing  changes in overseas defense basing strategies and requirements. To  directly observe the condition of facilities and the status of selected  construction projects, we visited and toured facilities at Garrison  Wiesbaden and Garrison Grafenwoehr, Germany; Camp Schwab, Camp  Zama, Yokosuka Naval Base, and Yokota Air Base, Japan; and Yongsan  Army Garrison and Garrison Humphreys, South Korea.", "To determine the status of DOD\u2019s planning efforts for the Guam military  buildup, we met with officials from OSD, the Air Force, the Navy, U.S.  Pacific Command, and the Joint Guam Program Office. In general, we  discussed the current planning framework for the military buildup, the  schedule and development of a comprehensive master plan, and the status  of the environmental impact study required by the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969. In addition, we met with officials from U.S. Pacific  Fleet; U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific; U.S. Marine Forces Japan; Third  Marine Expeditionary Forces; U.S. Forces Japan; U.S. Army Pacific; and  Pacific Air Forces to discuss the challenges and various factors that can  affect U.S. infrastructure requirements and costs associated with the  military buildup, to determine if funding requirements to accommodate  the buildup have been identified, and to identify operational and training  challenges associated with the buildup. We also visited Naval Base Guam;  Andersen Air Force Base, Guam; and other military sites in Guam to  directly observe the installations and future military construction sites. We  analyzed available reports, documents, and international agreements to  keep abreast of ongoing activities in Guam pertaining to challenges that  may affect DOD\u2019s development and implementation of a comprehensive  master plan for the military buildup. To identify the funding and local  infrastructure challenges, we met with the Governor and his staff, Guam  Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, and representatives from  the Guam legislature, the Mayors\u2019 Council of Guam, the Guam Chamber of  Commerce, Guam\u2019s Civilian Military Task Force, and community groups  on Guam.", "We met with U.S. Special Operations Command officials; however, its  planning efforts were not specifically required for the overseas master  plans in response to the congressional mandates. In addition, we did not  include U.S. Southern Command and U.S. Northern Command in our  analysis because these commands have significantly fewer facilities  overseas than the other regional commands in the Pacific, Europe, and  Central Asia.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 through  August 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Mark Little, Assistant Director;  Nelsie Alcoser; Mae Jones; Kate Lenane; Julia Matta; and Jamilah Moon  made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Force Structure: Preliminary Observations on the Progress and  Challenges Associated with Establishing the U.S. Africa Command.
