To ensure that federal agency computer matching programs protect individuals' privacy rights, from 1988 through 1990 Congress enacted amendments to the Privacy Act of 1974 (collectively referred to in this report as the Computer Matching Act).", "GAO was asked to review issues relating to computer matching. This report examines (1) agencies' responsibilities under the Computer Matching Act, (2) how selected agencies are implementing the act with regard to federal benefits programs, and (3) the views of officials at selected agencies on the process of developing and implementing computer matching agreements. GAO reviewed the act's provisions and OMB guidance. It also interviewed officials and examined documents at seven agencies with high expenditures in benefits and assistance programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for developing guidelines and providing assistance to agencies on implementing the Computer Matching Act, while agencies have a variety of implementation responsibilities. Agency responsibilities include (1) developing computer matching agreements (CMA) containing specific elements for each proposed matching program and notifying Congress, OMB, and the public of such activities; (2) conducting cost-benefit analyses for proposed matching programs; and (3) establishing data integrity boards to oversee matching programs.", "The seven agencies GAO reviewed (the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and the Social Security Administration) have taken a number of steps to implement the act's requirements. They have all established processes for creating CMAs, and the agreements generally included the elements required by the act. However, implementation among these agencies was inconsistent in several ways. First, the selected agencies differed in their understanding of whether CMAs were required for data queries. OMB's guidance is not clear on whether such queries are covered by the act. Second, while the selected agencies generally developed cost-benefit analyses for their CMAs, they did not consistently address key elements needed to assess the value of computer matching programs. OMB stated in 1989 that it would issue specific guidance for cost-benefit analyses of computer matching programs, but it has not done so. Finally, agency data integrity boards have not consistently reported to OMB on agencies' computer matching activities as required by the act. OMB guidance requires biennial reporting, which varies from the act's requirement for annual reports. The lack of clear guidance from OMB has contributed to the inconsistent implementation of the act at the agencies GAO reviewed.", "Several agency and office of inspector general officials stated that the act's rigorous requirements and short time frames discouraged them from pursuing CMAs. Officials at six agencies stated that CMA review processes were lengthy and resource-intensive and that statutory durations for conducting matching activities were too short. Similarly, officials from offices of the inspector general at four agencies stated that the length of the approval process and the requirement that proposed agreements be approved by data integrity boards discouraged them from computer matching."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that OMB revise its guidance and that selected agencies develop and implement policies and procedures for cost-benefit analyses and ensure annual reviews and reporting.

To ensure that federal agency  computer matching programs are effective and protect individuals\u2019 privacy  rights, from 1988 through 1990 Congress enacted amendments to the  Privacy Act of 1974. These amendments established conditions for the  use of information about individuals for, among other things, establishing  or verifying eligibility for federal benefits programs. They also established  protections to ensure procedural uniformity in carrying out computer  matches and included due process rights for individuals whose benefits  may be affected. Throughout the remainder of this report, we refer to  these amendments as the Computer Matching Act.", "You asked us to examine agencies\u2019 efforts to share data through the  Computer Matching Act. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) determine  agencies\u2019 responsibilities under the Computer Matching Act, (2)  determine how selected agencies are implementing that act with regard to  federal benefits programs, and (3) describe the views of officials at  selected agencies on the process of developing and implementing  computer matching agreements (CMA). To describe agencies\u2019  responsibilities under the Computer Matching Act, we reviewed the act\u2019s  provisions, as well as other relevant laws, policies, and guidance that  address computer matching for program integrity purposes. We also  interviewed agency officials and examined agency documents, including  policies and procedures on computer matching programs and processes.  We selected for review federal agencies with the highest expenditures in  benefits and assistance programs, specifically the Departments of  Agriculture (USDA), Education (ED), Health and Human Services (HHS),  Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Social  Security Administration (SSA). We added the Department of Labor  (Labor) because it oversees significant employment benefit programs and  there were some indications that the Labor Office of Inspector General  (OIG) had faced challenges in using CMAs. Labor is also one of the 10  federal agencies with the highest expenditures in benefits and assistance  programs. We also reviewed guidance developed by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB). In addition, we obtained information  from the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) on the Do Not Pay  Working System and its relationship to the Computer Matching Act. To  assess agencies\u2019 implementation of the act, we compared the  requirements of the act with agencies\u2019 computer matching agreements  relating to benefits programs, including accompanying cost-benefit  analyses and agency processes for approving the agreements. To  describe the views of officials at selected agencies on the process of  developing and implementing CMAs, we interviewed agency officials on  how they implemented the act with regard to federal benefits programs.  Further, we obtained the views of inspectors general at the agencies we  reviewed on the implementation of the act.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2013 to January 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix I contains additional  details on the objectives, scope, and methodology of our review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Sharing information is an important tool in improving the efficiency and  integrity of government programs. By sharing data, agencies can often  reduce errors, improve program efficiency, evaluate program  performance, and reduce information collection burdens on the public.  Technological advances have broadened the government\u2019s ability to  share data for these uses. Likewise, such advances have enhanced the  government\u2019s ability to use computerized analysis to identify and reduce  fraud, waste, and abuse. One important analytical technique is computer  matching, a term commonly used to refer to the computerized comparison  of information, generally including personally identifiable information (PII),  such as names and Social Security numbers, in two or more information  systems.", "Agencies use computer matching in a variety of ways to help ensure that  federal benefits are distributed appropriately. For example, the National  Directory of New Hires, established in 1996 under the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, is used to match  new-hire information from states with information from other states and  federal programs to detect and prevent erroneous payments for the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and  other benefit programs. In another example, according to the Chairman of  the House Committee on Ways and Means, SSA collects prisoner data  from states and local governments to identify incarcerated individuals who  should not receive Supplemental Security Income benefits. The chairman  stated that from 1997 to 2009 computer matching had helped SSA  identify over 720,000 inmates who were improperly receiving benefits,  contributing to billions of dollars in savings to the federal government.  Due to the success of this program, prisoner data are now shared with  child support enforcement and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  programs as well. Likewise, the chairman also reported that the Public  Assistance Reporting Information System was being used to match state  enrollment data for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and  child care programs with data from participating states and a selected  group of federal databases to identify potentially inappropriate payments.  According to the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House  Committee on Ways and Means, the State of Colorado realized a return  on investment of 4000 percent from using the system, and the state of  New York annually saves an average of $62 million through its  participation in the system.", "Much computer matching is done for program integrity purposes, but it  has other uses as well. For example, Secure Flight, a program run by  DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Administration, matches information about  passengers provided by the airlines against government watch lists to  detect individuals on the No Fly List and prevent them from boarding  aircraft and to identify individuals for additional screening. Another  example is E-Verify, an Internet-based system developed by U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services that allows businesses to determine  the eligibility of potential employees to work in the United States.", "While computer matching programs have been successful in identifying  fraud, waste, and abuse in federal benefit programs, if proper controls are  not in place, they can also adversely affect the privacy and due process  rights of individuals whose records are being matched. The data that are  exchanged through matching programs involve personal information such  as Social Security numbers and income and employment data. Without  adequate protection, individuals\u2019 information could be compromised  through inappropriate use, modification, or disclosure.", "In addition, without effective due process protections, individuals could  unfairly lose government benefits if decisions were made to reduce or  terminate those benefits based on inaccurate or misleading computer  matches. For example, according to a senior policy analyst of the Center  of Law and Social Policy, a computer match authorized under the  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, which  allowed states to verify the citizenship of Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program applicants by matching Social Security records rather  than using clients\u2019 birth certificates, produced matches of questionable  accuracy. Specifically, according to this analyst, in the first year of using  this matching program, the state of Alabama incorrectly identified over  1,000 children who would have been denied benefits if the results had not  been verified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Laws That Address Computer Matching", "paragraphs": ["The major requirements for computer matching and the protection of  personal privacy by federal agencies come from two laws, the Privacy Act  of 1974 and the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002.  The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and  use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act  defines a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information about  an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her  name or another individual identifier. It defines a \u201csystem of records\u201d as a  group of records under the control of any agency from which information  is retrieved by the name of the individual or other individual identifier. The  Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a  system of records, they must notify the public through a system of records  notice in the Federal Register that identifies, among other things, the  categories of data collected, the categories of individuals about whom  information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and  procedures that individuals can use to review and contest its content.", "In 2002, Congress enacted the E-Government Act to, among other things,  enhance protection for personal information in government information  systems. Toward this end, the act requires agencies to conduct privacy  impact assessments before developing or procuring information systems  that will collect or process personal information. These assessments  provide a means for agencies to analyze and document the privacy  protections they have established for uses of automated data, such as  computer matching and other data-sharing activities.", "Because of concerns about agency use of personal information in  computer matching programs, Congress passed the Computer Matching  and Privacy Protection Act in 1988 as an amendment to the Privacy Act.  The provisions were intended to create procedures that would require  serious deliberation and prevent data \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d that could  reduce or terminate benefits without verifying the information and  notifying affected individuals of the matching program. In 1989 and 1990,Congress enacted further amendments to, among other things, require  due process procedures for agency computer matching programs,  including independent verification of \u201chits\u201d and a 30-day notice for  individuals affected by a matching program.", "Under these sets of amendments, which we collectively refer to as the  Computer Matching Act, computer matching is defined as the  computerized comparison of records for the purpose of establishing or  verifying eligibility or recouping payments for a federal benefit program or  relating to federal personnel management. To ensure procedural  uniformity in carrying out matching programs and to provide due process  for potentially affected individuals, the law established a number of  requirements for covered agency computer matching programs, including agencies must have computer matching agreements with participating  agencies that specify, among other things, the purpose and legal  authority of the program and a justification for the program, including a  specific estimate of any savings;", "Data Integrity Boards (DIB) must be established to approve and  review all agency computer matching programs covered by the  Computer Matching Act, including the costs and benefits of such  programs; and", "OMB must prescribe guidance for agencies on conducting computer  matching programs as part of implementation of the Privacy Act.", "These requirements do not, however, apply to all federal agency  computer matching activities. For example, the law\u2019s definitions exclude  matches of federal agency information with commercial data and matches  of federal agency payments, grants, or loans to entities other than  individuals. Further, the law exempts a number of matching activities. For  example, the initial 1988 amendments included exemptions for matches  for statistical or research purposes, law enforcement investigations of  specific individuals, and certain tax-related matches. In 1999, an  exemption was added for Social Security Act-related matches of prisoner  data. In addition, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act exempted matches by HHS relating to potential fraud, waste, and  abuse.", "Most recently, in January 2013, the Improper Payments Elimination and  Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) provided, among other things, that  data-matching activities conducted by agencies and offices of inspectors  general (OIG) that assist in the detection and prevention of improper  payments would be subject to requirements that differ from those of the  Computer Matching Act. These include a 60-day time limit on DIB review,  approvals extended up to 3 years, and a waiver on the requirement for a  specific estimate of savings in a computer matching agreement.", "In addition, IPERIA established in law the Do Not Pay Initiative,  coordinated by the Department of the Treasury, to require agencies to  reduce improper payments by reviewing a number of databases,  including the SSA Death Master File and the Department of Housing and  Urban Development Credit Alert System, before issuing any payments.  IPERIA also required OMB to ensure the establishment of a working  system to provide agencies with access to these databases, and to report  to Congress on the operations of the Do Not Pay Initiative. OMB\u2019s August  16, 2013, guidance also contained instructions for agencies on  implementing this initiative, including responsibilities for agency DIBs.

IPERIA requires federal agencies to use  certain databases, which are to be available through the Do Not Pay  Working System, for prepayment review of eligibility for payments and  awards. Agencies use the portal to perform online queries to verify  records related to specific individuals, a process known as front-end  verification.

Similarly, OIG officials at four  agencies stated that, given the short duration of CMAs, the typical length  of the CMA approval process discouraged them from computer matching,  as did the requirement that their proposed agreements be approved by  agency DIBs.", "For example, officials at DHS told us they avoid attempting to implement  CMAs because the internal review processes are lengthy and resource- intensive and because of the relatively short duration of approved CMAs.  Officials at ED, HHS, Labor, SSA, and VA agreed that the CMA review  process is lengthy and resource-intensive. They said that the fact that  proposed CMAs must be reviewed by both the source and recipient  agencies created extensive review processes that often took a long time  to complete. In contrast, officials at USDA did not think the review  process was overly lengthy or resource-intensive.", "To implement the requirements of the act, agencies we reviewed typically  adhere to the following CMA process, which involves an extensive  sequence of multiple reviews:", "Development of the Computer Matching Agreement: The agency that  wants to run a match on its program records (the recipient) develops a  proposed CMA to receive records from another agency (the source) to  match against its records. The proposed CMA must include a cost- benefit analysis that adheres to all the act\u2019s requirements, which can  add to the time and cost of developing a CMA. Reaching agreement  on the CMA frequently involves negotiation between the agencies  over what data will be matched and how the data will be transferred.  Upon reaching a draft agreement, the proposed CMA is reviewed and  approved by multiple offices, including separate legal and privacy  office reviews, in each agency. Officials said that the negotiation  process and legal and privacy reviews often took many months to  complete.", "Data Integrity Board Review: The proposed CMA is reviewed and  must be approved by DIBs at both the source and recipient agencies.", "Agency Head Approval: Following DIB approval, the proposed CMA  must also be approved by both agency heads, requiring that the draft  agreement be vetted through officials at additional offices within each  agency.", "Notice to Congress: Recipient agencies must allow an additional 40  days to notify the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, and OMB to provide an opportunity for review  and comments prior to implementation of the match.", "Public Notice: A notice of the computer matching program must be  published in the Federal Register at least 30 days prior to  implementation to provide an opportunity for interested persons to  submit comments. (This public notice period can occur at the same  time as notice is given to OMB and Congress.)", "Figure 2 provides an overview of the typical CMA approval process.", "According to agency officials, following these steps can be a lengthy  process, often taking 3 months or longer to complete. For example:", "An ED official stated that new CMAs usually take 9-10 months and  renewals take 6 months to complete.", "According to officials from the HHS Administration for Children and  Families, CMAs with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  agencies typically take 6 to 9 months, while those with state workforce  programs take up to a year.", "According to officials from the DHS privacy office, the CMA process at  DHS can take up to 6 months.", "According to officials from VA\u2019s Veterans Benefits Administration,  CMAs can take 3 months to 1 year.", "According to officials from the SSA privacy office, on average, CMAs  take about a year to process or to be renewed; however, the process  can take longer. Officials at VA and HHS stated that CMAs with SSA  must be planned a year in advance.", "Not all agency officials reported that the CMA process was lengthy. For  example, USDA officials stated that the CMA process could take up to 45  days to complete.", "In addition, agency officials generally believed that CMAs do not last long  enough. Given the lengthy internal review processes, agency officials  from ED, HHS, DHS, VA, and SSA indicated that the statutory  requirement that agreements be effective for only 18 months with a  possible extension for 12 additional months was too short. Given such  constraints, the approval process can last nearly as long as the proposed  matching program itself. These officials said that when they have a  continuing need to maintain permanent matching programs they have to  restart the approval process nearly as soon as a CMA is approved in  order to get either a 12-month extension or to reinstate the CMA as a new  agreement after an existing 12-month extension has expired. As a result  of the lengthy administrative process, agencies could be discouraged  from pursuing CMAs.", "Similarly, DHS privacy office officials stated that the review requirements  and limited duration of CMAs discouraged implementation in the  department.

For  example, they stated that privacy protections were examined in privacy  impact assessments and were assessed for all data-sharing agreements,  including those that fell outside of the act. In addition, DHS privacy impact  assessments are publicly available on the agency\u2019s website and thus  contribute to the transparency of the programs.", "OIG officials also had concerns with the approval process for CMAs.  Specifically, OIG officials at ED, DHS, SSA, and Labor stated that they  were reluctant to make the effort to establish CMAs because it could take  6 months to several years to get them approved, which could overly delay  their planned audit and investigative work. OIGs that did not have active  CMAs, including those at USDA, ED, DHS, and Labor, said they perform  computer matches only when they do not need to seek new CMAs, such  as when they can use data already obtained by other entities within their  departments or gathered by the states. In both such cases, separate  CMAs are not required. ED OIG officials also added that although the  lengthy computer matching approval process may be acceptable for  agency programs that may last for multiple years, OIG's needs generally  are confined to investigations and audits with limited time frames, and  CMAs are less practical in those circumstances. An OIG official at HHS  stated that the HHS OIG was exempt by law from having to prepare  CMAs.", "OIG officials at ED and representatives from the Council of the Inspectors  General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and Recovery Accountability  and Transparency Board (Recovery Board) also expressed concerns  about their independence in initiating and conducting computer matching  programs. Specifically, they said that because agency management  officials sit on the Data Integrity Boards that approve CMAs, the agency is  informed of OIG investigations that intend to use computer matching,  which could compromise certain investigations. Lastly, an official from  the DHS OIG expressed the opinion that because the OIG\u2019s role is  advisory in nature and does not involve making official eligibility  determinations based on computer matching results, the OIG should be  exempt from having to establish CMAs in order to do computer matching.", "Not all OIG officials agreed that CMAs were problematic. For example,  OIG officials from Labor and USDA said they had not experienced  independence issues at their agencies. In addition, an official from the VA  OIG stated that while the computer matching process usually takes 6 to 9  months, she did not feel the requirements posed a problem for  investigative projects that were adequately planned in advance. For  example, the VA OIG official pointed out that the act allowed for pilot data  matches (under its exemption for statistical matching) that provide an  opportunity for investigative methods to be tested in advance of  developing a CMA. The official stated that in one case the VA OIG had  conducted pilot matches using a small data subset to determine whether  it would be productive to perform a match of the entire dataset. After the  pilot showed the value of conducting the match, the VA OIG initiated a  CMA with the source agency, and matching under this CMA is currently  under way. In this case, the length of time required to get the CMA  approved was not problematic because the OIG had planned for it in  advance.", "Further, officials from privacy offices in several agencies, such as USDA,  ED, and SSA, stated that requirements of the Computer Matching Act  were valuable to their agencies as privacy protections and did not  discourage use. For example, an official in the USDA Privacy Office  stated that USDA ensures that mechanisms similar to those in the  Computer Matching Act are incorporated in policies and practices relating  to all applicable computer matching and data-sharing activities regardless  of whether they are statutorily covered by the act. Similarly, officials from  ED said they have applied the CMA process to data-sharing agreements  not covered by the act, including a data-sharing agreement with SSA, to  ensure that that program had privacy protections comparable to those  provided by the act.

Regarding our recommendation to ensure that the DIB  reviews cost-benefit analyses to make certain cost savings information for  CMAs are included before approval, ED did not concur and stated that  the DIB has consistently reviewed cost-benefit analyses before approving  CMAs and that no change in agency practices was needed. However, our  review of ED\u2019s eight cost-benefit analyses showed that two did not  address avoidance of future improper payments and five did not address  recovery of improper payments and debts. Given that ED\u2019s cost-benefit  analyses did not mention these costs, which are key elements of cost  savings information, the DIB would not have been able to make a full  review of costs and benefits to ensure that cost savings information was  included in CMAs before approving them.

Specifically, we examined computer matching  agreements to determine if the agreements contained information  required by the act. In addition, we reviewed the accompanying cost- benefit analyses to determine if they contained relevant information to  conclude that the matching program was beneficial to the agency.  Specifically we reviewed the 1986 GAO report for criteria on cost-benefit  analyses since OMB guidance refers agencies to it and because  agencies we reviewed used it. We selected four key elements of costs  and benefits (cost: personnel and computer costs; benefits: avoidance of  future improper payment and recovery of improper payments and debts)  and determined whether the agencies\u2019 cost-benefit analyses included  these key elements. We also reviewed the activities and documentation  of the Data Integrity Boards (DIB) to determine if they followed the  requirements of the law.
