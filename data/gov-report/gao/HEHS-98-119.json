Enrollees who become dissatisfied with aspects of their health care can send signals to their health plan in several ways. One approach is to disenroll and obtain services from a competing plan. But leaving a plan is not always feasible within a plan year or if an employer offers only one health plan; nor does leaving provide information to the plan about why the employee is dissatisfied so that it can take appropriate action. Another approach is to voice a complaint directly to the plan and provide detailed information from which plans can modify their practices or services. This approach offers an alternative to enrollees who may be reluctant to disenroll despite a problem with the health plan and affords plans an opportunity to be responsive to member concerns.", "Unlike traditional indemnity insurance plans, many managed care plans limit coverage to services provided by the physicians and hospitals in the plan and require use of an authorization system. For example, health maintenance organizations (HMO) generally restrict coverage to care from providers within the plan\u2019s network and further require that specialty care be recommended by the member\u2019s primary care gatekeeper. Additionally, as part of managing patient care, most managed care plans have adopted utilization review procedures. Utilization review determines whether the physician\u2019s proposed course of medical treatment and proposed location are necessary, based on clinical criteria. Because of these restrictions, many believe that HMOs need to have a system for enrollees to express dissatisfaction with their care. Similarly, many believe that plans with the ability to deny or reduce coverage for unauthorized services need a mechanism for members to seek review of claims that have been denied or covered at a lower than expected level of benefits.", "These issues, as well as the momentum toward managed care as employers\u2019 preferred method of paying for health care, have focused attention on the adequacy of mechanisms whereby HMO enrollees can raise and resolve disputes. Therefore, you asked us to examine (1) what elements are considered important to a system for processing HMO member complaints and appeals; (2) the extent to which HMOs\u2019 complaint and appeal systems contain these elements; (3) what concerns consumers have regarding HMO complaint and appeal systems; (4) what information is available on the number and types of complaints and appeals HMOs receive from their members; and (5) how, if at all, HMOs use their complaint and appeal data. Although we did not evaluate how well these systems were performing, our report assesses whether the policies and procedures in place contain the features recommended by leading regulatory, industry, and consumer groups.", "To address these issues, we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from a national managed care industry association, state insurance regulatory offices, national consumer advocacy groups, national business associations, and national health plan accrediting bodies. To obtain information on specific HMOs\u2019 complaint and appeal systems, we contacted 38 HMOs in five states: Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Tennessee. We selected states in various regions and with different levels of state regulation and HMO market penetration. In selecting HMOs, we sought a mix of plans reflecting different model types, enrollment size, and accreditation status. (See app. I for information on the characteristics of HMOs in our study across these variables.) At each HMO, we interviewed officials and reviewed the HMO\u2019s written policies and procedures for complaint and appeal systems, member handbooks, certificates of coverage, letters sent to members during the appeal process, and complaint and appeal data. Additionally, in each of the five states, we met with representatives of consumer advocacy groups identified largely by state insurance officials as being active in managed care issues.", "In this report, we define complaints as expressions of dissatisfaction with the care or service received from a plan\u2014for example, difficulty in scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment, or dissatisfaction with a particular provider. We define appeals as requests to have plan decisions, such as denials of authorization for services requested or denials of payment for services received, reversed. (Some HMOs define these terms differently; further, some HMOs use the term grievance in place of, or in addition to, these terms.) Our report discusses systems applicable to HMO members not enrolled in a Medicare or Medicaid plan. We did not focus on members of self-funded plans in our study, nor did we assess the extent to which the systems described in our report apply to members of self-funded plans.(According to a 1997 study of large firms, only about 14 percent of American workers enrolled in HMOs in 1997 were in self-funded plans.) We conducted our review between May 1997 and March 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Complaint and appeal procedures are regulated by a patchwork of federal and state law. No federal standards, however, prescribe how complaint and appeal systems are to be structured and administered. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a federal law governing most employer-sponsored health plans, simply requires that covered health plans provide a mechanism to permit participants and beneficiaries to appeal a plan\u2019s denial of a claim. Another federal law, the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, simply requires that plans provide \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201ctimely\u201d procedures for hearing and resolving complaints in order to become federally qualified HMOs.", "Numerous bills mandating specific features of health plan complaint and appeal procedures have been introduced before the current Congress. One bill, for example, would set standards for the timeliness of plan response to appeals and the professional qualifications of appeal reviewers and would require external review of plan decisions in certain circumstances. In addition, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry recently issued a \u201cConsumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities\u201d that included recommendations for handling consumer complaints and appeals.", "Many states have laws regulating or affecting HMOs. According to the American Association of Health Plans (AAHP), which represents managed care organizations, nearly all HMO coverage offered to employees is governed by state grievance and appeal requirements. HMOs have frequently argued, however, that in certain circumstances ERISA prevents state law from applying to them. These arguments arise because ERISA prohibits states from regulating employee health plans, although it expressly permits states to regulate insurance purchased by employers.", "Most states require HMOs to describe their grievance procedures when applying for a license or certificate of authority. Many states require that plans inform members about grievance procedures at least upon enrollment and sometimes annually. Some states mandate that HMOs inform patients of grievance rights and procedures upon each denial of service, when this information is most pertinent. Some states require plans to submit an annual report on the number of complaints filed, their underlying causes, and their disposition.", "Some states have prescribed detailed requirements in the area of complaints and appeals. For example, some states require that HMOs resolve member appeals of decisions within certain time periods (for example, 20 days); some have required that HMOs allow members the option of having complaints and appeals reviewed by an external, independent panel. However, provisions in state laws vary considerably.

We reviewed standards promulgated by two private accrediting bodies, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). We also reviewed the guidelines established by groups representing industry, consumer, and regulatory interests: AAHP, Families USA (FUSA), and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), respectively. (See app. III for more information on these five organizations.) In all, we identified 11 features considered important to a complaint and appeal system by at least two of the groups.

JCAHO, for example, emphasized the importance of \u201cdefined time frames in which the member can anticipate response to an appeal.\u201d The groups differed in specifying the number of days allowed for resolution; while NAIC\u2019s criterion stated that plans have up to 30 days to resolve first-level appeals, for example, JCAHO simply called for plans to have established time periods without specifying what they should be.", "Expedited review refers to a plan policy of processing appeals more quickly in situations in which, were the plan to follow its usual time period for processing the appeal, the patient\u2019s health might be jeopardized. Again, the groups differed in the extent to which they specified the time within which expedited appeals were to be processed.

Both NAIC and NCQA stated that such professionals should be involved in decisions regarding denials of clinical services; FUSA did not specify instances under which review by medical professionals should take place. According to AAHP, medical necessity determinations should involve a physician\u2019s review, while determinations about whether a benefit is covered under the terms of the contract might not involve a physician.", "FUSA, NAIC, and NCQA stated that plan officials determining the outcome of an appeal should not be the same officials who were involved in either the initial denial or the first-level appeal. NCQA\u2019s standards state that no one performing a first- or second-level review should be previously involved in the case.

NCQA requires that plans provide information that is easily accessible\u2014for example, in a member handbook or provider directory or on a membership card\u2014rather than relying exclusively on technical or legal documents. The President\u2019s Quality Commission notes that consumers have the concomitant responsibility to become knowledgeable about their health plan coverage, including covered benefits, plan processes, and appeal rights.", "FUSA and NCQA also noted the importance of plans\u2019 acceptance of oral complaints and appeals.

Regarding the plan\u2019s response to an appeal of a denial, two of these groups also highlighted the importance of written notice of appeal denials, including appeal rights. Including appeal rights in the written denial notice ensures that plan members are aware of the steps they need to take in the event they are dissatisfied with the plan decision. An official from the Center for Healthcare Rights, a California-based consumer group, also noted that denial notices should contain information about the nature of what was denied, the basis for the decision (for example, the medical information or plan contract terms the HMO relied upon in making the determination), and information about what factors the HMO would consider in an appeal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HMOs Had Most of the Important Elements, but Two Were Commonly Lacking", "paragraphs": ["The HMOs in our review had most of the 11 elements identified by the groups in our study as being important to complaint and appeal systems, although they varied considerably in the mechanisms adopted to meet them.

Accordingly, consumer advocates believe that review by an independent third party is essential to ensuring integrity in decisionmaking.

Additional analysis must be done, according to the Commission, to identify the most effective and efficient methods of establishing the independent external appeal function. Issues to be considered include mechanisms for financing the external review system, sponsorship of the external review function, consumer cost-sharing responsibilities (for example, filing fees), and methods of overseeing external appeal entities and holding them accountable.", "Managed care organizations have raised concerns about requirements for external review, noting that under various proposals the external reviewers may not be qualified, may not use proper standards, may add expense, and may delay the process. Addressing the expense issue, however, a recent report by The Lewin Group estimated that external review would cost no more than 7 cents per enrollee per month.According to the report, the estimated cost is small because, in practice, only a small number of appeals reach the external review process. Once the cost is divided among the total number of enrollees, the cost per enrollee is very low.", "There is limited experience with external review systems for HMO members. HCFA requires that appeals by Medicare HMO enrollees be reviewed by an independent party if the initial appeal is denied by the HMO. In such cases, the HMO is required to send the denial, along with medical information concerning the disputed services, to a HCFA contractor that adjudicates such denials. Since 1989, the HCFA contractor has been the Center for Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR) (formerly known as the Network Design Group) of Pittsford, New York. CHDR hires physicians, nurses, and other clinical staff to evaluate beneficiaries\u2019 medical need for contested services and make reconsideration decisions.

In Florida, for example, the program consists of a statewide panel made up of three Florida Department of Insurance representatives and three representatives from Florida\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Administration. The process is available to any enrollee who has exhausted the HMO\u2019s internal appeal procedure and is dissatisfied with the result. HMOs are required to inform members about the program, including the telephone number and address of the panel. According to a Florida official, from 1991 to 1995 an average of 350 appeals per year were heard under the program: issues included quality of, and access to, care; emergency services; unauthorized services; and services deemed not medically necessary.

Although arbitration has been promoted as a quick, informal, and flexible alternative to litigation, some HMOs have been criticized for requiring members to enter into binding arbitration agreements as a condition of enrollment. Such agreements, according to consumer advocates, require enrollees to relinquish their rights to legal remedies in the event they are not satisfied with their plan\u2019s response.

According to this survey, half of insured respondents merely skim\u2014or do not read at all\u2014the materials about their health plan. Further, many consumers do not understand even the basic elements of health plans, including the ways in which managed care plans differ from traditional indemnity insurance. For example, barely half (52 percent) of managed care enrollees knew that managed care plans place emphasis on preventive care and other health improvement programs, generally including Pap smears and children\u2019s immunizations. Only about three-quarters knew that their choice of physicians was limited to those in the plan, that patients must see a primary care physician first for any health problem, or that, with the exception of emergencies, patients must be referred by their primary care physician before they can see a specialist.", "Member confusion is not limited to managed care enrollees, however. According to a nationwide survey conducted in 1994 and 1995, a similar percentage (24 to 33 percent) of managed care enrollees and fee-for-service enrollees reported difficulty understanding which services were covered by their insurance. Further, about 30 percent of enrollees in each group reported that they had problems dealing with insurance plan rules that were confusing and complex.", "Communication difficulties were also noted by the California task force as well as NCQA. The task force cited a recent study of the \u201creadability\u201d of health insurance literature and contracts that found that the average document was written at a reading level of third- or fourth-year college to first- or second-year graduate school. In contrast, according to the report, the results of the 1992 Adult Literacy Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education indicated that writing directed at the general public should be at the seventh- or eighth-grade level. From focus groups with commercial members in 1994 and 1995, NCQA concluded that, though it is important that HMO members know how to use managed care systems, many do not fully understand how they function.", "To resolve the communications problem, whatever its genesis, several HMOs we contacted have come up with alternative communication methods to supplement member handbooks. For example, one HMO reported distributing to its members a videotape that explained the complaint and appeal system. Other HMOs periodically published reminders and articles about the system in their newsletters, some of which encouraged members to contact a customer service representative with any questions about the complaint and appeal system.", "Another method aimed at improving communication between plans and members is the ombudsman program, in which an independent party educates members about, and assists them with, the intricacies of the health plan, including the complaint and appeal system. Ombudsman programs\u2014sometimes referred to as independent assistance programs\u2014may fall along a spectrum of types, from neutral, mediation-type programs to active consumer advocacy. Ombudsman programs have been established in several locations, including California, Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In Florida, for example, ombudsman committees have been established by the state to act as volunteer consumer protection and advocacy organizations on behalf of managed care members in the state, and these committees may assist in the investigation and resolution of complaints. Members of the committees include physicians, other health care professionals, attorneys, and consumers, none of whom may be employed by or affiliated with a managed care program.", "An ombudsman program is also available to consumers in northern California. The program is funded by three California-based foundations\u2014the California Wellness Foundation, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Sierra Health Foundation\u2014and is administered by the Center for Health Care Rights, a Los Angeles-based consumer advocacy organization. The program, confined to the Sacramento area, was designed to assist individuals with general questions about managed care, as well as help resolve specific problems with managed care plans\u2014for example, providing assistance in filing and pursuing formal grievances.

The model act calls for a grievance register to be accessible to the state insurance commissioner. Each health plan would maintain written records to document all grievances received during a year. The register would contain a general description of the reason for the grievance, date received, date of each review, resolution at each level, date of resolution at each level, and the name of the covered person. The plan would submit to the commissioner an annual report that includes the number of grievances, the number of grievances referred to second-level review, the number resolved at each level and their resolution, and actions taken to correct problems identified.", "Some government agencies and consumer groups contend that public accountability for complaint and appeal practices could also provide prospective enrollees with important information needed to compare plans. If these data were standardized and publicized, HMOs could compete on the basis of complaint and appeal rates. Publishing the complaint rates would likely boost enrollment of plans with low complaint rates and encourage plans with high rates to improve their performance.", "For example, in the interests of providing Medicare beneficiaries with information that will help them make choices among health plan options, HCFA intends to require contracting health plans to submit standardized, plan-level appeal data. After assessing the database, the agency, in consultation with consumer groups and managed care plans, will determine what types of measures are valid, reasonable, and helpful to the public.", "However, HCFA and consumer groups, as well as accrediting bodies such as NCQA, recognize that reporting simple complaint and appeal rates on individual plans may be a misleading indicator of members\u2019 relative satisfaction with HMOs. There may be a relationship between these rates and enrollee knowledge and education about their rights to complain and appeal plan decisions. Also, some plans place greater emphasis on soliciting and documenting member complaints. Public access to such information could then lead to misunderstandings that could harm plan reputations.

Some HMOs, for example, differentiated between informal and formal complaints. Other HMOs used the term appeal to refer to an expression of dissatisfaction with the outcome of a complaint, whether or not it involved a request for reconsideration.", "Among the HMOs in our review, \u201cgrievance\u201d was often used in addition to, or in place of, complaints and appeals.

Another HMO reported that it may count one member contact, such as a letter or telephone call, as several complaints if the contact involves several different issues.", "These differences, together with limitations in the data some HMOs provided us, hindered our attempt to report in a consistent manner the numbers of complaints and appeals received by the HMOs in 1996. Although 33 of the 38 HMOs provided us with data on complaints or appeals, in only 27 cases did the data allow us to calculate the number of complaints or appeals per 1,000 enrollees. For the remainder of the HMOs that submitted data, limitations in the data prevented such a calculation. One HMO provided data for only three-quarters of the year, another HMO provided data for only 1997, another plan did not break out HMO enrollees separately from enrollees in other managed care arrangements such as preferred provider organizations or Medicare, another HMO provided data on the number of complaints in the \u201ctop five\u201d complaint categories but did not provide the total number of complaints, and another HMO provided data for only one category of complaint.", "Not unexpectedly, given the wide variation in HMO definitions and data collection and documentation methods, the number of complaints and appeals reported to us by the HMOs we studied varied widely.

A similarly wide range was apparent in the number of appeals received; appeals ranged from 0.07 per 1,000 enrollees to 69.4 per 1,000 enrollees.", "Complaints and appeals reported by HMOs covered a variety of issues. The most common complaints reported to us were characterized by HMOs as complaints about (1) medical or administrative services, (2) quality of care, and (3) claims issues (such as complaints about the processing of claims for services received). The most common appeals reported to us were characterized by HMOs as appeals of (1) benefit issues (such as services or benefits that are not covered under the member\u2019s policy), (2) denial of payment for emergency room visits, and (3) referral issues (such as instances in which a member visited a physician without first obtaining a referral, as required in the member\u2019s contract).", "Concerned about the limitations of our data, we contacted insurance regulators in the five states in our study, to determine whether they required HMOs to report to them the number of complaints and appeals the HMOs received. However, according to the regulators, none of these states collected such information from HMOs (though the states do record and maintain information about complaints they receive directly from the public).

In addition to using complaint and appeal data, HMOs reported using other indicators of member satisfaction, such as the results of member satisfaction surveys and member focus groups, and feedback from purchasers, to identify common problems.", "Documenting and analyzing complaints and appeals can help plans deal with chronic problems by informing management about various elements of plan performance, both clinical and administrative. Resolution of problems brought to the plan\u2019s attention, if widespread or recurring, can lead to improvements in access to care, physician issues, and quality of care, as well as changes in plan policies and procedures.", "Several HMOs reported expanding member benefits, at least in part as a result of complaints and appeals they received. Three HMOs added a drug to the HMO\u2019s formulary; another added Weight Watchers coverage. Other HMOs changed their processes or structure. Several HMOs reported changes to their system for processing and paying emergency room claims. Two HMOs, for example, increased the number of emergency room diagnoses that they would automatically pay without reviewing the claim. Claims that would previously have been denied were thus paid.", "Another HMO, in response to members\u2019 complaints about not being allowed to see well-regarded specialists in a nearby city, changed its policy so that, after a patient had been referred to a specialist within the HMO and had seen that specialist, the patient was then free to see any of several nonplan specialists in the city, and the HMO would pay for the specialists\u2019 services.", "HMOs changed other processes as well. Two HMOs increased staffing in their member service departments in order to reduce the time members telephoning the HMO spent on hold; another HMO added additional telephone lines for the same purpose. Several HMOs adopted centralized appointment systems or took other measures to increase the efficiency and timeliness of the appointment-setting process. Two HMOs reported changing their pharmacy benefits vendor as a result of member complaints.", "Some HMOs reported paying for an unauthorized service (for example, an unwarranted visit to the emergency room or an unauthorized visit to a provider specialist outside the network) but then sending the member a letter explaining why the member was not entitled to the service received and warning that a repeat occurrence would not be paid for. Through such policies (called by one HMO a \u201cpay and educate\u201d policy, by another a \u201cfirst-time offender\u201d policy), HMOs avoid an immediate appeal of a denied claim and hope to reduce unnecessary or unauthorized visits in the future.", "HMOs have also initiated efforts to educate their members.

This hotline was a service provided to members who wanted medical advice, particularly members having doubts about whether a visit to the emergency room was necessary.", "Many HMOs reported using complaint and appeal data about specific providers as part of their processes for recredentialing providers; one HMO reported terminating a provider as a direct result of a member complaint. Some HMOs reported using complaint and appeal data to evaluate provider performance. For example, a few HMOs reported establishing peer review panels, in which providers within the HMO would review information, including complaints and appeals, to evaluate the performance of other providers.", "Three HMOs told us that many of the quality-of-care complaints they received from members actually resulted not from poor quality but from poor communication between providers and members.

Many consumers may not fully understand the rules for gaining access to health care or the complex benefits structures in HMOs.

Innovative approaches might improve consumer understanding. For example, ombudsman programs might be an alternative way to facilitate consumer knowledge about, and use of, these systems. Ironically, members\u2019 inability to navigate the complaint process results in little formal tracking of patterns of problems encountered. Improved consumer knowledge might lead to more appropriate use of complaint and appeal systems and thus might provide more information to HMOs wishing to identify and address plan problems.", "Finally, consumers lack the information they need to compare plans in a meaningful way. If defined and collected uniformly, complaint and appeal data, as a performance indicator, could be important tools for consumers when selecting a health plan. Publicly available, comparative information about the number and types of complaints and appeals, the outcomes of the dispute resolution process, and actions taken to correct problems would provide information about not only member satisfaction but also plan responsiveness to problems raised by members.
