That base now faces uncertainties as DOD\u0092s budget declines and operational requirements for these vehicles decrease. In addition to sales to DOD, U.S. manufacturers sell vehicles to foreign governments.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee Report on a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 directed GAO to (1) describe the composition of the U.S. TWV industrial base, (2) determine how many U.S. manufactured TWVs were purchased by foreign governments from fiscal years 2007 through 2011, and (3) identify factors perceived as affecting foreign governments\u0092 decisions to purchase these vehicles.

Four of these manufacturers reported that their reliance on sales to the Department of Defense (DOD) varies, in part, as they also produce commercial vehicles or parts. Collectively, the seven manufacturers supplied DOD with over 158,000 TWVs to meet wartime needs from fiscal years 2007 through 2011. DOD, however, plans to return to pre-war purchasing levels, buying about 8,000 TWVs over the next several years, in part, due to fewer requirements.", "Almost 28,000 U.S.-manufactured TWVs were purchased for use by foreign governments from fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Approximately 92 percent of these vehicles were paid for using U.S. security assistance funds provided to foreign governments. Iraq and Afghanistan were the largest recipients of such assistance, but officials stated that DOD does not plan to continue funding TWV purchases for these countries. While sales to foreign governments are unlikely to offset reductions in DOD purchases, manufacturers reported that foreign sales are becoming an increasingly important part of their revenue stream.", "Sales of U.S.-manufactured TWVs to foreign governments may be affected by multiple interrelated factors, including the availability of used DOD vehicles for sale, foreign competition, differing vehicle requirements, and concerns associated with U.S. arms transfer control regimes. U.S. manufacturers said sales of used Army TWVs to foreign governments could affect their ability to sell new vehicles. U.S. manufacturers and foreign governments also identified a number of non-U.S. manufacturers that produce TWVs that meet foreign governments\u0092 requirements, such as right-side drive vehicles. While U.S. manufacturers can produce vehicles that meet these requirements, vehicles they produced for DOD generally have not. Finally, manufacturers and foreign officials had mixed views on how the U.S. arms transfer control regimes may affect foreign governments\u0092 decisions to purchase U.S. vehicles. U.S. manufacturers and foreign officials expressed concerns with processing times and U.S. end-use restrictions, but foreign officials also said that such concerns have not been a determining factor when purchasing TWVs that meet their requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

TWVs are primarily designed for use by forces in the field to transport  cargo and personnel and are capable of operating on primary and  secondary roads, trails, and cross-country terrain. The Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) need for TWVs increased dramatically in response to  the operational demands and threats, such as improvised explosive  devices, experienced by U.S. forces during Operation Enduring Freedom  and Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example, DOD\u2019s procurements for two  types of TWVs\u2014the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle  (HMMWV) and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV)\u2014 increased from 5,500 in 2002 to 27,350 vehicles in 2006. To meet these  requirements, the U.S. TWV industrial base, which includes vehicle  manufacturers and their suppliers of major subsystems and parts,  increased vehicle production. However, that industrial base now faces a  period of uncertainty as requirements for these vehicles decrease with the  withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and the planned drawdown in  Afghanistan, along with declines in DOD\u2019s budget.", "In addition to sales to DOD, the U.S. TWV industrial base also sells  vehicles to foreign governments. The sale of U.S. arms and dual-use  items, including TWVs, to friendly nations and allies is an integral  component of both U.S. national security and foreign policy. The Arms  Export Control Act (AECA) authorizes the President to control the export  and import of arms. The AECA authorizes the U.S. government to sell  arms to foreign governments through government-to-government  agreements as part of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. It also  authorizes the issuance of export licenses for U.S. manufacturers to sell  arms directly to eligible foreign governments, known as direct commercial  sales (DCS). Regardless of the method of sale, each FMS request or  DCS license application is reviewed by officials from DOD and the  Department of State (State) to ensure the sale would not result in harm to  U.S. interests and is consistent with national security and foreign policies.", "In response to directions in the Senate Armed Services Committee  Report on a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2012, we (1) described the composition of the U.S. TWV industrial  base and the extent of manufacturers\u2019 reliance on sales to DOD,  (2) determined how many U.S. manufactured TWVs foreign governments  purchased in fiscal years 2007 through 2011, and (3) identified factors  that are perceived as affecting foreign governments\u2019 decisions to  purchase these vehicles.", "We did not include TWV parts purchased by DOD or any efforts intended to sustain or  upgrade its existing vehicles. and electronic data testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious errors  and determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine how many U.S. TWVs were purchased by foreign  governments, we obtained FMS and DCS data for fiscal years 2007  through 2011. We obtained FMS data from the Army TACOM Life Cycle  Management Command\u2019s Security Assistance Management Directorate  and the Marine Corps Systems Command\u2019s International Programs  Directorate as they directly facilitate the FMS process for TWVs within  DOD. We obtained DCS data from the four TWV manufacturers included  in our scope. The FMS data we obtained from DOD contain foreign sales  data for the three remaining TWV manufacturers, but we did not collect  DCS data from them. We limited FMS and DCS data to vehicles that were  purchased by DOD in fiscal years 2007 through 2011 and also sold to  foreign governments. We assessed the reliability of FMS data reported by  DOD by interviewing officials knowledgeable about the data and cross- checking the data with FMS records from the four manufacturers we met  with.

Based on those efforts, we  determined that the FMS and DCS data reported to us were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To identify factors perceived as affecting foreign government decisions to  purchase U.S. TWVs, we interviewed representatives from the four U.S.  TWV manufacturers included in our scope, foreign government officials  from five selected countries, and DOD, State, and Department of  Commerce (Commerce) officials. We interviewed officials from three  countries that were among the biggest buyers of U.S. TWVs through the  FMS program in fiscal years 2007 through 2011 or DCS in fiscal years  2008 through 2011. We also interviewed officials from two allied countries  that did not purchase U.S. TWVs through the FMS program in fiscal years  2007 through 2011 or DCS in fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to gain  additional perspectives. Some of the five countries were in the process of  purchasing TWVs. Collectively, these officials provided information on  foreign manufacturers of TWVs and foreign TWV requirements.

For  example, the Army\u2019s FMTV consists of 2.5- and 5-ton capacity trucks,  each with the same chassis and includes cargo, tractor, van, wrecker,  and dump truck variants. Table 1 lists the TWVs acquired by the military  services over five fiscal years, fiscal years 2007 through 2011.", "Requirements for TWVs have evolved over the last decade, in part, due  to the operational threats encountered in Afghanistan and Iraq. TWVs  were traditionally viewed as utility vehicles that required little armor  because the vehicles operated behind the front lines. However, the tactics  used against forces in these countries dictated that vehicles needed more  protection. For example, the HMMWV was conceived and designed to  support operations in relatively benign environments behind the front line,  but it proved to be highly vulnerable to attacks from improvised explosive  devices, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire when it was  required to operate in urban environments. As a result, DOD identified an  urgent operational need for armored tactical vehicles to increase crew  protection and mobility of soldiers. Although the initial solution\u2014the Up- Armored HMMWV\u2014provided greater protection, the enemy responded by  increasing the size, explosive force, and type of improvised explosive  devices, which were capable of penetrating even the most heavily  armored vehicles. Consequently, the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  (MRAP) vehicle was approved in 2007 as a rapid acquisition capability.  DOD recognized that no single manufacturer could provide all of the  vehicles needed to meet requirements quickly enough, so it awarded  contracts to multiple manufacturers.", "The AECA authorizes the President to control the export of arms, such as  TWVs. The authority to promulgate regulations on these items has been  delegated to the Secretary of State. State administers arms transfer  controls through the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and  designates, with the concurrence of DOD, the articles and services  deemed to be arms. These arms constitute the United States Munitions  List (USML). DOD\u2019s TWVs are generally designated as Category VII  (Tanks and Military Vehicles) items on the USML.", "Arms, including TWVs, can be sold and exported to foreign governments  through the FMS program or DCS. Under the FMS program, the U.S.  government procures items on behalf of eligible foreign governments  using the same acquisition process used for its own military needs. While  State has overall regulatory responsibility for the FMS program and  approves such sales of arms to eligible foreign governments, DOD\u2019s  Defense Security Cooperation Agency administers the program.  Alternatively, the DCS process allows foreign governments to directly  negotiate with and purchase arms from U.S. manufacturers. For TWVs  controlled on the USML, manufacturers must generally apply for an  export license to State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which  authorizes the export of arms to foreign governments.", "State officials assess all arms export requests through the FMS program  and DCS license applications against 12 criteria specified in the  Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, as summarized in table 2. DOD officials assess the technical risks of the sensitive or classified electronic  equipment associated with the sale of TWVs to foreign governments,  including the type of armor, sensors or weapons attached to the vehicle,  and any signature information. Aside from these technologies, State and  DOD officials said the departments generally consider the technology  associated with TWVs comparable to commercially available trucks and  do not have any additional policies pertaining to the sale of TWVs to  foreign governments.", "In accordance with the AECA, recipient countries of arms, including  TWVs, must generally agree to a set of U.S. arms transfer conditions,  regardless if sold through the FMS program or DCS. The conditions  include agreeing to use the items only for intended purposes without  modification, not to transfer possession to anyone not an agent of the  recipient country without prior written consent of the U.S. government,  and to maintain the security of any defense article with substantially the  same degree of protection afforded to it by the U.S. government.

For example, the  manufacturers relied on six or fewer suppliers to provide components,  such as engines or tires. In contrast, the manufacturers relied on more  than 25 armor suppliers, in part, because there was a shortage of vehicle  armor during initial MRAP production. DOD reported that the  requirements for armor, in response to the conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan, provided an opportunity for several suppliers to begin  producing armor, which eventually resolved the armor shortage. In  addition to these suppliers, manufacturers we met with reported there  were potentially thousands of other companies that produced parts for  these vehicles.

DOD  demands for TWVs increased dramatically in response to the operational  demands and threats experienced by U.S. forces during Operation  Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example, between  fiscal years 1998 through 2001, before these two wars began, Army  budget documents indicate plans to purchase approximately  5,000 HMMWVs. After the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, Army  budget documents in 2003 reflected an increased requirement for  HMMWVs and, at the time, it planned to purchase approximately 23,000  though fiscal year 2009. However, after Operation Iraqi Freedom began,  the need for HMMWVs increased further and the Army reported that it  ultimately purchased approximately 64,000 between 2003 through 2009.", "As U.S. forces began to draw down from the conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan, DOD\u2019s operational requirements for TWVs declined. For  example, while DOD bought over 100,000 TWVs in fiscal years 2007 and  2008, DOD plans to purchase less than 1,000 TWVs in fiscal years 2015  and 2016.

Army  officials told us that it would cost approximately $2.5 billion per year to  sustain its current fleet of approximately 260,000 TWVs and meet any  new TWV requirements. Officials stated, however, that the Army can no  longer afford and does not need such a sized fleet, in part, due to budget  cuts and potential force structure changes. The Army is re-evaluating how  many TWVs it needs and can afford, which will be outlined in a revised  TWV strategy. In developing this revised strategy, Army officials  recognize that the Army has a relatively young fleet of TWVs, averaging  9 years of age, many of which will be part of its fleet through 2040.", "While this revised strategy has not been completed, the Army has already  made changes to reduce its TWV costs. For example, in February 2012  the Army reduced the number of FMTVs it planned to purchase by  approximately 7,400 vehicles. At that time, the Army also terminated a  HMMWV modernization effort, known as the Modernized Expanded  Capability Vehicle, which was intended to improve vehicle performance  and crew protection on over 5,700 HMMWVs. Officials stated that this  effort was terminated, in part, because of DOD-wide funding constraints.  Army officials estimate that these actions will result in a total savings of  approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Furthermore,  Army officials stated that the Army plans to reduce the size of its TWV  fleet to match force structure requirements. They also stated that, as of  July 2012, the Army plans to reduce its total fleet by over 42,000 vehicles.  Officials added that more vehicles could be divested depending on any  future force structure changes and budget constraints.", "Despite budget constraints, the industrial base will have some  opportunities over the next several years to produce a new TWV for DOD.  The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is a new DOD program, designed  to fill the gap between the HMMWV and MRAP by providing near-MRAP  level protection while maintaining all-terrain mobility. As we previously  reported, the Army and Marine Corps are pursuing a revised  developmental approach for JLTV and awarded technology development  contracts to three industry teams. The program completed the  technology development phase in January 2012. Last month, the Army  awarded three contracts for the JLTV\u2019s engineering and manufacturing  development phase. While production contracts will not be awarded for  some time, DOD reports that it plans to purchase approximately  55,000 JLTVs over a 25-year period with full rate production beginning in  fiscal year 2018. With production of other TWVs for DOD largely coming  to an end in fiscal year 2014, DOD considers the JLTV program to be  critical in maintaining an industrial base to supply TWVs to the military.", "In addition to new production, the Army and Marine Corps also plan to  invest in sustainment efforts that could be completed by the U.S. TWV  industrial base. These efforts include restoring or enhancing the combat  capability of vehicles that were destroyed or damaged due to combat  operations.

Foreign government officials  identified the following areas where their governments\u2019 requirements  differ from those of DOD:", "DOD\u2019s TWVs are generally larger than what their government can  support. For example, officials from one foreign government reported  that its military considered purchasing U.S. manufactured MRAP  vehicles but did not have the cargo planes required to transport a  vehicle the size and weight of DOD\u2019s MRAP vehicles. Instead,  according to the official, this country purchased a mine and ambush  protected vehicle developed by one of its domestic manufacturers that  is smaller and lighter than the DOD\u2019s MRAP vehicles and better  aligned with its transportation capabilities.", "Their governments do not always require the same level of  capabilities afforded by DOD\u2019s TWVs and, in some cases,  requirements may be met by commercially available vehicles. For  example, foreign government officials identified a number of vehicles  in their governments\u2019 tactical fleets that are based on commercial  products from automobile companies such as Jeep and Land Rover.", "Their governments have different automotive or design standards for  military vehicles that do not always align with those produced for DOD  by U.S. manufacturers. For example, officials from one country said  that their military is required to purchase right-side drive vehicles,  which are not always supported by U.S. manufacturers. While their  military can obtain a waiver to purchase a left-side drive vehicle, this  presents training challenges as the majority of the vehicles in its fleet  are right-side drive vehicles. Foreign officials said that while U.S.  manufacturers are capable of meeting these requirements, foreign  competitors may be more familiar with these requirements.  Manufacturers that we interviewed said they produce or are  developing TWVs to better meet foreign customers\u2019 requirements. For  example, one U.S. manufacturer said it was developing a right-side  drive variant of one of its vehicles and another manufacturer said that  it has a line of TWVs for its international customers that better meets  those requirements.", "U.S. manufacturers and foreign officials expressed mixed views on the  effect the U.S. arms transfer control regimes may have on the sale of  U.S.-manufactured TWVs to foreign customers. Officials we met with  reported that, generally, the U.S. arms transfer control regimes do not  inhibit foreign governments from purchasing U.S. manufactured TWVs.  Accordingly, we found that once the FMS and DCS process was initiated,  no eligible foreign sales or licenses for U.S. TWVs were denied. For  example, State officials reported that no countries eligible to participate in  the FMS program were denied requests to purchase TWVs in fiscal years  2007 and 2011. Similarly, State DCS license data indicated that no  licenses for vehicle purchases were denied from fiscal years 2008  through 2011.", "While sales of TWVs to foreign governments are generally approved by  the U.S. government once initiated, U.S. manufacturers and foreign  officials said that foreign governments may prefer to purchase vehicle  manufactured outside the United States, in part, due to the amount of  time to process sales and licenses requests and end-use restrictions  associated with the U.S. arms transfer control regimes. Specifically,  manufacturers said the congressional notification process can result in  lengthy delays during the FMS and DCS approval process. The AECA  requires notification to Congress between 15 and 45 days in advance of  its intent to approve certain DCS licenses or FMS agreements.  Preceding the submission of this required statutory notification to the U.S.  Congress, State provides Congress with an informal review period that  does not have a fixed time period for action. One manufacturer stated that  this informal review period, in one case, lasted over a year and, after  which, the prospective customer decided to not continue with the  purchase. Another manufacturer said that the informal congressional  notification process is unpredictable because there is no set time limit for  review, making it difficult for the manufacturer to meet delivery  commitments to foreign customers. State officials acknowledged that the  informal congressional notification period can delay the DCS and FMS  process because there is no designated time limit for review. According to  State officials, the department established a new tiered review process in  early 2012 to address this issue by establishing a time bounded informal  review period that is based on the recipient country\u2019s relationship with the  U.S. government. The formal notification period remains unchanged.", "Foreign officials said when TWVs that meet their governments\u2019  requirements are available from manufacturers outside the United States,  AECA restrictions on third party transfers and end-use administrative  requirements associated with U.S. manufactured vehicles could affect  their governments purchasing decisions. Foreign officials explained that  there are a number of TWV manufacturers outside the United States that  can meet their requirements and vehicles sold by those manufacturers do  not necessarily come with the same end-use restrictions as U.S. vehicles.  For example, the AECA restricts the transfer of arms, including U.S.  manufactured, TWVs to a third party without consent of the U.S.  government. Some foreign officials said their governments prefer to use  private companies, when possible, to make repairs and maintain its TWV  fleet because it can reduce costs compared to government repair work.  These foreign officials said that U.S. third party transfer restrictions  require that their governments obtain permission from the U.S.  government before transferring a U.S. TWV to a private company for  repairs, which creates an administrative burden. Additionally, foreign  governments are required to maintain information on U.S. TWVs\u2019 end-use  and possession that must be available to U.S. officials when requested to  ensure compliance with U.S. end-use regulations. Foreign officials from  one country said the maintenance of this information is an administrative  burden and will be more difficult to manage as their government tries to  reduce its workforce in a limited budget environment. Foreign officials  said that TWVs purchased from manufacturers outside of the Untied  States are not generally encumbered with these same restrictions and  administrative burdens, making maintenance of these vehicles easier and  cheaper, in some cases. State officials acknowledged these concerns  from foreign governments but said these restrictions play an important  role in protecting U.S. national security interests.", "Foreign officials reported, however, that the U.S. arms transfer control  regimes would not adversely affect their decision to purchase a U.S.  vehicle that best meets their governments\u2019 requirements in terms of  capabilities and cost. Foreign officials said that U.S. manufacturers make  vehicles that are reliable and highly capable. When their governments  have requirements that align with those associated with U.S.  manufactured vehicles, foreign officials said that the U.S. arms transfer  control regimes would not be a factor in their governments\u2019 decisions to  purchase the vehicles. Foreign officials that we interviewed also said their  governments are experienced buyers of U.S. arms and are able to  successfully navigate the FMS and DCS processes and U.S. end-use  restrictions to obtain the military equipment they require."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The volume of TWVs DOD purchased to meet operational requirements  in Iraq and Afghanistan was unique due to specific threats. Many of these  vehicles are no longer needed and DOD\u2019s need for new TWVs is  expected to decline in coming years. Further, given the current budgetary  environment, DOD cannot afford to support the size of its current fleet or  buy as many vehicles as it once did. Though U.S. manufacturers  increased their production to meet those past needs, they will be  challenged in responding to the sharp decline in DOD\u2019s TWV  requirements in future years. As DOD continues its studies of the U.S.  TWV industrial base, it may be better positioned to address these  challenges and how DOD can mitigate any risks to sustaining its TWV  fleet. It is unlikely that sales to foreign governments will ever offset  declines in sales to DOD, but foreign sales may be more important to the  industrial base now more than ever. U.S. manufacturers, however, are  presented with a number of factors that affect their ability to sell TWVs to  foreign governments. While no foreign officials indicated that their  governments would not buy U.S. TWVs, there has been relatively limited  demand for the vehicles U.S. manufacturers have produced for DOD.  Further, there are many foreign manufacturers that can supply vehicles  that meet foreign governments\u2019 requirements. Each of the U.S.  manufacturers we met with was either selling or developing alternative  vehicles that better meet foreign governments\u2019 requirements, but the  extent to which those efforts will stimulate additional sales has yet to be  seen. Further, U.S. manufacturers raised concerns that their competitors  could eventually include the U.S. military as it makes plans to divest itself  of used TWVs that it could make available to foreign governments at  reduced costs or for free. Additionally, while U.S. manufacturers  perceived the U.S. arms transfer control regimes to be more burdensome  than those of other countries, the regimes are not a determining factor  when foreign governments seek to purchase TWVs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Third-Party Views", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, State, and Commerce, as well  as the four manufacturers and five foreign governments with whom we  met, for their review and comment.
