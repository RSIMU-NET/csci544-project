About 96 percent of marketing identified appeared on the Internet, and a total of 490 memory supplement products were identified by the market review. GAO found 28 examples of advertisements that linked supplement use to treatment or prevention of memory-related diseases, which is generally prohibited by federal law. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials subsequently determined that 27 of these examples appeared to violate federal requirements. Officials reported that they had issued two advisory letters to two firms and would continue monitoring all of the examples that were identified.", "Oversight of memory supplements falls under FDA's general authority to regulate dietary supplements and their labeling, and the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) general authority to enforce the prohibitions against deceptive advertising. Between 2006 and 2015, FDA and FTC have taken similar types of enforcement actions for memory supplements as for other dietary supplements\u2014with most FDA actions being warning letters and FTC actions being a mix of administrative and federal court actions. Nineteen of 551enforcement actions involved memory supplements. The agencies coordinate enforcement actions in the same way for all dietary supplements. FDA and FTC have done some outreach to industry and consumers on dietary supplement use by older adults as well as some specific outreach related to memory supplement enforcement actions. In prioritizing enforcement and outreach efforts, the agencies focus on safety, egregiousness of deception, and impact of marketing.", "FDA faces challenges related to limited information about the dietary supplement market, including memory supplements, to inform its oversight efforts. FDA officials said the agency is exploring ways to obtain additional market information to improve its oversight. FTC officials believe their existing tools and information are sufficient to inform its oversight efforts. While Internet marketing of dietary supplements was a concern for agencies, consumers, and industry groups, GAO found that consumer groups were unclear about FDA's and FTC's roles for overseeing supplement marketing found on the Internet. FDA and FTC share oversight of marketing on the Internet, with FTC exercising primary jurisdiction over advertising on the Internet and FDA exercising primary jurisdiction over aspects considered to fall under labeling, including information provided at the point of sale. However, few documents explicitly delineate their differing roles and coordination in oversight, or communicate the roles to industry and consumers. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should communicate quality information with external parties to achieve objectives, and GAO has also previously reported that delineating roles and responsibilities are issues agencies should consider when collaborating. Absent clarification of FDA and FTC roles, consumers may not understand which agency to report concerns to involving Internet marketing, and there is a risk that agencies may not receive consumer complaints directly, which may delay agencies taking action to address a problem. Consumer complaints are an important tool for both agencies to learn about potential dietary supplement issues, according to agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA and FTC provide additional guidance to consumers clarifying the agencies' differing roles in their shared oversight of memory supplement and other dietary supplement marketing on the Internet.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease, considered the most common form of dementia, is a  progressive disease that begins with mild memory loss and has no known  cure. Consumers searching to prevent or treat age-related memory loss,  including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, have increasingly turned to dietary  supplements for help. Scientific evidence shows that some dietary  supplements are beneficial for overall health and for managing some  health conditions; however, in some instances, dietary supplements have  caused serious adverse health effects. Specialty dietary supplements that  claim to address specific health issues, including those that claim to  improve or in other ways positively affect memory (referred to in this  report as memory supplements), have emerged in the market. The  memory supplements market reportedly almost doubled from 2006 to  2015, with total estimated sales increasing from $353 million to $643  million.

This report examines: (1) how memory  supplements are marketed, and the extent to which the marketing targets  older adults and is potentially deceptive or inconsistent with federal  requirements; (2) what enforcement and outreach actions FDA and FTC  have undertaken in overseeing memory supplements and their marketing;  and (3) what challenges FDA and FTC face in overseeing memory  supplements.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations related  to each agency\u2019s oversight of dietary supplements. We worked with  officials from FDA and FTC, as well as representatives from the HHS  National Institutes of Health, to develop and obtain concurrence on a  single definition of memory supplements for the purposes of this review.  To determine how memory supplements are marketed, and the extent to  which the marketing targets older adults and is potentially deceptive or  inconsistent with federal requirements, we conducted a market review in  which we monitored five media channels (the Internet, retail stores,  television, magazines, and newspapers) in 2 months of 2016, targeting  media most likely used by older adults, to identify, catalogue, and review  memory supplement advertisements for marketing claims. We also  conducted a targeted review of the Internet search results from the  market review to identify (1) examples of Internet marketing containing  memory supplement advertisements in the form of text and visuals  targeting older adults, and (2) visuals that may positively affect a  consumer\u2019s view of the product, such as pictures of medical professionals  or testimonials made by older adults. Although our review of the memory  supplement market is not generalizable and cannot be projected to the  entire memory supplement market, we believe that our sampling  methodology provides us with the ability to obtain important insights into  memory supplement marketing practices. In addition, we identified and  reviewed marketing claims for examples that may be potentially deceptive  or in violation of federal requirements\u2013specifically, disease-related claims  that a product can treat, cure, or prevent a memory-related disease. We  shared the examples with staff from FDA and FTC for their review.", "To determine what enforcement and outreach actions FDA and FTC have  undertaken in overseeing memory supplements and their marketing, we  collected and analyzed agency oversight policies. We also conducted  semistructured interviews with FDA and FTC officials to review their  activities and guidance related to dietary supplement enforcement and  outreach efforts. We also interviewed agency officials about strategic  plans and program priorities related to dietary supplements as well as  reviewed documents showing how each agency prioritizes dietary  supplement work in their enforcement or outreach efforts. Additionally, we  conducted semistructured interviews with consumer groups and industry  associations regarding FDA and FTC oversight efforts of dietary  supplements, including memory supplements and efforts specific to older  adults. Finally, we obtained and analyzed data from FDA and FTC on  their enforcement actions involving dietary supplements and memory  supplements for fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2015\u2014the most  recent years for which such data were available at the time of our review.  As part of this analysis, we interviewed FDA and FTC staff about these  memory supplement actions. Based on our analysis of the data provided  on memory supplement enforcement actions as well as the responses  from FDA and FTC officials to our questions about these data, we  determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  providing the number of enforcement actions taken by each agency that  involved dietary supplements as well as the number of enforcement  actions taken by each agency that involved memory supplements.", "To identify what challenges FDA and FTC face in overseeing memory  supplements, we interviewed agency officials, consumer groups, and  industry groups, and reviewed relevant documentation. We analyzed top- marketed memory supplements to identify potential new dietary  ingredients (NDI), and asked FDA officials to confirm whether the  supplements contained an NDI and whether a notification was filed with  FDA for the product, to the extent possible.

FDA and FTC authorities related to dietary  supplements are generally limited to after dietary supplements go to  market (postmarket). In general, neither agency has premarket authority  that allows for approvals of labeling or advertising claims before dietary  supplements may be sold to consumers, although as explained below,  under relevant provisions of FDA regulations, firms may not make health  claims that FDA has not authorized. Under DSHEA, FDA does not have  the authority to require dietary supplements to be approved for safety or  effectiveness before they are sold to consumers, as it does for drugs.  Additional details about FDA oversight of supplements can be found in  figure 2.", "Additional details about FTC oversight of supplements can be found in  figure 3.", "Dietary supplement firms must meet federal requirements for dietary  supplements related to safety, quality, and labeling elements, including  the following:  Quality Requirements. FDA established current good manufacturing  practice regulations for dietary substances describing the conditions  under which supplements must be manufactured, packed, labeled, and  held. These requirements were implemented in phases, according to  company size, and became fully effective in 2010.", "Required Labeling Elements. FDA regulations implementing DSHEA  require that dietary supplement labels include, among other things, a  statement of identity that identifies the product as a supplement, a list of  ingredients present in significant amounts and the quantity of such  ingredients in the product. Since December 2007, the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the 2006 Dietary Supplement  and Non-prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, has required dietary  supplement manufacturers, distributors, or packers (dietary supplement  firms) to include on the dietary supplement product label several  elements, including the firm\u2019s name and a domestic phone number or  domestic address for individuals to submit an adverse event report to the  manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the product  label as a way, according to FDA officials, to enhance FDA\u2019s ability to  identify and act on public health issues associated with the use of dietary  supplements.", "FDA Labeling Claim Requirements. Under federal law, firms can make  certain labeling claims about dietary supplements but are generally  prohibited from claiming that a supplement can treat, cure, or prevent a  disease (such claims are referred to as disease claims). Allowable claims  for foods are generally either: structure-function and related types of  claims, health claims, or nutrient content claims. The Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act stipulates that the firm submit structure-function and  related types of label claims to FDA for review within 30 days of the  dietary supplement\u2019s first being marketed with the claim. FDA reviews the  claims that firms make about dietary supplements, including the following:", "Structure-function and related types of claims: Structure-function  claims describe the role of substances intended to affect the normal  structure or function in humans. An example of a structure-function  claim would be \u201ccalcium builds strong bones.\u201d Related types of claims  include those related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease for  which the prevalence of such disease in the United States is disclosed  with the claim, and general well-being claims from the consumption of  a dietary ingredient. DSHEA requires that the manufacturer have  substantiation that structure-function claims in labeling are truthful and  not misleading. This requirement is consistent with FTC\u2019s requirement  that advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, and substantiated.", "Health claims: Health claims characterize the relationship between a  substance (food or food component) to a disease or health-related  condition. To make a health claim, the firm must first present FDA  with a petition or notification that contains scientific evidence  supporting the proposed claim, and FDA must authorize the claim  before it can be made. Health claims are limited to express or implied  claims about disease risk reduction and cannot be claims about the  cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. For example,  \u201cLow fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat  and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C) may reduce  the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many  factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of  dietary fiber,\u201d characterizes the reduced risk of the disease and has  been authorized by FDA. In addition, in response to a federal appeals  court ruling, FDA allows \u201cqualified health claims.\u201d Qualified health  claims are health claims not authorized as health claims but for which  the agency has stated its intention to exercise enforcement discretion  (i.e., to refrain from taking enforcement action) under certain  circumstances. Qualified health claims must include qualifying  language that characterizes the level of evidence supporting the  health claim, as well as any other information necessary to prevent  the claim from being misleading. FDA reviews a qualified health claim  petition and responds with a letter of enforcement discretion that  outlines the level of evidence the agency found and the conditions  under which the claim may be used, or a letter of denial if the claim is  not supported by credible evidence. For example, FDA has issued a  letter stating it intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion  for, among other claims, \u201cconsumption of phosphatidylserine may  reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly.\u201d", "Nutrient content claims: Nutrient content claims describe the level of  a nutrient in a food using terms such as \u201cfree,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d or \u201clow,\u201d or they  compare the level of a nutrient in a food to that of another food, using  terms such as \u201cmore,\u201d \u201creduced,\u201d or \u201clight.\u201d For example, a  statement such as \u201conly 200 mg of sodium\u201d characterizes the level of  sodium as being low and would have to conform to the criteria of an  appropriate nutrient content claim or carry a disclosure statement. The  Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 permits the use of  nutrient content claims if they have been authorized by FDA and are  made in accordance with FDA\u2019s authorizing regulations.", "FTC Requirements for Advertising Claims. In regulating advertising,  according to FTC guidance, all parties who participate directly or indirectly  in the marketing of dietary supplements have an obligation to make sure  that claims are presented truthfully and to check the adequacy of the  support behind those claims. To this end, FTC may take actions against  supplement manufacturers as well as advertising agencies, distributors,  retailers, catalog companies, infomercial producers, and others involved  in promotions it deems as deceptive. In addition, while FDA\u2019s laws and  regulations governing structure-function claims, health claims, and  nutrient content claims do not apply to the FTC and its authority over  advertising, structure-function claims must be truthful and not misleading,  and they must be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific  evidence. Further, according to FTC guidance, the agency generally  defers to FDA authorizations of health claims and generally applies FDA\u2019s  definitions for nutrient content claims to advertising.", "New Dietary Ingredients. Under DSHEA, dietary supplement firms with  an NDI\u2014an ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before  October 15, 1994\u2014may be required to notify FDA at least 75 days before  marketing the product, depending on whether this ingredient has been  present in the food supply. The NDI notification should include information  showing that the product containing the ingredient is reasonably expected  to be safe. The NDI notification process is not a premarket approval  process, and, as with other dietary supplements, to find that an NDI is  adulterated, FDA must demonstrate that there is inadequate information  to ensure a supplement containing an NDI does not present a significant  or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. There has been a long-standing  effort by FDA to issue guidance to industry on the NDI notification  process. We recommended in previous reports issued in 2009 and 2013  that FDA issue NDI guidance. FDA issued draft guidance in 2011 and  revised draft guidance in August 2016, but this guidance has not yet been  finalized and FDA is in the process of reviewing public comments on it.", "Over the years, GAO has issued multiple reports and testimonies related  to dietary supplement safety, labeling, and claims. For example, in 2010,  we found potentially deceptive marketing about dietary supplements,  including potential disease claims. Similarly in 2011, we reported that  consumers find it difficult to understand the differences among claims and  that consumers are just as likely to purchase a product with a structure- function claim (which FDA does not verify) as they are to purchase a  product with a health claim supported by significant scientific agreement  (which FDA does verify). Based on our findings in 2011, we  recommended that FDA provide guidance to industry on the level of scientific evidence to substantiate structure-function claims, and also  recommended that FDA pursue legal authorities to allow the agency to  obtain evidence for claims from food companies (including dietary  supplement firms). Lastly, we also recommended that FDA provide  additional guidance to inspectors for identifying potentially false or  deceptive structure-function claims on labels.

Under the  memorandum of understanding, FDA and FTC each designate a liaison  to serve as the primary contact to coordinate activity as needed, such as  when similar claims are found in both labeling and advertising, or when  marketing material may be construed as either advertising or labeling, or  both. The memorandum of understanding specifies that FDA has primary  responsibility for preventing the misbranding of foods, among other items,  shipped in interstate commerce and will exercise primary jurisdiction over  all matters regulating the labeling of foods (which includes dietary  supplements); and that FTC has primary responsibility with respect to the  regulation of the truth or falsity of all advertising (other than labeling) of  foods (including dietary supplements), among other things, and will  exercise primary jurisdiction over all matters regulating the truth or falsity  of advertising of foods.

To identify potential safety or quality concerns related  to dietary supplements, both agencies conduct surveillance activities  to monitor dietary supplement firms and markets. These surveillance  activities may result in enforcement actions and related outreach. FDA  primarily relies on postmarket surveillance efforts, such as monitoring  reports of health problems or adverse event reports it receives from  industry, health-care practitioners, and individuals; reviewing  consumer and industry complaints; and conducting inspections of  dietary supplement firms. Similarly, FTC relies on postmarket  surveillance efforts, such as its Consumer Sentinel Network that  collects reports from consumers about potentially deceptive or  untruthful advertising, according to agency officials; and conducting  routine Internet monitoring for a range of potential advertising  violations. Examples of FDA and FTC surveillance actions are listed in  table 1.", "Enforcement. FDA and FTC both take enforcement actions against  dietary supplement products and firms if they identify violations.", "Once FDA identifies a concern, it may take enforcement action  against a firm through advisory and regulatory actions. Advisory  actions\u2014such as sending a warning or untitled letter to a dietary  supplement firm that manufactures, distributes, or packs a dietary  supplement\u2014notify firms that FDA has found the firm uncompliant with dietary supplement manufacturing or labeling regulations.  Regulatory actions are actions that either restrain dietary  supplement firms from manufacturing dietary supplements or  remove specific dietary supplements from the market, or prevent  entry into U.S. commerce of imported products. Among the  regulatory actions available to FDA are administrative  enforcement tools such as issuing a mandatory recall,  suspending a firm\u2019s registration, administratively detaining a  product, or refusing entry to an imported product; judicial court  actions such as seeking an injunction against a firm, initiating  prosecution of a firm, or filing a seizure action against products  that are adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of  federal law; and conducting rulemaking to restrict or prohibit the  use of a specific ingredient. In any of these cases FDA must  demonstrate that the relevant statutory standard has been met.  For example, FDA can take a variety of the above actions if a  dietary supplement is adulterated, which can be established by,  for example, demonstrating that it, or a dietary ingredient  contained within, presents a significant or unreasonable risk of  illness or injury.", "Under its responsibilities, once FTC identifies potentially deceptive  or untruthful advertising, it may take enforcement action against a  firm or individual through administrative court actions or judicial  court actions. Before taking such action, FTC may compel firms to  produce documents and other information, such as marketing and  labeling materials, sales information, and relevant substantiation  materials. Administrative court actions are complaints issued by  FTC that are adjudicated before an administrative law judge.  These complaints may result in settlements through consent  decrees or, in subsequent actions in a federal judicial court to  enforce administrative orders, injunctions, and civil penalties.  Federal judicial court actions are direct challenges in a district  court and can result in injunctions and monetary relief.", "Outreach. To help inform the public\u2014including both consumers and  industry\u2014about potential health or safety issues related to dietary  supplements, FDA and FTC conduct various outreach efforts. Such  efforts can be educational outreach or outreach conducted in response to  a specific enforcement action taken by one or both of the agencies.  Examples of key outreach efforts include consumer or public education  (such as alerts about Internet scams or safety problems), guidance for  industry or consumers (such as on how firms can make sure their dietary  supplement claims have appropriate scientific support), and publicly  available press releases (such as those informing the public about the  results of enforcement actions like court injunctions or product recalls that  warn the public and, according to FDA officials, aim to prevent similar  violations in the future)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Memory Supplements Were Marketed on the Internet, and, While Few Advertisements Targeted Older Adults, Some May Have Violated Federal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Most of the memory supplement marketing we identified was on the  Internet, with few examples that included text or visuals (images and  videos) targeting older adults.

Of the 551 dietary supplement actions taken by FDA, 19  involved memory supplements. Similar to its enforcement actions for  other dietary supplements, the majority of the 19 memory supplement  enforcement actions FDA took between 2006 and 2015 were advisory,  namely notification by FDA that the agency has found the firm out of  compliance with dietary supplement manufacturing or labeling regulations  or with the prohibition against marketing an unapproved new drug.  Specifically, these 19 memory supplement enforcement actions consisted  of 17 advisory actions (6 untitled letters and 11 warning letters) and 2  regulatory actions (1 injunction and 1 seizure), as shown in table 3.", "FDA\u2019s two regulatory actions involving memory supplements consisted of  one injunction and one seizure. FDA filed for an injunction in 2011 against  a dietary supplement firm and its principals whose products\u2019 advertising  continued to contain prohibited claims to treat or cure Alzheimer\u2019s, among  other diseases, despite prior FDA warnings to stop making claims to treat  the disease. Similarly, FDA brought action in federal court in 2012 to  seize dietary supplements that were marketed for treating a variety of  diseases or conditions, including dementia. In addition, FDA determined  that the products were not manufactured according to the current good  manufacturing practice regulations. FDA officials told us the agency has  subsequently closed these cases. Such disease claims are no longer  present on the memory supplement products\u2019 websites and, according to  FDA officials, the agency has not taken further public action on these  cases.", "FDA staff investigate and pursue actions against firms and products as  individual safety concerns or other violations are identified. According to  FDA officials within the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs\u2014the  office that leads and sets priorities for FDA dietary supplement  enforcement efforts\u2014the agency currently plans to prioritize actions  against products presenting immediate safety concerns, given its limited  resources, rather than focusing on actions against a specific therapeutic  category of dietary supplements.", "In terms of FTC enforcement actions involving memory supplements, the  agency took some administrative and judicial actions involving memory  supplements between fiscal years 2006 and 2015, similar to its  enforcement actions for other dietary supplements. Approximately 3  percent (2 of 78) of FTC\u2019s dietary supplement enforcement actions  involved memory supplements, as shown in table 4. These 2 FTC  enforcement actions involving memory supplements included 1  administrative action and 1 judicial action.", "In 2014, FTC took an administrative action after it determined that  advertising for a dietary supplement, that included claims that the  supplement was \u201cclinically shown to improve adult memory,\u201d was not  backed by adequate scientific evidence. The administrative action applied  to two supplement firms responsible for the claims, and the settlement  bars them from making such claims unless those claims are supported by  reliable scientific evidence and clinical proof, among other things. In 2015,  FTC took judicial action when it filed suit against a firm for deceptive  advertising claims after finding that the claim that its supplement could,  for example, \u201chelp users match the memory power of others 15 years  younger in as little as 30 days!\u201d were false, misleading, and  unsubstantiated.

As of February 2017, according to FTC  officials, they have not conducted targeted enforcement sweeps of the  Internet or other media channels focusing specifically on memory  supplements. Further, FTC officials would not confirm whether the agency  plans to conduct enforcement sweeps focused specifically on memory  supplements in the future, due to the sensitive nature of its law  enforcement priorities. FTC officials also acknowledged that one  approach it could take to targeted enforcement against deceptive memory  supplements would be to identify a handful of firms with the most  aggressive advertisements or largest market share, and then look into the  validity of those claims.", "In sharing jurisdiction for dietary supplements, FDA and FTC coordinate  enforcement actions based on the 1971 agreement. Based on the 1971  memorandum of understanding, the agencies have articulated where  each has primary responsibilities for oversight of dietary supplements (a  type of food) and their related marketing \u2014with FDA generally  responsible for supplement safety and labeling and FTC generally  responsible for supplement advertising. Staff from each agency confer by  phone on a quarterly basis to discuss and coordinate individual and joint  efforts. Agency officials also meet as needed between quarterly  meetings to exchange information on specific cases. According to FDA  and FTC officials, FDA scientists sometimes serve as resources or  experts for FTC in investigations involving dietary supplements.", "FDA and FTC have conducted joint enforcement actions involving some  dietary supplements, but, to date, the agencies have not conducted a joint  enforcement action specifically involving memory supplements. When  asked about future plans to conduct joint enforcement actions on memory  supplements, officials from both agencies noted that, due to the sensitive  nature of their law enforcement role, they would not publicly disclose  specific future enforcement plans or give information about ongoing  investigations. However, FDA and FTC both emphasize the importance of  collaborating with their partners in their strategic planning and budget  documents. FTC officials noted that, while memory supplement cases to  date may not have required joint enforcement action, any FTC case that  involves dietary supplements will involve some level of interaction with  FDA, as with the two memory supplement cases FTC took enforcement  action against between 2006 and 2015.", "In deciding how to pursue cases, and in maximizing agency resources  and the effectiveness of this collaboration, FDA and FTC told us that they  consider what strategies or procedures promise the greatest benefit to the  public. To this end, FDA and FTC may identify the same product or firm  as potentially violating federal requirements, and in such an instance the  two agencies may work together to decide how best to proceed. They  may choose (1) to each pursue the case independently, (2) to pursue the  case jointly, or (3) that one agency is in a better position to pursue the  case because it has a clearer path or stronger enforcement tools to bring  the firms or products into compliance or to otherwise resolve the potential  violation. For example, firms are required to possess evidence that  substantiates the claims being made; that is, scientific evidence that  provides a reasonable basis for the claims being made on product labels  and in product advertisements. Firms are not required to put this  substantiation information on their websites or provide it to consumers;  however, FTC has the authority to compel substantiation evidence for  product claims. In contrast, FDA does not have explicit authority to  compel such substantiation. Consequently, there may be some instances,  according to agency officials, where the two agencies agree that FTC  should pursue the case instead of or in conjunction with FDA given its  authority to compel documentation. Additionally, FTC officials told us that  they generally refer all instances where product safety is at issue, such as  where a product claims to be acting as a drug, to FDA; similarly, FDA  officials told us that they may refer cases to FTC where only fraud is at  issue and that they focus where FTC does not have jurisdiction over such  things as manufacturing, to make sure each agency is conducting  different types of work and given the agency\u2019s limited resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and FTC Have Conducted Some Outreach on Dietary Supplement Use by Older Adults, as Well as Some Specific Outreach about Memory Supplement Enforcement Actions", "paragraphs": ["FDA and FTC have conducted some outreach aimed at industry and  consumers on dietary supplements generally, including dietary  supplement use by older adults, as well as some outreach accompanying  enforcement actions specifically involving memory supplements.

Further, both FDA and FTC use  agency press releases as well as blog posts or updates to educate  industry and the general public about specific enforcement actions taken  involving dietary supplements, including memory supplements. For  example, FDA issued a press release in October 2012 regarding a  seizure of memory supplement products that claimed to treat or cure  specific diseases, including senile dementia. While FDA and FTC have  conducted outreach to consumers on certain general categories of dietary  supplements, such as weight loss or sexual enhancement, the agencies  have not conducted similar efforts aimed at the general category of  memory supplements. Rather, according to agency officials, limiting  outreach on memory supplements to specific enforcement actions  involving memory supplements was the best use of limited resources  given the size of the market and scope of violations to date.

To review the NDI  notification process, we analyzed three highly advertised memory  supplement products for any ingredients that may be NDIs subject to  notification, and we then provided FDA with a list of these memory  supplement products and their ingredients, asking FDA officials to confirm  whether the products included an NDI and whether a notification was  filed, to the extent possible. The selected products contained a total of  39 ingredients, and we identified 9 unique ingredients as possible NDIs  based on data on previous NDI notifications. FDA officials provided  information indicating whether ingredients in the products potentially  matched a previous NDI notification, but told us that they would have to  conduct a full investigation of a supplement and its ingredients to  determine whether it is subject to NDI notification requirements.  According to FDA officials, supplement firms have initial responsibility for  determining if a supplement product contains an NDI subject to the  notification requirement before marketing the product, and the agency  has the burden of showing that a firm has not met this requirement.

Consumer complaints on supplement issues are an important tool for  both agencies to identify issues with memory supplement products,  according to officials. If consumers do not understand the different  agency authorities over Internet marketing, there is a risk that consumers  will not report issues to the proper agency, and there is a risk that it may  take longer for the appropriate agency to learn about a potential problem  and take action. Along these lines, one of the consumer groups we spoke  to told us that it was not always clear which agency they should report  potential issues to involving Internet marketing, and in these cases, they  chose to report all issues to FTC because the agency had been more  responsive to their past referrals. Developing and publishing additional  guidance delineating agency roles could help consumers better  understand where to report concerns about supplement issues that  involve Internet marketing. Such actions would be in line with federal  internal control standards that state that agencies should communicate  quality information with external parties to achieve objectives.

Specifically, we identified senior living facilities in the Washington,  D.C., metropolitan area and used an annual market survey conducted  by Food World, a trade news publication, to identify the top 10 grocery  retailers in the Washington, D.C., area. We then identified a senior  living facility with a grocery retailer in close proximity and the next  closest grocery store in the same chain, as well as the closest  supplement retailer. For all three stores, we reviewed and catalogued  all memory supplements for sale, as well as any marketing displays  for memory supplements.", "Television: We selected three television networks to review for  memory supplement marketing using data on top shows for older  adults. Due to technical constraints, we could only record two  broadcast and one cable channel simultaneously, which limited our  review to three channels. Specifically, we used data on the top 10  prime-time broadcast shows viewed by older adults to select two  broadcast networks. We also identified the number one program  among older adults and conducted a TV listing search using TV  Guide, a magazine that provides television program listings, to identify  the equivalent cable network that airs the program. We recorded and  reviewed 4 days of television programming for the three selected  stations, cataloguing any memory supplement advertisements.", "Magazines: We identified appropriate magazines using Mediamark\u2019s  \u201cFall 2015 Magazine Audience Estimates,\u201d a market research report  on magazine readership and demographics. Specifically, we identified  all magazines in the report where the median age of the audience was  50 or greater and then identified the three magazines with the largest  readership. The three magazines did not include a health-related  magazine, which we thought would be pertinent to the topic of the  review, so we used the data to identify the health-related magazine  with the largest readership within the 50 and older age group. We  reviewed an issue of each magazine consistent with the market  review period\u2014April and May 2016\u2014cataloguing any memory  supplement advertisements.", "Newspapers: We reviewed three Sunday newspapers published on  April 3, 2016. We selected the Sunday newspapers based on highest  total print circulation for newspapers published in the Washington,  D.C.; Seattle; and Dallas areas, locations that coincided with GAO  staff offices and covered different regions across the country.  Specifically, we determined the highest total print circulation numbers  for the Sunday newspapers for the Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and  Dallas areas using the \u201cAverage Circulation at the Top 25 U.S.  Sunday Newspapers\u201d published by the Alliance for Audited Media, an  organization that provides independently verified media data. We  reviewed the selected newspapers for the same Sunday to identify  any memory supplement advertisements.", "We conducted a number of analyses on the market review data to identify  memory supplement marketing practices as described below:  For all the examples of memory supplement marketing that we identified  on the Internet, in-store, and TV media channels\u20141,590 in total\u2014we  assessed whether there was sufficient information for review; specifically,  that the associated product met the definition of a memory supplement  and the advertisement provided claims information was at the product  level. For 91 unique memory supplement products identified on the three  media channels, we identified labels or advertisements that contained  sufficient information. We reviewed these results for instances where  advertisements claimed products are clinically proven or studied and  provided supporting evidence for the claim. We did not evaluate product  claims for accuracy and truthfulness or product effectiveness.", "We also conducted a targeted review of the marketing examples from the  Internet to identify examples of memory supplement marketing targeting  older adults. Specifically, we conducted a targeted word search of the  Internet search results using the Adobe search function to identify  examples of targeted text, and manually reviewed advertisement  screenshots and the Internet search results to identify visuals depicting  older adults. We also reviewed the Internet search results to identify additional visuals that may encourage a consumer to purchase the  product, such as pictures of medical professionals or older adult  testimonials and endorsements.", "To identify marketing claims that may be considered deceptive or in  violation of federal requirements, we reviewed memory supplement  marketing for disease-related claims that a product can treat, cure, or  prevent a memory-related disease. Such claims are generally prohibited.  Specifically, we conducted targeted online searches using a variety of  search terms, and we reviewed all memory supplement marketing  identified on the five media channels for potentially inappropriate claims.  Marketing examples we identified as potentially deceptive or in violation  of federal requirements were shared with staff from FDA and FTC for their  review as to whether the claims may be considered deceptive or in  violation of requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Memory Supplement Enforcement Actions and Outreach", "paragraphs": ["To determine what enforcement and outreach actions FDA and FTC have  undertaken in overseeing memory supplements and their marketing, we  interviewed FDA and FTC officials on the definition of memory  supplements and collected and analyzed agency oversight policies. We  worked with officials from FDA and FTC, as well as representatives from  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National  Institutes of Health, to develop and obtain concurrence on a single  definition of memory supplements for the purposes of this review. In  addition, we conducted semistructured interviews with FDA and FTC  officials to review their activities and guidance related to dietary  supplement enforcement and outreach efforts. We also interviewed  agency officials about strategic plans and program priorities as well as  reviewed documents showing how each agency prioritizes dietary  supplement work, including whether memory supplements or older adults  are an area of focus in their enforcement or outreach efforts. Additionally,  we conducted semistructured interviews with consumer groups and  industry associations regarding FDA and FTC oversight efforts of dietary  supplements, including memory supplements and efforts specific to older  adults. Finally, we obtained and analyzed enforcement data involving  dietary supplements and memory supplements from FDA and FTC for  fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2015\u2014the most recent years for  which such data were available at the time of our review. As part of this  analysis, we interviewed FDA and FTC officials about these memory  supplements actions. Based on our analysis of the data provided on  memory supplements enforcement actions as well as the responses by  FDA and FTC officials to our questions about these data, we determined  these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing the  number of enforcement actions taken by each agency that involved  dietary supplements as well as the number of enforcement actions taken  by each agency that involved memory supplements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Memory Supplement Oversight", "paragraphs": ["To identify what challenges FDA and FTC face in overseeing memory  supplements, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed relevant  documentation. In addition, we conducted a series of semistructured  interviews with five consumer groups and four industry groups.

The industry groups we spoke to include the Better  Business Bureau\u2019s Advertising Self-Regulatory Council National  Advertising Division, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the  Council for Responsible Nutrition, and the Natural Products Association.  We identified the consumer groups actively working on dietary  supplement issues as well as the dietary supplement industry groups  through a review of past GAO reports on dietary supplements, Internet  searches for groups actively engaged in dietary supplement issues,  referrals from agency officials, and interviews with other consumer groups  and industry associations. To review challenges around oversight of new  dietary ingredients (NDI), we analyzed the ingredients for highly  advertised memory supplement products to identify potential NDIs. We  used data from our review of the memory supplement market, as  described above, to identify highly advertised memory supplements by  determining the total number of advertisements for memory supplement  products, and then identifying those products with the most  advertisements. We provided FDA officials with three highly advertised  supplements that we identified as containing potential NDIs, based on a  comparison of the ingredients to a list of past NDI notifications. We asked  FDA officials to confirm whether the supplements contained an NDI and  whether a notification was filed for the product, to the extent possible.  Where applicable, we also assessed FDA and FTC oversight issues and  challenges against federal internal control standards for communicating  quality information with external parties to achieve objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to May 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
