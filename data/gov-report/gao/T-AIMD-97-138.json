The act required that the Special Trustee provide oversight of reforms within Interior, including development of policies, procedures, and systems. The act also required the Special Trustee to develop a comprehensive Strategic Plan to cover all phases of the trust fund business cycle\u2014land and lease ownership determinations and recordkeeping, natural resource asset management, and trust fund management, including accounting and investment. In April 1997, the Special Trustee submitted his Strategic Plan to the Congress.", "The Strategic Plan proposes a new organization, independent of the Department of the Interior, to administer trust fund accounting and asset programs. It also proposes adding new functions, such as an Indian archives center, and acquiring new accounting, land record, and lease management systems. The Plan would give the new organization authority for the management and oversight of certain other Indian asset management programs, such as natural resource and realty management functions, that would remain with Interior as well as programs administered by Self-Governance and Self-Determination tribes who have agreements with the government to administer certain programs. These proposals are estimated to cost $168 million for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 and another $61 million and $56 million for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, respectively. The cost estimates included in the Strategic Plan are based on the costs of similar functions performed by private sector trust companies, vendor estimates, actual costs of functions currently performed by some Interior agencies, and assumptions about the workload, staffing, and number of locations to be serviced.", "In addition, the Plan proposes establishing an Indian economic development bank to be capitalized by the federal government.

In addition, MMS performs compliance audits that are directed at ensuring that Indian royalty payments are consistent with lease terms and production volume. MMS also provides funding to some tribes for cooperative agreements to perform their own compliance audits.", "OTFM, in the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, accounts for nonmineral revenues and distributes mineral royalties received from MMS to tribal and individual Indian accounts, based on lease and ownership information. OTFM disburses unrestricted funds to account holders upon request. OTFM also invests IIM and tribal trust funds on behalf of account holders. While IIM accounts are currently maintained in BIA\u2019s Integrated Records Management System as separate accounts, OTFM invests the cash balances in these accounts as a pool, primarily in U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency securities. OTFM invests tribal funds in government securities or collateralized accounts in federal depository banks.", "The Office of American Indian Trust, in the Office of the Secretary of the Interior, conducts annual reviews of tribes\u2019 performance of trust functions assumed under the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994.

These overall weaknesses preclude account holders from having assurance that their account balances are accurate and that their assets are being prudently managed.", "Currently, trust fund accounting and asset management are complicated by the lack of adequate numbers of trained field staff. In fiscal year 1996, the Congress transferred the funding for BIA\u2019s Financial Trust Services to OST. As a result, on February 9, 1996, a Secretarial Order made OST responsible for accounting for IIM receipts and, as a result, a number of BIA staff were transferred to OTFM. However, at a number of area and agency offices, small staffs handle a wide variety of duties of which trust activities are only one part. Consequently, there are insufficient field staff at present to provide separate, full-time collection and accounting functions for OTFM and separate, full-time leasing and ownership recordkeeping staff for BIA.", "As a result, depending on the agency office, either OTFM or BIA performs IIM accounting functions and procedures for processing receipts, leasing activities, paying allowed claims, administering IIM accounts (including establishing new accounts), monitoring leases, performing guardianship activities, and billing and printing checks. In addition, lines of supervision and accountability are sometimes blurred. This problem has not yet been resolved.", "Moreover, continued fractionation of Indian land and lease ownerships has seriously complicated trust fund accounting and asset management. According to the Strategic Plan, Interior may soon be unable to cope with the recordkeeping of land titles and accurate distribution of income due to the worsening fractionation. The Plan contains a proposal for dealing with this problem. Interior officials agree that fractionation must be reduced and eliminated to ensure the success of Indian trust fund accounting and resource management reforms.

Also, it would use funds transferred from MMS to contract with MMS for compliance and control functions and perform oversight of self-governance tribes, respectively. However, AITDA would have the option to contract with other entities for these services.", "In addition, the Plan would create the following three new organizations within AITDA: the National Indian Fiduciary Records Center, responsible for controlling and preserving all Indian trust-related records, to be located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, near OTFM; a trust risk management unit to conduct operational audits, credit and compliance reviews and audits of outside servicers (including BIA, BLM, MMS, and tribes) and to perform appraisals and other asset management functions; and a centralized technical center for data processing.", "To support the operations of the new organization, the Plan calls for hiring qualified staff; acquiring or modifying trust fund accounting and asset management systems; developing policies and procedures and internal controls; and implementing internal and external audit functions.", "The major systems that would collectively support the new organization fall under an umbrella concept known as the Trust Asset and Accounting Management System (TAAMS). TAAMS would include trust asset and accounting systems, a land title and records system, and a trust fund general ledger accounting system.", "The second phase of the Strategic Plan would establish a bank and trust company\u2014the American Indian Trust and Development Bank (TD Bank)\u2014to provide full financial services and economic development funding to Indians.

The TD Bank would be authorized to invest up to 25 percent (initially $125 million) of its permanent capital in eligible individual Indian and tribal business ventures and projects. The TD Bank would also be allowed to invest up to $300 million for the purchase, holding, and financing of fractionated Indian realty interests on allotted lands.", "The Plan also proposes that the TD Bank be authorized to receive up to $5 billion in additional funding from borrowing to provide loans and other economic development funding to American Indians.

Because Interior lacks the financial and managerial resources to clean up the records, the Special Trustee proposes that the cleanup be outsourced to independent contractors. This proposal is consistent with our past recommendations. Cleanup of IIM accounts is under way, and cleanup of appraisal and lease and ownership backlogs could begin within a relatively short time.", "As part of TAAMS, the Strategic Plan proposes that the commercial trust accounting and investment system\u2014which is currently used by OTFM for tribal accounts\u2014be expanded to include a component for IIM accounting. Currently, IIM accounts are maintained on BIA\u2019s Integrated Records Management System (IRMS), which is not a trust accounting system. However, in determining the appropriate timing for acquiring an IIM commercial trust accounting system component, certain questions need to be addressed, including whether to (1) convert all IIM accounts to the new system immediately, or convert them as they are cleaned up, (2) identify and archive inactive accounts before conversion, (3) convert small-balance or pass-through accounts (zero balance accounts where receipts are immediately withdrawn) to the new system or maintain them separately.

For example, the Strategic Plan refers to MMS\u2019 mineral royalty collection and accounting function, but it also refers to AITDA acquiring a mineral management and accounting system. In addition, the Plan does not adequately define all interrelated business functions, such as the co-located BIA, BLM, and MMS mineral program office in Farmington, New Mexico, or how the proposed new organization will work with BIA, BLM, and MMS to provide assistance to tribes on mineral leasing activities. Furthermore, the Plan does not adequately address how BIA\u2019s agriculture, forestry, and realty activities will be performed in the future.", "Finally, the Plan was developed without sufficient input from affected Interior agencies.

These include the development of a strategic Information Resources Management (IRM) plan, criteria for the evaluation of major information system investments, and an information architecture which aligns technology with mission goals. Because OST has not developed a strategic IRM plan, and investment process, or an information architecture, the organization risks acquiring systems that will not meet their business needs.", "In late May 1997, in response to the Clinger-Cohen Act, Interior hired a Chief Information Officer (CIO) with both industry and federal agency experience. The CIO and the Special Trustee need to work closely to ensure that the investments in information systems are made appropriately and effectively.
