This report examines (1) how TSA assesses the training needs of air marshal candidates and incumbent air marshals, and any opportunities that exist to improve this assessment, and (2) the extent to which FAMS ensures that incumbent air marshals are mission ready.", "GAO analyzed FAMS training data for calendar year 2014, the last year of available data, reviewed TSA, OTD and DHS guidance and policies on FAMS's air marshal training program, interviewed TSA and FAMS headquarters officials, and visited the TSA Training Center and 7 of FAMS 22 field offices selected based on size and geographic dispersion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Office of Training and Development (OTD) assesses air marshals' training needs using several information sources, but opportunities exist to obtain more feedback from air marshals on whether the training courses they must take met their needs. OTD primarily assesses air marshals' training needs by holding curriculum development and review conferences composed of OTD officials, training instructors, and other subject matter experts. In assessing courses, conference participants use, among other things, the results of surveys that some air marshals complete on the effectiveness of their training. However, while OTD administers these surveys for air marshal candidates and newly graduated air marshals, it does not use them to obtain feedback from incumbent air marshals on the effectiveness of their annual recurrent training courses. Systematically gathering feedback from incumbent air marshals would better position OTD to fully assess whether the training program is meeting air marshals' needs. Additionally, among the training surveys that OTD does currently administer to air marshals, the response rates have been low. For example, among newly hired air marshals and their supervisors from 2009 through 2011\u2014the last three full years in which the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) hired air marshals\u2014the survey response rates ranged from 16 to 38 percent. Until OTD takes steps to achieve sufficient response rates, OTD cannot be reasonably assured that the feedback it receives represents the full spectrum of views held by air marshals.", "FAMS relies on its annual recurrent training program to ensure incumbent air marshals' mission readiness, but additional actions could strengthen FAMS's ability to do so. First, FAMS does not have complete and timely data on the extent to which air marshals have completed their recurrent training. For example, nearly one-quarter of all training records for calendar year 2014 had not been entered into FAMS's training database within the required time period. Policies that specify who is responsible at the headquarters level for overseeing these activities could help FAMS ensure its data on air marshals' recurrent training are accurate and up to date. Second, FAMS requires air marshals to demonstrate proficiency in marksmanship by achieving a minimum score of 255 out of 300 on the practical pistol course every quarter. However, for the remaining recurrent training courses FAMS does not assess air marshals' knowledge or performance in these courses against a similarly identified level of proficiency, such as by requiring examinations or by using checklists or other objective tools. More objective and standardized methods of determining incumbent air marshals' mission readiness, as called for by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Learning Evaluation Guide, could help FAMS better and more consistently assess air marshals' skills and target areas for improvement. Additionally, in 2015 FAMS developed a health, fitness, and wellness program to improve air marshals' overall health and wellness, but it is too early to gauge the program's effectiveness. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in June 2016.

To help ensure the  security of the nation\u2019s civil aviation system addresses such threats, the  Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), an Office  within the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Transportation  Security Administration (TSA), is tasked with promoting confidence in the  nation\u2019s aviation system through the deployment of federal air marshals to  protect U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. While  deployed, these air marshals\u2019 mission is to deter, detect, and defeat  terrorist or other criminal hostile acts. TSA established the Federal Air  Marshal Training Program (FAMTP) to provide air marshals with the  knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to recognize and respond  effectively, including through the use of deadly force, to threats they may  encounter while deployed on a mission to protect the traveling public. The  unique operating environment of air marshals\u2014the relatively tight  confines of an airplane, the possibility of air turbulence, and the presence  of numerous passengers and crew\u2014highlights the importance of ensuring  that air marshals are well trained and capable of successfully carrying out  their duties.", "You asked us to assess the training that air marshals receive to ensure  they effectively respond to the incidents that they encounter.

TSA deemed some of the information in the report as  sensitive security information, which must be protected from public  disclosure. Therefore, this report omits this information, such as specific  numbers of air marshals and specific types of training that air marshals  reported needed to be added to FAMS\u2019s training curriculum to address  changes in air marshals\u2019 responsibilities.

We also analyzed documentation on the results of training curriculum  assessments OTD conducted to identify recommendations made to  improve training and the extent to which OTD implemented the  recommendations. OTD conducted these assessments from May 2007  through April 2014. We then compared OTD\u2019s training development and   evaluation processes to key principles identified in DHS guidance on  training evaluation, and GAO\u2019s prior work on training and development.", "We also obtained the available response rates for surveys that OTD  conducted of FAMTP graduates and their supervisors on the  effectiveness of FAMTP courses for calendar years 2009 through 2011\u2014 the last three full years that FAMS hired air marshals. In addition, we met  with senior OTD officials to discuss the actions that had been taken to  improve these response rates, and compared these actions to Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) standards and guidance for conducting  surveys. Further, we visited the TSA Training Center (TSATC) in Atlantic  City, New Jersey and 7 of 22 FAMS field offices, which we selected to  reflect a range in size (as determined by the number of air marshals  assigned to the office) and geographic dispersion. At TSATC, we  interviewed TSATC management and training instructors and toured the  facility. At the field offices, we interviewed field office management,  supervisory federal air marshals (SFAM), air marshals, and training  instructors to obtain their views on the current training curriculum. The  results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all field offices, but  provide insight into the extent to which TSA is addressing air marshals\u2019  training needs and ensuring their mission readiness.", "To address the second objective, we assessed FAMS directives that set  forth training requirements for incumbent air marshals, analyzed air  marshals\u2019 training data for calendar year 2014\u2014the most recent full year  for which training data were available\u2014to determine the extent to which  air marshals met these requirements. We interviewed senior FAMS  officials to understand how FAMS uses this information to ensure that air  marshals are mission ready. We compared the results of our analyses to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and GAO\u2019s  prior work on training and development. We assessed the reliability of  the 2014 training data by (1) reviewing documentation on the processes  for entering air marshals\u2019 training records into the Federal Air Marshal  Information System (FAMIS), (2) performing electronic testing for obvious  anomalies and comparing FAMIS data to FAMIS-generated reports on  training completion, and (3) interviewing knowledgeable officials about  training records and exemptions entered into FAMIS. We discuss our  findings about the reliability of these data later in this report. Additionally,  as previously discussed, we interviewed TSATC personnel and FAMS  field office personnel to obtain their perspectives on FAMS methods for  ensuring that air marshals are mission ready. Further, we reviewed the  studies that FAMS conducted or commissioned to inform its development  of its physical fitness program and assessment\u2014a component of air  marshals\u2019 training.

Specifically, OTD holds CDCs to determine  whether to approve proposals to develop new training courses, and  convenes CRCs to evaluate the effectiveness of existing FAMTP courses  and, if appropriate, to make recommendations to address any identified  shortcomings. These conferences are composed of OTD officials  responsible for developing and implementing FAMTP courses and  relevant subject matter experts, such as training instructors, field office  Supervisory Air Marshals-in-Charge (SACs), SFAMs, and air marshals.  According to OTD guidance and consistent with Federal Law  Enforcement Training Accreditation Board standards, CDCs are to be  held prior to the development of new training programs and CRCs are to  be held no less than every three years or sooner if directed by FAMS  management. CDCs can also be held in response to directives from  OTD or FAMS management and to requests for additional training from  FAMS personnel.", "As part of the CDCs and CRCs, OTD conducts assessments to determine  the extent that existing FAMTP courses are current with existing or  planned FAMS policy, procedures, or new equipment or technology, and  address the known threat environment, and air marshals\u2019 training  needs. When doing so, OTD considers various sources of information  including, among others, its job task analysis; training-related concerns  raised by field office focus groups; feedback from air marshal  candidates, training instructors and other subject matter experts; and  intelligence. According to OTD guidance, this information is primarily to  be gathered as described below.", "TSATC Training Evaluation Surveys: OTD\u2019s student critique review  program evaluates FAMTP training courses delivered at TSATC  consistent with Kirkpatrick levels one and three. Under this program,  OTD solicits and reviews feedback from air marshal candidates on the  quality of the FAMTP courses that they complete at TSATC and from  newly graduated air marshals on the extent that these courses  effectively prepare them for their duties. Specifically, consistent with  Kirkpatrick level 1, OTD requires air marshal candidates to complete a  course evaluation on the effectiveness of the course and the quality of  the instructor and facility immediately after completing the course.  Further, consistent with Kirkpatrick level 3, TSATC surveys newly  graduated air marshals 10 to 12 months after they have graduated  from FAMTP-II, and their supervisors within 12 months of their  graduation, to obtain their feedback on the extent that the training  adequately prepared the FAMTP graduates to successfully perform  their mission. In addition, the program provides OTD with feedback  from air marshal candidates and newly graduated air marshals on the  effectiveness of FAMTP curriculum, instructor performance, and  TSATC facility or safety, or other related issues. This feedback is  used by CDCs and CRCs to identify training gaps and determine how  to appropriately address them. However, as described later in this  report, response rates by air marshals on these surveys have been  low.", "TSATC Examinations and Simulations: Consistent with Kirkpatrick  level 2, OTD requires air marshal candidates to pass written exams or  job simulations in order to advance through FAMTP. Specifically, air  marshal candidates must demonstrate that they possess the  knowledge, cognitive, or physical skills that classroom courses are  intended to impart by passing examinations. OTD has developed  evaluation tools, such as checklists, that TSATC training instructors  must use to objectively determine air marshal candidates\u2019 proficiency  in law enforcement tactics and techniques such as marksmanship,  defensive tactics, arrest procedures, and decision-making. OTD  collects and analyzes the data on newly hired air marshals\u2019  performance to determine the extent to which air marshal candidates  have mastered the learning objectives with each FAMTP course and  to identify any areas in the curriculum that may need revision. For  example, OTD officials stated that they may revise examination  questions in response to a relatively high number of air marshal  candidates failing a question or series of questions due to poor  wording. Furthermore, OTD uses these data to identify and address  any training needs not met by the existing FAMTP curriculum when  carrying out CRCs and CDCs.", "In addition to using surveys and examinations when evaluating FAMTP  curriculum provided at TSATC, OTD officials noted additional information  sources they use when evaluating FAMTP curriculum, including field  office training assessment teams and quarterly training teleconferences.", "Field Office Training Assessment Teams: OTD established field  office assessment teams, which consist of TSATC instructors, to  assess field office training programs and their instructors. As  described earlier, field office training programs primarily provide the  recurrent training that incumbent air marshals are required to fulfill  each year. In advance of the assessment team\u2019s visit, TSATC sends  surveys to supervisors and air marshals in the field with questions on  the effectiveness of the field office\u2019s training program, including its  training instructors and facilities, as well as FAMS\u2019s training  curriculum. According to OTD officials, when conducting assessments  at the field offices, team members are to observe field office trainers  in class to ensure that FAMTP courses are taught uniformly across all  FAMS field offices. They also are to review the field office\u2019s training  records and policies and procedures to ensure the field office\u2019s  training program is in compliance with OTD and FAMS policies, and  when necessary, to make recommendations for improvement. For  example, OTD officials told us that an assessment team discovered a  field office whose training staff were using unapproved \u201cdynamic  fighting\u201d tactics to teach air marshals how to fend off multiple  attackers when cornered, which had resulted in many severe injuries.  In this case, the assessment team halted use of the unapproved  scenarios and provided approved lesson plans that taught air  marshals to counter multiple attackers. OTD officials stated that  training assessment team visits also provide opportunities for TSATC  trainers to engage directly with field office trainers and air marshals to  share new best practices and identify any unmet training needs.  However, as we discuss later in this report, OTD has not sent  assessment teams to evaluate field office training programs since  March 2013.", "Quarterly Training Teleconferences: OTD holds quarterly  conference calls between TSATC staff, FAMS headquarters training  staff, and field office training staff to discuss service-wide training  issues.

In  addition, our work has also shown that agencies should ensure that they  incorporate a wide variety of stakeholder perspectives in assessing the  impact of training on employee and agency performance.", "OTD officials stated that conducting level 1 and 3 evaluations for air  marshal candidates and newly graduated air marshals has provided  sufficient feedback to reliably identify all air marshals\u2019 training needs  because the agency has taken steps to ensure that the content and  quality of training for air marshals candidates is identical to that of  recurrent training for incumbent air marshals. However, FAMS did not hire  any new air marshals from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. As a result,  TSA has not systematically gather feedback on the effectiveness of  FAMTP training curriculum from air marshals for approximately four  years. Over this time period, OTD has revised the training curriculum,  such as adding a course on personal security when overseas and  expanding the number of courses within the legal and investigative  discipline to cover all transportation modes. Moreover, while the minimum  skill requirements may be the same for both air marshal candidates and  incumbent air marshals in the field, the training needs for both groups  may not necessarily be identical. With greater experience in carrying out  missions, incumbent air marshals may have a better idea of their training  needs than air marshal candidates or newly graduated air marshals,  which could result in more experienced incumbent air marshals providing  different feedback on the quality of the training. Further, although  incumbent air marshals take many of the same training courses as air  marshal candidates, they do so at different facilities and with different  instructors.", "OTD officials also stated that field office training assessments and  quarterly training teleconferences provide additional opportunities to both  ensure that the training all air marshals receive is standardized across the  service and to obtain incumbent air marshal feedback. However, OTD  has not sent assessment teams to evaluate field office training programs  since March 2013 due, in part, to a lack of resources. OTD officials  reported that they plan to resume field office training assessments during  fiscal year 2017 and conduct assessments at 10 FAMS field offices per  year if sufficient funding is available. These officials also reported that  OTD plans to increase the frequency of training teleconferences between  TSATC and field office training programs from a quarterly to monthly  basis and invite field office leadership\u2014SACs and Assistant Supervisory  Air Marshals-in-Charge (ASACs)\u2014to participate in these meetings.", "Nevertheless, our review suggests that OTD could benefit from  broadening its efforts to gather feedback on recurrent training courses.  First, field office staff we interviewed at the seven field offices we visited  stated that improvements to training could better prepare them for their  roles. For example, SFAMs and training staff in four of the seven field  offices we visited stated that the training curriculum is overly focused on  the training needs of air marshal candidates and newly graduated air  marshals. Staff from five of the seven field offices also identified  advanced training courses beyond those currently provided that they  believed should be offered to incumbent air marshals, in areas such as  firearms, defensive, or medical training. Second, field office staff at all  seven field offices we visited identified training that should be revised,  expanded, or added, to include topics such as active shooter response,  counter surveillance and behavior detection techniques, training on  improvised explosive devices and other explosives, and expanded legal  and investigative training, among others. These sources also told us that  the curriculum did not adequately address changes in their  responsibilities over time, which include a broader set of current threats  such as improvised explosive devices or FAMS-specific training on active  shooters. OTD officials stated that they believed the current FAMTP  curriculum adequately addresses the types of additional training that field  office staff identified and that the curriculum has been designed to meet  the needs of air marshals at all experience levels and may be consistently  and safely delivered to the entire workforce. However, without a  mechanism to systematically collect and incorporate feedback on field- based training for incumbent air marshals, consistent with Kirkpatrick  level 1 and 3, OTD could miss important opportunities to identify  problems and improve overall training and development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response Rates for Air Marshal Training Surveys Have Been Consistently Low", "paragraphs": ["When OTD administered surveys to obtain feedback on the FAMTP-II  and field-based training, the response rates were substantially lower than  the 80 percent rate OMB encourages for federal surveys that require its  approval. Specifically, about 19 to 38 percent of air marshals that  graduated from FAMTP-II and their supervisors responded to the surveys  that TSATC administered from 2009 through 2011\u2014the last 3 full years in  which FAMS hired air marshals. Additionally, according to OTD officials,  the combined response rates for the surveys that training assessment  teams conducted from June 2012 through March 2013 was about 16  percent. OTD staff acknowledged that the response rate to these surveys  have been consistently low, but stated that the low response rates have  not significantly affected the usefulness of the surveys. According to OTD  staff, with regard to the FAMTP-II surveys, they received a sufficient  number of responses to successfully evaluate the extent that FAMTP  courses have met all air marshals\u2019 training needs. However, OMB  guidance stipulates that agencies must design surveys to achieve the  highest practical rates of response to ensure that the results are  representative of the target population and that they can be used with  confidence as input for informed decision-making. The guidance also  states that response rates are an important indicator of the potential for a  bias called nonresponse bias, which could affect the accuracy of a  survey\u2019s results. In general, as a survey\u2019s response rate increases, the  likelihood of a bias problem decreases, and, therefore, the views and  characteristics of the target population are more accurately reflected in  the survey\u2019s results.", "OMB guidance also describes the methods agencies can use to improve  the response rate of future surveys, including conducting outreach to  groups of prospective respondents, ensuring that the survey is well- designed and brief, providing alternative modes to provide responses,  conducting nonresponse follow-up efforts, and extending cut-off dates for  survey completion. OTD officials reported that they have taken several  of these actions to improve the response rates of the FAMTP-II surveys,  but have had little success in improving their response rate. Specifically,  officials stated that TSATC instructors and staff discussed the surveys  and their importance to improving future course offerings in class. In  addition, OTD officials reported designing the survey to be as brief as  possible, making it accessible via the internet and air marshals\u2019 handheld  devices, sending out follow-up reminders to survey respondents via   e-mail and telephone, and contacting non-respondents\u2019 field office  supervisors. OTD officials told us that the low response rates may be  attributable to \u201csurvey fatigue\u201d given the high number of surveys that TSA  employees are asked to complete and stated that there was little more  that they could do to persuade air marshals to respond.", "Although OTD officials reported taking several of the actions that OMB  recommends for agencies to improve survey response rates, additional  actions could improve the response rate of future OTD surveys, including  those administered to the air marshals FAMS hired this year. For  example, monitoring future survey response rates by field office could  help OTD identify and then target extra follow-up efforts to air marshals  and their supervisors in field locations that have comparatively low  response levels. Further, extending the cut-off date for air marshals and  their supervisors to respond to the survey, or requiring survey  respondents to complete the surveys, could help improve response rates  to future surveys. Until OTD achieves sufficient response rates, OTD  cannot be reasonably assured that the feedback it received represents  the full spectrum of views held by air marshals or their supervisors.

According to Field Operations  staff, these personnel contact field office SACs or their designees when  these reports identify air marshals that have not met their recurrent  requirements. If field office staff report that the air marshal(s) have  completed a requirement(s), but have not entered this information in  FAMIS, Field Operations is to request appropriate documentation and  update FAMIS. Field Operations officials stated they discuss with field  offices why any air marshals have not completed their training  requirements, such as illnesses, injuries, or scheduling issues, and, if  necessary, the field office SAC is to take appropriate action.", "In addition, FAMS policy allows for air marshals to be exempted from  training requirements when certain conditions, such as illness, injury, or  military leave, are met and defines the process by which exemptions are  to be requested and granted. Specifically, FAMS policy states that  SACs must prepare a letter to the appropriate regional director to request  approval of the exemption no later than 5 days after the end of a quarter.

However, we  found that the data used to track this information were not complete or  readily available for purposes of tracking air marshals\u2019 compliance with  these requirements when we requested these data in March 2015. We  reviewed training data from FAMIS\u2019s training module for calendar year  2014 to determine the extent that air marshals have met their recurrent  training requirements. Although we were ultimately able to determine  that almost all of the air marshals met their training requirements or  received an appropriate exemption in calendar year 2014, it was difficult  to do so because data on both approved exemptions and training  completions were missing or had not been entered in a timely manner.  We found that nearly one-third of all training exemptions granted to air  marshals in calendar year 2014 had not been entered into FAMIS.  Specifically, at least 299 training exemptions granted to about 2 percent  of air marshals had not been entered into FAMIS when we received the  data in March 2015\u2014nearly three months after the calendar year had  ended. Additionally, we found that nearly one-quarter of all training  records for calendar year 2014 had been entered into FAMIS more than 5  days after an air marshal had completed the training.", "FAMS headquarters officials responsible for reconciling recurrent training  service-wide stated that these exemptions were not entered into FAMIS  until July 2015\u2014seven months after the calendar year ended. These  officials told us that the delay was partly because FAMS took the  database offline for three weeks in September 2014 to allow for an  upgrade of the system. As a result, the staff person responsible for  entering exemptions had become backlogged and later entered the  backlogged exemptions into the database, in part, to reconcile the  missing exemptions that were identified through our analysis of the 2014  training data. Additionally, FAMS officials responsible for reconciling  completion of recurrent training service-wide reported that each quarter  there are a significant number of air marshals for whom field office staff  have not entered training records. According to these officials, at the end  of every quarter, FAMS Field Operations staff must contact staff from  several field offices to remind them to review and enter missing training  records\u2014a process that officials described as labor-intensive. In  December 2015, FAMS officials provided us with the updated records for  the air marshals whose exemptions had been entered into FAMIS as a  result of our audit work to demonstrate that the air marshals\u2019 2014  recurrent training data had been corrected and were complete.", "TSA Office of Inspection (OOI) reports have found similar problems with  monitoring, or timely and accurate recording, of air marshals\u2019 training  records.

However, for the remainder of air marshals\u2019 required recurrent training  courses, FAMS does not assess air marshals against a similarly identified  level of proficiency, such as by requiring examinations to evaluate air  marshals\u2019 knowledge in classroom-based courses or by using checklists  or other objective tools to evaluate air marshals\u2019 performance during  simulation-based courses, such as mission tactics. For instance, FAMS\u2019s  recurrent training includes both mandatory refresher courses that all air  marshals must complete annually as well as a broad set of courses within  several disciplines that field offices must ensure are incorporated into  their annual or quarterly training plans. However, FAMS does not  require air marshals to take an examination for any course within these  disciplines.", "Federal Standards for Internal Control states that agencies should  establish expectations of competence for key roles, such as federal air  marshals, to help the entity achieve its objectives, and that all personnel  need to possess and maintain the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities  that allow them to accomplish their assigned duties. Additionally, GAO\u2019s  prior work on training and development states that in some cases,  agencies may identify critical skills and competencies that are important  to mission success, and require that employees meet requirements to  ensure they possess needed knowledge and skills. Further, DHS\u2019s  Learning Evaluation Guide identifies testing or skill checklists as tools  agencies can use to determine whether students have the knowledge and  can perform the skills classes are designed to teach. The guide also  states that learning activities that are skill-based, such as FAMS courses  on tactical and defensive techniques, may require the development of skill  checklists to determine the level of trainee proficiency.", "Field Operations officials said that it is not necessary to use examinations  for recurrent training courses because air marshals are continuously  evaluated by field office training instructors and SFAMs who participate in  their training. In addition, officials stated that air marshals demonstrate  their proficiency in the various cognitive or physical skills they must  possess during simulations conducted as part of FAMS\u2019s recurrent  training program. As a result, according to officials, FAMS can be assured  that any gaps in air marshals\u2019 performance are identified and addressed  in a timely manner. Field Operations officials also stated that checklists  are also unnecessary because training instructors do not evaluate air  marshals\u2019 performance solely on whether their actions were appropriate  and the air marshal correctly applied the relevant principles or tactics  taught by course simulations. Rather, air marshals must also articulate  why their actions were appropriate and how they applied the relevant  principles or tactics. For example, to evaluate air marshals\u2019 performance  in mission tactics simulations, Field Operations officials stated that  training instructors observe air marshals\u2019 actions in response to various  simulated threats ranging from verbal or physical assaults to the crew by  passengers to suicide bombers. According to FAMS officials, training  instructors evaluate the extent the actions taken by air marshals resulted  in positive outcomes (i.e., protected the plane, passengers, and crew)  and were carried out in accordance with applicable authorities, policies,  procedures, and principles. Officials stated that part of this assessment is  based on air marshals\u2019 explanation for why their actions appropriately  addressed the simulated threat and applied relevant FAMS principles and  tactics. In addition, TSA has established a training instructor training  program, which, according to FAMS Field Operations officials, ensures  that training instructors are highly trained and certified; and, therefore,  can assess air marshals\u2019 performance in a reasonably objective manner.", "As previously discussed, for training courses taught at TSATC, OTD  requires air marshal candidates and incumbent air marshals to  demonstrate that they possess the knowledge or cognitive skills that  classroom courses are intended to impart by passing examinations for  training courses taught at TSATC. Additionally, when evaluating the  performance of air marshal candidates and incumbent air marshals in  courses taught at TSATC, OTD requires training instructors to use  evaluation tools, including checklists. For example, TSATC training  instructors must use these tools when evaluating air marshal candidates\u2019  performance in defensive measures and mission tactics simulations as  part of FAMTP-II. TSATC staff reported that they require TSATC training  instructors to use such checklists because doing so better ensures air  marshals are evaluated in an objective, fair, and consistent manner.  Further, a field office SAC reported that given the absence of an objective  tool for assessing air marshals\u2019 performance in field-based training, such  as defensive measures and tactics, there are air marshals who have not  fully demonstrated the requisite level of proficiency, but still \u201cpassed\u201d  these courses and continued to fly missions. According to the SAC, air  marshals are flying missions with colleagues they do not view as mission  ready in part due to their performance in training courses\u2014a concern  raised by air marshals in 3 of the 7 field offices we visited. Finally, field  office trainers in 3 field offices reported that a standardized tool for  evaluating air marshals during training would help them to identify and  address trainee deficiencies.", "FAMS Field Operations officials also noted that standardized  examinations or checklists during trainings are not necessary because  SFAMs have opportunities to continually assess their air marshals\u2019  mission readiness by flying with their squads or attending training.  However, we found that SFAMs infrequently attend training with their  squads or accompany them on flying missions, although they are not  necessarily required to do so. The July 2014 FAMS Advisory Council  minutes state that the council unanimously agreed that a large population  of SFAMs do not fully participate in their air marshals\u2019 required training.  Air marshals from 6 of 22 field offices raised similar concerns based on  our review of the minutes from field office focus groups conducted in  fiscal year 2014. In addition, SFAMs in all 7 field offices we visited  reported that they rarely fly with their squads, i.e., once per quarter or  less. Further, SFAMs in 6 of the 7 field offices stated that they rely on air  marshals\u2019 self-assessments and factors unrelated to mission readiness,  such as quality of administrative paperwork (i.e., travel vouchers and  timecards), and completion of OLC training to assess air marshals\u2019  performance.", "Standardized methods for determining whether incumbent air marshals  are mission ready, such as required examinations or evaluation tools, in  key training courses could help provide better assurance that air marshals  service-wide are mission ready.

Over the period 2008 to 2015, FAMS commissioned  two studies to evaluate air marshals\u2019 health and fitness, as well as a third  study to evaluate air marshal fatigue and sleeplessness. FitForce, a  consulting group, which conducted the first evaluation of air marshals\u2019  fitness in 2009, found that nearly 32 percent of the FAMS who  participated in the study exercised less than three times per week and  almost 7 percent did not exercise at all. FitForce also concluded that  physical fitness is a necessity for air marshals to be able to perform the  essential functions of their job, and stated that FAMS should make a  commitment to address the fitness needs of air marshals. Additionally, a  2012 sleep study conducted by Harvard University concluded that more  than half of the air marshals who responded to the study\u2019s survey were  overweight and nearly one-third were obese, and, therefore, may suffer a  variety of health issues that could directly impact mission readiness.  Furthermore, FAMS conducted its own review of air marshals\u2019 fitness  from 2012 through 2013 and concluded that air marshals suffered from  high injury rates and declining overall health and wellness, which FAMS  officials attributed in part to the increasing age of air marshals.  Specifically, the review found that the injuries that occurred while air  marshals took their physical fitness assessment from 2010 through 2013  had resulted in approximately 8,060 lost or restricted work days and  12,896 lost mission opportunities and Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation  Program claims totaling over $1 million.", "We analyzed the scores that air marshals achieved in calendar year 2014  when taking the quarterly Mission Readiness Assessment (MRA)\u2014the  health evaluation program that FAMS had in place at that time. We found  that, with the exception of the 1.5-mile run, the majority of air marshals  who took the MRA met or exceeded each of the MRA component test  goals. In quarters 2 through 4 of calendar year 2014, 84 to almost 90  percent of air marshals who participated in the MRA failed to meet the  1.5-mile run goal, as shown in figure 3. Moreover, about 5 percent of the  air marshals did not meet the performance goals for any of the  component tests in quarters 2 through 4 of calendar year 2014.", "To address the impact that air marshals\u2019 declining health and fitness may  pose to FAMS\u2019s ability to carry out its mission within TSA, as well as air  marshals\u2019 injury rates, FAMS has developed the Health, Fitness, and  Wellness Program, which went into effect in April 2016. According to  FAMS policy, this program will include a revised fitness assessment\u2014the  Health and Fitness Assessment (HFA)\u2014and a general health and  wellness program. FAMS officials reported that air marshals are to  complete the HFA on a biannual basis, but will not be required to meet  performance goals for any of the HFA\u2019s four components:  cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance,  and flexibility. Rather, FAMS will use the results of air marshals\u2019 first  HFA to establish a fitness baseline and to take appropriate action to  improve the performance of those who do not maintain their fitness levels  or show improvement. According to FAMS officials, the agency decided  not to require air marshals to meet the performance goals for the HFA  tests because the results of the HFA cannot reliably determine the extent  that an air marshal is physically capable of carrying out FAMS\u2019s mission.  Officials explained that FAMS had originally intended to require  incumbent air marshals to meet a physical fitness standard similar to the  HFA, but did not do so because of concerns raised by TSA\u2019s Office of  Human Capital and Office of the Chief Counsel. Specifically, according to  FAMS officials, advice was provided regarding whether the proposed  physical fitness standard could reliably predict an air marshal\u2019s physical  ability to carry out FAMS job-related mission, as well as if FAMS could  demonstrate the business necessity (mission-related) of the standard.  Because of these concerns, FAMS\u2019s leadership decided to implement the  Health, Wellness, and Fitness Program with a focus on reducing the  incidence of air marshals\u2019 injuries, reducing the number of exemptions air  marshals needed to request from taking the HFA, increasing program  participation, and improving air marshals\u2019 overall health and wellness  instead. FAMS officials stated that in addition to general improvement of  air marshals\u2019 health and fitness, a key benefit of the new program will be  that air marshals will request and receive fewer exemptions because the  HFA will allow air marshals to demonstrate their fitness through  alternative means of testing. FAMS officials reported that, when taking the  HFA, air marshals may choose one of three exercises to perform for five  of the six subsets within the four components. For example, when taking  the upper body subset of the muscular strength component, air marshals  may choose to perform pull-ups, assisted pull-ups, or lateral pulldowns.  According to FAMS officials, because multiple exercises will be available  for each HFA component, FAMS will no longer grant air marshals  exemptions from taking the HFA unless an injury prevents them from  performing any of the HFA exercises.", "FAMS has established a goal for the Health, Wellness, and Fitness  program\u2014to provide the opportunity, resources, and education necessary  to enhance mission readiness and promote workplace wellness, but it is  too early to know if the program is achieving its intended goal. FAMS and  OTD officials responsible for developing this program told us that FAMS  plans to collect and analyze data on air marshals\u2019 performance on the  HFA over a period of about 12 to 18 months\u2014two or three assessment  periods. These officials stated that after FAMS had collected and  analyzed sufficient data and established a baseline, the agency would be  better positioned to collaborate with OTD to establish performance  measures for the program.

However, by regularly collecting incumbent air  marshals\u2019 feedback on the recurrent training they receive in the field  offices, OTD would better ensure it considers the input and experience of  incumbent air marshals when assessing and refining their training  programs. Also, by taking additional steps to improve the response rates  for the training surveys it administers to air marshal candidates,  incumbent air marshals, and their supervisors, OTD could be more  reasonably assured that the feedback it receives represents the full  spectrum of views held by its air marshal workforce.", "FAMS has established recurrent training requirements to ensure that air  marshals maintain the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to carry out  their mission.

At  TSATC, we interviewed TSATC management and training instructors and  toured the facility. At the field offices, we interviewed field office  management, Supervisory Federal Air Marshals (SFAM), air marshals,  and training instructors to obtain their views on the current training  curriculum. The results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all  field offices, but provide insight into the extent to which TSA is addressing  air marshals\u2019 training needs and ensuring their mission readiness.", "To address the second objective, we assessed FAMS directives that set  forth training requirements for incumbent air marshals, and analyzed air  marshals training data for calendar year 2014, which is the most recent  year for which training data were available, to determine the extent to  which air marshals met these requirements. We interviewed senior FAMS  officials to understand how FAMS uses this information to ensure that air  marshals are mission ready. We compared the results of our analyses to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, the DHS  Learning Evaluation Guide, and GAO\u2019s prior work on training and  development. We assessed the reliability of the 2014 training data by (1)  reviewing documentation on the processes for entering air marshals\u2019  training records into the Federal Air Marshal Information System (FAMIS),  (2) performing electronic testing for obvious anomalies and comparing  FAMIS data to FAMIS-generated reports on training completion, and (3)  interviewing knowledgeable officials about training records and  exemptions entered into FAMIS. Although the data FAMS originally  provided were not complete or entered in a timely manner, over the  course of our audit we identified missing data that FAMS corrected in  response to our inquiries. Therefore, we found the data were reliable for  the purposes of our report. Additionally, as previously discussed, we  interviewed TSATC training instructors and FAMS field office personnel to  obtain their perspectives on FAMS methods for ensuring that air marshals  are mission ready. We also reviewed the most recent Management  Assessment Program inspection report completed by TSA\u2019s Office of  Inspections for all 22 field offices to identify the training-related findings.  Additionally, we reviewed the FAMS Advisory Council minutes and the  field offices\u2019 focus group minutes for fiscal year 2014\u2014the most recent full  year of information available at the time of our request\u2014to identify the  training related issues that FAMS personnel raised to their leadership.  Finally, we reviewed the studies that FAMS conducted or commissioned  to inform its development of its physical fitness program and  assessment\u2014a component of air marshals training. We interviewed  FAMS and OTD officials responsible for developing and implementing  FAMS\u2019s health, wellness, and fitness program to determine how TSA  plans to measure the effectiveness of the program.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Maria Strudwick (Assistant  Director) and Michael C.
