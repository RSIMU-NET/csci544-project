States use various sources of funds to finance the nonfederal share, such as state funds and funds from health care providers and local governments. Medicaid has been on GAO's list of high-risk programs since 2003, in part, because of concerns about federal oversight of complex state Medicaid financing arrangements where states seek funds from the providers for the nonfederal share of the payments, and oversight of large supplemental payments that states often make to government providers. States may have incentives to overpay providers that help finance the nonfederal share to maximize federal matching funds.", "This statement highlights (1) findings from GAO's report being issued today on how states' reliance on health care providers and local governments to finance Medicaid changed from state fiscal years 2008 through 2012, and implications of these changes; and (2) preliminary results from GAO's ongoing work on what is known about data to oversee state Medicaid payments to government and private providers.

In state fiscal year 2012, while most of the nonfederal share was from state general funds, states used funds from health care providers and local governments to finance 26 percent, or over $46 billion, of the total nonfederal share of Medicaid payments. States' reliance on funds from health care providers and local governments to finance the nonfederal share increased by over 21 percent from state fiscal years 2008 through 2012. States' increasing use of funds generated from health care provider taxes was one main contributing factor to this increase. States' increasing reliance on providers and local governments to finance Medicaid can effectively shift costs from the state to the federal government, as illustrated by GAO's work in three selected states. For example, in one state, a $220 million payment increase for private nursing facilities funded by a tax on private nursing facilities resulted in an estimated $110 million increase in federal matching funds and no increase in state general funds, and a net payment increase to the facilities, after paying the taxes, of $105 million.", "GAO's preliminary results from ongoing work related to state Medicaid payments to government providers shows that data needed for overseeing Medicaid payments are lacking. Federal payment data do not capture on a provider-specific basis certain large supplemental payments states often make and generally lack information on provider ownership. At the state level, preliminary results in three selected states suggest that payment data primarily maintained by states are not always reliable and can be challenging to obtain and assess. GAO's preliminary analysis of Medicaid payments to government hospitals in one state suggests the need for and value of better data for oversight. GAO estimates that on an average per day basis, the state's 2011 inpatient hospital payments were higher for local government hospitals than for private hospitals. For local government hospitals, the higher average payment was largely due to supplemental Medicaid payments the state made to two local government hospitals. State officials said these hospitals served patients with greater needs. However, the state's own estimate of what Medicare would have paid these hospitals for similar services was $100 million, much less than the $416 million in supplemental Medicaid payments and $70 million in regular payments that the hospitals received. Documentation from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) payment review process did not identify the actual supplemental payments these hospitals received. GAO plans to issue its final report later this year.", "In GAO's past reports and the report being released today ( GAO-14-627 ), GAO has made recommendations to CMS to improve Medicaid payment oversight and develop a data collection strategy to improve the transparency of state financing methods. CMS has taken steps to improve the transparency and oversight of Medicaid financing and payments but has not implemented all of GAO's prior recommendations, and has generally disagreed with GAO's new recommendation. CMS believes that additional action is not needed. As discussed in the statement, GAO continues to believe that provider-specific information on state Medicaid financing and payments is needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you explore federal oversight of state  financing of Medicaid and state Medicaid payments to government  providers.

In the case of state  government providers, excessive Medicaid payments can reduce the  state\u2019s obligation to supply funds to the provider for non-Medicaid  services. In the case of local government providers, when they or local  governments supply the nonfederal share of Medicaid payments, states  may have an incentive to make excessive Medicaid payments to local  government providers because the state has a reduced obligation to  supply funds to finance the nonfederal share. Private providers that serve  Medicaid beneficiaries can be taxed in order to provide funds for the state  share of Medicaid payments. Generally, these taxes are levied on large  providers, particularly hospitals or nursing facilities, and they are  acceptable to providers because the tax revenues they supply allow the  state to increase the payments they receive. As the agency overseeing  Medicaid at the federal level, CMS is responsible for ensuring that state  Medicaid payments made under such financing arrangements are  consistent with Medicaid payment principles, including requirements that  Medicaid payments be economical and efficient and ensure access to  care for Medicaid beneficiaries, and that the federal government and  states share in the financing of the Medicaid program as established by  law.

The questionnaire collected information on each state\u2019s use of funds from  health care providers and local governments, state general funds, and  other sources to finance the nonfederal share of Medicaid from 2008  through 2012. In addition, we obtained more in-depth information on any  implications of changes in reliance on funds from health care providers  and local governments from a nongeneralizable sample of three states,  selected on the basis of having large Medicaid programs, as determined  by spending for Medicaid services; making large amounts of certain  supplemental payments to providers; having made changes in sources of  funds to finance the nonfederal share, and in Medicaid payment rates  from 2008 through 2011; and geographic diversity.

The federal share of each state\u2019s  Medicaid expenditures is based on a statutory formula known as the  Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). On average, the  federal share of Medicaid service expenditures is about 57 percent. Some  states design their Medicaid programs to require local governments to  contribute to the programs\u2019 costs, for example, through intergovernmental  transfers of funds from government-owned or -operated providers to the  state Medicaid program. States may, subject to certain requirements, also  receive funds to finance Medicaid payments from health care providers,  for example, through provider taxes\u2014taxes levied on providers such as  hospitals or nursing facilities. For example, federal law allows up to   60 percent of the nonfederal share to be financed by local governments.  This requirement is applied on the basis of total annual Medicaid program  spending and not on individual payments or types of payments.", "In addition to flexibility in determining sources of funds to use to finance  their nonfederal share, states have flexibility, within broad federal  requirements, in designing and operating their Medicaid programs,  including determining services to cover and setting payment rates for  providers. In general, federal law provides for federal matching funds for  state Medicaid payments for covered services provided to eligible  beneficiaries up to a ceiling or limit, often called the upper payment limit  (UPL). The UPL is based on what Medicare would pay for the same services. Typically, state Medicaid payment rates are lower than what the  Medicare program would pay, and so many states make supplemental  payments under the UPL. Unlike regular Medicaid payments, which are  generally based on claims submitted by providers for services rendered,  supplemental payments often consist of large, lump sum payments made  on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis and can be targeted to small  groups of providers, such as local government hospitals. Supplemental  payments totaled at least $43 billion in federal fiscal year 2011, including  $26 billion made under the UPL, but reporting was incomplete.  Supplemental payments have been growing in size, as they totaled at  least $23 billion in federal fiscal year 2006.", "Our prior work has raised concerns about gaps in the oversight of  supplemental payments made under the UPL. As part of its oversight  responsibilities, CMS is responsible for ensuring that state Medicaid  payments are consistent with federal requirements, including that  Medicaid payments are economical and efficient. In recent years, we  have found several instances of payments that raise concerns about  compliance with these requirements. For example, in November 2012, we  reported that 39 states had made supplemental payments to 505  hospitals that, along with their regular Medicaid payments, exceeded  those hospitals\u2019 total costs of providing Medicaid care by $2.7 billion.  Although Medicaid payments are not required to be limited to a provider\u2019s  costs of delivering Medicaid services, payments that greatly exceed these  costs raise questions; for example, as to whether payments are being  used for allowable Medicaid expenditures. We have previously made  recommendations to CMS\u2014including recommendations to require states  to report the amounts of UPL supplemental payments that they make to  individual providers\u2014to review all state supplemental payment programs, and enhance the oversight of payments made to government providers.CMS has not implemented all of these recommendations. We have also  suggested that the Congress consider requiring CMS to require states to  submit annual independent audits of supplemental payments made under  the UPL, which are not currently subject to audit.", "CMS uses a range of tools to oversee state Medicaid payments, including  review and approval of states\u2019 Medicaid plans and amendments. State  plans describe, among other things, who and how much states will pay for  particular services.

Specifically, the percentage of funds from health care providers and local  governments that states used to finance the nonfederal share increased  from 21 percent to 26 percent during this 5-year period, for an increase of   5 percentage points, or 21 percent. While the total amount of funds from  all sources, including state funds, increased during this period, funds  from providers and local governments increased as a percentage of the  nonfederal share, while the percentage of state funds decreased. Health  care provider taxes represented the source of funds from health care  providers and local governments with the largest increase, $9 billion,  during the 5-year time period. We found that a total of 85 new provider  taxes were implemented in 32 states during this time period.", "Our analysis shows that for supplemental payments alone, the  percentage of the nonfederal share that states financed with funds from  health care providers and local governments was relatively high, and  increasing. In particular, the percentage of the nonfederal share of  supplemental payments that was financed with funds from providers and  local governments increased from 57 percent in 2008 to 70 percent in  2012. In other words, almost three-quarters of the nonfederal share of  supplemental payments was financed by providers, and not state funds.  These large payments that states can target to small groups of providers  without linking them to services provided were, to a much greater extent  than regular Medicaid payments, financed by the providers.", "In the report we are releasing today, we also found that CMS does not  collect complete and accurate data on state Medicaid financing methods.  States are required, under federal law, to report the amounts of funds  from provider taxes and donations used to finance the nonfederal share,  but CMS has not ensured that this data is complete and accurate.  Reporting of funds from local government providers and local  governments that are used by states to finance the nonfederal share of  Medicaid is not required under federal law. CMS may seek on a case- specific basis information on financing arrangements when reviewing  individual state plan amendments; however, the information provided  varies by state, and CMS officials reported that states are not required to  identify the amount of funds provided by or on behalf of any specific  providers or the amount of payments made to providers. Without accurate  and complete information on state sources of funds, we concluded that  CMS is unable to adequately understand and oversee Medicaid financing  and payments, including net payments, to individual providers.

In effect, states seeking to raise payment rates to providers  can finance those increased rates by asking providers to provide the  funds to finance the state share of the payment, and then seek federal  matching on the larger amount. By increasing providers\u2019 Medicaid  payments, and at the same time imposing requirements on providers  receiving the payments to supply all or most of the nonfederal share for  the payments, states could obtain additional federal matching funds for  those facilities\u2019 payments without a commensurate increase in state  general funds. The use of funds from providers and local governments is,  as previously described, allowable under federal rules, but it can also  have implications for federal costs. And from the providers\u2019 perspective,  the use of funds from providers to finance an increase in Medicaid  payments results in a net payment to the provider that is less than the  amount used for purposes of claiming federal funds.", "In three selected states, we reviewed a financing arrangement that  involved financing the nonfederal share of new Medicaid payments with  funds from provider taxes or transfers of funds from local governments  put in place in recent years. For these arrangements, we estimated the  effect on the federal and state shares of new payments the state was  making. In each case, we determined that the result was a net increase in  payments to the providers\u2014after accounting for both the payment  increase they received, as well as the increased funds they or a local  government provided to the state to finance the nonfederal share of the  payments\u2014and increases in costs to the federal government. The state  contribution to the new Medicaid payments, in each case, did not  increase compared to what it would have been had the new financing  arrangement not taken place. For example, one state increased regular  Medicaid payments for nursing facilities in May 2011, and financed these  payments with a provider tax on nursing facilities. According to our  estimates, the increased regular Medicaid payment and new provider tax  had the effect of increasing federal matching payments by $110 million.

As a  result of these two gaps in the federal data on state Medicaid payments,  CMS is not able to assess payments to government providers compared  to private providers, and cannot detect any outlier provider payments,  such as providers receiving significantly larger amounts in Medicaid  payments than other providers providing similar services.

We have sought to obtain  payment data on supplemental payments, by ownership, from three  selected states to combine with federal data on regular Medicaid  payments so that we could assess how total Medicaid payments to  government providers compare to payments to private providers. Doing  this work, however, has proved to be difficult, illustrating the challenge in  overseeing Medicaid payments and ensuring that payments to individual  providers are economical and efficient. In each of the three states, we  encountered obstacles in capturing complete information on payments  and provider ownership. For example, states may use multiple provider identification numbers for the same provider; use a different provider identification number for supplemental  payments versus regular payments, complicating the process of  combining data sets to understand full payments to individual  providers; and be unable to report provider ownership by state government, local  government, and private.", "Our ongoing effort to compile reliable and accurate provider-specific  ownership and supplemental payment data has been, and continues to  be, a time consuming and labor intensive effort as a result of data  obstacles. We have encountered issues with data in all three states. For  one of the three states, we have determined that data issues are of such  difficulty that they preclude completing an assessment.

For this state, we were able to combine the state-provided  supplemental payments made under the UPL and provider ownership  data with the federal claims data on regular payments and Medicaid  patient days. Although our work analyzing this state\u2019s data to examine  payments for different types of services to different types of providers is  ongoing, we have completed the preliminary analysis for one type of  service: inpatient hospital payments. With these data, we have  determined each hospital\u2019s daily payment amount by dividing total  Medicaid payments for each hospital by the hospital\u2019s total Medicaid  patient days. We then calculated the average daily payment amounts for  three categories of provider ownership: state government, local  government, and private. Where possible, our preliminary analysis  adjusted regular payments for differences in the conditions of the patients  treated by the hospitals, commonly referred to as \u201ccase mix\u201d  adjustments.

Local government hospitals\u2019 average daily payment amount  was about $1,470, which was 25 percent higher than the average for  state government hospitals ($1,140) and 44 percent higher than for  private hospitals ($930).", "Our preliminary analysis also shows that, because the state was targeting  its UPL supplemental payments to only two local government hospitals,  the higher payments to these hospitals accounted for much of the  differences in average daily payment amounts when UPL supplemental  payments were included in the average. Together these hospitals  received nearly $416 million in UPL supplemental payments, compared to  $70 million in regular Medicaid payments. Our preliminary analysis of the  average daily payment amounts for regular and UPL supplemental  payments for these two hospitals suggests that the average amount at  one hospital was as high as about $8,800 per day, significantly higher  than the approximately $1,470 average amount for all local government  hospitals. The other hospital had a lower average, although it was still  higher than the average for private hospitals.

We  reviewed the state plan amendment authorizing the supplemental  payment, the funding questions that CMS asked when the state submitted  a proposed change to the payment, and the annual report the state  submitted to CMS in 2011 regarding the state\u2019s estimated UPL for local  government hospitals.

The state\u2019s estimate of  what Medicare would have paid the hospitals for the Medicaid  services provided was about $100 million, compared to the   $416 million those two facilities received.
