While waste in the form of used (spent) fuel from nuclear power plants is classified as \u201chigh-level\u201d because of the amount of radioactivity in the fuel, almost all other commercial waste is designated as \u201clow-level\u201d because the levels of radioactivity in these wastes are relatively lower. Low-level radioactive waste items include such things as rags, paper, liquid, glass, protective clothing, as well as hardware, equipment, and resins exposed to radioactivity or contaminated with radioactive material at nuclear power plants.", "In 1993, operations at utilities\u2019 nuclear power plants accounted for about 50 percent of the volume of commercially generated low-level radioactive waste, but this volume contained about 95 percent of the radioactivity in low-level waste. Examples of other commercial uses of radioactive materials that either directly or indirectly produce low-level radioactive waste include the following:", "Medical procedures involving radiation or radioactive material. More than 100 million of these procedures are performed each year.", "Testing and development of about 80 percent of new drugs.", "Sterilization of consumer products, such as cosmetics, hair products, and contact lens solutions using radioactive materials.", "Production of consumer products, such as smoke detectors, and industrial products, such as instruments to inspect for defects in highways, pipelines, and aircraft.", "The radioactivity in most commercially generated low-level waste decays to safe levels within 100 years, but some waste remains hazardous for longer than 500 years. Because these wastes are potentially harmful to workers, the general public, and the environment, they must be stored and disposed of safely.", "Throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s, commercially generated low-level waste was routinely disposed of in three facilities at or near Beatty, Nevada; Barnwell, South Carolina; and Richland, Washington. However, Nevada closed its facility on January 1, 1993. The facility in Washington was closed to generators in all but 11 states on January 1, 1993, and on July 1, 1994, South Carolina closed its facility to waste generators in all but 8 southeastern states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background on Disposal of Commercially Generated Low-Level Radioactive Waste", "paragraphs": ["The generation of significant amounts of nuclear wastes began during World War II and because nuclear operations then and for years afterward were controlled by the federal government, the government assumed responsibility for the disposal of these wastes. Eventually, however, the federal Atomic Energy Commission began permitting commercial entities to possess, own, and use radioactive materials and to dispose of low-level waste. With the increase in commercial uses of radioactive materials, the Congress, in 1959, authorized the Commission to transfer to states authority and responsibility for regulating most commercial users other than nuclear power plants. States that desired to assume such authority and responsibility could do so by establishing regulatory programs that were adequate to protect the public health and safety and compatible with the Commission\u2019s regulatory program. Such states are referred to as agreement states.", "With increased commercial use of radioactive materials and an expanding regulatory role for states, private companies, rather than the federal government, began to provide disposal facilities for commercially generated low-level waste. By 1971 there were six privately operated disposal facilities located in Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, South Carolina, and the state of Washington. All of these disposal facilities except the facility in Illinois were regulated by agreement states. Only the facility in Washington was developed on federal land; specifically, on the Hanford Reservation, now managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 show the disposal facility in Barnwell, South Carolina.)", "By March 1979 the disposal facilities in Illinois, Kentucky, and New York had been closed for a variety of reasons, including leakage at the sites. Then, in July 1979, the governor of Nevada ordered the Beatty facility shutdown after two incidents involving trucks carrying radioactive waste into the facility. Thereafter, the governors of Nevada, South Carolina, and Washington wrote to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for assurance that rules governing shipments would be enforced. The Beatty facility reopened in late July 1979. In October 1979, the governor of Washington ordered that state\u2019s disposal facility to shut down after deficiencies were found in waste shipments bound for the facility. Among other things, a truckload of radioactive cobalt was leaking. Also in 1979, the governor of South Carolina said that the state\u2019s disposal facility was receiving up to 90 percent of all commercially generated low-level waste and that decontamination of the disabled Three Mile Island nuclear power plant would generate waste amounting to almost 50 percent of the total volume the state had received in 1978. For this reason, the governor said that South Carolina would not accept waste from the disabled plant.", "Concerned about the potential loss of disposal capacity, several congressional committees held hearings in 1979. Initially, the committees considered legislation that would make the federal government responsible for the disposal of commercially generated low-level waste. The governors of the three states with operating disposal facilities, however, opposed this approach because they wanted states to have an opportunity to examine alternatives to federal disposal. By the end of the year, Washington and Nevada had reopened their disposal facilities, and the Congress had deferred consideration of legislation to the next year. Subsequently, a task force convened by the National Governors\u2019 Association recommended that responsibility for the disposal of low-level waste be assumed by the states. Other state government organizations supported this approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low-Level Waste Policy Act and Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Late in 1980, the Congress established a new policy regarding the disposal of commercially generated low-level waste by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-573). The act made each state responsible for making disposal capacity available and stated that low-level radioactive waste can be most safely and efficiently managed on a regional basis. To implement this policy, the Congress encouraged states to form compacts to meet their collective disposal needs and to minimize the number of new disposal sites. Congressional consent was required for a compact to become effective. As an inducement to states to form compacts and develop regional disposal facilities, the act stated that compacts could, beginning January 1, 1986, restrict the use of their disposal facilities to wastes generated within their respective regions. The Congress expected states to have new disposal facilities capable of handling their own low-level waste by that date.", "Although nearly 40 states had formed seven regional compacts by the end of 1983, it had become clear that no new disposal facilities would be ready for at least another 5 years. As a result, the Congress passed and, on January 15, 1986, the President signed into law, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-240). At the same time, the Congress granted consent to the seven regional compacts. The amendments represented a compromise for competing parties. On one side, waste generators in states that would be left without access to disposal facilities\u2014generators that were relying on the existing disposal facilities in Nevada, South Carolina, and Washington\u2014got a 7-year extension of the period during which they could ship waste to existing disposal facilities. On the other hand, these three states, which wanted to close their facilities to waste generators outside their respective compacts, received additional assurances that other states or compacts of states would develop their own disposal facilities.", "Among these additional assurances were six deadlines and milestones by which states should make decisions and commit to certain actions towards developing new disposal facilities. The amendments prescribed limited responsibilities for DOE and NRC. The amendments also established financial penalties, or surcharges, on the waste disposed of in existing facilities if certain milestones were not met. In addition to basic disposal charges, waste generators were to pay nonpenalty surcharges based on the volume of wastes disposed of at the three operating disposal facilities. The six deadlines and milestones are described in figure 1.3.", "New York and two of its counties challenged several provisions of the amendments, including the take-title provision contained in the last milestone. Nineteen other states supported this challenge. Under the take-title provision, states or compacts that failed to provide for the disposal of all waste generated within their borders by January 1, 1996, were required, upon request, to take title to and possession of the waste and become liable for damages suffered by the generators as a result of the state\u2019s failure to do so. In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in New York v. United States, 112 S.Ct. 2408 that this provision was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the Congress has power under the Constitution to preempt state regulation or to encourage states to provide suggested regulatory systems for disposal of the low-level waste generated within their borders, but the Constitution does not confer upon the Congress the ability to compel the states to do so in a particular way. The court held that the take-title provision was severable from the remainder of the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the environmental and economic effects of implementing the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, Senators Christopher J.

In fact, the states and compacts with jurisdiction for the South Carolina and Washington facilities began denying waste generators in some states, such as Michigan, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island, access to the existing disposal facilities prior to 1994. The denials were made on the basis that those states had not demonstrated sufficient progress in either joining other compacts of states or developing their own disposal facilities. Waste generators that do not have access to disposal facilities accounted for about 42 percent of all commercially generated low-level waste in 1993, the last full year that waste generators in most states had access to a disposal facility.

NRC\u2019s staff identified seven factors that, in its judgment, had affected the progress of these states, including criteria and procedures for selecting sites, funding and legislation, litigation, perceptions that federal and state regulations were inadequate, perceptions that long-term storage of waste is more desirable than disposal, and liability protection for citizens and property from potential releases of radioactivity from a disposal facility.", "The staff said that the seventh factor\u2014public and political concern over the development of new disposal facilities\u2014appeared to be one of the major factors linked to many of the other factors. Public concern and an absence of broad-based public and political acceptance has had a significant effect on the development of new disposal facilities. Public concern, according to the staff, has been demonstrated in a variety of ways, including lack of volunteer sites for disposal facilities, delays in enacting necessary legislation, changes in states\u2019 legislation affecting site-selection processes, strict site-selection regulations, and litigation.", "Moreover, according to the staff, public concern tends to increase and change as the site-selection process advances.", "The process of developing compacts and selecting a state within a compact to develop a disposal facility illustrates the difficulty at the political level of moving forward with a program for developing a disposal facility. In the early 1980s, 11 northeastern states were considering forming a regional compact. However, the compact never materialized because, according to observers, no state would agree to host a disposal facility for the large amount of waste that would be coming from the other states. Subsequently, the states splintered into smaller compacts, and several states decided to independently pursue their own waste disposal solutions, but none has selected a site for licensing.", "In an earlier report, we also pointed out that choosing sites for disposal facilities could be controversial and time-consuming.

Moreover, the studies were limited to assumptions that the volume of waste would continue at the same rate for the life of the facilities. The volume may increase or decrease, depending, for example, on how and when nuclear power plants are dismantled.

A 1991 report on small volume facilities concluded that unit costs rise radically as facility size decreases. The report estimated that costs were 143 percent higher for a disposal facility capable of annually accepting 10,000 cubic feet of waste than for a facility with three times this waste acceptance capacity. A 1993 study concluded that efforts to develop a cost-effective waste disposal facility should seek to match facility size as closely as possible to disposal waste demand and concentrate waste disposal activities at a small number of large sites.", "Disposal facilities that can handle high volumes of commercially generated low-level waste enjoy economies of scale because a significant portion of facility costs are fixed and do not vary with volume of disposal. These fixed costs can be spread over the high number of waste units received, thus lowering the per-unit cost of disposal. Because fixed costs are very significant in low-level waste disposal, a facility\u2019s average costs decline markedly as facility size increases. (See table 3.1.) Also, a few large sites can reduce the fixed costs of identifying and licensing many small sites.", "Although there is agreement among the studies on the efficiency of fewer, larger facilities, only three of the seven studies we reviewed estimated the optimal number of sites. The estimates for the optimum number of sites ranged from two to five. In 1990, Bullard and Weger found that facilities designed to handle annual volumes between 200,000 and 500,000 cubic feet were most economically efficient. Using DOE\u2019s projection of 933,000 cubic feet on average annually for the period 2000 to 2030, the number of economically efficient sites would be from two to five. In 1992, Coates, Heid, and Munger estimated the maximum number of economically viable sites to be five, while stating that a more realistic estimate would be two or three facilities.", "We were not able to develop a comparative cost analysis to demonstrate the relative efficiency of a wide range of facility sizes because all available cost studies contained either outdated data, which do not reflect current marketplace conditions, or limited scope for considering a narrow range of disposal facility sizes. However, all available cost information we collected point to a rapidly rising trend in major cost categories and most notably in pre-operating and siting costs.", "Cost information from North Carolina and Nebraska confirm that states are facing escalating costs. In 1989, North Carolina projected that pre-licensing costs would be $17.7 million; by 1991 the estimate had tripled to $51.1 million. Nebraska\u2019s total cost estimates rose 231 percent from 1987 to 1992, from $36.9 million to $122.3 million. Also, NRC reported in its study that California\u2019s cost estimate had increased by a factor of six.

Typically, NRC licenses these nuclear power plants to operate for 40 years, but many utilities are interested in extending the authorized operating lives of their plants by up to 20 years. Although NRC\u2019s regulations permit such life extensions, no civilian nuclear power plant has yet operated for 40 years. Sixteen plants have been permanently shut down before operating that long.", "In the next 20 years, about 50 nuclear power plants will have to be retired unless their licenses are extended. No utility has yet submitted an application to extend its operating license, and since 1979 utilities have retired seven nuclear plants earlier than had originally been anticipated.For example, owners of the Yankee Rowe and the Monticello plants originally planned to submit applications to NRC for license extensions as part of a cooperative program between DOE and the nuclear power industry. However, in 1992, the utility that owns the Monticello plant indefinitely deferred its application for a number of reasons, such as increases in estimated costs of upgrading to new equipment standards, and DOE\u2019s inability to accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Then, in 1992, the owner of the Yankee Rowe plant decided to retire that plant for economic reasons.", "Thus, future decisions on when to retire civilian nuclear power plants from service, including the possibility of extending the operating lives of these plants, will affect the volumes of commercially generated low-level waste that must be disposed of over the next several decades. The state of Pennsylvania, for example, has estimated that extending, by 20 years, the operating lives of the 12 nuclear power plants located in states that make up the Appalachian Compact could produce an additional 3.3 million cubic feet of low-level waste through the first quarter of the next century."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timing of Decontaminating and Dismantling Nuclear Power Plants Will Affect Waste Volume", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the low-level waste that civilian nuclear power plants produce during their operating periods, many components of the plants become contaminated with radioactivity as a result of years of plant operations.

Although specific decommissioning plans may vary from plant to plant, NRC generally requires that a utility complete decommissioning within 60 years of the plant\u2019s retirement. To meet the 60-year requirement, utilities may either dismantle and/or decontaminate portions of a plant that contain radioactive contaminants shortly after retirement or allow the radioactive contaminants to decay over a period of years prior to decontamination and/or dismantlement.", "Thus, decisions on when to decontaminate and dismantle retired plants will affect the waste volume just as decisions on when to retire nuclear power plants will affect the volume. DOE estimates that decommissioning and decontaminating the nuclear power plants that utilities will shut down over the next 30 years will generate about 55 million cubic feet of low-level waste. DOE assumed a 2-year planning period after a plant has been permanently shut down followed by a 4-year decontamination period. Either more or less waste than estimated, however, could be generated and disposed of at new disposal facilities, depending on the timing of decommissioning and decontamination of these plants. If utilities decontaminate and dismantle more nuclear plants over the next 30 years than projected, they could generate even more low-level waste.", "Even if nuclear power plants are not decommissioned and decontaminated immediately, there may be a sizable amount of waste generated to keep them operating.

Since 1980, the volume has decreased.

Some of the officials said that uncertainties in the costs of storage and disposal could eventually lead to reduced volume through new or additional treatment that would not necessarily reduce radioactivity. Others said that the uncertainties could lead to reduced usage of radioactive materials, particularly among smaller generators.

Several former disposal facilities experienced environmental problems, such as radionuclides leaking into groundwater. However, several state officials and generators said that new disposal facilities would not encounter such problems because the land disposal regulations developed by NRC in 1982 include, among other things, stricter requirements for investigating sites and building and operating facilities. In addition, NRC officials pointed out that each new disposal facility would have to comply with these regulations, including limits on the dose of radiation that a member of the public could receive each year from operation of the facility. (App. II provides a brief description of NRC\u2019s standard for allowable radioactive risk to the public and EPA\u2019s current concern about NRC\u2019s standard.)

The acreage dedicated to such facilities, including buffer zones, will require monitoring and limited land-use applications for at least a century. Furthermore, unless the currently planned facilities can expand their operating lives, there may be a need to establish more sites in 20 to 30 years.

Estimating potential transportation benefits may be difficult, because of the many factors, such as road conditions, weather, driver error, and type of vehicle, that contribute to accidents. In addition, many generators use various waste brokers and processors in different parts of the nation for temporary storage, packaging, and treatment of waste before sending it to disposal facilities, which could also affect transportation distances. Proponents of new disposal facilities also point out that the transportation of waste has never created a grave environmental or safety risk. According to DOE, 53 transportation accidents involving low-level waste were reported in the 20-year period from 1971 to 1991.

One concern is the potential for releases of radioactive materials in the event of an accident caused by an event such as a fire, hurricane, or tornado. According to an NRC official, no serious accidents related to storage have occurred in the past. Although NRC has not conducted any analyses of the potential consequences of such an event, it believes the risk of potential releases as a result of an event or accident at one of numerous storage sites around the country is higher than the risk of a release from a limited number of disposal sites.", "Another NRC concern relates to potential degradation of the packages that contain stored waste. Depending on the waste storage environment, degradation of waste packages could occur in several ways, such as temperature fluctuations, corrosion, generation of gases and corrosive substances, and radiation-induced embrittlement of certain containers. (Fig. 4.5 shows an example of corrosion of low-level waste drums at a DOE facility.) Therefore, waste generators need to maintain sufficient integrity of their stored waste packages to prevent dispersal of the waste during storage, transport, and handling. According to NRC, if gone undetected, degradation of packages could lead to spills or releases during handling for disposal, which would create the potential for increased worker exposures during handling, repackaging, and cleanup. NRC officials did not have any examples of such degradation, they said, because extended on-site storage is a relatively new phenomenon.", "Another of NRC\u2019s concerns is the possibility of increased radiation exposure to workers from storage-related activities. For example, conducting routine radiation surveys and inspecting waste in storage could add to workers\u2019 occupational doses of radiation. Nuclear utilities in Michigan, for example, indicated that technicians may experience greater exposure levels due to the need to store larger quantities of waste.", "In addition to NRC\u2019s concerns, some generators and state officials said that there could be a greater risk of illegal dumping as the amounts of waste in storage increase and storage capacity becomes saturated. For example, the officials said, NRC\u2019s regulations permit, under certain conditions, users of radioactive materials to dispose of wastes in sewage systems. In the absence of access to disposal facilities, these generators and officials said, waste generators might dispose of waste in sewage systems in excess of the limits that NRC permits. In a 1980 report, we reported that the abrupt closure of disposal facilities in 1979 might have led to some illegal dumping.", "Another concern among some generators is a possible reduction in nuclear health care and medical research because of a lack of access to disposal sites and storage capabilities. For example, Organizations United for Responsible Low-Level Radioactive Waste Solutions said that hospitals and clinics could be forced to stop nuclear medicine procedures to diagnose heart disease, detect cancer, or cure thyroid disease. In some cases, the organization said that physicians will choose other, less desirable, alternatives, such as ultra-sound, rather than referring a patient to another hospital for a nuclear medicine procedure. The organization also said that medical research on cancer, AIDS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and other illnesses could suffer.

The radiation safety officer at a hospital in California told us that the hospital began the legal disposal of radionuclides in the sewage system for the first time in 1993. The radiation safety officer for a hospital in Washington, D.C., told us that, when the District lost access to a disposal facility in 1993, he encouraged a variety of efforts for researchers at his institution, including legal sewage disposal.

Medical experts at some hospitals told us that they did not believe that disposing of radioactive wastes in sewage systems within legal limits is the best method of disposal. They said that this disposal method provides additional exposure to the public and, although the amounts disposed of are within permissible levels, the resulting exposure to the public is not as low as is reasonably achievable by disposing of wastes in a land disposal facility. Furthermore, we recently reported that nine sewage treatment plants were contaminated by radioactive materials appearing in the sewage sludge, ash, and related by-products that are sometimes used for agricultural and residential purposes, such as lawn and garden fertilizer. Officials at the affected plants said that they had been unaware of the problem and had not tested for it. The full extent of the radioactive contamination at sewage treatment plants across the country is unknown, in part, because NRC has inspected only 15 of the approximately 1,110 NRC licensees that may discharge radioactive material to treatment plants to determine if a concentration problem exists. Furthermore, NRC did not have information on another approximately 2,000 licensees that discharge radioactive materials into sewers because inspections of these licensees are the responsibility of agreement states.", "Another alternative, treatment by on-site incineration, might be attractive to waste generators for some waste if local opposition were not an issue. Local communities, however, may not always accept incineration facilities, and some generators may be concerned about taking possession of ash that contains radioactive elements from other waste generators. Some generators have used on-site incinerators to reduce their waste, particularly biodegradable waste, such as radioactive animal carcasses. However, because of local opposition, it may be difficult to build new incinerators or continue using existing ones. In 1984, for example, an engineering firm canceled its plan to build a low-level waste incinerator in Pennsylvania because of public opposition, and in 1994 the National Institutes of Health closed an incinerator in Bethesda, Maryland, because of public concern about emissions.

According to the group, states commenting on a draft of its report generally supported development of a national plan; however, some states took a strong position against the federal government selecting sites for disposal facilities within their jurisdictions. Also, other states said that states should retain the right, within the concept of a national plan, to veto the selection of sites for disposal facilities within their jurisdictions.", "At about the time of the report, selecting sites for new disposal facilities began to be seen as a state, rather than federal, responsibility. The governors of the three states with operating disposal facilities\u2014Nevada, South Carolina, and Washington\u2014testified to this effect before congressional committees.

Other states, however, wanted a federal solution because, in their view, public opinion would probably impede states\u2019 unilateral efforts to establish regional disposal facilities. \u201cSince low-level waste is generated in every state, it is unfair to expect three states to shoulder the sole responsibility for the safe disposal of the entire nation\u2019s waste. Unlike high level waste, the problem is not so technologically complex that it requires the leadership of the federal government to manage it effectively. Because the states are primarily charged with protecting their citizens\u2019 health, safety, and environment, it is appropriate that they assume this responsibility.

Those proponents who suggested federal funds to assist the states, however, did not provide specifics on how such funds would improve states\u2019 programs to develop disposal facilities or how the funds would be made available.", "Other proponents have suggested financial penalties, such as withholding funds to states that do not make measurable progress in developing new disposal facilities. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, as amended, tried this approach to a limited degree. The act required states to meet a series of milestones that would lead to the development of new disposal facilities by January 1, 1993. If a state did not meet a milestone, penalties included payment by waste generators within the state of a non-refundable surcharge and/or loss of rebates to states from an escrow account, managed by DOE and accrued from waste generators. From 1986 to 1992, DOE collected about $37 million in the escrow account. In 1993, DOE disbursed $26 million to states, including the final payment of $11 million to all but the 5 states without plans for future access to disposal facilities. The remaining $11 million will be returned to waste generators because the states and compacts did not provide any new disposal facilities by the January 1, 1993, deadline.", "Assuming that states are in strict control of their siting efforts, financial incentives or penalites might have some impact. However, the process of selecting a site and developing a disposal facility is complex, controversial and, therefore, may be beyond a state\u2019s ability to strictly control in all cases. Since the surcharges have ended, the possibility has also been suggested that the federal government could withhold other federal funds, such as transportation funds, if states do not meet predetermined deadlines. Those proponents who have suggested this approach, however, have not addressed questions about equity and the effects that such an approach would have on programs for which the funds are typically provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transferring Responsibility to the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["Some supporters have suggested making the federal government (probably DOE) responsible for disposing of commercially generated low-level waste. First, there are precedents for the approach\u2014DOE has been given responsibility for disposing of spent fuel from civilian nuclear power plants and the most radioactive class of commercially generated low-level waste. Second, this approach could permit selection nationwide of sites for new disposal facilities having superior geologic and technical qualifications rather than relying on qualified, but not necessarily outstanding, sites within many states. Third, federal sites might create less public opposition if all the waste is concentrated at remote locations. Last, the waste might be disposed of at one or more federal reservations that are already too badly contaminated to restore to unrestricted use. For example, some supporters suggested establishing regional collection and processing centers for low-level waste with disposal of the waste on federal lands that are dedicated to perpetual care, such as portions of DOE\u2019s Nevada Test Site, because of radioactive contamination. This alternative, according to its advocates, would spare uncontaminated public lands.", "At first glance, federal responsibility for disposing of commercially generated low-level waste may appear attractive because of the existing precedents and the potential for disposing of this waste at already contaminated federal facilities. Indeed, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 assigned DOE responsibility for developing one or more geologic repositories for permanent disposal of spent fuel from civilian nuclear power plants and other highly radioactive waste. Moreover, amendments to that act in 1987 directed DOE to investigate one site\u2014Yucca Mountain, Nevada\u2014as a candidate site for a repository. If, after investigating that site, DOE determines that the site is suitable for a repository, it must recommend approval of the site to the President. Thus, in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, the Congress directed that the site at Yucca Mountain be investigated for possible use as a site for a repository and established procedures for making a political decision on selecting the site following a technical determination on the suitability of the site.", "However, establishing a similar method for federal disposal of commercially generated low-level waste may be more difficult for several reasons. First, as recognized by the task force of the National Governors\u2019 Association, disposal of commercially generated low-level waste is not so technologically complex that it requires federal management. Second, states with substantial federal lands have opposed efforts to place waste disposal facilities within their borders. In 1991, 21 western governors said that the west had assumed a large part of the national waste management burden. The governors pointed out that a western state is the host to DOE\u2019s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, which is a proposed repository for disposal of DOE\u2019s transuranic waste, and the candidate repository site at Yucca Mountain. Also, at the time of the governors\u2019 statement, two of the three existing facilities for disposing of commercially generated low-level waste were located in the west. According to the governors, the west has been asked to shoulder a large part of the national waste burden, because of the region\u2019s geology, rainfall, and settlement patterns, while its environment and natural resources have been the lifeblood of the region. The governors said that the west should not sacrifice its environment to subsidize inadequate waste management practices in other parts of the country.", "Third, it is unclear that the federal government could be more successful than states in obtaining public acceptance of new waste disposal sites. When states sought responsibility for developing facilities for disposing of low-level waste, they argued that they could meet the needs and concerns of their citizens better than the federal government. States said that federal control over the selection of sites for disposal facilities would be more difficult because of longstanding public distrust of federal nuclear waste activities. More recently, the Task Force on Radioactive Waste Management established by the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board concluded that, despite some progress, there continues to be widespread lack of trust in DOE\u2019s radioactive waste management activities. On a pragmatic level, the task force said that public trust and confidence is generally essential for agencies to effectively carry out their missions.", "The 1985 amendments to the low-level waste act made DOE responsible for disposing of the most hazardous class of commercially generated low-level waste. Thus, a modified method of placing disposal responsibility in the federal government is to make DOE responsible for disposing of still other, relatively hazardous, classes of low-level waste. The argument for this more modest federal assumption of disposal responsibility is that states might then find it easier to develop facilities for disposing of low-level waste that is relatively less hazardous. For example, the Illinois commission\u2019s decision in 1993 to reject a site for a disposal facility was, in part, based on the commission\u2019s uncertainty over whether the proposed engineered facility would contain the long-lived waste that would have been disposed of in the proposed facility for the period of time\u2014up to 500 years\u2014that it would take for those radioactive materials to decay. On the other hand, federal assumption of responsibility for disposing of more commercially generated low-level waste would require the federal government to find a disposal solution for this waste and would not relieve the states of the need to develop facilities for disposing of the relatively large-volume classes of low-level waste with less concentrated long-lived materials.", "For several years, the possibility that DOE would treat and dispose of mixed waste\u2014low-level radioactive waste mixed with hazardous materials\u2014has been under consideration. In November 1990, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Forum requested that DOE explore this possibility. Although DOE has not made a decision on this request, in October 1994, DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management said that the agency, in consultation with states, would consider incorporating disposal of commercially generated mixed waste into plans that DOE is preparing for managing mixed wastes located at its nuclear facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Private Sector Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["Another alternative is increasing the private sector\u2019s responsibility for developing and operating disposal facilities similar to the role the private sector had previously. Before the Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 was enacted, the private sector had developed, owned, and operated disposal facilities regulated by the states or NRC. However, environmental problems occurred at some facilities, and states in which some of these facilities were located opposed the use of these facilities by waste generators nationwide. For these and other reasons, states concluded that they could best control their own destinies by forming compacts and assuming responsibility for developing disposal facilities.", "Private-sector responsibility for developing, owning, and operating disposal facilities for commercially generated low-level waste would be consistent with the role of the private sector in disposing of other waste materials, such as solid and hazardous wastes. Moreover, states\u2019 previous environmental concerns may have been addressed, to some extent, by NRC\u2019s issuance in 1982 of regulations governing development of disposal facilities. Finally, there is a recent precedent for private sector development of a low-level waste disposal facility. In 1988, the state of Utah, which belongs to the Northwest Compact, authorized a private company to develop and operate a disposal facility for certain kinds of high-volume, low-radioactivity low-level waste. The facility has since received licenses and permits required for the disposal of these wastes and operates under a resolution passed by the Northwest Compact. According to NRC officials, this facility does not accept routine operating waste from utilities. Moreover, the officials said that the bulk wastes that the facility does accept will not be accepted at most of the disposal facilities that states are developing.", "For at least two reasons, however, having the private sector develop and operate disposal facilities does not appear to be a favorable alternative. First, that approach would end states\u2019 ability, provided by the compact approach of the 1980 act, as amended, to restrict access to disposal facilities located within their borders to waste generators within the compact in which the state is a member. Second, finding a site for and developing a disposal facility appears to be at least as difficult as it was before the act was passed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["Several other alternatives\u2014from temporary storage to a ban on the commercial uses of radioactive materials\u2014have also been offered. Critics of states\u2019 selections of candidate sites for disposal facilities, for example, have suggested that utilities store the low-level waste generated by operation of nuclear power plants at these plants and that all other low-level waste either be stored at nuclear power plants or some other central storage facility. Several states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York, are considering such approaches, but none have adopted them.", "There are, however, several potential problems with the storage approach: If medical and academic waste generators must pay for a centralized facility solely for their waste, they may, when possible, opt for less costly treatment or storage alternatives.", "Finding a central storage site could be as difficult as finding and developing a disposal site and facility if local residents do not perceive that a storage facility poses less risk to them than a disposal facility. Earlier experience with the concept of a central facility for storing spent fuel illustrates this potential problem. In that case, some state, local, and environmental groups opposed DOE\u2019s plans to construct a storage facility because of concerns that the facility could become a facility for permanent storage of the spent fuel.", "A state with a centralized storage facility might not be able to prevent waste generators in other states from shipping their wastes to the central storage facility.", "Because some of the stored low-level waste would probably be hazardous for more than 100 years, disposal, rather than temporary storage, would eventually be required.", "Because of the long half-lives of some radioactive materials that become low-level waste, some critics of current state efforts to develop disposal facilities have suggested that commercial firms substitute shorter-lived materials that can be stored until they decay to a harmless level and/or recycle the longer-lived materials. According to researchers in the medical and biotechnology community, however, the use of shorter-lived materials are not always an option in their research.", "Representatives of some environmental groups have also recommended a moratorium on the generation of low-level waste until they are assured that the waste will be permanently managed in an environmentally sound manner. Such an approach would require a serious examination of the tradeoffs in reduced risk from nuclear waste compared to the reduced benefits from nuclear materials in society. For example, a moratorium might diminish the ability to conduct biomedical research. Adopting a moratorium would, in effect, require repealing the current policy\u2014established in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended\u2014of encouraging peaceful uses of atomic energy.", "Finally, two alternatives that would result in the disposal of low-level waste outside the United States have been suggested. One such approach is shipping waste to another country. NRC has developed a proposed rule on licensing imports and exports of low-level waste for disposal. In commenting on the proposed rule, some state officials said that they are concerned that the rule might encourage waste exports at the expense of new domestic disposal facilities, and others did not see the need for the proposed rule in their states because waste could not move out of their compacts without their approval. Also, current international agreements discourage or prohibit this practice. All nations are required to do their best to ensure that nuclear waste is not exported unless the sending and receiving nation approves and the parties agree it is in their best interests.", "A return to the earlier practice of dumping low-level waste in the Atlantic and/or Pacific Oceans is also an alternative. However, the Congress, in 1982, essentially banned ocean disposal, except for research purposes and, in November 1993, the United States was among the signatories to an international agreement banning ocean disposal of radioactive waste for at least 25 years."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
