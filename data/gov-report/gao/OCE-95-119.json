In 1992 we examined the role of fiscal policy in promoting or inhibiting long-term economic growth and concluded that deficit reduction was key to our nation\u2019s long-term economic health. We observed that a path of \u201cno action\u201d could not be sustained over the long run. If policymakers did not take the initiative, the economic consequences would force action. We identified three forces driving the long-term growth of budget deficits: health spending, interest costs, and\u2014after 2010\u2014Social Security.", "In our current work, we used a long-term economic growth model to simulate three of the many possible fiscal paths through the year 2025: (1) a path that takes no action on the deficit, (2) a path that \u201cmuddles through\u201d with deficits at 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), roughly approximating deficits of recent years, and (3) a path that reaches balance in 2002 and sustains it. To suggest some of the trade-offs facing policymakers in choosing among fiscal policies, we examined some long-term economic and fiscal outcomes of these paths. We also simulated how some types of early action on the deficit, including early action on health, might affect the long-term deficit outlook. Finally, we examined the prospects for sustaining budget balance over the long term. While this report discusses the consequences of alternative fiscal paths, it does not suggest any particular course of action, since only the Congress can resolve the fundamental policy question of choosing the fiscal policy path most appropriate for the nation.", "In our simulations, we employed a model originally developed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) that relates long-term GDP growth to economic and budget factors. (For details of the model\u2019s assumptions, see table I.1.) Simulations are useful for comparing the potential outcomes of alternative policies within a common economic framework but should not be interpreted as forecasts of the level of economic activity 30 years in the future, given the broad range of uncertainty about future economic changes. Simulation results provide qualitative illustrations, not quantitative forecasts, of the budget or economic outcomes associated with alternative policy paths."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Economic growth\u2014which is central to almost all our major concerns as a society\u2014requires investment, which, over the longer term, depends on saving. Since the 1970s, nonfederal saving has declined while federal budget deficits have consumed ever-higher levels of these increasingly scarce savings. The result has been to decrease the amount of national saving potentially available for investment. (See figure 1.) Since we last reported on this issue in 1992, overall national saving has remained low. These conditions\u2014less nonfederal saving and a greater share of this saving absorbed by deficits\u2014do not bode well for the nation\u2019s future productive capacity and future generations\u2019 standard of living. The surest way to increase the resources available for investment is to increase national saving, and the surest way to increase national saving is to reduce the federal deficit.", "Our 1992 analysis showed that an indefinite continuation of then-current federal budget policy was not sustainable. Without policy change, the continuation of large increases in health care costs, a jump in Social Security costs after 2010 as the baby boom generation retires, and escalating interest costs would fuel progressively larger deficits. Growing deficits and the resulting lower saving would lead to dwindling investment, slower growth, and finally a decline of real GDP. Living standards, in turn, would at first stagnate and then fall. Our view was that a \u201cno action\u201d path with respect to the deficit was not sustainable. Action on the deficit might be postponed, but it could not be escaped.", "Our simulation of several hypothetical deficit reduction paths further showed that the timing and magnitude of deficit reduction would affect both the amount of sacrifice required and the economic benefits realized. Acting sooner would reduce future interest costs and therefore total deficit reduction required from other sources. Achieving and sustaining balance or surplus would yield long-term benefits in the form of higher national saving, higher investment, and more rapid economic growth. By promoting economic growth, deficit elimination would give future generations more resources to finance the baby boom\u2019s retirement.", "Since our 1992 report, the Congress and the President have taken action on the deficit. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) will reduce the federal deficit cumulatively for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 by over $400 billion. Despite this short-term progress, however, OBRA 93 did not fundamentally alter the growth of the major entitlement programs driving the long-term deficit problem. The Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, created in late 1993, highlighted the nation\u2019s vulnerability to the growth of these programs and their potential fiscal effects. Currently, the Congress and the administration are again considering proposals which could reduce future deficits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inaction on the Deficit Is Not Sustainable", "paragraphs": ["As in our 1992 work, our updated simulation results show that continuing current spending and taxation policies unimpeded over the long term would have major consequences for economic growth. A fiscal policy of \u201cno action\u201d through 2025 implies federal spending of nearly 44 percent of GDP and a deficit of over 23 percent of GDP. (See figure 2.) By drastically reducing national saving, rising deficits would shrink private investment and eventually result in a declining capital stock. Given our labor force and productivity growth assumptions, GDP would inevitably begin to decline. These negative effects of rapidly increasing deficits on the economy would, we believe, force action at some point before the end of the simulation period. If policymakers did not take the initiative, external events\u2014for example, the unwillingness of foreign investors to sustain a deteriorating American economy\u2014would compel action. While the \u201cno action\u201d simulation is not a prediction of what would actually happen, it illustrates the pressures to change the nation\u2019s current fiscal course.", "The shift in the composition of federal spending by the end of the simulation period shows that, under a long-term \u201cno action\u201d path, health care, interest costs, and\u2014after 2010\u2014Social Security spending drive increasingly large and unsustainable deficits. (See figure 3.)", "As federal spending in the simulation heads toward 44 percent of GDP in 2025, the major federal health care programs\u2014Medicare and Medicaid\u2014would become the major programmatic driver of budget deficits. Their share of the economy would more than triple between 1994 and 2025. Health care cost inflation and the aging of the population work together to produce this rapid growth.", "At the same time, simulated interest spending increases dramatically.", "Escalating deficits resulting from the increased spending add substantially to the national debt. Rising debt, in turn, raises spending on interest, which compounds the deficit problem, driving a vicious circle. The effects of compound interest are clearly visible, as interest spending rises from about 3 percent of GDP in 1994 to over 13 percent in 2025.", "Social Security also grows, but its rise is much slower than health care. Its expansion occurs mainly after 2010 as the baby boom generation retires.", "The expansion of the three forces fueling budget deficits means that the federal government would find it increasingly difficult to fund other needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficit Reduction Would Promote Economic Growth in the Long Term", "paragraphs": ["The economic benefits of deficit reduction are illustrated by the three fiscal paths we simulate in our model. (See table 1.) As discussed above, a fiscal policy of \u201cno action\u201d is not economically sustainable over the long term. The \u201cmuddling through\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d paths show that the further away fiscal policy moves from a path of \u201cno action,\u201d the better the outlook for the economy in the long term.", "The differences in GDP per capita at 2025 reflect major differences in the underlying capacity of the economy in our illustrative simulations to generate growth. Our \u201cno action\u201d simulation, when maintained unimpeded through 2025, portrays the potential long-term economic impact of a declining national saving rate. Under a policy of \u201cno action\u201d on the deficit, investment would peak in the next decade and then decline steadily due to the lack of national saving. Shortly thereafter, capital depreciation would outweigh investment, and the capital stock would actually begin to decline. Given our assumptions about labor force and productivity growth, the declining capital stock would lead inevitably to a decline in GDP. By 2025, investment would be entirely eliminated, the capital stock would have declined to less than half of its 1994 level, and per capita GDP\u2014only about 5 percent greater in real terms than at the start of the 30-year period\u2014would be poised for a precipitous drop.", "Compared to a policy of \u201cno action,\u201d more stringent fiscal policies would result in greater economic growth. Tighter fiscal policies can promote greater private investment in the long term, a larger capital stock, and therefore a larger future GDP. The \u201cmuddling through\u201d simulation shows such GDP growth but because of persistent deficits, debt increases well above current levels. In the model, the larger debt requires increased foreign capital inflows. Our \u201cbalance\u201d simulation, compared to \u201cmuddling through,\u201d achieves greater deficit reduction and a larger GDP with lower debt and, accordingly, less reliance on foreign capital. And as we stated in 1992, a strongly growing economy will be needed to support present commitments to the future elderly and a rising standard of living for the future working population.", "In actuality, the differences between alternative fiscal policies would likely be even greater than our simulation results suggest. Our model incorporates conservative assumptions about the relationship between savings, investment, and GDP growth that tend to understate the differences between the economic outcomes associated with alternative fiscal policies. For example, in our model, interest rates, productivity, and foreign investment all hold steady regardless of economic change. In the \u201cno action\u201d simulation, we assumed that they all remain constant in the face of a collapsing U.S. economy; this is unlikely to be true. Similarly, under our \u201cbalance\u201d simulation, interest rates, productivity, and foreign investment do not respond favorably to increased national savings and investment. While the magnitude of any response is difficult to predict, some change could be expected. To the extent that our assumptions are conservative, differences between a \u201cbalance\u201d path and the other two paths would be larger than simulated.", "We recognize that deficit reduction would have costs in the short term. The deficit reduction necessary to achieve beneficial long-term economic outcomes and reduced interest costs would entail difficult budgetary reductions and require a greater share of national income to be devoted to saving, thus foregoing some consumption in the short term. The greater the fiscal austerity, the more consumption would need to be sacrificed. However, more stringent deficit reduction measures mean correspondingly larger increases in consumption in the long term. The decision policymakers face, then, involves a trade-off between the immediate sacrifice of deficit reduction and the deferred but more severe economic costs associated with continued deficits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficit Reduction Would Reduce Interest Costs", "paragraphs": ["The share of the federal budget devoted to interest costs would be reduced through deficit reduction, freeing up scarce resources to satisfy other public needs. This will be particularly important for future budgets when the aging of the population will prompt greater spending pressures.", "The dynamics of compound interest which, given no action on the deficit, lead inexorably to spiralling deficits, yield dividends under a balance simulation. The more rapidly real debt is reduced and real interest costs brought down, the less long-term programmatic sacrifice required. Action taken to achieve balance by 2002 and to sustain it shrinks interest as a percent of total outlays from 12 percent in 1994 to less than 5 percent in 2025, assuming a constant interest rate. (See figure 4.) In contrast, higher interest costs would approach 18 percent of outlays by 2025 under the \u201cmuddling through\u201d path because the deficit is maintained at 3 percent of GDP, resulting in higher debt. Moreover, due to growing pressures from health and Social Security commitments, the \u201cmuddling through\u201d path requires progressively greater spending reductions just to keep the deficit from growing above 3 percent of GDP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Type of Spending Reduction Matters", "paragraphs": ["Not all spending cuts have the same impact over the long run. Decisions about how to reduce the deficit will reflect\u2014among other considerations\u2014judgments about the role of the federal government and the effectiveness of individual programs. In our 1992 work, we drew particular attention to federal investment in physical capital, human capital, and research and development. Such public investment plays a key role in economic growth, directly and by creating an environment conducive to private sector investment. Accordingly, in addition to the overall level of deficit or surplus, the proportion of the budget devoted to investment spending will also affect long-term growth.", "The extent to which deficit reduction affects spending on fast-growing programs also matters. Although a dollar is a dollar in the first year it is cut\u2014regardless of what programmatic changes it represents\u2014cutbacks in the base of fast-growing programs generate greater savings in the future than those in slower-growing programs, assuming the specific cuts are not offset by increases in the growth rates of the programs.", "Figure 5 illustrates this point by comparing the long-run effects of a $50-billion cut in health spending with those of the same dollar amount cut from unspecified other programs. For both paths the cut occurs in 1996 and is assumed to be permanent but, after 1996, spending is assumed to continue at the same rates of growth as those shown in the \u201cno action\u201d simulation.We used the simple assumption that a reduction either in health or in other programs would not alter the expected growth rates simply to illustrate the point that a cut in high-growth areas of spending will exert greater fiscal effects in the future than the same size cut in low-growth areas.", "Because the 1996 cuts are equal dollar amounts, the two simulations appear very similar in the early part of the period. A gap develops between them as time passes, however, and by 2025 the difference between the two paths has widened to nearly 4 percent of GDP. The gap appears and then widens because health spending grows much faster than other areas of spending. A cut in this spending area reduces the proportion of the budget growing quickly, thereby reducing the total budget growth. The effects of compound interest, discussed earlier in this report, magnify the difference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Pressures Will Continue", "paragraphs": ["Even if a balanced budget is achieved early in the next century, deficits could reemerge as the coming demographic changes continue to exert fiscal pressures. Depending upon the types of spending reductions adopted, future growth in health, Social Security, and interest costs\u2014the deficit drivers\u2014will continue to place demands on federal budgetary resources. As the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform recently observed, the decreasing ratio of the labor force to retirees will exacerbate the fiscal effects of the growing elderly population.", "In addition to the effects of the known demographic shift, uncertainties about the growth of health care costs also promise to complicate future budget policy. Recent budgetary history has shown that health care costs have proven very difficult to predict. Experts we contacted agreed on only one thing\u2014long-range cost projections made today will be wrong. Whether they are too high or too low is unclear, although historically health projections have nearly always been too low. For these reasons, sustaining a balanced budget over the long term could be an ongoing challenge.", "Rather than discouraging efforts to reduce the deficit, an awareness of future fiscal pressures might instead be used to help inform current fiscal policy choices. For example, some program changes, if made today, would generate little in immediate savings but would exert large future outlay reductions. Program changes with such \u201cwedge-shaped\u201d savings paths might be important elements of a strategy to mitigate the longer-term spending pressures, as they were in several other nations that reduced fiscal deficits. Phasing in such changes over a longer time frame would give affected populations more time to adjust to these changes.

Conversely, the rate of economic growth helps determine the overall federal deficit or surplus through its effect on revenues and spending. Higher federal budget deficits reduce national saving while lower deficits increase national saving.

For Medicaid through 2004, we similarly assumed growth consistent with CBO\u2019s projections. For 2005 and thereafter, in the absence of long-range Medicaid projections from HCFA, we used projections developed in 1994 by the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.

The model represents growth as resulting from labor force increases, capital accumulation, and the various influences affecting total factor productivity. To allow a closer analysis of the long-term effects of fiscal policy, we added a set of relationships describing the federal budget and its links to the economy. The relationships follow the definitions of national income accounting, which differ slightly from those in the budget.", "The model is helpful for exploring the long-term implications of policies and for comparing alternative policies within a common economic framework.

The main influence of budget policy on long-term economic performance is through the effect of the federal deficit on national saving. Higher federal budget deficits reduce national saving while lower deficits increase national saving. The level of savings affects investment and, hence, GDP growth.", "Gross domestic product (GDP) is determined by the labor force, capital stock, and total factor productivity. GDP in turn influences nonfederal saving, which consists of private saving and state and local government surpluses or deficits. Through its effects on federal revenues and spending, GDP also helps determine the federal budget deficit or surplus. Nonfederal and federal savings together comprise national saving, which influences private investment and the next period\u2019s capital stock. Capital combines with labor and total factor productivity to determine GDP in the next period, and the process continues.", "There also are important links between national saving and investment and the international sector, not shown in figure I.1 in order to keep the overview simple. In an open economy such as the United States, a decrease in saving due to, for example, an increase in the federal budget deficit, does not require an equal decrease in investment. Instead, part of the saving shortfall may be filled by foreign capital inflows. A portion of the net income that results from such investments flows abroad.", "If capital were perfectly mobile, foreign capital inflows could fully offset the effect on domestic investment of a decline in U.S. saving. The evidence continues to suggest, however, that a nation\u2019s investment is correlated with its own saving. Hence, we retained our 1992 assumption (based on the work of FRBNY) that net foreign capital inflows rise by one-third of any decrease in the national saving rate.", "Table I.1 lists the key assumptions incorporated in the model. The assumptions used tend to provide conservative estimates of the benefit of deficit reduction and the harm of deficit increases. The interest rate on the national debt is held constant, for example, even when deficits climb and the national saving rate plummets. Under such conditions, the more likely result would be a rise in the rate of interest and a more rapid increase in federal interest payments than our results display. Another conservative assumption is that the rate of total factor productivity growth is unaffected by the amount of investment. Productivity is assumed to advance 1 percent each year even if investment collapses. Such assumptions suggest that deficit changes could have greater effects than our results indicate.", "We have made several modifications to the model since the 1992 report, but its essential structure remains the same. The model incorporates the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) shift from 1982 to 1987 as the base year, and the switch from gross national product to GDP as the primary measure of overall economic activity.", "The more recent data prompted several parameter changes. For example, the inflation rate is now assumed to be 3.4 percent, down from 4.0 percent in our previous work, while the average interest rate is reduced to 7.2 percent from 7.8 percent. Our work also incorporates the CBO projection that deficits in the next few years will be somewhat lower than was foreseen in 1992.", "The distinction between the mandatory and discretionary components of the budget is important. Our approach has been modified to accommodate this distinction by reclassifying budget data based on the NIPA framework as mandatory or discretionary spending. From 1995 through 1999, CBO data were used for this reclassification. For the years from 2000 through 2005, we adopted CBO\u2019s assumption that discretionary spending would increase at the rate of inflation, and, thereafter, we assumed it would keep pace with GDP growth.", "Mandatory spending includes Health, Old Age Survivors\u2019 and Disability Insurance (OASDI, or Social Security), and a residual category covering other mandatory spending. For the first 9 years, health spending incorporates CBO\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid assumptions. Thereafter, Medicare follows the Trustees\u2019 1995 Alternative II projections. We smoothed the path of Medicaid spending from 2005 through 2011 in order to link CBO\u2019s spending assumptions to those of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. OASDI reflects the April 1995 Social Security Trustees\u2019 Alternative II projections.", "Other mandatory spending is a residual category consisting of all nonhealth, non-Social Security mandatory spending. It equals CBO\u2019s NIPA projection for Transfers, Grants, and Subsidies less Health, OASDI, and other discretionary spending.
