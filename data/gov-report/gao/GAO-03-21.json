This automated system was intended to address a number of specific weaknesses highlighted in several of our and Army studies since 1994 regarding the Army\u2019s inability to support its civilian personnel requirements by using an analytically based workload forecasting system. The Department of Defense\u2019s fiscal years 1997 and 1998 Annual Statements of Assurance highlighted the problems of not being able to relate personnel requirements to workload and budget as a material weakness in the Army\u2019s manpower requirements determination system. The Army Workload and Performance System was designed to address this weakness and to coordinate workforce requirements with workloads, initially at the Army\u2019s five maintenance depots and subsequently at other Army maintenance and industrial activities.", "The Army first outlined its strategy for designing and fielding this system in a master plan in April 1999. We reported in November 1999, however, that this master plan provided limited and incomplete information on future development plans and insufficient funding information. We recommended that the Army strengthen the management controls and oversight for the system\u2019s development and prepare a more comprehensive master plan that contained priorities, costs, benefits, and schedules. In response to congressional direction, the Army updated its original master plan in May 2001. Section 346 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107) required that the Army provide Congress annually a progress report on the implementation of the master plan during the preceding year. In May 2002, the Army submitted to Congress its first progress report on the implementation of the master plan. The report was presented in the form of a revised master plan. Section 346 also required that the General Accounting Office evaluate the Army\u2019s progress report. Lastly, section 346 encouraged the Army to develop a process to enhance data sharing between the Army Workload and Performance System and the Logistics Modernization Program. Beginning in February 2003, the Logistics Modernization Program will replace many of the old information systems that currently support the workload and performance system, and will become the primary data source for this system.", "As agreed with your offices, this report addresses whether (1) the May 2002 report provides adequate information for Congress to assess the Army\u2019s progress in implementing the Army Workload and Performance System, and (2) the interface the Army is developing between this system and the Logistics Modernization Program has been sufficiently tested to ensure that data can be shared between the two systems and that the capability of the workload and performance system will not be adversely affected."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army Workload and Performance System (AWPS) is intended to resolve long-standing systemic problems in the Army\u2019s civilian manpower requirements determination process. It is an information and reporting system that draws production and manpower data from other existing programs, including the Army\u2019s Standard Depot System. Its main purpose is to provide decision support tools for linking workload demands to manpower requirements and the budget process. The system was initially installed at Corpus Christi Army Depot, Texas, in June 1996. Since then, it has been put into operation at the Army\u2019s four other maintenance depots\u2014Anniston, Letterkenny, Red River, and Tobyhanna. In 1999, the Assistant Secretary of the Army certified the system as fully operational for the maintenance mission at the five maintenance depots.", "The Army is moving forward with the installation of AWPS at all of its logistics and industrial activities. To date the system is being used as a decision-making tool in other functional areas, including ammunition logistics, base operations, materials usage, working capital fund budgets, and reporting of net operating results. The Secretary of the Army has directed that AWPS be used throughout the Army as the standard Armywide mechanism for determining manpower requirements for all of its logistics and industrial activities.", "The first AWPS master plan, submitted to Congress in April 1999, described the Army\u2019s progress and future plans for developing and implementing the system. In our November 1999 report regarding that master plan, we pointed out that the information it contained was limited, and we recommended that the Army develop a more substantial master plan that incorporated all applications for which the system was to be implemented, along with their priorities, costs and benefits, and proposed schedules. We also recommended that the Army make improvements in the existing management and oversight structures. The House Report to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 required the Army to submit a revised master plan, incorporating our recommendations, by February 2001. Subsequently, section 346 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 required the Army to submit an annual progress report on its implementation of the revised master plan. Section 346 also required that these reports specifically address any changes made to the master plan since the previous report.", "In December 1999, the Army contracted with the Computer Sciences Corporation to create the Logistics Modernization Program, which is a new information system for managing the Army\u2019s supply, maintenance, and transportation functions. This system, initially called the Wholesale Logistics Modernization Program, will replace the existing Standard Depot System and many other source data systems, several of which provide data to AWPS. The Logistics Modernization Program is designed to improve readiness and logistics support to the war fighter by (1) reducing requisition response times, (2) improving the availability of supplies, (3) optimizing the use of inventory, and (4) responding more quickly to changing customer requirements. The milestones to the first deployment of the Logistics Modernization Program are shown in table 1.", "Once the Logistics Modernization Program becomes operational at the maintenance depots, the Army plans to shut down many of the old information systems that currently support AWPS and it will become the primary source for the data that AWPS needs to function. As a result, section 346 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 encouraged the Army to set up a process that would permit or enhance data sharing between the two systems. To ensure that the Army\u2019s AWPS capabilities remained intact, section 346 also mandated that the Army retain AWPS as its standard servicewide manpower system, under the Secretary of the Army\u2019s supervision and management. This mandate was further underscored in a letter dated August 9, 2001, from several congressional representatives to the Commander of the U.S. Materiel Command, which further requested that the Army refrain from incorporating the new system into the Logistics Modernization Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Does Not Contain Adequate Information to Assess Progress", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s May 2002 report on its workload and performance system does not contain the information that Congress needs to assess the Army\u2019s progress in implementing the system.

This updated version did not identify or explain the changes that the Army had made to the master plan since the May 2001 version. In addition, the Army\u2019s report did not contain certain cost, schedule, and performance information that would normally be expected.

Appendixes II and III provide tables showing the milestones and tasks identified in both the 2001 and 2002 reports. In comparing the two reports, we found that several milestones had been changed, but the 2002 report did not identify these changes nor did it provide a detailed discussion of the reasons for these changes or their significance. For example, in its 2001 report the Army had scheduled Corpus Christi Army Depot as the first site to prototype the Net Operating Result capability, beginning in August 2001. We found, however, that in the 2002 report this task was set back by 1 year\u2014to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. The same task was also scheduled to be prototyped at one of the ammunition sites by March 2002, but this milestone was later delayed by about 1 year until sometime between January and March 2003. In each case, the 2002 report did not provide an analysis or explanation for the scheduling change.", "We also found discrepancies between the two reports related to the phasing of certain tasks involved in implementing the new system. Some tasks that were assigned to a specific phase in the 2001 report were moved to a different phase in the 2002 report, and there was no discussion of why these changes were made or what their impact on the overall implementation schedule might be. For example, phase 1 of the 2001 report involved only the consolidation of ongoing implementation actions, whereas in the 2002 report phase 1 also included non-Army Material Command maintenance activities. The 2002 report, however, does not clearly address the status of tasks previously listed under phase 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Lacks Cost, Schedule, and Performance Data", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s 2002 plan does not contain the cost, schedule, and performance data that might normally be expected. For example, according to the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Regulation 5000.2-R, progress reports related to the acquisition of major new automated information systems should contain detailed information on such key parameters as cost, schedule, and performance. Army officials stated that the scope and cost of the AWPS system does not meet the minimum threshold to be considered a major information system and, thus, the regulation does not apply to it. While we agree that the AWPS system does not meet the threshold requirements of the regulation, we believe certain criteria in the regulation would provide Congress with the necessary information to properly evaluate the AWPS system and should therefore be addressed in the Army\u2019s progress reports. Consequently, we have analyzed the AWPS report using criteria from the regulation. Additionally, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agencies to have investment management processes and information to help ensure that information technology projects are being implemented at an acceptable cost and within a reasonable and expected time frame. In effect, these requirements and guidance recognize that one cannot manage what one cannot measure. Finally, in our November 1999 report on the Army\u2019s original master plan for AWPS, we identified several shortcomings, including the lack of detailed information on costs and expenditures, milestones, and performance. We recommended in that report that the Army develop a more substantive master plan that included priorities, costs and benefits, and schedules.", "In our analysis of the Army\u2019s 2002 plan, we found that, while it addresses some of these elements, it does not provide the detailed or complete data that is needed to adequately assess the Army\u2019s progress in implementing the workload and performance system. As table 2 shows, the 2002 plan contained information on a few parameters identified in DOD\u2019s guidance, including direct costs; dates for certain events, such as reaching initial operating capabilities; and objectives for operational requirements. However, it did not include information on a large number of parameters, such as total procurement costs, critical schedule dates, and measures of performance.", "In addition, the 2002 report did not contain necessary cost, scheduling, and performance data for the individual tasks that the Army has assigned to each implementation phase. Phase 1, implementation of the workload and performance system at non-Army Materiel Command maintenance depots; phase 2, expansion of the system into nonmaintenance missions (e.g., base operations, medical); and phase 3, development of decision- support tools for use at the major command and headquarters levels (e.g., working capital fund budget, links to depot maintenance operational system, and cross-organizational activities). As table 3 illustrates, the Army\u2019s report contained cost, scheduling, and performance information for only a small number of these tasks. Furthermore, we could only identify specific costs for one of the tasks and, in most cases, the milestones and performance measures were too broad and did not include interim measures and specific performance targets to measure progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Lacks Detailed Cost Data", "paragraphs": ["While the Army\u2019s May 2002 report provided some estimated funding requirements for AWPS for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, it did not contain the detailed information that could be used to assess the costs of implementing the system thus far and the costs of expanding it into other functional areas in the future. According to the Army Materiel Command, the total estimated costs for the AWPS program were about $44.8 million for fiscal years 1996 through 2002, and the estimated program costs for fiscal year 2003 are about $8.9 million. The primary source for this funding has been the Army\u2019s working capital fund. These figures and the funding sources, however, were not included in the Army\u2019s report. In addition, the Army\u2019s report did not identify the extent to which actual expenditures relate to the budgeted amounts. The report also did not provide any cost estimates for funding the Army\u2019s plan to expand AWPS to other nonmaintenance activities, such as base operations support. According to Army officials, these expansion plans will require funding through the Army\u2019s appropriated operations and maintenance accounts.", "In its report, the Army estimated that it would need about $20.1 million over the next 3 fiscal years (2004 through 2006), to ensure that the remaining tasks are implemented. Table 4 shows the Army\u2019s projected costs for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, which were included in its May 2002 report. According to the report, these future year costs are unfunded and the Army has not yet identified funding sources for them. These officials stated that, other than the funding that has been provided through the working capital fund, the department has not adequately funded the AWPS expansion effort in recent years and that this lack of funding has hampered their ability to plan and implement further expansions.", "As table 4 indicates, the Army did not provide a detailed cost analysis regarding the historical and projected costs for AWPS, nor did it provide a complete summary of the estimated costs to complete the tasks listed for each phase. Specifically, the table includes cost estimates for additional system implementation (phase 1) and for the development of decision support tools (phase 3), but it provides no specific estimates for expanding the system into other functional areas (phase 2).

Specifically, the report lacked schedules that include implementation and completion dates and interim milestones. For example, the Army is updating the Workload and Performance System applications from the original programming language to a more up-to-date programming language. According to the Army, this upgrade has been installed at all five maintenance depots and will be installed at other installations between May 2002 and May 2003. However, specific dates for implementing or completing this upgrade were not included in the May 2002 report. In another example, the Army indicates that it intends to install AWPS at other nonmaintenance activities outside the Army Materiel Command, but it does not provide specific milestones for each location or the specific tasks associated with the development and installation process. As shown in appendix III, the Army has established expected completion dates for some of the AWPS applications, but the completion dates for other long- term applications have not yet been set.", "The Army\u2019s May 2002 report also did not provide milestones for completing the interface between AWPS and the Logistics Modernization Program. Instead, it simply stated that between May 2002 and February 2003 the system has to accept, and operate with, data from the Logistics Modernization Program. The original date (July 2001) set to operationalize the interface at the first site, the Tobyhanna Army Depot, had changed by about 18 months.

For example, the capability of the performance measurement and control module in the AWPS software also exists in the Logistics Modernization Program software configuration. This module allows the user to compare actual resource expenditures against production plans, scheduled workload, and related budgets for specific projects in order to determine the likelihood of completing a project within its estimated time frame and budget. In addition, because the Logistics Modernization Program is not complete, the Army cannot be certain what other capabilities may be duplicated. Army officials at the Tobyhanna Army Depot expressed concerns that the need to operate and maintain both systems could lead to higher costs and duplication of efforts.", "A second module in AWPS, however, the strategic planning and forecasting module, is unique to AWPS and does not currently exist within the software configuration for the Logistics Modernization Program. This module provides the user with the capability to forecast manpower and capacity requirements based on future projected workload. More specifically, this module allows the Army the ability to conduct \u201cwhat if\u201d analyses for manpower and capacity requirements based on future workload projections at each of its maintenance activities. Contractor officials stated that although this capability could be built into the Logistics Modernization Program, it would have to be modified to be compatible with the current software configuration. By incorporating this capability into the Logistics Modernization Program, the Army could eliminate the need to operate and maintain two separate systems. Computer Sciences Corporation submitted a formal proposal to the Army in August 2001 to incorporate all of the capabilities of AWPS into the Logistics Modernization Program for an estimated contract price increase of about $2 million. Contractor officials told us in May 2002, however, that because of the amount of work they have dedicated to building the interface between the two systems, this cost estimate is no longer valid."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Army Has Not Sufficiently Tested the Interface between AWPS and the Logistics Modernization Program", "paragraphs": ["Although the Army has begun developing an interface between AWPS and the Logistics Modernization Program, it has not sufficiently tested the interface to ensure that data can be shared between the two systems and that the AWPS capability will not be adversely affected.

However, the Army has not demonstrated that the Logistics Modernization Program databases will be able to supply AWPS with the data that it needs to continue to function. Until the Army has placed the interface in operation at several sites, it will be too early to assess its effectiveness.", "The Army\u2019s contract with the Computer Sciences Corporation to develop and field the Logistics Modernization Program required that the contractor would create an interface between the two systems, and this work started in 1999. In February 2002, Army and contractor officials developed an interface control document that identified the data elements that AWPS would need from the Logistics Modernization Program databases to maintain its current capabilities. Since that time, contractor personnel have been working to locate the sources within the Logistics Modernization Program databases for each data element and determine the most expedient way to move that data into AWPS. According to Army and contractor officials, about 90 percent of the data elements had been located by May 2002.", "While initial testing of the interface began in August 2002, it will be tested at only one of the five Army depots by February 2003 when the Logistics Modernization Program is scheduled to come on line. Specifically, the Army will be testing the interface at Tobyhanna Army Depot between August 2002 and February 2003, and expects that the interface will be fully functional by the time the Logistics Modernization Program is deployed at the depot in February 2003. Subsequently, the Army plans to install the Logistics Modernization Program and the AWPS interface at the four remaining Army maintenance depots, along with the Army\u2019s ammunition maintenance facilities. According to the May 2002 report, the Army expects to shut down the current information systems that support AWPS at the same time as it turns on the Logistics Modernization Program.
