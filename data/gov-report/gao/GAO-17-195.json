GAO reviewed GSA's leasing documents; identified and checked ownership information regarding high-security leased space to the extent possible using data, as of March 2016, from a firm that specializes in analyzing the commercial real estate market; interviewed GSA and federal foreign investment officials, tenant agencies that were occupying space owned by foreign entities, and five real estate companies that lease space to GSA or provide related services; and visited three foreign-owned high-security leased facilities selected to represent a variety of owners and tenants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO reviewed available information on the ownership of General Services Administration (GSA) leased space that requires higher levels of security protection based on factors such as mission criticality and facility size (high-security space) as of March 2016 and found that GSA is leasing high-security space from foreign owners in 20 buildings. The 26 tenant agencies occupy about 3.3 million square feet at an annual cost of about $97 million and use the space, in some cases, for classified operations and to store law enforcement evidence and sensitive data. The foreign-owned leased space included six Federal Bureau of Investigation field offices and three Drug Enforcement Administration field offices. GAO determined that the high-security space is owned by companies based in countries such as Canada, China, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. GAO was unable to identify ownership information for about one-third of GSA's 1,406 high-security leases as of March 2016 because ownership information was not readily available for all buildings.", "Federal officials who assess foreign investments in the United States and some tenant agencies occupying high-security leased space told GAO that leasing space in foreign-owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access. However, 9 of the 14 tenant agencies GAO contacted were unaware that the space they occupy is in a building that we identified as foreign owned. The other five agencies that knew about occupying foreign-owned space had taken actions to mitigate the risk or were not concerned. Another risk is possibly entering into leases with hidden beneficial owners\u2014the persons who ultimately own and control a building. According to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the risks of contracting with hidden beneficial owners include money laundering. GSA is not required to collect beneficial ownership information and therefore does not know the beneficial owners of the buildings it leases.", "Federal agencies are required to assess and address the risks to their high-security facilities but GSA does not inform tenants when leasing space from foreign owners. When leasing space, GSA is required, among other things, to determine whether the prospective lessor is a responsible party, but foreign ownership is not one of the factors that it must consider. As a result, tenants may be unaware that they are occupying foreign-owned space and not know whether they need to address any security risks associated with such foreign ownership."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA determine whether the beneficial owner of high-security leased space is a foreign entity and, if so, share that information with the tenant agencies for any needed security mitigation.

The General Services  Administration (GSA) leases space for many agencies in the federal  government, including some high-security space. However, the extent to  which GSA is leasing high-security space from foreign owners\u2014entities  based in foreign countries\u2014is unclear. Furthermore, foreign ownership of  GSA-leased space raises questions about potential security risks  involving access to the facilities and the means by which these buildings  were financed.", "You asked us to examine GSA\u2019s leasing of high-security space from  foreign owners.

We defined  foreign-owned buildings as those that are owned by an immediate or  parent company based in a foreign country. Another way of defining  foreign ownership is the nationality of a building\u2019s beneficial owner\u2014the  person who ultimately owns and controls a company. While definitions of  beneficial ownership vary, this is the definition we developed for the  purposes of this report. The foreign owners that we identified may not  necessarily be the beneficial owners.

The real estate companies were selected because they  lease space to GSA or provide services regarding the leasing of space to  GSA. We visited three foreign-owned high-security facilities that GSA is  leasing to interview tenant agencies about security-related issues.

A representative from  the American Bankers Association said that while it might seem  reasonable for real estate companies to rely on banks (and for GSA to  rely on real estate companies) to check the legitimacy of the funds that  are used to finance real estate projects, banks do not always have  sufficient information about the transaction. He said that when these  transactions are put together, the lender may not have direct contact with  the purchaser or the seller and if the purchaser or a seller is a  corporation, the bank knows the corporation but not necessarily the  details about the corporation, its structure or its management. The  representative added that because the real estate company is dealing  directly with the corporation as its client and has access to the individuals  who can provide that information, the real estate company has a direct  relationship and is in the best position to obtain any detailed information  about the purchaser or seller.", "However, a representative from the Real Estate Roundtable, an  association of real estate firms and associations, said that the many  participants in the commercial real estate transactional process such as  mortgage bankers, brokers, and title agents, are unlikely to have any  significant and important information bearing on the possibility of money  laundering activities given their function in commercial real estate  transactions. He said that these participants are generally small  businesses unequipped to deal with significant training on regulations,  policing, audit and record keeping responsibilities. The Real Estate  Roundtable representative also said that anonymity and liquidity\u2014two  characteristics important to money launderers\u2014typically do not exist in  real estate transactions because real estate transactions generally  involve illiquid and visible assets. In addition, a representative from the  National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts told us there is a  low risk of illegal foreign money being used to finance publicly traded  REITs. He noted that because a publicly traded REIT is financed and  operated in effectively the same manner as any other publicly traded  company it is very unlikely it would be used as a mechanism to launder money. Furthermore, the Real Estate Roundtable representative said that  because real estate is not a highly liquid asset and real estate  transactions generally create a detailed \u201cpaper trail\u201d of debt and equity  investors, commercial buildings are not ideally suited to be money  laundering vehicles. However, in its 2006 report on money laundering in  the commercial real estate market, FinCEN stated that although real  estate historically has been a relatively illiquid asset, money launderers  may use real estate both as an investment and vehicle to store laundered  funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Leasing Policies and Procedures Do Not Include Determining Foreign Ownership", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s leasing policies and procedures do not distinguish between leasing  from domestic or foreign companies.
