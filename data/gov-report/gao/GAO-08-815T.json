GAO designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as a high-risk area in 2003, and it remains so. While DHS has made progress, it continues to face challenges in transforming into an effective, integrated organization. In response to a request to provide information on diversity in DHS and steps DHS is taking to create and manage a diverse workforce, GAO is providing demographic data related to the federal government as a whole and DHS's workforce. GAO obtained these data from the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). GAO used its past work on leading diversity management practices (GAO-05-90) and reviewed data from DHS on its diversity management practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data in OPM's CPDF show that as of September 2007, the overall percentages of women and minorities have increased in the career SES governmentwide, the highest nonpolitically appointed leaders in the federal workforce, and the SES developmental pool for potential successors since September 2003. As part of GAO's recent analysis of the diversity of the SES and the SES developmental pool, GAO reviewed career, or permanent, SES appointments at DHS and DHS's SES developmental pool. During this 4-year period, the total number of career SES and those in the SES developmental pool for potential successors increased at DHS. The percentage of women in the SES increased, while the percentage of minorities decreased. For the SES developmental pool, the percentage of women and minorities increased. While GAO did not analyze the factors that contributed to changes in DHS's workforce for this period, OPM and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in their oversight roles require federal agencies, including DHS, to analyze their workforces. As part of a strategic human capital planning approach, agencies need to develop long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, motivating, and retaining a diverse workforce. An agency's human capital planning should address the demographic trends that the agency faces with its workforce, especially retirements, which provide opportunities for agencies to affect the diversity of their workforces. DHS reported taking steps to affect the diversity of its workforce. These steps are consistent with several leading diversity management practices: (1) a diversity strategy as part of its strategic plan, (2) recruitment, (3) employee involvement, and (4) succession planning. For example, DHS cited its use of intern programs for recruiting and its implementation of two leadership development programs for managing succession. GAO has not conducted a review of DHS's diversity management efforts; therefore, it cannot comment on the effectiveness of DHS's implementation of these practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to provide the Committee with information  on diversity of the federal workforce and at the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), which was created from a disparate group of 22 agencies  with multiple missions, values, and cultures into a cabinet department  whose goals are to, among other things, protect U.S. borders and  infrastructure, improve intelligence and information sharing, and prevent  and respond to potential terrorist attacks. Since its inception in March  2003, DHS has faced enormous challenges related to protecting the nation  from terrorism while organizing its predecessor agencies\u2014several with  existing program and management challenges\u2014into a coherent and  integrated department.", "Because these challenges could have serious consequences for the  security of our country, we designated the department\u2019s implementation  and transformation a high-risk area in 2003 and reiterated our concerns in  January 2005 and again in January 2007. One key challenge DHS has faced  is effectively and strategically managing its sizable workforce of nearly  167,000 employees in order to respond to current and emerging 21st  century challenges. Strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious change management strategy. Also, given the  changing demographics of our society, diversity management is a key  aspect of strategic human capital management. Developing a workforce  that reflects all segments of society and our nation\u2019s diversity is a  significant part of an agency\u2019s transformation of its organization to meet  the challenges of the 21st century.", "Today, as requested, my remarks will focus on demographic data related  to career positions in the federal government as a whole and DHS\u2019s  workforce as well as actions the department has reported taking to create  and manage a diverse workforce. For our analyses of governmentwide  career and DHS career demographic data, we extracted data from the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Central Personnel Data File  (CPDF) and analyzed these data to identify the extent of changes in the  representation of women and minorities in DHS\u2019s workforce between  September 2003 and September 2007. However, we did not analyze the  factors that contributed to changes identified in DHS\u2019s workforce over this  4-year period.

We previously reported that  governmentwide data from the CPDF for the key variables reported in this  testimony\u2014agency, gender, race or national origin, and pay plan or  grade\u2014were 96 percent or more accurate. We also obtained information  from DHS on recruitment and other strategies used to develop and sustain  a diverse workforce. We conducted this performance audit in May 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Specifically EEOC\u2019s MD-715 states that agency  personnel programs and policies should be evaluated regularly to  ascertain whether such programs have any barriers that tend to limit or  restrict equitable opportunities for open competition in the workplace.  The initial step is for agencies to analyze their workforce data with  designated benchmarks, including the CLF. If analysis of their workforce  profiles identifies potential barriers, agencies are to examine all related  policies, procedures, and practices to determine whether an actual barrier  exists.

In addition, the approach that a high-performance  organization takes toward its workforce is inclusive and draws on the  strengths of employees at all levels and of all backgrounds.

DHS established an  objective in its 2004 Strategic Plan to \u201censure effective recruitment,  development, compensation, succession management and leadership of a  diverse workforce to provide optimal service at a responsible cost.\u201d In an  August 2007 progress report on implementation of mission and  management functions, we indicated that DHS had taken action to satisfy  most of the elements related to developing a results-oriented strategic  human capital plan. We noted that in addition to the strategic human  capital plan that DHS issued in October 2004, which covers 2004 to 2008,  the department developed a fiscal year 2007 and 2008 Human Capital  Operational Plan, which provides measurable goals that the department is  using to gauge the effectiveness of its human capital efforts. DHS officials  provided us with a copy of DHS\u2019s Corporate Diversity Strategy, issued in  March 2008, and stated that the department has developed a Diversity  Action Plan, which it plans to submit to the DHS Diversity Council for  approval in May 2008. The Diversity Strategy outlines DHS\u2019s policy of  encouraging a diverse workforce and the value of a diverse workforce in  accomplishing DHS\u2019s mission. Among the guiding principles is integrating  diversity into the organization culture rather than as a stand alone  program and recognizing that diversity is a matter of equity and fairness.  To help ensure accountability, among other things, the strategy calls for  establishing a senior-level Diversity Council, which DHS officials reported  has been done, integrating diversity strategies into DHS\u2019s comprehensive  human resource operation, and ensuring that all DHS leaders have access  to training, tools, and support needed to serve as de facto diversity  champions.", "Recruitment. To achieve its strategic plan objective of a diverse  workforce, in his April 2008 testimony, DHS\u2019s Acting CHCO stated that  recruitment strategies have been implemented at the department and  component levels to improve diversity of the DHS talent pool. DHS  officials told us that the department partners with several minority-serving  institutions and participates in several intern, scholarship, and fellowship  programs; officials provided a recruitment brochure. These officials also  indicated that in October 2007, the DHS began a Veterans\u2019 Outreach  Program as a means of recruiting a diverse workforce. This outreach  strategy consists of (1) a Web site for one-stop employment and other  information, (2) an advisory forum of external veterans as stakeholders,  and (3) training in veterans\u2019 preference and reemployment rights for EEO  and human capital specialists. DHS has also created an SES-level Director  of Recruiting and Diversity within the Chief Human Capital Office.", "Employee Involvement. Employees can make valuable contributions in  driving diversity throughout an organization. Our work on leading  diversity management practices identified several forms these  contributions can take, including mentoring and community outreach with  private employers, public schools, and universities. DHS officials  described actions the department is taking to provide opportunities for  employees at various levels throughout the department to receive  mentoring. In addition, DHS officials stated that they have developed  formal partnerships with minority professional service organizations,  including the Urban League\u2019s Black Executive Exchange Program, where  DHS provides speakers that participate in outreach programs at  historically black colleges and universities. DHS officials indicated they  are pursuing similar partnerships with the National Association of  Hispanic Federal Executives, the African American Federal Executive  Association, and the Asian American Executive Network.", "Succession Planning. Succession planning is a comprehensive, ongoing  strategic process that provides for forecasting an organization\u2019s senior  leadership and other needs; identifying and developing candidates who  have the potential to be future leaders; and selecting individuals from  among a diverse pool of qualified candidates to meet executive resource  needs. Succession planning and management can help an organization  become what it needs to be, rather than simply recreate the existing  organization. Leading organizations go beyond a \u201creplacement\u201d approach  that focuses on identifying particular individuals as possible successors  for specific top-ranking positions and engage in broad, integrated  succession planning and management efforts that focus on strengthening  both current and future capacity. They anticipate the need for leaders and  other key employees with the necessary competencies to successfully  meet the complex challenges of the 21st century.", "For DHS, in addition to the changes that will occur as a result of the  upcoming new administration, several factors including recent turnover  and expected retirements provide opportunities for DHS to affect the  diversity of its workforce and highlight the importance of succession  planning. Recently, we reported that the overall attrition rates for  permanent DHS employees (excluding SES and presidential appointees) at  8 percent and 7 percent in 2005 and 2006, respectively, exceeded the 4  percent average rate for all cabinet-level agencies. These higher attrition  rates, about 14 to 17 percent, were among transportation security officers  in DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Administration. The attrition rate for  SES and presidential appointees was also higher than the average senior- level attrition rate for all cabinet-level departments. As for retirements,  about 20 percent of career employees at DHS as of fiscal year 2007 are  projected to be eligible to retire by 2012, and certain key occupations  within the department are expected to have high retirement eligibility  rates, such as customs and border protection agents\u2014about 51 percent.", "In 2006, OPM reported that approximately 60 percent of the executive  branch\u2019s 1.6 million white-collar employees and 90 percent of about 6,000  federal executives will be eligible for retirement over the next 10 years.  Considering retirement eligibility and actual retirement rates of the SES is  important because individuals normally do not enter the SES until well  into their careers; thus SES retirement eligibility is much higher than for  the workforce in general. If a significant number of SES members were to  retire, it could result in a loss of leadership continuity, institutional  knowledge, and expertise among the SES corps, with the degree of loss  varying among agencies and occupations.", "Succession planning also is tied to the federal government\u2019s opportunity to  affect the diversity of the executive corps through new appointments.  Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the SES is an important component  for the effective operation of the government. In September 2003, we  reported that agencies in other countries use succession planning and  management to achieve a more diverse workforce, maintain their  leadership capacity, and increase the retention of high-potential staff.", "According to the Acting CHCO\u2019s April 3, 2008, testimony and discussion  with senior level human capital officials, the department is taking steps to  develop a qualified and diverse pool of applicants for SES positions by  preparing its mid-career employees through a variety of leadership  development programs. These programs include the DHS SES Candidate  Development Program (primarily for GS-15s) and the DHS Fellows  Program (for GS-13s, GS-14s, and GS-15s). See appendix II for  representation data for both programs since their inception. According to  DHS officials, the DHS Fellows Program, initiated in 2006, is a competitive  developmental program where participants are placed in high-visibility  rotational assignments, receive training in such areas as leadership, and  form small groups to work on specific projects. After completion of this  11-month program, participants remain in their current assignments but,  according to DHS officials, are prepared for advancement when the  opportunities arise. Participants in both of the DHS leadership programs  receive mentoring and coaching and rotational assignments. However,  according to DHS officials, employees at other levels of the organization  can also participate in ad hoc mentoring and rotational assignments.  Effective training and development programs can enhance the federal  government\u2019s ability to prepare its workforce and thereby achieve results.  The efforts that DHS officials described are consistent with these  practices.", "Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
