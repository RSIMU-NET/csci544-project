In September 2006, GAO issued our report (GAO-06-938) on DOD's Mobility Capabilities Study (MCS). The MCS determined that the projected mobility capabilities are adequate to achieve U.S. objectives with an acceptable level of risk during the period from fiscal years 2007 through 2013; that is, the current U.S. inventory of aircraft, ships, prepositioned assets, and other capabilities are sufficient, in conjunction with host nation support. GAO's report stated that conclusions of the MCS were based on incomplete data and inadequate modeling and metrics that did not fully measure stress on the transportation system. GAO further observed that the MCS results were incomplete, unclear, or contingent on further study, making it difficult to identify findings and evaluate evidence. It was not clear how the analyses done for the study support DOD's conclusions and GAO suggested that decision makers exercise caution in using the results of this study to make programmatic decisions. In March 2007, GAO reported (GAO-07-367R) on the lack of mandatory analyses to support a passenger and cargo capability for the new replacement refueling aircraft, the KC-X tanker. Contrary to mandatory Air Force implementing guidance, the Air Force proposed a capability without analyses identifying an associated gap, shortfall, or redundancy. GAO believes that without sound analyses, the Air Force may be at risk of spending several billion dollars unnecessarily for a capability that may not be needed to meet a gap or shortfall and made recommendations to the Secretary of Defense that included conducting the requiring analyses necessary to establish capabilities. Successful acquisition programs make sound decisions based on critical product knowledge to ensure that program investments are getting promised returns--on time delivery, within estimated costs, and with expected capabilities. However, GAO has shown in its work that DOD practices diverge from best development practices intended to produce good outcomes and, as a result, have experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays. DOD expects to invest over $12 billion in new and improved capabilities in four airlift programs discussed in this testimony between now and 2013--C-5 Avionics Modernization Program, C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Reengining Program, C-130 Avionics Modernization Program, and the C-130J acquisition program. GAO found that all four programs failed at basic systems engineering practices to 1) fully analyze the resources needed to integrate proven commercial technologies, 2) achieve a stable design before beginning system demonstration, and 3) demonstrate the aircraft would work as required before making large production investments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss the development of aircraft program  requirements and issues related to the acquisition process.

Airlift and  tanker aircraft play a vital role in providing this capability. Over the past  25 years, DOD has invested almost $141 billion to develop, procure, and  modify its airlift and tanker forces with an additional investment planned  for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 of $32 billion. Recent annual funding  levels are at the highest levels in two decades. (See figure 1.)", "In December 2005, DOD issued a report on the study of its mobility  capabilities. The goal of this Mobility Capabilities Study was to identify  and quantify the mobility capabilities needed to support U.S. strategic  objectives into the next decade. The MCS determined that the projected  mobility capabilities are adequate to achieve U.S. objectives with an  acceptable level of risk during the period from fiscal years 2007 through  2013; that is, the current U.S. inventory of aircraft, ships, prepositioned  assets, and other capabilities are sufficient, in conjunction with host  nation support. The MCS emphasized that continued investment in the  mobility system, in line with current departmental priorities and planned  spending, is required to maintain these capabilities in the future. This  includes, for example, fully funding Army prepositioned assets as planned  and completing a planned reengineering of the C-5 aircraft.", "In our previous reports concerning acquisition outcomes and best  practices, we have noted the importance of matching warfighter  requirements with available resources, a responsibility shared by the  requirements and acquisition communities in DOD. As described in Air  Force implementing guidance, there is within DOD a distinct separation  between the requirements authority and acquisition authority. Under this  guidance, this separation requires early and continued collaboration  between both communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyses Used to Determine Mobility and Tanker Capabilities Were Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["Analyses done for the MCS contained methodological limitations that  create concerns about the adequacy and completeness of the study and  decision makers approving the KC-X tanker proposal lacked required  analyses identifying need and associated risk for a passenger and cargo  capability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mobility Capabilities Study Limitations Raise Questions about Adequacy and Completeness", "paragraphs": ["While DOD used an innovative approach in conducting the study and  acknowledged some methodological limitations in its report, it did not  fully disclose how these limitations could affect the MCS conclusions and  recommendations. In September 2006, we reported that DOD\u2019s  conclusions were based, in some instances, on incomplete data and  inadequate modeling and metrics that did not fully measure stress on the  transportation system, and that, in some cases, MCS results were  incomplete, unclear, or contingent on further study, making it difficult to  identify findings and evaluate evidence. It is not clear how the analyses  done for the study supported DOD\u2019s conclusions, and we suggested that  decision makers exercise caution in using the results of this study to make  programmatic decisions.", "As measured against relevant generally accepted research standards, we  identified limitations in the MCS study and report that raise questions.  Among our findings    Aspects of modeling and data were inadequate in some areas because data  were lacking and some of the models used could not simulate all relevant  aspects of the missions. The report did not explain how these limitations  could affect the study results or what the effect on the projected mobility  capabilities might be. Relevant research standards require that models  used are adequate for the intended purpose and represent a complete  range of conditions, and also that data used are properly generated and  complete. For example, the MCS modeled hypothetical homeland defense  missions rather than missions for homeland defense demands from a well- defined and approved concept of operations for homeland defense  because the specific details of the missions were still being determined,  and DOD acknowledged that the data used may be incomplete. The MCS  also was unable to model the flexible deterrent options/deployment order  process to move units and equipment into theater due to lack of data, but  the study assumed a robust use of this process, which in one scenario  accounted for approximately 60 percent of the airlift prior to beginning  combat operations. In addition, the MCS report contains more than 80  references to the need for improved modeling, and 12 of these references  call for additional data or other refinements. Additionally, the MCS  modeled the year 2012 to determine the transportation capabilities needed  for the years 2007 through 2013. The year 2012 did not place as much  demand for mobility assets in support of smaller military operations, such  as peacekeeping, as other years. However, DOD officials considered  2012\u2014the year modeled\u2014as \u201cmost likely\u201d to occur and stated that  statistically it was not different from other years in the 2007 to 2013 period  even though the number of smaller military operations is the least of any  of the years reviewed.", "As I mentioned, we have reported before on the lack of data available for  analysis that could benefit decision makers. In September 2005, we  reported that the Air Force captured data on short tons transported but  did not systematically collect and analyze information on operational  factors, such as weather and runway length, that impact how much can be  loaded on individual missions. Therefore, Air Force officials could not  know how often it met its secondary goal to use aircraft capacity as  efficiently as possible. Without this information, Air Mobility Command  officials do not know the extent to which opportunities exist to use  aircraft more efficiently and whether operational tempo, cost, and wear  and tear on aircraft could be reduced. In addition, DOD officials do not  have the benefit of such analysis to determine future airlift requirements  for planning purposes.", "While the MCS concluded that combined U.S. and host nation  transportation assets were adequate to meet U.S. objectives with  acceptable risk, the report, in describing the use of warfighting metrics in  its analyses, does not provide a clear understanding of the direct  relationship of warfighting objectives to transportation capabilities.  Acknowledging this point, the report stated that further analysis is  required to understand the operational impact of increased or decreased  strategic lift on achieving warfighting objectives. Relevant generally  accepted research standards require that conclusions be supported by  analyses. The use of warfighting metrics is a measure to determine  whether combat tasks, such as achieving air superiority, are achieved.  However, they do not measure whether appropriate personnel, supplies,  and equipment arrived in accordance with timelines. As a result, we could  not determine how the study concluded that planned transportation assets  were adequate because the study did not contain a transparent analysis to  support its conclusion or a clear roadmap in the report to help decision  makers understand what that conclusion meant in terms of type and  number of mobility assets needed. Previous DOD mobility studies  primarily used mobility metrics, which measured success in terms of tons  of equipment and personnel moved per day to accomplish military  objectives. The use of both warfighting and mobility metrics to measure  success would allow decision makers to know whether combat tasks were  achieved and how much strategic transportation is needed to accomplish  those tasks.  In some cases, the MCS results were incomplete, unclear, or contingent on  further study, making it difficult to identify findings and evaluate evidence.  Relevant research standards require results to be presented in a complete,  accurate, and relevant manner. For example, the report contains several  recommendations for further studies and assessments, five of which are  under way. However, at the time of our report, DOD had no plans to report  the effect of these studies on the MCS results after the studies are  complete. In addition, the report contains qualified information that is not  presented clearly, such as varying assessments of intratheater assets in  three different places in the report. The lack of clarity and conciseness of  the reported results can limit the study\u2019s usefulness to decision makers  and stakeholders.", "The MCS report also made recommendations to conduct further studies,  develop plans and strategies, and improve data collection and mobility  models. In fact, DOD officials told us at the time that a Mobility  Capabilities Study-2006 was underway, as well as studies on intratheater  lift, aerial refueling, and other mobility issues. However, unless DOD  addresses the concerns I just outlined for you, decision makers may be  unable to clearly understand the operational implications of the study  results and make fully informed programmatic investment decisions  concerning mobility capabilities. Also, some of the underlying  assumptions used in the MCS have now changed significantly, such as the  assumption that Army prepositioned equipment is in place and fully  funded, which will no longer be the case. Therefore, the MCS analyses and  results, which would be the starting point for any new studies, may no  longer be relevant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Analyses Done to Support Passenger and Cargo Capabilities in the KC-X Tanker Were Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory Air Force policy requires Air Force organizations to use a  formal capabilities-based approach to identify, evaluate, develop, field,  and sustain capabilities that compete for limited resources. Contrary to  mandatory Air Force implementing guidance, however, the Air Force  proposal for a replacement refueling aircraft, the KC-X tanker, included a  passenger and cargo capability without analyses identifying an associated  gap, shortfall, or redundant capability. According to mandatory Air Force  implementing guidance, analyses supporting the decision-making process  should assess a capability based on the effects it seeks to generate and the  associated operational risk of not having it. In this case, the supporting  analyses determined neither need nor risk with regard to a passenger and  cargo capability. Air Force officials could not provide supporting  information sufficient to explain this discrepancy between the analyses  and their proposal. Without sound analyses, the Air Force may be at risk of  spending several billion dollars unnecessarily for a capability that may not  be needed to meet a gap or shortfall.", "Military decision makers approved the passenger and cargo capability as a  requirement although supporting analyses identified no need or associated  risk. Mandatory Air Force implementing guidance states that senior  leaders must use the documented results of analyses to confirm the  identified capability requirement. The Air Force Requirements for  Operational Capabilities Council validated, and the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff\u2019s Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated and  approved, KCX tanker proposal with a passenger and cargo capability.  Following the approvals of the oversight councils, DOD plans to solicit  proposals and award a contract for the KC-X tanker late in fiscal year  2007. At this time, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics, who supervises DOD acquisition, must certify,  as Milestone Decision Authority for the proposed tanker acquisition, that,  among other things, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council has  accomplished its statutory duties and that the proposed program is in  compliance with DOD policies and regulations. However, the absence of  analyses identifying a capability gap, shortfall, or redundancy, and the  Joint Requirements Oversight Council approval of the program without  these analyses is contrary to policy and implementing guidance and could  preclude certification of the program by the Under Secretary. Absent this  certification, the acquisition program for the KC-X tanker cannot begin.", "In this report, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Air Force to accomplish the required analyses to evaluate  the proposed passenger and cargo capability so as to determine if there is  a gap, shortfall, or redundancy, assess the associated risk, and then submit  such documentation to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council for  validation. We also recommended that, once these analyses are completed,  the Secretary of Defense direct the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to  formally notify the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics that such analyses have been completed as  required prior to certification of the program to Congress.", "DOD disagreed with our first recommendation to accomplish the required  analyses. In its comments, DOD stated that through the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System process, the Air Force presented  analysis and rationale for the passenger and cargo capability. DOD further  stated that its Joint Requirements Oversight Council and the Air Force  concluded that the analysis was sufficient justification for the capability  and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated the requirement.  However, as our report points out, DOD did not perform the required  analyses and failed to identify a gap, shortfall, or redundancy for the  passenger and cargo capability. Considering the requirement for analyses  that separate needs from wants and the risk of unnecessary expenditures  in this multi-year multi-billion dollar acquisition program, we continue to  believe that our recommendation has merit and that the analyses required  by mandatory guidance are necessary to inform the decision that begins  the acquisition.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to formally notify the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics once the  required analyses have been completed. However, DOD did not offer  assurance that the Air Force would accomplish the required analyses that  evaluate the proposed passenger and cargo capability as we  recommended, and then submit such documentation to the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council for validation. We believe that the time it  could take to accomplish the required analyses and submit the analyses  for revalidation by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, could delay  the Under Secretary\u2019s certification until just prior to the Milestone B  decision, and may frustrate the congressional oversight that would  otherwise be permitted under section 2366a. We believe that in a program  committing $120 billion over several decades, the review confirming that  needs are justified should occur as far in advance of program initiation as  possible.", "In light of the DOD comments on our report, we have put forward a matter  for congressional consideration. Specifically, we are suggesting that  Congress consider requiring  in addition to the certification described by section 2366a of title 10,  United States Code, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions,  Technology and Logistics make a specific certification that the Air Force  employed a sound, traceable, and repeatable process producing analyses  that determined if there is a gap, shortfall, or redundancy and assessed the  associated risk with regard to passenger and cargo capability for the KC- 135 Recapitalization, and    consistent with service policy, these analyses are made available to the  Joint Requirements Oversight Council prior to the Under Secretary\u2019s  certification of the program pursuant to section 2366a of title 10, United  States Code.  The Air Force intends to replace the fleet of more than 500 tankers and the  Mobility Capabilities Study of 2005 set the requirement for tankers at a  range of between 520 to 640 aircraft. Replacement of this fleet is estimated  to cost a minimum of $72 billion. Compared to a refueling aircraft without  a passenger and cargo capability, the inclusion of the capability is  estimated, according to the Analysis of Alternatives done for the KC-X  tanker, to increase costs by 6 percent. The Joint Requirements Oversight  Council approval of the proposal of a replacement tanker aircraft with the  passenger and cargo capability, without an established need supported by  analyses and without an analysis of risk, could result in an unnecessary  expenditure of at least $4.3 billion by our estimates.", "In our August 1996 report, U.S. Combat Air Power: Aging Refueling  Aircraft Are Costly to Maintain and Operate, we recommended  consideration of a dual-use aircraft that could conduct both aerial  refueling and airlift operations as a replacement for the KC-135. We  recommended that the Secretary of Defense require that future studies and  analyses of replacement airlift and tanker aircraft consider accomplishing  the missions with a dual-use aircraft. DOD only partially concurred with  this recommendation, expressing concern at that time about how a dual- use aircraft would be used and whether one mission area might be  degraded to accomplish the second mission. The lack of analyses done to  support the current proposal still does not give DOD officials information  about how a dual-use aircraft would be used or whether the primary  mission of aerial refueling would be degraded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Employing Best Practices Can Shape Better Program Outcomes for DOD\u2019s Airlift Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 25 years, DOD has invested more than $140 billion on its  airlift and tanker forces.
