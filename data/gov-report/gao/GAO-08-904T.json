Broadly defined, risk management is a process that helps policymakers assess risk, strategically allocate finite resources, and take actions under conditions of uncertainty. GAO convened a forum of 25 national and international experts on October 25, 2007, to advance a national dialogue on applying risk management to homeland security. Participants included federal, state, and local officials and risk management experts from the private sector and academia. Forum participants identified (1) what they considered to be effective risk management practices used by organizations from the private and public sectors and (2) key challenges to applying risk management to homeland security and actions that could be taken to address them.

For example, participants discussed the private sector use of a chief risk officer, though they did not reach consensus on how to apply the concept of the chief risk officer to the public sector. One key practice for creating an effective chief risk officer, participants said, was defining reporting relationships within the organization in a way that provides sufficient authority and autonomy for a chief risk officer to report to the highest levels of the organization. Participants stated that the U.S. government needs a single risk manager. One participant suggested that this lack of central leadership has resulted in distributed responsibility for risk management within the administration and Congress and has contributed to a lack of coordination on spending decisions. Participants also discussed examples of public sector organizations that have effectively integrated risk management practices into their operations, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, and compared and contrasted public and private sector risk management practices. According to the participants at our forum, three key challenges exist to applying risk management to homeland security: improving risk communication, political obstacles to risk-based resource allocation, and a lack of strategic thinking about managing homeland security risks. Many participants agreed that improving risk communication posed the single greatest challenge to using risk management principles. To address this challenge, participants recommended educating the public and policymakers about the risks we face and the value of using risk management to establish priorities and allocate resources; engaging in a national discussion to reach a public consensus on an acceptable level of risk; and developing new communication practices and systems to alert the public during an emergency. In addition, to address strategic thinking challenges, participants recommended the government develop a national strategic planning process for homeland security and governmentwide risk management guidance. To improve public-private sector coordination, forum participants recommended that the private sector should be more involved in the public sector's efforts to assess risks and that more state and local practitioners and experts be involved through intergovernmental partnerships."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the use of  risk management principles in homeland security. As shown by the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina, homeland  security risks vary widely. The nation can neither achieve total security  nor afford to protect everything against all risks. Managing these risks is  especially difficult in today\u2019s environment of globalization, increasing  security interdependence, and growing fiscal challenges for the federal  government. It is increasingly important that organizations effectively  target homeland security funding\u2014totaling nearly $65 billion in 2008  federal spending alone\u2014to address the nation\u2019s most critical priorities.", "Using principles of risk management can help policymakers reach  informed decisions regarding the best ways to prioritize investments in  security programs so that these investments target the areas of greatest  need. Broadly defined, risk management is a strategic process for helping  policymakers make decisions about assessing risk, allocating finite  resources, and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty. The  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established a risk  management framework to help the department target its investments in  security programs based on risk. This framework defines risk as a function  of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, or, in other words, a credible  threat of attack on a vulnerable target that would result in unwanted  consequences.", "Our prior work has shown that using risk management principles to  prioritize which programs to invest in and to measure the extent to which  such principles mitigate risk is a challenging endeavor. For this reason, to  assist both Congress and federal agencies, including DHS, GAO convened  an expert panel to advance the national dialogue on strengthening the use  of risk management principles to manage homeland security programs.  Today, I\u2019ll discuss the highlights of our panel\u2019s thoughts on the issues we  asked them to identify: (1) effective risk management practices used by  organizations from the public and private sectors and (2) key challenges  faced by public and private organizations in adopting and implementing a  risk-based approach to manage homeland security programs and actions  that could be taken to address them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Comptroller General convened this expert panel from the U.S. and  abroad to advance a national dialogue on strengthening the use of risk  management principles to better manage homeland security programs.  The forum brought together a diverse array of experts from the public and  private sectors, including, from the public sector, a former governor, a  former DHS under secretary, a U.S. Coast Guard Admiral, and senior  executives from DHS, the U.S. Army, and the National Intelligence  Council, as well as state and local officials with homeland security  responsibilities. From the private sector, participants included executives  from leading multinational corporations such as Swiss Re, Westfield  Group, JPMorgan Chase, and Wal-Mart. In addition, several of the world\u2019s  leading scholars from major universities, the National Research Council,  and the RAND Corporation participated in the forum. (See app. I for a list  of participants.)", "Recognizing that risk management helps policymakers make informed  decisions, Congress and the administration have charged federal agencies  to use a risk-based approach to prioritize resource investments.  Nevertheless, federal agencies often lack comprehensive risk management  strategies that are well integrated with program, budget, and investment  decisions. To provide a basis for analyzing these strategies, GAO has  developed a risk management framework based on industry best practices  and other criteria. This framework, shown in figure 1, divides risk  management into five major phases: (1) setting strategic goals and  objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing risks; (3) evaluating  alternatives for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the appropriate  alternatives; and (5) implementing the alternatives and monitoring the  progress made and results achieved.", "Our work has indicated that while DHS is making progress in applying risk  management principles to guide its operational and resource allocation  decisions, challenges remain. GAO has assessed DHS\u2019s risk management  efforts across a number of mission areas\u2014including transportation  security, port security, border security, critical infrastructure protection,  and immigration enforcement\u2014and found that risk management  principles have been considered and applied to varying degrees. For  example, in June 2005 we reported that the Coast Guard had developed  security plans for seaports, facilities, and vessels based on risk  assessments. However, other components had not always utilized such an  approach. As we reported in August 2007, while the Transportation  Security Administration has developed tools and processes to assess risk  within and across transportation modes, it had not fully implemented  these efforts to drive resource allocation decisions. Moreover, in February  2007, we reported that DHS faced substantial challenges related to  strengthening its efforts to use information on risk to inform strategies and  investment decisions, for example, by integrating a consideration of risk  into annual budget and program review cycles. We also reported that  while integrating a risk management approach into decision-making  processes is challenging for any organization, it is particularly difficult for  DHS given its diverse set of responsibilities. The department is responsible  for dealing with all-hazards homeland security risks\u2014ranging from natural  disasters to industrial accidents and terrorist attacks. The history of  natural disasters has provided experts with extensive historical data that  are used to assess risks. By contrast, data about terrorist attacks are  comparatively limited, and risk management is complicated by the  asymmetric and adaptive nature of our enemies.", "In addition to helping federal agencies like DHS focus their efforts, risk  management principles can help state and local governments and the  private sector\u2014which owns over 85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure\u2014prioritize their efforts to improve the resiliency of our  critical infrastructure and make it easier for the nation to rebound after a  catastrophic event. Congress has recognized state and local governments  and the private sector as important stakeholders in a national homeland  security enterprise and has directed federal agencies to foster better  information sharing with these partners. Without effective partnerships,  the federal government alone will be unable to meet its responsibilities in  protecting and securing the homeland. A shared national approach\u2014 among federal, state, and local governments as well as between public and  private sectors\u2014is needed to manage homeland security risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Effective Risk Management Practices in the Private and Public Sectors", "paragraphs": ["Participants discussed effective risk management practices used in the  public and private sector.

According to another participant, the Army Corps developed flood risk  management practices that he saw as notable because this information  was used to digest and share critical information with the public. One  participant noted that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  developed and implemented a risk assessment program that guided the  agency\u2019s management in setting priorities for a 5-year, $500 million  security capital investment program.

However, participants noted that the private and public  sectors also manage risk differently. One participant said the private  sector manages risk by \u201cpre-funding\u201d and diversifying risk through  insurance. In addition, the private sector creates incentives for individuals  to lower the risks they face from, for example, a car accident or a natural  disaster, by offering to reduce insurance premiums if the policy holder  takes certain steps to mitigate these risks. Similarly, the public sector also  plays a unique role in managing risk, for instance, regulating land use and  establishing building codes; organizing disaster protection, response, and  recovery measures; setting regulatory frameworks; and supplementing the  insurance industry.", "In addition, participants noted that the private sector organizations have  more flexibility than the public sector to select which risks to manage. For  instance, participants stated that the private sector could avoid risks in  cases where the costs of ensuring these risks are too high.

Participants said that the public  lacks a fact-based understanding of what homeland security risks the  nation faces. Participants attributed these problems to media coverage  that undermines a fact-based public discussion of risk by sensationalizing  acts of terrorism that have dramatic consequences but may be unlikely to  occur. In addition, participants stated that even though it is not possible to  prevent all disasters and catastrophes, public officials need to engage the  public in defining an acceptable level of risk of a terrorist attack or natural  disaster in order to make logical, risk-based resource allocation decisions.  To communicate with the public about risks in a meaningful way,  participants recommended educating the public on how risk is defined,  providing fact-based information on what risks we face and the probability  they might occur, and explaining how risk informs decision-making. One  expert recommended the government communicate about risks through  public outreach in ways that calms the public\u2019s fears while raising  awareness of risks. Another participant recommended that the country  engage in a national public discourse to reach consensus on an acceptable  level of risk.", "Educate policymakers and establish a common lexicon for discussing  risk. Participants emphasized the importance of educating elected  officials on risk management. Several participants believed that the  distinction between risk assessment\u2014involving scientific analysis and  modeling\u2014and risk management\u2014involving risk reduction and  evaluation\u2014is not widely understood by policymakers. In addition, one  expert also noted that the nation should do more to train a cadre of the  next generation of risk management professionals. Given differences in  education and levels of understanding about risk management, the  participants felt it would be important to develop a common lexicon that  can be used for dialogue with both the layman and the subject matter  expert. Without a common, shared understanding of risk management  terms, communicating about risks is challenging. Some members of our  expert panel recommended focusing specifically on educating elected  officials and the next generation of policymakers about risk management.  One participant pointed out that a new administration and Congress will  soon enter office with a new set of policy objectives, and it will be  important to highlight the importance of risk management to incoming  policymakers and to persuade them to discuss it. Panelists also  recommended creating a common vocabulary or lexicon that defines  common risk management terms.", "Develop new risk communication practices to alert the public during  emergencies. Participants said that government officials lack an  understanding of what information to share and how to communicate with  the public during an emergency. Participants said that risk analysis,  including predictive modeling, tends to neglect a consideration of how the  public\u2019s expectations and emotions can impact the effectiveness of  response efforts and affect the likelihood the public will respond as  predicted or directed by government officials during an emergency.  According to one participant, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that the  efficacy of emergency response efforts depends on how the public  behaves, as some people chose to shelter in place while others followed  directions to evacuate. Participants recommended that governments  consider what information should be communicated to the public during a  crisis and how best to communicate that information. For instance, one  participant suggested that experts look at existing risk communication  systems, such as the National Weather Service, that could be used as  models for a homeland security risk communication system. The  participant noted that the service provides both national and local weather  information, looks at overall risks, and effectively provides actionable  information to be used by both the public and private sectors.

As a  result, participants stated that there is less incentive for officials to invest  in long-term opportunities to reduce risk, such as investing in  transportation infrastructure, when the public does not view these  investments as addressing a perceived risk.

Participants said there is a lack of a  national strategic planning process to guide federal investments in  homeland security. Balancing the security concerns of various federal  government agencies that have diverse missions in areas other than  security, such as public safety and maintaining the flow of commerce,  poses a significant strategic challenge, some participants stated. One  participant stated that the President had developed a strategy to guide,  organize, and unify the nation\u2019s homeland security efforts in the October  2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security. However, several other  participants said that a better process is needed for strategic planning. For  example, to think strategically about risk they recommended that  stakeholders discuss trade-offs, such as whether more resources should be  spent to protect against risks from a conventional bomb, nuclear attack,  biological attack, or a hurricane. Another participant noted that the  purpose of risk assessment is to help answer these strategic questions.  One participant also recommended that the short-term goal for a national  strategic planning process should be identifying the big problems that  strategic planning needs to address, such as measuring the direct and  indirect costs of reducing risk.", "Fragmented approaches to managing security risk within and across  the federal government could be addressed by developing  governmentwide risk management guidance. Some participants agreed  that approaches to risk management were fragmented within and across  the federal government. For example, one participant said that each of the  Department of Defense combatant commands has its own perspective on  risk. According to this participant, this lack of consistency requires  recalculations and adjustments as each command operates without  coordinating efforts or approaches. Three participants also said that there  is a lack of governmentwide guidance on using risk management  principles to manage programs. To address this problem, participants said  governmentwide guidance should be developed.

One reason partnerships may not be as strong as they  could be is that the private sector may not be appropriately involved in the  public sector\u2019s risk assessments or risk-based decision-making.  Participants agreed that the private sector should be involved in  developing risk assessments because when these stakeholders are not  sufficiently involved they lose faith in government announcements and  requirements related to new risks and threats.
