But with the enormous benefits of this interconnectivity comes a threat: both physical and cyber assets are potentially vulnerable to computer-based attack. In response, Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63, May 1998) called for a range of actions to improve the nation's ability to detect and respond to serious infrastructure attacks. For specific agencies under the Committee on Energy and Commerce's jurisdiction and for private-sector organizations for which these agencies have responsibilities, GAO was asked, among other things, to assess their progress and challenges in undertaking critical infrastructure protection (CIP) activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to protect our nation's critical public and private infrastructures have had mixed progress. GAO examined four specific agencies--the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Energy, and Commerce, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)--and found that the agencies have made progress in implementing several PDD 63 requirements, such as appointing chief information assurance officers and preparing initial CIP plans. However, none of the agencies has fully implemented all requirements, including the fundamental processes of identifying agency assets that are critical to the nation and determining their dependencies on other public and private assets, as well as assessing these assets' vulnerabilities. In addition, although most agencies have tentatively identified their critical assets, these efforts could take years to complete given the current pace and estimated time and resource needs. GAO also examined private-sector groups known as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for five specific industry sectors--information technology, telecommunications, energy, electricity, and water supply. PDD 63 suggested voluntary ISAC creation to, among other things, serve as mechanisms for information sharing between infrastructure sectors and the government. In response, ISACs have been established and are serving as clearinghouses for their sectors to share information. For other suggested activities, such as establishing baseline statistics on computer security incidents, progress is mixed. Both the agencies and the ISACs identified challenges and obstacles to undertaking CIP activities. Agency-identified challenges included coordinating security efforts for critical assets with the General Services Administration, which may often be responsible for protecting agency facilities that house critical assets. The ISACs identified obstacles to information sharing, both between the sectors and the government and within the sectors. In particular, they noted concerns that information reported to the government could be subject to public release under the Freedom of Information Act."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1990s, an explosion in computer interconnectivity, most  notably growth in the use of the Internet, has revolutionized the way that  our government, our nation, and much of the world communicate and  conduct business. The benefits have been enormous. Vast amounts of  information are now literally at our fingertips, facilitating research on  virtually every topic imaginable; financial and other business transactions  can be executed almost instantaneously, often 24 hours a day; and  electronic mail, Internet Web sites, and computer bulletin boards allow us  to communicate quickly and easily with a virtually unlimited number of  individuals and groups. However, this widespread interconnectivity also  poses enormous risks to our computer systems and, more important, to the  critical operations and infrastructures they support, such as  telecommunications, power distribution, national defense, law  enforcement, and critical government services. Further, private-sector  entities control over 80 percent of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures.  Because potential adversaries\u2014be they nation-states, cyberterrorist  groups, criminal organizations, or disgruntled insiders\u2014can develop  cyberattack capabilities to attempt to exploit these risks, it is essential that  our critical infrastructures be adequately protected.", "In response to these concerns, in May 1998 the President issued  Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63), which called for a range of  actions intended to improve federal agency security programs, establish a  partnership between the government and the private sector, and improve  the nation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to serious computer-based or  physical attacks. Such critical infrastructure protection (CIP) activities are  intended to enhance the security of cyber and physical public and private  infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic  security, or national public health and safety. PDD 63 encouraged  nonfederal participation, including voluntary creation of Information  Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to serve as mechanisms for  gathering, analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing and disseminating  information to and from infrastructure sectors and the federal government.  The directive also appointed lead federal agencies to work with specific  industry sectors, and it established several federal CIP entities, such as the  Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) within the Department of  Commerce, which was intended to, among other things, develop a national  plan for CIP, and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), an  organization within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that was  expanded to address national-level threat assessment, warning,  vulnerability, and law enforcement investigation and response.", "In addition, on October 16, 2001, President Bush issued Executive Order  13231, \u201cCritical Infrastructure Protection in the Information Age,\u201d which  continued many PDD 63 activities by focusing on cyberthreats to critical  infrastructures; the order also created the President\u2019s Critical  Infrastructure Protection Board to coordinate federal cybersecurity efforts.  On October 8, 2001, President Bush issued Executive Order 13228, which  created the Office of Homeland Security. In addition, on November 25,  2002, the President signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 creating the  Department of Homeland Security, which, among other things, will  consolidate certain CIP functions, including assessing the vulnerabilities of  and taking necessary measures to protect the key resources and critical  infrastructures of the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In response to your requests, our objectives were to   assess the pace and progress of efforts by the Departments of Health  and Human Services (HHS), Energy, and Commerce and by the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement CIP  requirements to protect their own critical infrastructures and assets  from cyber and physical attacks, as prescribed by PDD 63 and Executive  Orders 13231 and 13228;   assess the progress of the private-sector ISACs established for the  information technology, telecommunications, energy, electricity, and  water-supply sectors in achieving the objectives of PDD 63 and  Executive Orders 13231 and 13228;   assess the level of cooperation and interaction between these ISACs and  their federal lead agency counterparts, as well as the level of assistance  provided to the selected agencies by CIAO and NIPC and to the ISACs  by NIPC; and   identify any resource-related issues or other challenges or obstacles that  the selected agencies and ISACs indicate have affected their efforts to  implement the CIP requirements or objectives.", "The agencies and ISACs selected for our review were specifically requested  by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce as consistent with its  jurisdiction for specific agencies and for the industry sectors for which  these agencies have responsibilities. We performed this work at the four  agencies\u2014HHS, Energy, Commerce, and EPA\u2014and for the five ISACs  associated with key sectors of our economy\u2014telecommunications,  information technology, electricity, oil and gas energy, and water supply.  We also conducted our work at the national CIAO within the Department of  Commerce, the Department of Justice and its NIPC, the General Services  Administration, and the National Communications System (an interagency  body housed within and funded through the Department of Defense).", "To assess the pace and progress of efforts by the agencies to implement  requirements to protect their own critical infrastructures and assets, we  analyzed CIP plans and other documentation of efforts to implement CIP  requirements, including current results of their efforts to identify critical  assets using CIAO\u2019s Project Matrix methodology, where available. Likewise,  we evaluated selected vulnerability assessments to determine the  methodology used and whether they addressed specific critical assets. We  also met with agencies\u2019 chief information officers or their staff, chief  infrastructure assurance officers, and others responsible for security of the  agencies\u2019 cyber and physical assets to determine their roles,  responsibilities, and current activities. We did not validate the accuracy of  data provided in agencies\u2019 Project Matrix reports, including their  identification of critical assets and vulnerability assessment data.  Vulnerability assessments were often physically maintained at the asset  location and not readily available, and agencies were also sometimes  reluctant to share vulnerability assessments because of their sensitive or  classified nature.", "To assess the progress and summarize the different management structures  and operating principles of private-sector ISACs established for the  information technology, telecommunications, energy, electricity, and water- supply sectors, we collected and evaluated relevant ISAC documents such  as operational agreements, charters, guidance, reporting requirements,  summary incident statistics, and vulnerability assessments. We also  obtained and analyzed information from ISAC officials regarding  management structure, operating principles, activities, challenges,  obstacles, and level of cooperation and interaction with federal agencies.  We did not independently verify information provided by ISAC  representatives.", "To determine the level of cooperation and interaction between these ISACs  and their federal counterparts, as well as the level of assistance that CIAO,  NIPC, or both provided to the selected agencies or ISACs, we analyzed  available documentation of efforts by CIAO and NIPC to assist the four  agencies, and we obtained the views of agency officials about the extent of  CIAO and NIPC assistance efforts. In addition, we discussed with officials  from Commerce, Energy, EPA, the National Communications System, and  NIPC the level of cooperation and interaction between the ISACs and the  applicable agencies. We also discussed with ISAC officials the extent of  cooperation and interactions with federal agencies.", "To determine the identity of any resource-related issues, challenges, or  obstacles that the agencies and ISACs indicate have affected their efforts in  implementing the CIP requirements or objectives, we analyzed information  on CIP budgets and expenditures that the agencies reported to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) as part of its national security crosscut  data call and that was included in OMB\u2019s June 2002 combating terrorism  report to the Congress. We also analyzed agency documentation on denials  of CIP funding requests and obtained pertinent views of agency officials on  the adequacy of resources in meeting their CIP responsibilities. We did not  validate the accuracy of agency-reported budget data. We also obtained the  views of officials in the four agencies and the ISACs on any other  challenges or obstacles that have affected their implementation of CIP  requirements or objectives.", "We conducted our review from March 2002 to February 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As our reliance on our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures grows, so do the  potential threats and attacks that could disrupt critical operations.

By launching attacks across a span of  communications systems and computers, attackers can effectively disguise  their identity, location, and intent, thereby making them difficult and time- consuming to trace. Such attacks could severely disrupt computer- supported operations, compromise the confidentiality of sensitive  information, and diminish the integrity of critical data. A significant  concern is that terrorists or hostile foreign states could launch computer- based attacks on critical systems to severely damage or disrupt national  defense or other critical operations or steal sensitive data, resulting in  harm to the public welfare.", "The April 2002 report of the Computer Crime and Security Survey,  conducted by the Computer Security Institute and the FBI\u2019s San Francisco  Computer Intrusion Squad, showed that 90 percent of respondents  (primarily large corporations and government agencies) had detected  computer security breaches. In addition, the number of computer security  incidents reported to the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center rose from 9,859 in  1999 to 52,658 in 2001 and 82,094 in 2002. And these are only the reported  attacks. The Director, CERT Centers, stated that he estimates that as much  as 80 percent of actual security incidents goes unreported, in most cases  because (1) the organization was unable to recognize that its systems had  been penetrated or there were no indications of penetration or attack, or  (2) the organization was reluctant to report. Figure 1 shows the number of  incidents reported to the CERT Coordination Center from 1995 through  2002.", "According to the National Security Agency, foreign governments already  have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  methods to attack these systems. In February 2002, the threat to these  infrastructures was highlighted by the Special Advisor to the President for  Cyberspace Security in a Senate briefing when he stated that although to  date none of the traditional terrorist groups, such as al Qaeda, has used the  Internet to launch a known assault on the infrastructure of the United  States, information on computerized water systems was recently  discovered on computers found in al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.", "Further, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  there has been an increased recognition of the critical link between  cyberspace and physical space. In his November 2002 congressional  testimony, the Director of the CERT Centers at Carnegie-Mellon University  noted that supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and  other forms of networked computer systems have been used for years to  control power grids, gas and oil distribution pipelines, water treatment and  distribution systems, hydroelectric and flood control dams, oil and  chemical refineries, and other physical systems, and that these control  systems are increasingly being connected to communications links and  networks to reduce operational costs by supporting remote maintenance,  remote control, and remote update functions. These computer-controlled  and network-connected systems are potential targets for individuals bent  on causing massive disruption and physical damage, and the use of  commercial, off-the-shelf technologies for these systems without adequate  security enhancements can significantly limit available approaches to  protection and may increase the number of potential attackers.", "The September 11, 2001, attacks also raised concerns that potentially  disastrous cyberattacks could be coordinated to coincide with physical  terrorist attacks to maximize the impact of both. For example, NIPC has  warned that the potential for compound cyber and physical attacks,  referred to as \u201cswarming attacks,\u201d is an emerging threat to the U.S. critical  infrastructure. As NIPC reports, the effects of a swarming attack include  slowing or complicating the response to a physical attack. For example,  cyber attacks can be used to delay the notification of emergency services  and to deny the resources needed to manage the consequences of a  physical attack. A swarming attack could also be used to worsen the effects  of a physical attack. For instance, a cyber attack on a natural gas  distribution pipeline that opens safety valves and releases fuels or gas in  the area of a planned physical attack could enhance the force of the  physical attack. In addition, the recently issued fourth annual report of the  Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism  Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction concluded that the physical and  cyber elements of CIP are so intertwined that it makes no sense to address  them separately.", "In its October 2002 report, an independent task force cochaired by former  Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman also highlighted the importance  of protecting our critical infrastructure from physical attack, noting in  particular that our homeland infrastructure for refining and distributing  energy to support our daily lives remains largely unprotected against  sabotage. In the report, the task force warned that if the nation does not  respond more urgently to address its vulnerabilities, the next attack could  result in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to our lives and  the economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CIP Policy Has Been Evolving Since the Mid- 1990s", "paragraphs": ["Federal awareness of the importance of securing our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures, which underpin our society, economy, and national  security, has been evolving since the mid-1990s. Over the years, a variety of  working groups have been formed, special reports written, federal policies  issued, and organizations created to address the issues that have been  raised. In October 1997, the President\u2019s Commission on Critical  Infrastructure Protection issued its report, which described the potentially  devastating implications of poor information security for the nation. The  report recommended several measures to achieve a higher level of CIP,  including infrastructure protection through industry cooperation and  information sharing, a national organization structure, a revised program of  research and development, a broad program of awareness and education,  and reconsideration of laws related to infrastructure protection. The report  stated that a comprehensive effort would need to \u201cinclude a system of  surveillance, assessment, early warning, and response mechanisms to  mitigate the potential for cyberthreats.\u201d It said that the FBI had already  begun to develop warning and threat analysis capabilities and urged it to  continue in these efforts. In addition, the report noted that the FBI could  serve as the preliminary national warning center for infrastructure attacks  and could provide law enforcement, intelligence, and other information  needed to ensure the highest quality analysis possible.", "In 1998, the President issued PDD 63, which described a strategy for  cooperative efforts by government and the private sector to protect the  physical and cyber-based systems essential to the minimum operations of  the economy and the government. PDD 63 called for a range of actions  intended to improve federal agency security programs, improve the  nation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to serious computer-based and  physical attacks, and establish a partnership between the government and  the private sector. The directive called on the federal government to serve  as a model of how infrastructure assurance is best achieved, and it  designated lead agencies to work with private-sector and government  organizations. Further, it established CIP as a national goal and stated that,  by the close of 2000, the United States was to have achieved an initial  operating capability to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from  intentional destructive acts and, no later than 2003, an enhanced capability.", "To accomplish its goals, PDD 63 designated and established organizations  to provide central coordination and support, including the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO), an interagency office  housed in the Department of Commerce, which was established to develop  a national plan for CIP on the basis of infrastructure plans developed by the  private sector and federal agencies;   the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), an organization  within the FBI, which was expanded to address national-level threat  assessment, warning, vulnerability, and law enforcement investigation  and response; and   the National Infrastructure Assurance Council, which was established to  enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors in protecting  our critical infrastructures.", "To ensure coverage of critical sectors, PDD 63 also identified eight private- sector infrastructures and five special functions. In addition, for each of the  infrastuctures and functions, the directive designated lead federal agencies  (known as sector liaisons) to work with their counterparts in the private  sector (known as sector coordinators). To facilitate private-sector  participation, PDD 63 also encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs that  could serve as mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately  sanitizing and disseminating information to and from infrastructure sectors  and the federal government through NIPC. Figure 2 displays a high-level  overview of the organizations with CIP responsibilities, as outlined by PDD  63.", "PDD 63 also called for a range of activities intended to establish a  partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure the security  of infrastructures essential to the operations of the government and the  economy. It required that the sector liaison and the sector coordinator  work with each other to address problems related to CIP for their sector. In  particular, PDD 63 required them to (1) develop and implement a  vulnerability awareness and education program and (2) contribute to a  sectoral National Infrastructure Assurance Plan by  assessing the vulnerabilities of the sector to cyber or physical attacks;  recommending a plan to eliminate significant vulnerabilities;  proposing a system for identifying and preventing major attacks; and   developing a plan for alerting, containing, and rebuffing an attack in  progress and then, in coordination with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency as appropriate, rapidly reconstituting minimum  essential capabilities in the aftermath of an attack.", "Within the federal government, PDD 63 required every federal department  and agency to be responsible for protecting its own critical infrastructure,  including both cyber-based and physical assets. To fulfill this responsibility,  PDD 63 called for agencies\u2019 chief information officers (CIOs) to be  responsible for information assurance, and it required every agency to  appoint a chief infrastructure assurance officer (who could also be the  CIO) to be responsible for the protection of all other aspects of an agency\u2019s  critical infrastructure. Further, it established the following requirements  specifically for or related to federal agencies\u2019 protection of their own  critical infrastructures:  develop, implement, and periodically update a plan for protecting its   determine its minimum essential infrastructure that might be a target of  infrastructure attack;   conduct and periodically update vulnerability assessments of its   develop a recommended remedial plan based on a vulnerability  assessment that identifies time lines for implementation,  responsibilities, and funding; and   analyze intergovernmental dependencies, and mitigate those  dependencies.", "Other PDD 63 requirements for federal agencies are that they provide  vulnerability awareness and education to sensitize people regarding the  importance of security and to train them in security standards, particularly  regarding cybersystems; that they establish a system for responding to a  significant infrastructure attack while it is under way, to help isolate and  minimize damage; and that they establish a system for rapidly  reconstituting minimum required capabilities for varying levels of  successful infrastructure attacks.", "In January 2000, the White House issued its National Plan for Information  Systems Protection. The national plan provided a vision and framework  for the federal government to prevent, detect, respond to, and protect the  nation\u2019s critical cyber-based infrastructure from attack and reduce existing  vulnerabilities by complementing and focusing existing federal computer  security and information technology requirements. Subsequent versions of  the plan were expected to (1) define the roles of industry and state and  local governments working in partnership with the federal government to  protect physical and cyber-based infrastructures from deliberate attack and  (2) examine the international aspects of CIP.", "In October 2001, President Bush signed Executive Order 13231,  establishing the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board to  coordinate cyber-related federal efforts and programs associated with  protecting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. The Special Advisor to the  President for Cyberspace Security chairs the board. Executive Order 13231  tasks the board with recommending policies and coordinating programs for  protecting CIP-related information systems. The executive order also  established 10 standing committees to support the board\u2019s work on a wide  range of critical information infrastructure efforts. The board is intended to  coordinate with the Office of Homeland Security in activities relating to the  protection of and recovery from attacks against information systems for  critical infrastructure, including emergency preparedness communications  that were assigned to the Office of Homeland Security by Executive Order  13228, dated October 8, 2001. According to Executive Order 13231, the  board recommends policies and coordinates programs for protecting  information systems for critical infrastructure, including emergency  preparedness communications and the physical assets that support such  systems. The Special Advisor reports to the Assistant to the President for  National Security Affairs and to the Assistant to the President for  Homeland Security. In addition, the chair coordinates with the Assistant to  the President for Economic Policy on issues relating to private-sector  systems and economic effects and with the Director of OMB on issues  relating to budgets and the security of federal computer systems. Executive  Order 13231 emphasized the importance of CIP and the ISACs, but neither  order identified additional requirements for agencies to protect their  critical infrastructures or suggested additional activities for the ISACs.", "In July 2002, the President issued the National Strategy for Homeland  Security to \u201cmobilize and organize our nation to secure the United States  homeland from terrorist attacks.\u201d According to the strategy, the primary  objectives of homeland security, in order of priority, are to (1) prevent  terrorist attacks within the United States, (2) reduce America\u2019s  vulnerability to terrorism, and (3) minimize the damage and recover from  attacks that do occur. In addition, the strategy identifies critical  infrastructure and intelligence and warning (critical components of CIP) as  two of its six mission areas. It also identifies critical infrastructure sectors  that require protection against incapacitation and destruction, including  many of the sectors previously identified in PDD 63, such as information  and communications, energy, and water, as well as several new sectors,  including agriculture, food, chemical and hazardous materials, and postal  and shipping. The sectors and their lead agencies are listed in table 1.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of  Homeland Security. Regarding CIP, the new department is responsible for,  among other things, (1) developing a comprehensive national plan for  securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States;  (2) recommending measures to protect the key resources and critical  infrastructure of the United States in coordination with other federal  agencies and in cooperation with state and local government agencies and  authorities, the private sector, and other entities; and (3) disseminating, as  appropriate, information analyzed by the department both within the  department and to other federal agencies, state and local government  agencies, and private-sector entities to assist in the deterrence, prevention,  preemption of, or response to terrorist attacks. To help accomplish these  functions, the act creates the Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection directorate within the new department and transfers to it the  functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of several existing organizations  with CIP responsibilities, including NIPC (other than the Computer  Investigations and Operations Section) and CIAO. In addition, as outlined  in the National Strategy for Homeland Security, the new department will  become the lead agency for several industry sectors, including information  and telecommunications.", "In addition to consolidation of CIP functions and responsibilities within the  Department of Homeland Security, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget  request for this new department includes $829 million for information  analysis and infrastructure protection, a significant increase from the  estimated $177 million for fiscal year 2003. In particular, funding requested  for information analysis and infrastructure protection includes about $500  million to identify key critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and support the  necessary steps to ensure that security is improved at these sites. It also  includes almost $300 million for warning advisories, threat assessments, a  communications system, and outreach efforts to state and local  governments and the private sector.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security called for the Office of  Homeland Security and the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection  Board to complete cyber and physical infrastructure protection plans,  which would serve as the baseline for later developing a comprehensive  national infrastructure protection plan. This strategy does not indicate a  date when the comprehensive plan is to be completed, but on February 14,  2003, the President released the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace  and the complementary National Strategy for the Physical Protection of  Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets.", "The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is intended to provide an  initial framework for both organizing and prioritizing efforts to protect our  nation\u2019s cyberspace. It is also to provide direction to federal departments  and agencies that have roles in cyberspace security, and to identify steps  that state and local governments, private companies and organizations, and  individual Americans can take to improve our collective cybersecurity. This  strategy is organized according to five national priorities, with major  actions and initiatives identified for each: 1. A National Cyberspace Security Response System\u2014This system is  described as a public-private architecture, coordinated by the  Department of Homeland Security, for analyzing and warning,  managing incidents of national significance, promoting continuity in  government systems and private-sector infrastructures, and increasing  information-sharing across and between organizations, in order to  improve cyberspace security. The system is to include governmental  entities and nongovernmental entities, such as private-sector ISACs.  Major actions and initiatives identified for cyberspace security  response include providing for the development of tactical and  strategic analysis of cyber attacks and vulnerability assessments;  expanding the Cyber Warning and Information Network to support the  role of the Department of Homeland Security in coordinating crisis  management for cyberspace security; coordinating processes for  voluntary participation in the development of national public-private  continuity and contingency plans; exercising cybersecurity continuity  plans for federal systems; and improving and enhancing public-private  information-sharing involving cyber attacks, threats, and  vulnerabilities. 2. A National Cyberspace Security Threat and Vulnerability  Reduction Program\u2014This priority focuses on reducing threats and  deterring malicious actors through effective programs to identify and  punish them; identifying and remediating those existing vulnerabilities  that, if exploited, could create the most damage to critical systems; and  developing new systems with less vulnerability, and assessing emerging  technologies for vulnerabilities. Other major actions and initiatives  include creating a process for national vulnerability assessments, to  better understand the potential consequences of threats and  vulnerabilities; securing the mechanisms of the Internet by improving  protocols and routing; fostering the use of trusted digital control  systems/SCADA systems; understanding infrastructure  interdependencies and improving the physical security of cybersystems  and telecommunications; and prioritizing federal cybersecurity  research and development agendas. 3. A National Cyberspace Security Awareness and Training  Program\u2014This priority emphasizes the promotion of a comprehensive  national awareness program to empower all Americans\u2014businesses,  the general workforce, and the general population\u2014to secure their own  parts of cyberspace. Other major actions and initiatives include  fostering adequate training and education programs to support the  nation\u2019s cybersecurity needs; increasing the efficiency of existing  federal cybersecurity training programs; and promoting private-sector  support for well-coordinated, widely recognized professional  cybersecurity certification. 4. Securing Government\u2019s Cyberspace\u2014To help protect, improve, and  maintain government\u2019s cybersecurity, major actions and initiatives for  this priority include continuously assessing threats and vulnerabilities  to federal cyber systems; authenticating and maintaining authorized  users of federal cyber systems; securing federal wireless local area  networks; improving security in government outsourcing and  procurement; and encouraging state and local governments to consider  establishing information technology security programs and  participating in ISACs with similar governments. 5. National Security and International Cyberspace Security  Cooperation\u2014This priority identifies major actions and initiatives  that can strengthen U.S. national security and international  cooperation. These include strengthening cyber-related  counterintelligence efforts; improving capabilities for attack attribution  and response; improving coordination for responding to cyber attacks  within the U.S. national security community; working with industry and  through international organizations to facilitate dialogue and  partnerships among international public and private sectors focused on  protecting information infrastructures; and fostering the establishment  of national and international watch-and-warning networks to detect  and prevent cyber attacks as they emerge.", "The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical  Infrastructures and Key Assets provides a statement of national policy to  remain committed to protecting critical infrastructures and key assets from  terrorist attacks, and it is based on eight guiding principles. These include  establishing responsibility and accountability, encouraging and facilitating  partnering among all levels of government and between government and  industry, and encouraging market solutions wherever possible and  government intervention when needed. The strategy also establishes three  strategic objectives. The first is to identify and ensure the protection of the  most critical assets, systems, and functions in terms of national-level public  health and safety, governance, and economic and national security and  public confidence. This would include establishing a uniform methodology  for determining national-level criticality. The second strategic objective is  to ensure protection of infrastructures and assets facing specific, imminent  threats; and the third is to pursue collaborative measures and initiatives to  ensure the protection of other potential targets that may become attractive  over time. Under this strategy, the Department of Homeland Security will  provide overall cross-sector coordination and will serve as the primary  liaison and facilitator for cooperation among federal agencies, state and  local governments, and the private sector. In addition, the Office of  Homeland Security will continue to act as the President\u2019s principal policy  adviser staff and coordinating body for major interagency policy issues  related to homeland security.", "These recently released strategies identify priorities, actions, and  responsibilities for the federal government, including federal lead  departments and agencies and the Department of Homeland Security, as  well as for state and local governments and the private sector.

Although agencies have taken steps to  redesign and strengthen their information system security programs, our  analyses of information security at major federal agencies have shown that  federal systems were not being adequately protected from computer-based  threats, even though these systems process, store, and transmit enormous  amounts of sensitive data and are indispensable to many federal agency  operations. For the past several years, we have analyzed audit results for 24  of the largest federal agencies and found that all 24 had significant  information security weaknesses. Further, we have identified information  security as a governmentwide high-risk issue in reports to the Congress  since 1997\u2014most recently in January 2001.", "Our most recent analyses of audit reports published from October 2001  through October 2002 continue to show significant weaknesses in federal  computer systems that put critical operations and assets at risk.  Weaknesses continued to be reported in each of the 24 agencies included in  our review, and they covered all six major areas of general controls\u2014the  policies, procedures, and technical controls that apply to all or a large  segment of an entity\u2019s information systems and help ensure their proper  operation. These six areas are (1) security program management, which  provides the framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that  effective controls are selected and properly implemented; (2) access  controls, which ensure that only authorized individuals can read, alter, or  delete data; (3) software development and change controls, which ensure  that only authorized software programs are implemented; (4) segregation  of duties, which reduces the risk that one individual can independently  perform inappropriate actions without detection; (5) operating systems  controls, which protect sensitive programs that support multiple  applications from tampering and misuse; and (6) service continuity, which  ensures that computer-dependent operations experience no significant  disruptions. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of weaknesses for the six  general control areas across the 24 agencies.", "The weaknesses identified place a broad array of federal operations and  assets at risk. For example,   resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost or   computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to  launch attacks on others;  sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  medical records, and proprietary business information, could be  inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied for purposes of espionage  or other types of crime;  critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted;  data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud or disruption;   agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents that  result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations  and fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.", "Because the weaknesses we identified apply to controls for all or a large  segment of an agency\u2019s information systems, information security may be  no better for agencies\u2019 critical infrastructure assets. Further, both we and  the inspectors general have reported limited agency progress in  implementing PDD 63 requirements to protect critical infrastructures from  computer-based attacks. For example, as we reported in September 2001,  only limited efforts have been undertaken to perform substantive,  comprehensive analyses of infrastructure-sector vulnerabilities and to  develop related remedial plans. Also, a March 2001 report by the  President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) and the Executive  Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) identified significant  deficiencies in federal agencies\u2019 implementation of PDD 63 requirements to  (1) establish plans for protecting their own critical infrastructure that were  to be implemented within 2 years, or by December 2000, and (2) develop  procedures and conduct vulnerability assessments. Specifically,  many agency CIP plans were incomplete, and some agencies had not   most agencies had not completely identified their mission-essential   few agencies had completed vulnerability assessments of their  minimum essential infrastructure assets or developed remediation  plans.", "In addition, in March 2002 we testified on the efforts by the federal  government to implement requirements of the government information  security reform legislation (commonly referred to as GISRA), and  reported that of the 24 large agencies we reviewed, 15 reported that they  had not implemented an effective methodology to identify their critical  assets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Not Yet Completed Implementation of CIP Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The four agencies we reviewed (HHS, Energy, Commerce, and EPA) have  made progress for several requirements, such as preparing initial CIP plans  and appointing chief infrastructure assurance officers.

In particular, the agencies are still  focusing on the fundamental process of identifying their critical assets and  these assets\u2019 dependencies. Once these assets and dependencies are  identified, further steps will be necessary, such as conducting or updating  vulnerability assessments, correcting identified vulnerabilities, and  ensuring that these assets are appropriately considered in continuity-of- operations planning. Neither the agencies nor the administration has set  milestones to complete the asset and dependency identification process or  estimated resource requirements, and it could take years to complete these  tasks at the current pace."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initial Progress Has Been Made in Implementing PDD 63 Management Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The four agencies we reviewed have made progress in implementing  several PDD 63 requirements to manage their CIP efforts.

All four agencies have met this requirement and appointed  chief infrastructure assurance officers. The designated chief infrastructure  assurance officer is the Director of Headquarters Security Operations  within the Office of Security at Energy and the Assistant Secretary for  Budget, Technology and Finance at HHS. At Commerce, the CIO is also  designated as the chief infrastructure assurance officer, as permitted by  PDD 63. At EPA, there are two designated officials or cochief infrastructure  assurance officers. According to an official with the Office of Solid Waste  and Emergency Response, the assistant administrator for this office was  appointed because of the office\u2019s responsibility for EPA\u2019s national security  efforts; and the assistant administrator for the Office of Administration and  Resources Management was also appointed because approximately 90  percent of EPA\u2019s physical and cyber assets were housed within that office.", "PDD 63 also required every department and agency to develop a plan for  protecting its own critical infrastructure within 180 days of the issuance of  this directive, to implement those plans within 2 years of the issuance of  the directive, and to update those plans every 2 years. As required, all four  agencies prepared their initial CIP plans. However, although HHS revised  its initial plan in October 2000 to incorporate review comments from a  CIAO expert review team, none of the agencies has formally updated its  plan. HHS and Commerce both intend to update their CIP plans, and in  October 2002, HHS awarded a contract that includes this task. However,  according to Energy officials and a March 2002 Energy IG report, Energy  is deferring the updating of its CIP plan until a national-level protection  plan is completed. Also, EPA officials indicated that they will defer  updating their plan pending further consultation with CIAO.", "PDD 63 also required the establishment of a system for responding to a  significant infrastructure attack while it is under way, with the goal of  isolating and minimizing damage. Consistent with PDD 63\u2019s cybersecurity  emphasis and CIAO guidance highlighting the need to establish a computer  security-incident response capability, all four agencies responded that  they are establishing incident response capabilities and are reporting  incidents to the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal  Computer Incident Response Center. Further, HHS\u2019s CIO reported that,  during fiscal year 2002, the department commissioned an incident response  and notification study by a security contractor and will use the results to  formulate the next stage of its enterprise security program. Recent IG  evaluations required by GISRA confirm most of these agencies\u2019 actions to  improve incident-handling capabilities. In particular, Commerce\u2019s IG  reported that a computer incident-response team was established in fiscal  year 2002 to provide this capability for operating units that did not have  their own, thus ensuring coverage departmentwide. In addition, the EPA IG  reported that EPA plans to outsource its incident-handling function.", "Another PDD 63 requirement calls for a vulnerability awareness and  education program to be established within the government to sensitize  people regarding the importance of security and to train them in security  standards, particularly regarding cybersystems. Overall, agency efforts  related to this requirement primarily focus on information security  education and awareness, and all four agencies indicate that they are  providing their staff with such training, some of which includes the use of  Web-based or automated training tools. However, although IGs\u2019 recent  GISRA evaluations confirm these efforts, they also reported common  weaknesses for these agencies, including that these training programs had  not ensured that employees with significant information security  responsibilities were receiving adequate training.", "Table 2 summarizes the results of the agencies\u2019 implementation efforts  related to requirements for managing PDD 63 efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Asset Identification Is Still Not Complete", "paragraphs": ["The four agencies we reviewed all provide information and physical  security to protect agency assets and reported that they have taken  additional protective actions since the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, such as increasing guards and building security, performing  vulnerability assessments for agency facilities, and updating plans to  ensure the continuity of essential operations. However, over 4 years after  PDD 63 was issued, the agencies have not completed the fundamental  processes of identifying their critical assets and their dependencies on  other public- and private-sector assets. Although all four agencies prepared  their required initial CIP plans, these plans focused on protecting hundreds  of assets considered essential to the agencies\u2019 missions rather than  focusing on those assets that are critical to the nation.", "In October 1998, a month before agencies\u2019 initial CIP plans were due, CIAO  issued its Vulnerability Assessment Framework. The framework was  intended to provide detailed guidance to federal agencies on how to  identify their critical infrastructures, identify interdependencies and  vulnerabilities of those infrastructures, and provide the basis for  developing remediation plans. However, CIAO officials concluded, on the  basis of a review of agency CIP plans and subsequent discussions with  agency officials, that agencies did not find the framework particularly  helpful in carrying out agency planning efforts. Further, several agencies  were unclear whether \u201ccritical\u201d organizations, personnel, systems, and  facilities to be identified using the framework referred only to those  specific missions performed by the individual departments and agencies or  more broadly to the performance of functions and missions by federal  agencies on behalf of the nation.", "On the basis of this review of the agencies\u2019 initial plans, CIAO decided that  the management of CIP programs required a new functional approach to  defining and identifying critical assets and their dependencies, and it  shifted the focus to identifying assets and dependencies that, under  PDD 63, are deemed critical to the federal government\u2019s carrying out its  responsibilities for national security, maintaining the orderly functioning of  the national economy, and ensuring the health and safety of Americans. To  accomplish this goal and provide the agencies with additional guidance, in  March 2000, CIAO began offering its Project Matrix methodology. Project  Matrix consisted of a three-step process in which each civilian federal  agency identifies (1) its critical assets; (2) other federal government assets,  systems, and networks upon which its critical assets depend to operate;  and (3) all associated dependencies on private-sector owned and operated  critical infrastructures. The Project Matrix methodology defines \u201ccritical\u201d  as the responsibilities, assets, nodes, and networks that, if incapacitated or  destroyed, would jeopardize the nation\u2019s survival; have a serious,  deleterious effect on the nation at large; adversely affect large portions of  the American populace; and require near-term, if not immediate,  remediation (currently defined as within 72 hours). It defines \u201cassets\u201d as  tangible equipment, applications, and facilities that are owned, operated, or  relied upon by the agency, such as information technology systems or  networks, buildings, vehicles (aircraft, ships, or land), satellites, or even a  team of people.", "Once critical assets and their associated dependencies are identified, the  agencies are to assess their vulnerability to physical or cyber attack and, if  vulnerabilities are found, to develop and implement plans to manage the  risks posed by potential attacks to the performance of essential functions  and services. Such plans are to seek to deter attacks from happening in the  first place, protect critical assets from damage or destruction if attacks  occur, mitigate the operational impact of attacks if protective measures  fail, restore operations if attacks disrupt services, and reconstitute any  assets damaged or destroyed during attacks.", "To perform Project Matrix step 1, a CIAO team is to work with the  participating agency to identify its PDD 63-relevant assets\u2014that is, pieces  of equipment, facilities, or people that are owned, operated, or relied upon  by the agency to fulfill its most critical responsibilities. Typically this  process includes the team\u2019s conducting document reviews and interviews  with selected program managers, to understand how the agency is  organized and functions; developing a universal list of physical and cyber  assets resident in the agency; producing a revised list of candidate assets  by eliminating those not critical to the support of PDD 63 national  requirements; and training agency program managers in how to complete  an \u201cinfrastructure asset evaluation\u201d response for each candidate-list asset.  This infrastructure asset evaluation requires the agency to provide answers  to a series of questions that describe the asset and its role in supporting the  objectives of national or regional security, economic stability, and public  health and safety. These responses are then scored by CIAO and, subject to  further deliberations by the agency, those with scores that exceed a certain  threshold are identified as the agency\u2019s critical assets. Generally, this  approach identifies a limited number of critical assets, thus enabling the  agency to focus its CIP efforts on those that are most essential to the  nation.", "All four of the agencies were in some stage of performing Project Matrix  step 1 at the time of our review. HHS originally completed step 1 in  December 2000 but is now revisiting that analysis given the terrorist  attacks that began on September 11, 2001. For Energy and EPA, CIAO had  prepared draft reports for step 1 (dated August 2001 and May 2002,  respectively) that presented a compilation of the evaluation responses and  resultant analyses and tentatively identified their critical assets. Both  agencies are continuing to review and update information in these draft  reports. Finally, although Commerce\u2019s 1998\u20131999 efforts to identify its  critical infrastructure assets were the basis upon which Project Matrix  step 1 was built, Commerce has now begun to formally perform the step 1  process to refine its list of critical assets.", "The agencies we reviewed are all performing the step 1 process and, until  they have completed it, their critical assets are only tentatively identified.  This is true even for HHS, which recognizes that what is identified as a  critical asset may change with different national needs and circumstances,  and is revisiting the step 1 process it completed over 2 years ago. Table 3  shows how this process winnows down the total number of agency assets  to a handful. The critical assets the agencies tentatively identified include  both cyber and physical, and they range from computer centers,  laboratories, and buildings to mobile laboratories and teams of experts.  However, because of their sensitivity both individually and collectively, we  do not specifically identify any of these in this report.", "In Project Matrix step 2, an agency is to identify the other federal  government assets, systems, and networks upon which its critical assets  depend to operate. Currently, CIAO plans to assist an agency in analyzing  two of its critical assets, and the agency is to perform the analyses for the  remaining assets. Two of the four agencies we reviewed had not initiated  the next steps of the Project Matrix methodology. Specifically, although  Commerce was a pilot for step 2 in 1999, of the four agencies, only HHS and  Energy have begun this step, with CIAO assistance, for a few critical assets.  In addition, HHS officials report that the department has awarded a  contract to complete step 2 for all of its critical assets.", "Further, none of the agencies had begun step 3, in which an agency  identifies and analyzes the critical assets\u2019 dependencies on nonfederal  infrastructures and identifies potential points of failure. Identifying such  interdependencies and dependencies is a critical step. For example, Energy  officials noted that the Bureau of Reclamation within the Department of  the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers within DOD, and the Tennessee  Valley Authority all operate dams that supply electricity to some of  Energy\u2019s critical assets and that could affect the availability of these assets.  This dependency is also an important consideration for these other  agencies\u2019 CIP efforts, particularly if these agencies have not yet identified  such dependencies. For this example, according to CIAO officials, none of  these other agencies has undergone a Project Matrix review.", "Although the agencies we reviewed are all participating in Project Matrix, it  is difficult to estimate when they will complete the process. None of the  agencies had estimates of when the individual steps or overall process  would be completed or of the total resources that would be required, and  CIAO officials emphasized that the actual time to complete a Project Matrix  step depends on an agency\u2019s priorities and resources.", "As an indication of the time required to complete Project Matrix, CIAO  officials told us that to assist an agency, CIAO itself requires a total of  approximately 1,000 staff hours to complete step 1 and 750 staff hours per  asset to complete step 2 (CIAO plans to assist the agencies in analyzing  only two of their critical assets for this step). Since no agency has  completed step 3, these officials projected that CIAO would also require  250 staff hours per asset for this step. As an indication of the time required  to complete Project Matrix from the agency perspective, an HHS official  stated that it took 6 to 7 months to complete a step 2 analysis for one of the  department\u2019s critical assets. Further, Energy officials estimated that it will  take 700 hours of staff time and $100,000 in contract support costs to do  step 2 for one critical asset, and they now question whether they will have  the funding to complete step 2. On the basis of these estimates, it could  take years for these agencies to complete their analyses for all critical  assets at their current pace.", "In addition to there being no agency Project Matrix completion estimates,  there currently is no governmentwide milestone that would indicate when  the agencies should complete their analyses other than those in PDD 63  that called for an initial operating capability by the close of 2000 to protect  the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from intentional destructive acts, and  for an enhanced capability no later than May 2003. In September 2001, we  recommended that the federal government\u2019s strategy define interim  objectives and milestones for achieving CIP goals and a specific action plan  for achieving these objectives. However, subsequent federal CIP policy  and strategy do not contain any specific milestones that would require  agencies to complete implementation of requirements. Specifically for  Project Matrix, in February 2002 OMB reported to the Congress that it was  requiring all large federal agencies to undergo a Project Matrix review  and, according to a CIAO official, has set a goal of having 31 agencies  complete Project Matrix. However, OMB did not establish a deadline for  these reviews to be completed. As of July 2002, CIAO reported that of the  31agencies targeted, 18 had begun their reviews, and of those, only 5 are  shown as completing step 1 (including HHS, for its December 2000 results)  and only 5 had begun step 2 (includes HHS and Energy). CIAO\u2019s deputy  director said that this office\u2019s current goal is to complete Project Matrix  reviews for 24 of the 31 identified agencies by the end of fiscal year 2004  and for the remaining 7 in fiscal year 2005. However, this goal is internal to  CIAO and has not been communicated to the agencies.", "Finally, the CIAO deputy director told us that at the request of the Office of  Homeland Security, CIAO is currently revising and streamlining its Project  Matrix methodology to approach step 1 from a high-level functional basis  that would be less labor intensive for the agencies instead of from the level  of the individual asset owners. In addition, the revision would combine the  identification of these assets\u2019 dependencies on other government and  private-sector assets (formerly steps 2 and 3) as step 2. This official  estimated that under the new streamlined methodology, step 1 would take  an agency from 8 to 12 weeks to complete, depending on its size. He could  not, however, estimate whether the new combined step 2 would require  less time or resources for CIAO or the agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Efforts to Implement PDD 63 Requirements for Critical Assets Are Also Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Several PDD 63 requirements related to the agencies\u2019 protection of their  own critical infrastructures are dependent on agencies\u2019 identification of  critical assets, including conducting and periodically updating vulnerability  assessments, developing a recommended remedial plan based on  vulnerability assessments, and rapidly reconstituting minimum required  capabilities for successful infrastructure attacks. Data collected by the  agencies for Project Matrix show that agencies\u2019 efforts to implement these  requirements for all critical assets are incomplete and do not ensure that  critical asset vulnerabilities are identified and corrected, and that these  assets are appropriately considered in planning for the continuation of  critical operations.", "PDD 63 requires agencies to conduct vulnerability assessments for their  critical assets, and federal vulnerability assessment guidance requires that  these vulnerability assessments be periodically updated. The four agencies  we reviewed and CIAO identified several sources of guidance for  conducting vulnerability assessments for cyber assets, including CIAO\u2019s  October 1998 Vulnerability Assessment Framework, its January 2000  Practices for Securing Critical Information Assets, and NIST\u2019s October  2001 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems. As  defined in CIAO\u2019s January 2000 guidance, a cyber vulnerability assessment  is an examination of the ability of a system or application (including  current security procedures and controls) to withstand assault, and this  examination may be used to (1) identify weaknesses that could be  exploited and (2) predict the effectiveness of additional security measures  in protecting information resources from attack. With regard to assessing  the vulnerability of physical facilities, all four agencies indicated that they  used a 1995 study by the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides  recommended minimum security standards for five different building  security levels. These levels are based primarily on staffing size, number  of employees, use, and the need for public access, but the determination of  the security level for a facility also considers threat intelligence, crime  statistics, and agency mission. Neither PDD 63 nor the above guidance  specifies an interval for how often these assessments should be updated,  but the guidance does indicate that updates should be performed when  significant changes occur. However, guidance by GSA\u2019s Federal Protective  Service does call for periodic vulnerability surveys for facilities according  to their security levels, with frequencies ranging from every 4 years for  level 1 and 2 facilities to every 2 years for more sensitive level 4 facilities.", "For the three agencies we reviewed that had tentatively identified their  critical assets (Energy, EPA, and HHS), data collected by the agencies in  performing Project Matrix step 1 showed that their vulnerability  assessment efforts are incomplete. As indicated by the agencies, the  critical assets are characterized as cyber only, physical only, or both cyber  and physical. As a result, some assets required either a cyber or physical  vulnerability assessment, and others required both. Table 4 summarizes  these vulnerability assessment data for these three agencies, through  December 2002. First, it shows that none of the agencies had completed  cyber or physical vulnerability assessments for all of its assets. For  example, of HHS\u2019s 15 critical assets with cyber characteristics, 10 (or 67  percent) had cyber vulnerability assessments. Table 4 also shows that for  the vulnerability assessments that were performed, HHS and Energy had a  number of both cyber and physical vulnerability assessments that were 2  years old or older. These older assessments predate the September 11th  attacks, which experts agree represent a significant change in threat and  attack scenarios. In addition, for Energy, these older vulnerability  assessments were conducted before the assets were tentatively identified  as critical.", "In addition to not conducting or updating vulnerability assessments, our  analyses of assessments for selected critical assets showed that some  physical assessments were not prepared specifically for those assets.  Rather, the physical vulnerability assessments we analyzed at HHS, EPA,  and Energy sometimes pertained to overall facilities or buildings, and it  was not clear to what extent physical vulnerabilities were assessed for a  specific critical asset housed within those facilities or buildings. EPA  officials reported that because EPA used the U.S. Marshals Service study as  the standard for assessing the facilities or buildings that house most of its  critical assets, they believe that the physical infrastructure vulnerabilities  associated with these critical assets were properly assessed. We agree that  these vulnerability assessments did indicate the facility levels assigned  according to criteria in the U.S. Marshals Service study. However, these  assessments still did not indicate that critical assets housed in a facility or  building were explicitly considered either in determining the facility levels  or in assessing the threats, vulnerabilities, or risk levels for these facilities.  As a result, based on the reported assessment results, we were unable to  determine whether physical infrastructure vulnerabilities associated with  critical assets had been properly assessed.", "All four agencies, including Commerce, are continuing their vulnerability  assessment efforts, but it was difficult to estimate when these efforts  would provide current assessments for all assets. For example, both EPA  and Energy identified teams of people as critical assets and indicated that  they needed additional guidance to conduct vulnerability assessments for  these assets. Further, the agencies generally had no system or organization  that routinely monitored the status of both cyber and physical vulnerability  assessments for their critical assets. Instead, they usually relied on  obtaining these data from the asset owners on an ad hoc basis. This  practice sometimes resulted in conflicting data between different agency  organizations. For example, officials in the HHS Office of Information  Resources Management and its Office of Real Property and Management  provided conflicting dates for when some physical vulnerability  assessments had been completed, which they reconciled at our request.", "All four agencies stated that they prepared remedial plans on the basis of  individual vulnerability assessments, as required by PDD 63, and that the  organization responsible for the asset was responsible for ensuring that  identified vulnerabilities are managed. In addition, for cyber-related  vulnerabilities, CIO officials from the four agencies all stated that identified  information security weaknesses are reported and monitored as part of  their tracking of information security corrective actions for GISRA. Recent  GISRA independent evaluations conducted by these agencies\u2019 IGs generally  confirmed that the agencies do have processes for tracking their  information security weaknesses. Further, some agencies are reporting  overall progress in correcting identified information security weaknesses.  For example, although neither their IGs nor we have validated corrective  actions, both Commerce and EPA officials report that they have corrected  most information security weaknesses identified in our latest audit reports  on their computer operations. However, despite this potential progress  for cyber vulnerabilities, agency officials acknowledge that they do not  have a comparable process to track corrective actions for vulnerabilities  identified through physical vulnerability assessments, nor do they ensure  that all cyber and physical vulnerabilities and corrective actions are  monitored specifically for their critical assets.", "In addition to assessing and correcting their vulnerabilities, PDD 63  requires the rapid reconstitution of agencies\u2019 minimum required  capabilities\u2014that is, their critical assets. However, data reported by the  agencies showed that only one of the three agencies with tentative critical  assets (EPA) had included all these assets in its continuity-of-operations  plans\u2014plans that provide for the continued performance of essential  federal functions (see table 5 below). Part of the data collected by the  agencies for Project Matrix step 1 concerns whether an asset is included in  a continuity-of-operations plan, to determine whether it will be restored as  one of the agency\u2019s essential functions. CIAO officials stated that  addressing critical assets in such plans is sufficient to meet the requirement  for rapidly reconstituting minimum required capabilities, as long as these  plans require reconstitution of the critical asset within 72 hours of its  disruption. Although Project Matrix data do not indicate whether the plans  meet the 72-hour criterion for a critical asset, they do show that for the  three agencies with tentative critical assets, only 29 (58 percent) of the 50  assets identified were included in continuity-of-operations plans. Project  Matrix data also showed that of those 29 included in the plans, 13 (45  percent) were over 2 years old. Although federal continuity-of-operations  guidance does not specify how often plans should be updated, plans over 2  years old predate the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001,  and for Energy and EPA, predate the identification of their tentative critical  assets. At least one agency, HHS, indicated that it is in the process of  revising its continuity-of-operations plan, and it will ensure that all critical  assets are included in its 72-hour recovery plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ISACs\u2019 Progress in Implementing PDD 63- Suggested Activities Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["In addition to specific requirements for federal agencies, PDD 63  encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs and suggested other activities  for them to undertake in order to effectively gather, analyze, and  disseminate information to and from infrastructure sectors and the federal  government.

Further, the directive encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs  and left their actual design and functions, along with their relationship with  NIPC, to be determined by the private sector in consultation with the  federal government. As a result, the five ISACs we reviewed were  established differently and with membership open to a wide variety of  organizations, according to the specific industry sector. The following brief  overview of each ISAC illustrates their variations:   The Information Technology ISAC is managed as a limited liability  corporation; membership is open to companies that are engaged in the  information technology industry or that use the Internet for a major part  of their business. Members can include vendors, manufacturers, or  providers of Internet and E-commerce products (both hardware and  software) and information technology solutions and services.", "The Telecommunications Infrastructure ISAC was established not as a  separate entity but as a function of the National Coordinating Center for  Telecommunications\u2014a government-industry operational and  collaborative body housed within the National Communications System.  The National Communications System is being transferred to the new  Department of Homeland Security, which is now the designated sector  liaison. Membership is open to companies that provide  telecommunications or network services, equipment, or software to the  communications and information sector; select, competitive local  exchange carriers; Internet service providers; vendors; software  providers; telecommunications professional organizations and  associations; or companies with participation or presence in the  communications and information sector. Membership is also allowed for  National Coordinating Center member federal departments and  agencies, and for national security/emergency preparedness users.", "The Energy ISAC was originally managed as a limited liability  corporation, but in late 2002 it changed its corporate structure to a tax- exempt organization. Its member companies are primarily in the oil and  natural gas industries, and their activities include the exploration,  production, processing, transmission, distribution, transportation,  storage, trading, supervisory control and data acquisition, and  E-commerce of energy commodities.", "The Electricity ISAC is managed and operated by the North American  Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit corporation that promotes  electric system reliability and security. Its membership includes small  and large electric utilities, regional utility companies, power marketers,  and other entities responsible for power generation, transmission,  control, and marketing and distribution in the United States, Canada,  and a portion of Mexico.", "For the water sector, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, a  nonprofit corporation, is currently serving as the interim ISAC.  Membership is open to drinking water and wastewater utilities,  regardless of size.", "The basic purpose of these ISACs\u2019 operations is the same: to facilitate  information sharing among members by collecting, analyzing, and  disseminating information on vulnerabilities, threats, intrusions, and  anomalies reported by members, the government, and other sources, in  order to avert or mitigate the impact of these factors. Also, all five reported  that they provide some level of watch services 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week.", "Despite the overall similarities, these organizations differ in several ways.  For example, existing organizations performed functions for some sectors  many years before being designated as ISACs. The National Coordinating  Center for Telecommunications performed some operations for the  telecommunications sector beginning in 1984, and was designated an ISAC  in January 2000. Similarly, before being designated for the electricity sector  in October 2000, the North American Electric Reliability Council had been  performing similar operations since 1968. In contrast, the Information  Technology ISAC initiated operations in December 2000 in direct response  to PDD 63.

For example, start-up and operational funding for  Telecommunications and Electricity are provided through their sponsoring  organizations, the National Communications System and the North  American Electric Reliability Council, respectively. On the other hand,  individual sector companies donated start-up funding for the Information  Technology ISACs, and operational funding comes from membership fees  paid by members. For the Energy ISAC, industry associations provided  start-up funding, and membership fees initially provided operational  funding. However, this ISAC reported that in the fall of 2002, the Office of  Energy Assurance in the Energy Department agreed to fund ISAC  operations\u2014an agreement sought so that membership costs would not  prevent smaller companies from joining.

Although Telecommunications and Electricity were both developed as part  of preexisting sector activities, Telecommunications is housed in the  National Communications System (a government entity), with private  contractors performing operations co-located and procedurally integrated  with government operations staff and industry representatives, and  Electricity is part of the private-sector North American Electric Reliability  Council, with its operations performed in-house. The Information  Technology ISAC is a limited iability corporation, created specifically to  oversee its operations, which are performed by a private contractor.  Originally created as a limited liability corporation, the Energy ISAC  reported that it changed its corporate structure to a tax-exempt  organization to better facilitate and manage the funds provided by the  Energy Department. And finally, the private-sector Association of  Metropolitan Water Agencies initially performed operations in-house for  Water.

Assessments  address broad, general incident or issue awareness information and  analysis that are significant and current, but they do not necessarily  suggest immediate action. Advisories address significant threat or incident  information that suggests a change in readiness posture, protective  options, or response. Alerts address major threat or incident information  addressing imminent or in-progress attacks targeting specific national  networks or critical infrastructures.

The Information Technology ISAC suggested that NIPC further streamline  the number of cyber threat warning levels, which can be confusing to  industry.

This strategy states that the Attorney General will  convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to enable the  sharing of essential homeland security\u2013related information between the  federal government and the private sector. In addition, we have testified on  the continuing debate concerning the protections provided to private- sector entities as they are encouraged to disclose and exchange  information on both physical and cyber security problems and solutions  that are essential to protecting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures.", "In response to some of these concerns, the Congress included provisions in  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that restrict federal, state, and local  government use and disclosure of critical infrastructure information that  has been voluntarily submitted to the Department of Homeland Security.  These restrictions include an exemption from disclosure under FOIA, a  general limitation on use to CIP purposes, and limitations on use in civil  actions and by state or local governments. The act also provides penalties for any federal employee who improperly discloses any protected critical  infrastructure information. At this time, it is too early to tell what impact  the new law will have on the willingness of the private sector to share  critical infrastructure information.", "In addition to legislation, public policy tools have also been discussed and  used as another approach to encouraging increased private-sector CIP  efforts and information sharing with the federal government. In his June  2002 testimony on the then-proposed Department of Homeland Security,  the Comptroller General noted that intelligence and information-sharing  challenges highlight the need for strong partnerships with those outside the  federal government, and that the new department would need to design  and manage tools of public policy to engage and work constructively with  third parties. Further, the National Strategy for Homeland Security  discusses the need to use available policy tools to raise the security of our  critical infrastructures, and it specifically mentions federal grants  programs to assist state and local efforts and legislation to create  incentives for the private sector. Public policy tools available to  governments include grants, regulations, tax incentives, and regional  coordination and partnerships, and some of these are already being used.  For example, as the lead agency for the water sector, EPA reported  providing 449 grants totaling $51 million to assist utilities for large drinking  water systems in preparing vulnerability assessments, emergency  response/operating plans, security enhancement plans and designs, or a  combination of these efforts.

The agencies have  made progress in implementing PDD 63 requirements, and most have  tentatively identified or are revisiting their list of critical assets. Further,  CIAO is currently undertaking efforts to streamline its Project Matrix  methodology. However, with no established agency or government  milestones and with resource uncertainties, it is difficult to estimate when  the agencies will complete the process of identifying their critical assets  and dependencies. This difficulty also creates uncertainties as to when  other key steps in protecting critical assets will be completed\u2014steps that  are not routinely tracked from both a cyber and physical perspective for  critical assets, such as identifying their vulnerabilities, developing  remediation plans, and developing plans to ensure the continuity of critical  operations. Other agencies, such as GSA, are also a critical element in this  process to ensure that once critical assets are identified, appropriate  security is provided for the facilities and buildings that house them.  Further, identifying critical assets and taking the other key steps needed to  protect them can help the agencies identify and obtain required resources.  Until these processes and steps are completed, neither the agencies nor the  federal government can ensure that the operations and infrastructures  essential to national security, national economic security, and national  public health and safety are safeguarded against attack and could be  rapidly reconstituted if a successful infrastructure attack or disruption  were to occur.", "The five ISACs have made progress in establishing ISAC operations.

NIPC and the lead agencies continue to work with the ISACs to  improve the public/private partnership called for by PDD 63 and  subsequent federal plans and strategies. The Homeland Security Act of  2002, in part, responds to the ISACs\u2019 FOIA concern by including  information use and disclosure restrictions. However, it remains to be seen  whether these efforts will result in increased information sharing with the  federal government and whether additional federal actions, such as the use  of public policy tools, could offer potential incentives to encourage  increased private-sector CIP efforts.", "Given what we found for these selected agencies and ISACs, we believe  that it is crucial that the administration also know the status and progress  of CIP activities for all major federal agencies and critical infrastructure  sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To (1) help ensure the identification and adequate protection of critical  agency cyber-based and physical assets and (2) reinforce management\u2019s  commitment to prioritize the protection of critical infrastructure  throughout agencies, we recommend that the Secretaries of Commerce,  Energy, and Health and Human Services and the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency all direct their respective CIOs and chief  infrastructure assurance officers to work together, as appropriate, to:  coordinate with CIAO to set milestones to complete their Project Matrix  analyses that will identify each agency\u2019s critical cyber, physical, and  other assets and the dependencies of these assets on other government  operations and privately owned critical infrastructures;   require, concurrently with the identification of critical assets and their  dependencies, that vulnerability assessments be conducted or updated  where warranted, to appropriately consider (1) the specific assets  identified as critical national assets and their dependencies, (2) both  cyber and physical vulnerabilities of these assets, and (3) changes in the  threat environment, particularly as reflected by recent terrorist activity  and in warnings by the Office of Homeland Security and NIPC;   ensure that remediation plans for correcting identified critical asset  vulnerabilities are developed, specifying corrective actions and the time  lines, responsibilities, and funding for their implementation; and that  cyber-related actions are also reflected in the agency\u2019s information  security corrective-action plans, and that updates are reported to OMB;  ensure that agency continuity-of-operations plans are prepared or  updated to incorporate critical assets and, according to the CIAO  criterion, that they provide for the reconstitution of these assets within  72 hours of a successful infrastructure attack or disruption;   routinely track and monitor the status of vulnerability assessments,  corrective actions, and other security efforts related to critical assets,  such as the development of continuity-of-operations plans; and provide  an annual status update to help support budget requests and other  reporting requirements, such as those of the Government Performance  and Results Act and the Federal Information Security Management Act;   formally apprise the General Services Administration when facilities or  buildings for which it has protective responsibilities house agency- critical assets identified through the Project Matrix process; and   use Project Matrix plans and results to help prioritize and prepare  budget justifications for resources needed to identify and protect the  agency\u2019s own critical infrastructures.", "To help ensure that private-sector ISACs continue efforts to improve their  CIP activities, we recommend that the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of  Commerce, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  through their lead agency responsibilities for the energy, electricity,  information, communication, and water industry sectors, assess the need  for grants, tax incentives, regulation, or other public policy tools to  encourage increased private-sector CIP activities and greater sharing of  intelligence and incident information between the sectors and the federal  government.
