These payments go to about 2 million recipients, both individuals and entities. GAO previously has reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not consistently ensure that these payments went only to those who meet eligibility requirements. GAO was asked to evaluate (1) how effectively USDA implemented 2002 Farm Bill provisions prohibiting payments to individuals or entities whose income exceeded $2.5 million and who derived less than 75 percent of that income from farming, ranching, or forestry operations, (2) the potential impact of the 2008 Farm Bill's income eligibility provisions on individuals who receive farm payments, and (3) the distribution of income of these individuals compared with all 2006 tax filers. GAO compared USDA data on individuals receiving payments with the latest available Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on these individuals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USDA does not have management controls, such as reviewing an appropriate sample of recipients' tax returns, to verify that payments are made only to individuals who do not exceed income eligibility caps and therefore cannot be assured that millions of dollars in farm program payments it made are proper. GAO found that of the 1.8 million individuals receiving farm payments from 2003 through 2006, 2,702 had an average adjusted gross income (AGI) that exceeded $2.5 million and derived less than 75 percent of their income from farming, ranching, or forestry operations, thereby making them potentially ineligible for farm payments. Nevertheless, USDA paid over $49 million to these individuals. According to USDA officials, a number of factors--such as resource constraints that hamper its ability to examine complex tax and financial information as well as a lack of authority to obtain and use IRS tax filer data for such purposes--contribute to the department's inability to verify that each individual who receives farm program payments complies with income eligibility provisions. However, USDA does not routinely sample individuals receiving farm payments to test for income eligibility; instead, its annual sample selected for review is based primarily on compliance with eligibility requirements other than income. The 2008 Farm Bill directs USDA to use statistical methods to target those individuals most likely to exceed income eligibility caps. The 2008 Farm Bill will increase the number of individuals likely to exceed the income eligibility caps. That is, with lower income eligibility caps under the 2008 Farm Bill, the number of individuals whose AGI exceeds the caps will rise, increasing the risk that USDA will make improper payments to more individuals. For example, had the new Farm Bill been in effect in 2006, as many as 23,506 individuals who received farm program payments would likely have been ineligible for crop subsidy and disaster assistance payments totaling as much as $90 million. Compared with all tax filers, individuals who participated in farm programs in 2006 are more likely to have higher incomes. For example, 12 of every 1,000 individuals receiving farm program payments reported AGI between $500,000 and $1 million compared with about 4 of all tax filers who reported income at this level."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Farmers receive about $16 billion annually in federal farm program  payments for crop subsidies, conservation practices, and disasters. These  payments go to about 2 million recipients, both individuals and entities,  including corporations, partnerships, and trusts. As we reported in  November 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) needed to  better oversee farm program payments. Without better oversight to  ensure that farm program funds are spent as economically, efficiently, and  effectively as possible, we noted, USDA had little assurance that these  funds benefit the agricultural sector as intended. We also previously  reported that because of weak management controls at USDA, some  payments, potentially totaling millions of dollars, have gone to deceased  individuals or farming entities organized to receive payments that exceed  legislatively established limits. For example, in July 2007 we reported that  USDA paid $1.1 billion in farm payments from 1999 to 2005 in the names of  over 170,000 deceased individuals. We recommended that USDA  strengthen its controls to prevent improper payments to deceased  individuals. In 2004, we recommended that because USDA did not have a  measurable standard for ensuring that farm program payments are going  to individuals who are actively engaged in farming\u2014as required by statute  and USDA\u2019s regulations\u2014it allowed individuals with limited involvement  to receive these payments. USDA agreed that it would be beneficial to  have a measurable standard. However, to date, USDA has not taken any  action on our recommendation, stating that its regulations are sufficient  for determining active engagement in farming.", "Under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm  Bill), an individual or entity with an average adjusted gross income (AGI)  of over $2.5 million, over the previous 3 tax years immediately preceding  the applicable crop year, was ineligible for farm program payments unless  at least 75 percent or more of the average AGI was farm income, defined  as income from farming, ranching, or forestry operations. The AGI  provision of the 2002 Farm Bill covered crop years 2003 through 2008 and  applied to most farm program payments, including those for crop subsidy  payments (e.g., fixed payments based on historical production, known as  direct payments, and price support payments), conservation practices, and  disasters. USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency is responsible for ensuring that  only eligible individuals receive farm program payments, either directly or  as a member of an entity, and do not receive payments that exceed the  established limits. USDA has relied principally on individuals\u2019 one-time  self-certifications that they do not exceed income eligibility caps, and their  commitment that they will notify USDA of any changes that cause them to  exceed these caps. To verify the certification, USDA field offices have  been able to request these individuals to submit their tax returns for  review. Individuals failing to provide accurate information to verify  compliance may not be eligible to receive farm program payments for the  year or years of the request.", "Nevertheless, concerns remained about whether it was appropriate for  wealthy individuals to participate in taxpayer-funded farm programs. The  Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill), enacted on  June 18, 2008, revised the income eligibility caps for farm program  payments. In general, the 2008 Farm Bill provides that for crop years 2009  through 2012, a person or entity is ineligible for    direct payments if the individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s 3-year average farm income    all crop subsidy and disaster payments if the individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s 3-year  average non-farm income exceeds $500,000; or    all conservation program payments if an individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s 3-year  average non-farm income exceeds $1 million, unless at least 66.66 percent  of the individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s 3-year average AGI is attributable to activities  related to farming, ranching, or forestry.", "In this context, we were asked to evaluate (1) how effectively USDA  implemented provisions under the 2002 Farm Bill that prohibited  payments to individuals or entities whose income exceeded $2.5 million  and who derived less than 75 percent of that income from farming,  ranching, or forestry operations; (2) the potential impact of the 2008 Farm  Bill\u2019s AGI provisions on individuals who receive farm program payments;  and (3) the distribution of income for individuals receiving farm program  payments compared with all tax filers in 2006.", "To address these issues, we reviewed USDA\u2019s regulations, guidelines, and  other internal controls for implementing the provisions of the 2002 Farm  Bill, and we examined the AGI provisions of the 2008 Farm Bill. We also  spoke to USDA officials in headquarters, and the state office and one local  field office in Louisiana and Mississippi who were responsible for ensuring  that individuals applying for farm payments under the 2002 Farm Bill  complied with the AGI provision. We selected these offices to provide an  example of how USDA implements the AGI provisions and the information  we obtained cannot be generalized to all field offices. In addition, to  evaluate how effectively USDA implemented the 2002 Farm Bill provisions  that prohibited payments to individuals or entities with incomes from  sources other than farming, ranching, or forestry operations that exceeded  the specific limits, we matched USDA data on the 1.8 million individuals  who received farm program payments with Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  tax filer data for 2000 through 2006. We limited our review to individuals  who report their taxes as primary filers\u2014the person who is listed first on  an IRS tax form, such as the Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax  Return). Although we did not analyze tax filer data reported by entities,  such as corporations, partnerships, or trusts, we did include tax filer data  for the individuals who make up the entity. For individuals with a 3-year  average AGI above $2.5 million, we determined whether at least 75 percent  of the income was derived from farming, ranching, or forestry operations.  We obtained farm income data for these individuals from IRS Form 1040,  IRS Schedule F (Profit or Loss From Farming), and IRS Form 4835 (Farm  Rental Income and Expenses). Schedule F and Form 4835 capture farm  income for individuals who report income from agricultural activities. For  all individuals with a 3-year average AGI above $2.5 million and with less  than 75 percent of their AGI derived from farming, ranching, or forestry  operations, we identified the amount of farm program payments subject to  the income eligibility provision. We also identified the amount of certain  program payments not subject to the income provision for these  individuals. To determine the potential impact of the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s AGI  provisions on individuals receiving farm program payments in 2006, we  categorized these individuals by their AGI amounts. We identified average  farm program payments for each of these categories and calculated the  farm payment income as a percentage of AGI. To determine the  distribution of income for individuals receiving farm program payments  compared with all tax filers, we compared the income distribution for  payment recipients with the income distribution for all U.S. tax filers in  2006, the latest year for which tax data were available.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 through  September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

(App. III lists USDA farm programs and payments made  between 2003 and 2006 under the 2002 Farm Bill.) Under the 2002 Farm  Bill, a person could receive farm program payments directly or through as  many as three entities in which the person held a substantial beneficial  interest\u2014defined as a 10 percent or more interest in the operation. For the  purposes of the 2002 Farm Bill, a person was defined to include, among  other things, an individual, partnership, trust, corporation, charitable  organization, or state agency, who could receive payments (1) as an  individual and as a member of no more than two entities or (2) through  three entities and not as an individual. Under the 2002 Farm Bill,  individuals and entities were required to be eligible under the AGI  provision to receive certain USDA payments, including direct and counter- cyclical payments; payments under the Marketing Assistance Loan  Program; and conservation payments. More specifically:    Direct and Counter-Cyclical Payments Program provides two types of  payments to producers of covered commodity crops, including corn,  cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Direct payments are tied to a fixed  payment rate for each commodity crop and do not depend on current  production or current market prices. Instead, direct payments are based  on the farm\u2019s historical acreage and yields. Counter-cyclical payments  provide price-dependent benefits for covered commodities whenever the  effective price for the commodity is less than a predetermined price  (called the target price). Counter-cyclical payments are based on a farm\u2019s  historical acreage and yields, and are not tied to the current production of  the covered commodity.", "Marketing Assistance Loan Program provides benefits to producers of  covered commodity crops when market prices are low. Specifically, the  federal government accepts harvested crops as collateral for interest- bearing loans (marketing assistance loans) that are due in 9 months. When  market prices drop below the loan rate (the loan price per pound or  bushel), the government allows producers to repay the loan at a lower rate  and retain ownership of their commodity for eventual sale. The difference  between the loan rate and the lower repayment rate is called the  marketing assistance loan gain. In addition, producers who do not have  marketing assistance loans can receive a benefit when prices are low\u2014the  loan deficiency payment\u2014that is equal to the marketing assistance loan  gain that the producer would have received if the producer had had a loan.  Under the 2002 Farm Bill, producers also could purchase commodity  certificates that allowed them to redeem their marketing assistance loan at  a lower repayment rate and immediately reclaim their commodities under  the loan. The difference between the loan rate and the lower repayment  rate, called the commodity certificate exchange gain, was not subject to  the AGI provision.", "Conservation payments provide assistance to producers to help them  safeguard environmentally sensitive land. For example, the Conservation  Reserve Program provides annual rental payments and cost-share  assistance to producers who contractually agree to retire their land from  agricultural purposes and keep it in approved conserving uses for 10 to 15  years. Other conservation programs include the Conservation Security  Program, the Conservation Stewardship Program under the 2008 Farm  Bill, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Grassland Reserve  Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program, which are generally  administered by the USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service.", "The 2008 Farm Bill, which is in effect for crop years 2009 through 2012,  continues many of the 2002 Farm Bill\u2019s provisions, including the programs  already subject to the AGI caps and programs that the 2008 Farm Bill  added. However, the 2008 Farm Bill changes, among other things, the AGI  cap by dividing it into two parts: non-farm income and farm income; both  are averages over a 3-year period. The 2008 Farm Bill sets a cap of  $500,000 for non-farm income for a person to receive crop subsidy  benefits, noninsured crop assistance (financial assistance to producers for  uninsurable specialty crops when low yields, loss of inventory, or  prevented planting occurs due to natural disasters), or disaster payments,  and sets a cap of $750,000 for farm income to receive direct payments. For  conservation programs, the farm bill sets a cap of $1 million non-farm  income, unless at least 66.66 percent of AGI is from farm income. The  farm bill also provides USDA discretion to waive the conservation cap for  \u201cenvironmentally sensitive land of special significance.\u201d", "The 2008 Farm Bill also specifies types of income or benefits that must be  included in determining farm income. These include the production of  farm-based renewable energy; the sale of easements and development  rights of farm, ranch, or forestry land, water or hunting rights, or  environmental benefits; and the processing, storing, and transporting of  farming, ranching, or forestry commodities, including renewable energy.  The 2008 Farm Bill also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct  audits of persons and legal entities most likely to exceed the AGI caps.  Furthermore, the new law requires persons and entities to provide the  Secretary of Agriculture, at least once every 3 years, with either (1)  information and documentation regarding AGI through procedures  established by the Secretary, or (2) a certification by a certified public  accountant or similar third party that the person or entity does not exceed  applicable limitations. It also allows individuals filing joint tax returns to  allocate their income and losses for purposes of applying for farm program  payments, which may help them individually meet the AGI eligibility  requirements even if applying jointly they could not. The 2008 Farm Bill  creates the Average Crop Revenue Election Program, which provides  producers with the option to participate in a state-level revenue protection  system if they are willing to forgo counter-cyclical payments and receive a  reduction in direct payments and the marketing assistance loan rate.  Payments under this new program are subject to the AGI provisions.", "To receive farm program payments under the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, an  individual or entity must be \u201cactively engaged in farming.\u201d To be  considered actively engaged in farming, an individual must make  significant contributions to a farming operation in two areas: (1) capital,  land, or equipment and (2) personal labor or active personal management.  An entity is considered actively engaged in farming if the entity separately  makes a significant contribution of capital, land, or equipment and its  members collectively make a significant contribution of personal labor or  active personal management.", "The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires the heads  of executive branch agencies to annually review all programs and  activities they administer, identify those that may be susceptible to  significant improper payments, and estimate and report on the annual  amount of improper payments in those programs and activities.

For example, we found individuals  who were members of a farming operation that received approximately  $700,000 in farm program payments in 2001 who asserted to USDA that  they provided personal management to the operation \u201con-site\u201d and on a  \u201cdaily\u201d basis even though these individuals lived several hundred miles  from the farming operation. We recommended that USDA develop and  enforce a measurable standard that defines a significant contribution of  active personal management.

Reviews for the  remaining 9 farming operations were waived because they had been  reviewed in a previous year. Because USDA has drawn a sample of  individuals receiving farm payments that has not routinely tested for  income eligibility, it could not ensure that only individuals who have not  exceeded the income eligibility caps were receiving farm payments.  However, in the 2008 Farm Bill, Congress directed the Secretary of  Agriculture to establish statistically valid procedures to conduct targeted  audits of persons or legal entities most likely to exceed the legislation\u2019s  income eligibility caps.", "Our analysis of USDA and IRS data suggests that USDA\u2019s primary method  for ensuring compliance\u2014its annual review of a sample of individuals\u2014 has not always identified or prevented payments to individuals who were  not eligible under the AGI requirement.

According to an official with USDA\u2019s Economic  Research Service, some individuals with high income might make business  decisions that, while legal, would help them avoid the new AGI caps.  These decisions include leasing all or part of their land to individuals not  affected by the caps, and then indirectly receiving farm program payments  by charging a rental rate that includes the lost payments; dividing income  with a spouse for individuals who are married and file a joint tax return;  investing in equipment to increase tax deductions for depreciation and  immediate expensing; and delaying or accelerating income from  corporations in which the individual has controlling interest. Furthermore,  while forecasts for high crop prices through 2012 might increase  individuals\u2019 farm income and AGI, an increase in the tax deduction for  \u201cdomestic production activities\u201d beginning in 2010 might reduce the  impact of the AGI provisions on some individuals. The 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s  directive to include the production of farm-based renewable energy,  production of livestock products, and the sale of farm equipment in the  definition of farm income might increase the number of individuals  ineligible for direct payments under the Direct and Counter-Cyclical  Payments Program.", "In discussing the 2008 Farm Bill with USDA officials, they agreed that the  lower income eligibility thresholds will increase and complicate their  responsibilities.

Rather, other IRS  forms and schedules not used previously may now be included in USDA\u2019s  eligibility determination. The USDA officials also stated that the split of  AGI into two types of income\u2014farm and non-farm\u2014together with  separate income caps for direct payments, crop subsidy and disaster  assistance payments, and conservation payments, adds to the complexity  for field office staff who must make eligibility determinations.

The likelihood that even more  individuals will exceed income eligibility requirements and still receive  payments is expected to grow under the 2008 Farm Bill given the bill\u2019s  new, more complex eligibility criteria.", "In the past, USDA has relied on individuals\u2019 one-time self-certifications  that they meet income eligibility requirements and their promise to notify  USDA if they no longer meet these requirements. As our analysis showed,  however, these self-certifications have not always proven reliable for all  recipients of farm program payments because USDA has not always  withheld payments from these individuals. Moreover, USDA\u2019s principal  management control to ensure compliance with farm program  requirements\u2014a review of a sample of individuals receiving high  payments or a change in operations\u2014has not targeted high-income  individuals. The need for management controls to ensure individuals meet  income eligibility requirements will be even more critical under the 2008  Farm Bill, which has provided reduced income eligibility caps for farm  program payments.", "The 2008 Farm Bill directs USDA to establish statistically valid procedures  to conduct targeted audits of persons and legal entities that are most likely  to exceed the income eligibility caps. We realize that under Internal  Revenue Code Section 6103, IRS is generally not authorized to provide  USDA with tax filer information for such purposes without a waiver from  the individual tax filer. Individual tax filers may authorize IRS, in writing,  to disclose their return information to a third party.

USDA agreed with our recommendations. Nevertheless, USDA did not  agree with several of our findings. First, USDA noted that only a small  percentage of USDA\u2019s total farm program payments were made to  individuals who exceeded the 2002 Farm Bill\u2019s income eligibility caps.  However, our finding is consistent with the general distribution of income  among all tax filers:  only a very small percentage of all individuals who  file a tax return report an AGI in excess of $2.5 million to the IRS.  Furthermore, the number of individuals who exceed income eligibility  caps is likely to increase because the 2008 Farm Bill lowers these  eligibility caps. Therefore, USDA could be at greater risk of making  improper payments unless it has better management controls in place.", "Second, USDA stated that we should not have discussed the requirement  of actively engaged in farming in this report. We disagree. We believe that  it is important to place our discussion of income eligibility requirements in  the context of other key eligibility requirements to provide a more  comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which individuals  may qualify for farm program payments.", "Finally, USDA sought more information about the individual cases we cite  in this report of individuals whose AGI apparently exceeds the eligibility  requirements.

In this context, we  were asked to evaluate (1) how effectively the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) implemented provisions under the 2002 Farm Bill that  prohibited payments to individuals whose 3-year average AGI exceeded  $2.5 million and who derived less than 75 percent of that income from  farming, ranching, or forestry operations; (2) the potential impact of the  Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008\u2019s (2008 Farm Bill) AGI  provisions on individuals who receive farm program payments; and (3) the  distribution of income for individuals receiving farm program payments  compared with all tax filers.", "To evaluate how effectively USDA implemented the 2002 Farm Bill  provisions that prohibit payments to individuals who do not meet the AGI  provisions, we reviewed guidance that USDA field offices use to determine  farm program payment eligibility, including relevant statutes and  regulations and agency policy, such as the FSA Handbook on Payment  Limitations, 1-PL (Revision 1), as well as relevant studies prepared by  USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General and the Congressional Research  Service and our own past reports. In addition, we spoke with USDA  officials in headquarters and state and local field offices in Louisiana and  Mississippi who are responsible for ensuring that individuals who receive  farm program payments were eligible under the 2002 Farm Bill\u2019s AGI  provisions that cap 3-year average AGI at $2.5 million, unless at least 75  percent is derived from farming, ranching, or forestry operations. We  selected these offices to provide an example of how USDA implements the  AGI provisions and the information we obtained cannot be generalized to  all field offices. We also spoke with officials from USDA\u2019s Economic  Research Service on the implications of AGI provisions in the 2008 Farm  Bill for individuals who receive farm program payments. We also reviewed  USDA\u2019s FY 2007 Performance and Accountability Report to understand  its assessment of internal controls for its farm programs, and Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) publications and guidance on reporting income.", "We obtained and analyzed USDA\u2019s computer databases for information on  individuals receiving farm program payments either directly or through an  entity, such as a corporation, general partnership, or trust, from 2003  through 2006. These databases included FSA\u2019s Producer Payment  Reporting System, Permitted Entity file, and Subsidiary Eligibility file, as  well as payment files from USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation  Service. These databases contained detailed information on payment  recipients, such as social security numbers, payment amounts, the status  of recipients as individuals or members of entities, their ownership  interest in entities, types of entities, and additional organizational details.  These databases also contained information on payments made under  USDA\u2019s farm programs, including the Direct and Counter-Cyclical  Payments Program, Marketing Assistance Loan Program, Conservation  Reserve Program, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program.  Appendix III provides a listing of USDA farm programs and payments  made between 2003 and 2006 under the 2002 Farm Bill.", "Using the USDA data described above, we identified approximately 2.6  million individuals who received farm payments between 2003 and 2006.  We forwarded the list to IRS and requested that IRS provide selected data  from Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return), Schedule F (Profit  or Loss from Farming), and Form 4835 (Farm Rental Income and  Expenses)\u2014the principal IRS forms for reporting income from farming,  ranching, or forestry. IRS returned data for about 10.9 million returns for  tax years 2000 to 2006. We verified the accuracy of the matched records  through an automated name check to compare the individual\u2019s name as  contained in the USDA data with the name of the tax payer in the IRS data.  In addition to the automated name comparison, we reviewed every name  that failed the check to confirm that the two names did not match. We did  not analyze tax filer data reported by entities, such as corporations,  partnerships, or trusts, but we did review tax filer data for the individuals  identified by USDA as members of an entity. At the conclusion of our  verification efforts, tax returns from about 1.9 million of the original 2.6  million individuals were validated.", "To determine the number of individuals who received potentially improper  farm program payments, we calculated 3-year moving averages of AGI and  farm income, and identified individuals whose average AGI was at least  $2.5 million for the 3 years immediately proceeding the year in which they  received a farm program payment. This analysis identified 3,893  individuals whose tax returns indicated they did not meet the AGI  provisions for receiving farm program payments in one or more of years  2003 to 2006. We matched these 3,893 individuals with the data provided  by USDA to determine the types and amounts of farm program payments  these individuals received in each year. Our analyses showed that 2,702  individuals had AGI that exceeded the income eligibility cap and had  received potentially improper farm program payments. For payments  made to an entity, we attributed the payments to each member based on  the payment share of the member as recorded in FSA\u2019s Permitted Entity  file.", "We also identified the amount of certain program payments and benefits  not subject to the income provision for the 2,702 individuals. Payments  and benefits not subject to the AGI provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill  include those provided under the 2002 Cattle Feed Program, Conservation  Reserve Program (annual rental and incentive payments for contracts  signed prior to May 13, 2002), Florida hurricane disaster programs  (payments for debris removal), Marketing Assistance Loan Program  (commodity certificate exchange gains), Noninsured Assistance Program,  Peanut Quota Buyout Program, and Sugar Beet Disaster Program. We  identified programs not subject to the AGI provisions with the assistance  of FSA officials.", "To evaluate the potential impact of the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s AGI provisions on  individuals who receive farm program payments, we identified 1.7 million  individuals who received farm payments in 2006 and matched these  individuals with 2006 data provided by IRS. After completing our name  validation tests, we identified 1.1 million tax returns for individuals  receiving farm payments in 2006. We categorized tax returns for these 1.1  million individuals by the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s farm and non-farm income  caps for direct payments, crop subsidy and disaster payments, and  conservation program payments\u2014$750,000, $500,000, and $1 million,  respectively. For individuals who received conservation program  payments, we also compared their farm income with their AGI to  determine if at least 66.66 percent of their average AGI was derived from  farm income. To estimate non-farm income, we calculated the difference  between reported AGI and farm income for each tax return.", "For joint tax returns, we assumed that the difference between the AGI and  farm income (Schedule F and Form 4835) represented non-farm income.  However, because individuals filing joint tax returns represented 70.5  percent of the 1.1 million returns for all individuals, we performed  additional steps for joint tax returns to account for the possibility that a  secondary filer on a joint tax return could have income that may be  categorized as either farm income, non-farm income, or both. Using the  2006 data, we developed 11 different scenarios to estimate the potential  impact of the 2008 Farm Bill\u2019s AGI provisions on tax returns from  individuals who receive farm program payments. These scenarios included  non-farm income as values from 0 percent to 100 percent of the difference  between AGI and farm income, using 10 percent increments. Table 4  provides the results of our calculations for individuals whose tax filing  status was single or married filing jointly. For example, the table shows  that 3,594 individuals filing single tax returns and as many as 19,912  individuals filing joint tax returns, or a total of 23,506, are likely to have  incomes above the new AGI cap of $500,000 for non-farm income.", "To evaluate the distribution of income of the 1.1 million individuals who  received farm program payments and filed a tax return in 2006, we  stratified these individuals by the amount of their AGI. We then identified  average farm program payments for each of these categories and  calculated the farm payment income as a percent of AGI. We compared  the income distribution for farm program payment recipients with the  income distribution for all individual tax filers in 2006, the latest year for  which data were available. Information for all tax filers is based on IRS\u2019s  Statistics of Income data.", "For our analyses of IRS\u2019s and USDA\u2019s data, we performed consistency  checks to confirm that the data contained the information required for our  comparisons. We eliminated duplicate records from both the USDA and  IRS data and ensured the internal consistency of the data by deleting any  cases with missing values critical for the analysis. When we matched  USDA records with IRS records, we confirmed that the USDA and IRS  records represented an accurate match through our automated name  verification check followed by the visual inspection for each failed match.  Only those individuals with farm income reported to the IRS who also  received farm payments were included in the analysis. Accordingly, we  believe the data we used in the analyses were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We did not independently verify the data from USDA\u2019s and IRS\u2019s  computer databases, but we discussed with agency officials, as  appropriate, the measures they take to ensure the accuracy of these data.  For the purposes for which the data were used in this report, these  measures seemed reasonable.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 through  September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following is GAO\u2019s response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s  letter dated October 9, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The report number has changed to GAO-09-67.  2.  We recognized in the report that resource constraints limit USDA\u2019s  ability to effectively enforce the adjusted gross income (AGI)  requirements. As we stated, according to USDA officials, these  resource constraints hamper the department\u2019s ability to examine  complex tax and financial information, and field staff have other  competing responsibilities that limit the time available for enforcing  the AGI requirements.   3.  We acknowledge that a small percentage of USDA\u2019s total farm program  payments were made to individuals who exceeded the 2002 Farm Bill\u2019s  income eligibility caps. The small percentage is to be expected:  only a  very small percentage of all individuals who file a tax return report an  AGI exceeding $2.5 million to the IRS. Furthermore, the fact that only a  small percentage of recipients are potentially ineligible does not  relieve USDA of its responsibility to enforce the AGI requirements.  This percentage is also likely to increase because the 2008 Farm Bill  lowers the income eligibility caps. Therefore, USDA will be at greater  risk of making improper payments to more than the 2,702 individuals  we found unless it has better management controls in place.", "USDA is correct in stating that not all of the farm programs and  payments listed in appendix III of this report were subject to the AGI  limitation under the 2002 Farm Bill. That table was not intended to list  only programs subject to the AGI limitation. To provide clarity, we  have included a note below the table in appendix III explaining this  fact.  4.  We believe that it is important to place our discussion of income  eligibility requirements in the context of other key eligibility  requirements to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the  conditions under which individuals may receive farm program  payments. Although USDA is correct that the requirements for actively  engaged in farming are not part of the AGI provision, we mention the  issue of actively engaged in farming in this report to provide more  information regarding concerns we have previously raised about  USDA\u2019s oversight of farm program payments.    5.  As noted in the report, the 2008 Farm Bill directed the Secretary of  Agriculture to establish statistically valid procedures to conduct  targeted audits of persons or entities most likely to exceed the  legislation\u2019s income eligibility caps. Therefore, to provide context for  our discussion on how USDA ensured recipients met eligibility  requirements, we provided information regarding concerns we had  previously raised in our 2004 report about how USDA selected farm  operations for compliance review.   6.  USDA is correct in stating that when the entity is AGI compliant and an  interest holder is not AGI compliant, the entity is still eligible to  receive a payment. However, the payment to the entity must be  reduced by the share held by that interest holder. In our analysis of  entities, we attributed payments to each interest holder based on the  payment share of the interest holder as recorded in the Farm Service  Agency\u2019s Permitted Entity database. For the 1,346 potentially ineligible  individuals who we identify as receiving a payment through an entity,  USDA did not reduce the payment to the entity based on the share held  by the individual. (For further discussion of the methodology we used,  see app. I.)  7.  We have identified potentially ineligible recipients on the basis of their  reported AGI. While we cannot name these recipients, we believe that  providing as much demographic information as we can about these  recipients, such as whether they reside near the farming operation, is  helpful to users of this report.   8.  USDA believes we should provide more information about the  examples we cite in this report. Providing this information would allow  USDA, which does not have authority to access tax information, to  identify individual filers. Internal Revenue Code Section 6103 prohibits  us from disclosing any additional information. We note here that some  of the payments were issued directly to individuals while others were  issued indirectly through entities. Regarding USDA\u2019s comment on  whether we made a commensurate reduction in the payment when the  payment was made to an entity, we attributed payments to each  interest holder based on the payment share of the interest holder as  recorded in the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Permitted Entity database. With  respect to USDA\u2019s comment on requesting authority to gain access to  information on potentially improper payments, we recommended that  the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator of the Farm  Service Agency to work with the Internal Revenue Service to develop a  system for verifying the income eligibility for all recipients of farm  program payments. We further stated that if the Secretary determines  that it does not have the authority to develop such a system with the  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, we recommended that  the Secretary request this authority from Congress, as appropriate.   9.  We believe that explaining our use of the term \u201cpotentially improper  payments\u201d in the footnotes on pages 4 and 25 is sufficient.  10. Appendix I of this report specifies the documents we reviewed.  As we  noted, we reviewed guidance that USDA field offices use to determine  compliance with the AGI requirements, including relevant statutes and  regulations and agency policy and guidance.
