These two teams used the network and its powerful project management software to address all aspects of the rollout of the network and the DCA by dividing tasks into two groups, those related to general project activities (e.g., procurement, application development and testing, communications, and training) and those related to installing the network and the application software at individual work locations and training staff in their uses. The teams then used the software to manage the tasks, track their progress against estimated milestones, and report on their status to management.", "This discipline developed a sense of teamwork among project participants. It continually reminded them of where their activities intersected with those of other managers, some of whom they were depending upon and some of whom were depending on them. In addition, by identifying the interdependent project tasks, the teams focused on the importance of managing according to the estimated milestones and kept the project close to its originally projected dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Site Preparation and Installation Plans", "paragraphs": ["This structured planning was particularly helpful in managing the complex set of tasks required to install a network at each organizational location. Each location brings a unique mix of a wide variety of elements: staff size; existing hardware and software; type of space: GAO owned, commercial, or host agency; permanence of location (anticipated move date if nonpermanent); location of current wire closets and other structures carrying the building\u2019s electrical system and the capacity of existing electrical systems; heating and air-conditioning capacity and hours of operation; and presence of a local area network (if present, its conformance to GAO\u2019s current standards).", "For each location, we identified and analyzed all these elements in a site survey to determine the level of effort and the specific steps that we would need to take to bring in a network. With the survey data in hand, we then ordered the hardware and the software the site required through contracts that we had specifically awarded for that purpose. We also used the survey to develop a detailed design of the proposed cable plant to guide the cabling and installation teams, identifying the location of each network workstation, printer, and server, as well as the location of the wiring closets and the potential connection points for the network. Depending on the location and the type of site, we then selected the appropriate contractor to install the cable plant and delivered the network hardware to the location. When the contractor had completed the installation, we tested the hardware to make sure it conformed to the design standards. Concurrently with these tasks, we employed a separate contractor to make any changes to the location\u2019s electrical and air-conditioning support required by the new network.", "As the cable plant was being installed, we also prepared the location\u2019s end-user hardware and software. The specific number and configuration of server(s) depended upon staff size and the types of applications to be performed at the site. We configured and tested the server(s), and then loaded the software the site required. We also installed network interface cards in each workstation and delivered them to each site.", "Finally, another team completed the installation. It connected the server(s), workstations, and printers to the cable plant, and if the location was not in the headquarters building, the team connected the local area network to GAO\u2019s wide area network, allowing it to exchange data with other GAO locations. We then verified that all network functions were operating normally and completed the systems integration.", "The variables that drive this process would not have been manageable without our project management approach. To illustrate, we had to manage 12 major tasks containing about 86 subtasks and coordinate the efforts of our own staff with a variety of contractor teams, their number ranging from 2 to 4 depending on the situation at a particular site. Given the number of organizational locations covered by the project, this was a challenging undertaking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquisition and Budgeting Issues", "paragraphs": ["As did site preparation and installation, our acquisition process required careful planning and management. In the middle of fiscal year 1994, we received authorization to proceed with the rollout of the network and DCA. We were faced with establishing a procurement vehicle that would meet the multifaceted requirements for this project, everything from network infrastructure hardware to end-user software and the labor services needed to install and maintain the total plant. Our task was complicated by two facts: (1) many of our existing contracts for information technology and services were about to terminate and (2) our procurement efforts would take place during the always hectic year-end buying period.", "As we had with the rollout as a whole, we formed a team representing the pertinent offices\u2014General Counsel, Acquisition Management, and OIMC\u2014to improve communication and reduce obstacles. The team defined the key activities required in the balance of fiscal year 1994 and those for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. The team also established some working guidelines: use existing contracts and governmentwide agreements wherever possible (such as contracts for cabling and telecommunications); use the reprocurement of terminating contracts as the vehicle for meeting our new network requirements wherever possible; negotiate directly with software providers for agencywide software; and use the mixture of competitive and noncompetitive contracts best suited to our needs.", "Working with these guidelines, we were able to undertake and put in place six major procurement activities in fiscal year 1994: a labor services replacement contract for various network tasks (e.g., user support and network operations and support); a hardware maintenance services replacement contract; an operations and maintenance replacement contract for administrative systems, small systems development, and customer support; a high-level configuration design and engineering support contract (e.g., testing structures and compatibility testing); a contract to install the hardware and the software for the basic network a contract to install the hardware and the software for the DCA.", "With these contracts in place, we then worked to ensure that they would provide us with the quality and the timeliness of service that we required.", "Our project management approach had demonstrated how tightly interrelated our tasks were and how a slippage by one contractor could roll throughout the project, causing delays in networking numerous units. As a result, we worked closely with the top management of our contractors to understand the stresses that they were under and to guarantee that they were clear about our priorities, schedules, and concerns. While we have experienced some delays, they have been relatively few given the size and the complexity of this project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Customer and Network Support Enhanced and Expanded", "paragraphs": ["We are well aware that the ability of our network and the DCA to achieve the type of benefits that GAO seeks will depend largely on how well we support users.

Many users work in locations far from headquarters, and many others are traveling far from their own offices or working at home; however, they all require support in the new interface and applications provided on the network, as well in the use of them in their assignments. To deal with these issues, we have established a two-tier support mechanism. The first tier is at the user\u2019s permanent location, where the network focal points and administrators are sources for immediate help and troubleshooting and know how to use the new applications in a typical GAO assignment. For those problems whose resolution requires a level of technical skill beyond that of the local support or for traveling staff, we have established the second tier, the Customer Support Facility, which is staffed weekdays from 6 a.m. to midnight E.S.T. and weekends from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. E.S.T.; support at other times is available through voice mail and pager service with a guaranteed immediate call-back option.", "Within the Customer Support Facility, a caller is provided multiple types of assistance depending on the nature of the problem.

Like all networks of any size, ours has thousands of different devices linked to the network infrastructure and thousands more which form the network itself. In addition, these devices come from thousands of different manufacturers, and while they are designed and configured to operate together, the industry is not yet so standardized that the status of each can be determined from a central point.", "We have, however, taken the first steps in securing such a capacity. We have procured the dominant industry platform for network management. When this combination of hardware and software is fully implemented, it will allow us to proactively review the status of major devices across the network, determine traffic patterns, and highlight potential trouble spots. While the platform provides a rich set of tools, implementing it will require a significant level of effort. We will need to standardize the network as much as possible, ensuring that each device on it has a unique address that can be identified and monitored centrally.
