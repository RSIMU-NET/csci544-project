The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pays for certain dialysis services under a type of bundled rate, called a composite rate, and, for certain dialysis-related drugs, pays a separate rate per dose each time the drug is administered. These drugs are referred to as \"separately billable\" and are paid at 6 percent above manufacturers' average sales price (ASP). Recently, the Congress required CMS to explore the creation of a bundled payment for all ESRD services, including separately billable drugs. GAO was asked to examine (1) recent changes in payments for ESRD services, (2) the ASP payment method of setting rates for separately billable ESRD drugs, and (3) CMS efforts to develop a bundled payment method that includes all ESRD drugs. GAO obtained information for this study from CMS, the U.S. Renal Data System, ESRD experts, and previously issued GAO reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effect of several legislative and regulatory changes since 2003 has been to raise the composite rate while reducing Medicare's pre-2005 generous payments for separately billable ESRD drugs. In 2005, when the first legislative change was implemented, Medicare expenditures for certain separately billable drugs dropped 11.8 percent. In 2006, Medicare regulation changed the payment for these drugs to a method based on ASP. Since then, Medicare's payment rates have varied from quarter to quarter but have remained relatively consistent with the lower 2005 payment rates. Medicare's cost containment efforts have targeted the most expensive of the separately billable drugs--Epogen--for which program spending totaled $2 billion in 2005. Epogen is used to treat anemia in ESRD patients; most patients receive this drug at nearly every dialysis session. Recent data indicate that Epogen use per patient continues to rise, although more slowly than in previous years. Several unknowns about the composition of ASP and the lack of empirical evidence for the percentage level added to ASP make it difficult for CMS to determine whether the ASP-based payment rates are no greater than necessary to achieve appropriate beneficiary access. Paying for Epogen under the ASP method is of particular concern. The ASP method relies on market forces to moderate manufacturers' prices; but Epogen is the product of a single manufacturer and has no competitor products in the ESRD market. Without competition, the power of market forces to moderate price is absent. For rarely used products, the lack of price competition may be financially insignificant, but for Epogen, which is pervasively and frequently used, the lack of price competition could be having a considerable effect on Medicare spending. In 2003, the Congress required CMS to issue a report and conduct a demonstration of a system that would bundle payment for ESRD services, including drugs that are currently billed separately, under a single rate. The bundled payment approach, used to pay for most Medicare services, encourages providers to operate efficiently, as they retain the difference if Medicare's payment exceeds the costs they incur to provide the services. GAO and others have found that a bundled rate for all ESRD services would have advantages for achieving efficiency and clinical flexibility in treating ESRD patients. CMS's demonstration testing the feasibility of a bundled rate, mandated to start in January 2006, is delayed, as is the completion of the agency's mandated report to the Congress on bundling. The report was due in October 2005; as of November 2006, CMS officials could not tell us when the report would be available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of age, most individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a  Regardless of age, most individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a  condition of permanent kidney failure, are eligible for health care coverage  condition of permanent kidney failure, are eligible for health care coverage  under Medicare.

Introduced in 1989, Epogen was an expensive breakthrough drug used to  treat anemia in patients with ESRD. Over time, policymakers have raised  concerns about incentives in the Medicare payment system for dialysis  facilities to use Epogen more than necessary because Medicare payments  for the drug substantially exceeded facilities\u2019 costs of acquiring it.

Kidney transplants are not  a practical option on a wide scale, as not all patients are candidates for  transplant and suitable donated organs are scarce. In contrast, dialysis is  the treatment used by most ESRD patients. Dialysis can be administered  through two methods: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. During  hemodialysis, a machine pumps blood through an artificial kidney, called a  hemodialyzer, and returns the cleansed blood to the body. Hemodialysis,  the most prevalent treatment method, is generally administered at  freestanding facilities that provide dialysis services. The conventional  regimen includes hemodialysis three times a week.", "Peritoneal dialysis\u2014which is generally done in the home\u2014utilizes the  peritoneal membrane, which surrounds the patient\u2019s abdomen, as a natural  blood filter.

ESRD patients receive Epogen to keep their Hct  above a minimum level. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  labeled Epogen for use encompassing a somewhat lower Hct target level  ranging from 30 to 36 percent. Recent clinical studies cited by KDOQI  indicate that there may be increased patient mortality and morbidity if Hct  levels are much higher than 39 percent. Epogen is typically administered  to Medicare ESRD patients intravenously. Epogen can also be  administered subcutaneously, that is, through an injection under the skin.

Despite its name, however, AWP was  neither an average price nor the price wholesalers charged. It was a price  that manufacturers derived using their own criteria; there were no  requirements or conventions that AWP reflect the price of an actual sale of  drugs by a manufacturer.

Essentially, these changes lowered payments for separately  billable drugs from their pre-MMA amounts, and raised payments for the  composite rate.

In  1997, the first policy denied payment when a patient\u2019s 3-month rolling  average Hct level exceeded 36.5 percent. In 1998, CMS revised the policy  so that the maximum level for the 3-month rolling average Hct was   37.5 percent; if a patient exceeded that level, payments were not denied as  long as the Epogen dose was reduced 20 percent.

In principle, under ASP, when two or  more clinically similar products exist in a market, market forces could  serve to bring prices down, as each manufacturer competes for its own  product\u2019s market share. In contrast, when a product is available through  only one manufacturer, Medicare\u2019s rate lacks the moderating influence of  competition.

Composite  rate updates and add-ons, coupled with the overhaul of payment for P drugs, have moved Medicare toward paying more appropriately for ESRD  services. Nevertheless, under the ASP payment method\u2014which pays for  separately billable ESRD drugs on a per administration basis\u2014facilities continue to have an incentive to use these drugs more than may be  necessary. Paying for Epogen under ASP presents an additional dilemm as a single-source drug in a market with no competitor products, Epo n  is not subject to the moderating effects that competition can have o price.", "In our view, Medicare could realize greater system efficiency if a services, including drugs, were bundled under a single payment. A bundled  payment\u2014suitably adjusted for differences across facilities in their mix of  patients\u2014would encourage facilities to use drugs more prudently, as they  would have no financial incentive to use more than necessary and could  retain the difference between Medicare\u2019s payment and their costs. At the  same time, because treatment choices would be payment neutral,  clinicians would have more flexibility to try different treatment  combinations of items and services paid for in the bundle. To account for  facilities\u2019 increased or decreased costs over time, a reexamination of the  bundled rate may be necessary periodically. In the case of Epogen, for  example, if other competitor products entered the market in the future,  the costs facilities would incur to treat anemia could decline. By adjusting  the payment bundle accordingly, Medicare could realize the benefits of  such cost reductions.", "CMS\u2019s time line is considerably protracted for issuing the mandate on a bundled ESRD payment system and conducting a demonst remains under development. The time needed to complete these steps  makes the prospect of implementing such a system several years away."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of the uncertain time frame for CMS\u2019s test of bundling and the  potential for bundling to eliminate financial incentives to overuse  separately billable drugs, the Congress should consider establishing a  bundled payment system for all ESRD services as soon as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and In Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comments from Industry Representatives", "paragraphs": ["We invited representatives of drug manufacturers, large and small dialysis  facility organizations, and a nephrologist specialty association to review  and comment on the draft report. The groups represented were Amgen  Inc. (Amgen), F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche), the Kidney Care  Council (KCC), the National Renal Administrators Association (NRAA),  and the Renal Physicians Association (RPA). Several of the industry  groups noted that the report was well written, thorough, and covered  many of the issues affecting dialysis providers. The bulk of the groups\u2019  comments focused on three general issues central to the message of our  report: the increase in utilization of Epogen over time, the current ASP- based payment system for ESRD drugs, and the implementation of a fully  bundled ESRD payment system.", "First, Amgen, KCC, Roche, and NRAA noted that the report did not ful ly  explain why utilization of Epogen has grown over time or why the gro wth  rate has slowed in recent years. Amgen stated that the draft report did not  sufficiently cover the goal of Epogen therapy\u2014which is to increase patient  Hct levels\u2014and its link to improved quality of life for dialysis patients.  KCC noted that while the average Epogen dose has increased over time,  patient outcomes\u2014as measured by average Hct levels\u2014have also  improved. KCC further contended that beca remained relatively flat in recent years, providers are not responding to  the incentive to overuse ESRD drugs. Roche maintained that the slow  growth in Epogen use over the past few years is attributable to more  patients\u2019 having achieved Hct levels within the target range. NRAA addedthat the slower growth of Epogen use is positive because it demonstrates  that providers use less Epogen as more patients reach the target Hct  range.", "In our report, we discuss the utilization of Epogen rather than the clinica outcomes associated with that utilization. In response to the groups\u2019  comments, we have added information that describes the benefits of  Epogen therapy as well as data on patient Hct levels prior to the MMA  payment changes. Although we do not take a position on whether the drug is overutilized at the levels we report, we stand by our contention that an  inherent incentive to maximize revenues exists when items are paid for on  a cost-plus (e.g., ASP+6 percent), fee-for-service basis. It is because of the  inherent nature of this incentive that we recommend combining payment  for ESRD drugs with all dialysis services under a single bundled rate.  l  Second, all of the groups commented on our discussion in the report of the current ASP-based payment method for separately billable ESRD drugs,  with some groups expressing concerns about an abrupt movement to a  fully bundled rate. Amgen noted that the ASP method is relatively new and  that it is too early to decide whether to move to a fully bundled rate. In  addition, Amgen was concerned with our characterization of ASP payment  issues associated with Epogen and stated that the entry of a new anemia  management product may not necessarily result in reduced prices. Two of  the organizations noted that, prior to moving to a bundled rate, a  transitional system\u2014one that encourages price competition for anemia  management drugs\u2014may be desirable. Roche stated that continuing to use  the ASP-based payment system for Epogen could have negative  downstream effects on a fully bundled ESRD payment system, as any price  increases prior to bundling would be captured in the dollar amounts  allocated for anemia management drugs included in the bundle. Similarly,  KCC stated that an alternative payment system should be explored prior to  bundling. KCC also stated that, as long as there is no viable clinical  alternative to Epogen, bundling by itself would not provide for clinical  flexibility, nor would bundling alone ensure drug price stability. KCC  suggested that a transitional system could involve paying for drugs at ASP  and transferring the rate\u2019s current 6 percent add-on to the composite rate.  In general, both RPA and NRAA viewed the ASP-based payment method  for ESRD drugs favorably. RPA specifically referred to the recent  legislative and regulatory actions, including the move to an ASP-based  rate, as \u201cresponsible,\u201d because payments for separately billable drugs were  lowered while the composite rate was increased.", "Our dis separately billable drugs in general and on Epogen in particular because of  its market domination and the high Medicare expenditures associated withcussion of the ASP-based payment method focuses on payment for  it. We agree that the introduction of a competitor product may not res in immediate price reductions, but note that, in principle, competition tends to lower prices over time. Although we acknowledge that there m be a better way to pay for separately billable drugs than ASP+6 percent,  our focus is on the need to mitigate the incentives that can undermine the  efficient use of resources in ESRD care. Any transitional system that  allows separate billing for individual drugs perpetuates the incentive to  maximize revenues through utilization of these drugs. We agree that  bundling by itself cannot solve problems resulting from the lack of pri competition. However, as noted in our draft report, if price competition  w treatment costs for providers and\u2014after adjustments to the bundle for  these lower costs\u2014could result in savings for Medicare.  ere introduced under a bundled payment system, it could result in lower  Finally, representatives from four of the groups expressed concerns about  implementation challenges associated with a payment bundle. Consistent  with CMS\u2019s position and the position of experts cited in our draft report, Amgen and KCC emphasized the importance of appropriate case-mix  adjustment in a bundled payment system. KCC underscored the  considerable variation in patients\u2019 need for Epogen and the role of the  case-mix adjuster to ensure adequate compensation for providers treating patients needing unusually high levels of the drug. RPA, NRAA, and KCC  were concerned that bundling could limit innovation in the ESRD  or that physicians would be reluctant to use any new ESRD drugs that  facilities would find to costly to cover within the payment bundle.  Consistent with this concern, NRAA noted that the payment bund methodology should have a mechanism to ensure the appropriate  incorporation of new technologies and treatment protocols.", "We agree that an appropriate case-mix adjuster is important to a bundled  payment system and noted in the draft report that adjusting for diffe in patients\u2019 needs was a key point made by interested parties we  contacted. We acknowledge that if the payment bundle does not accou for patient differences, facilities that treat a disproportionate share of  costly patients would be financially disadvantaged. We note that CMS has  done extensive research on case-mix adjustment in a fully bundled ESRD these  payment system and believe that any new system will benefit from efforts.
