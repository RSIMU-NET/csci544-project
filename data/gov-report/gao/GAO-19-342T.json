For example, current projections indicate that by 2034, the Old-Age and Survivors trust fund for Social Security's retirement program\u2014the first pillar\u2014will only be sufficient to pay 77 percent of scheduled benefits, due in part to the aging of the population (see figure). Other federal government retirement-related programs also face financial uncertainty. For example, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures the pension benefits of most private sector defined benefit plans, estimates a greater than 90 percent chance the multiemployer program will be insolvent by 2025. Meanwhile, employer-sponsored plans\u2014the second pillar\u2014have experienced a shift from traditional defined benefit (DB) plans that generally provide set monthly payments for life, to defined contribution (DC) account-based plans, like 401(k)s. DC plans provide greater portability of savings that can be better suited to the needs of a more mobile workforce, but also require individuals to assume more responsibility for planning and managing their savings. While DC plans can provide meaningful retirement security for many, especially higher earners, lower earners appear more prone to having little or no savings in their DC accounts. Further, individuals' savings\u2014the third pillar\u2014may be constrained by economic trends such as low real wage growth and growing out-of-pocket health care costs. Combined with increased longevity, these challenges can put individuals at greater risk of outliving their savings and fiscal pressures on government programs will likely grow.", "Congress generally has sought to address retirement-related issues in an incremental fashion. Also, no one agency is responsible for overseeing the U.S. retirement system in its entirety, so there is no obvious federal agency to lead a comprehensive reform effort. It has been nearly 40 years since a federal commission has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the nation's approach to financing retirement. Without a more comprehensive re-evaluation of the challenges across all three pillars of the system, it may be difficult to identify effective, enduring solutions. Unless timely action is taken, many older Americans risk not having sufficient means for a secure and dignified retirement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the 2017 report, GAO recommended that Congress should consider establishing an independent commission to comprehensively examine the US retirement system and make recommendations to clarify key policy goals for the system and improve how the nation promotes retirement security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the state of our nation\u2019s  retirement system.

Enacted in 1935, Social Security provides for the general  welfare of older Americans by, among other things, establishing a system  of federal old-age benefits, including a retirement program. Officially titled  Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), the Social Security retirement  program provides benefits to retired workers, their families, and survivors  of deceased workers. About 51 million retirees and their families  received $798.7 billion in Social Security retirement benefits in 2017,  according to Social Security Administration (SSA), which is responsible  for administering the program.", "About 40 years after the creation of Social Security, landmark legislation  was enacted in 1974 that has played a major role in establishing the  structure for private sector employers\u2019 involvement in sponsoring  retirement plans for their workers: the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA is a complex law administered by  multiple federal agencies including the Department of Labor (DOL), the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury), along with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC),  and has evolved with many significant amendments over the years (see  app. II).", "ERISA was enacted, in part, to address public concerns about the  security of pension benefits, including the prominent failure of a couple of  large, private sector pension plans. The act, as amended, does not  require any employer to establish a retirement plan, but those who do  must meet certain requirements and minimum standards. For example,  ERISA establishes certain requirements for all employer-sponsored  plans, including responsibilities for plan fiduciaries (those who manage  and control plan assets, among others), as well as minimum funding  standards for defined benefit (DB) plans, which traditionally promise to  provide a monthly payment to retirees for life. ERISA also established the PBGC, the government corporation responsible for insuring the pension  benefits of nearly 37 million American workers and retirees who  participate in nearly 24,800 private sector defined benefit plans. Under  ERISA, tax-qualified DB plans (or the employers who sponsor them) may  have to pay insurance premiums to the PBGC, based on the funding level  of their plans. The IRS also administers the Internal Revenue Code (IRC),  which has provisions that affect pensions and retirement savings.", "While SSA administers the Social Security program, and the DOL, PBGC,  and IRS each are generally responsible for administering aspects of  ERISA, several other agencies also have important roles in various parts  of the retirement system. For example, the Department of Health and  Human Services oversees the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS), which administers the major health care programs that  provide coverage for retirees, as well as the Administration on Aging,  which encourages and assists state grantees that provide services for  older adults.", "In addition, agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the  Department of Housing and Urban Development oversee food and  housing programs for older adults. Other agencies also play a role in  providing various services and supports for older adults. For example, the  Department of Transportation administers a program that improves  access and alternatives to public transportation for seniors and individuals  with disabilities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as part of its  mandate to provide financial literacy education, helps consumers  navigate financial choices related to retirement. The Federal Trade  Commission can have consumer protection and investor oversight roles  and responsibilities related to individuals borrowing against their  pensions. In addition, these federal agencies and others work together to  help combat elder financial exploitation, which experts have described as  an epidemic with society-wide repercussions. Citing our prior work on this  topic, in October 2017, Congress enacted the Elder Abuse Prevention  and Prosecution Act, calling on the Department of Justice to work with  other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to improve data  collection and provide technical assistance focused on combatting elder  abuse.", "The need for government services and support for older adults in  retirement will continue to grow as the proportion of older adults in the  United States continues to rise significantly in the future. In 1970, those  age 65 and over accounted for about 10 percent of the population, but by  2060, they are expected to account for about 23 percent (see fig. 1).

In addition, multiple  federal agencies help fund a broad array of home and community-based  services for older adults. As the number of older adults needing  assistance continues to grow, the pressure to increase federal funding for  these services is likely to increase.", "As the foundation of retirement security in the United States, Social  Security\u2019s retirement program, financed primarily by payroll taxes, helps  reduce poverty among beneficiaries, many of whom rely on Social  Security for the majority of their income once they retire. Our analysis of  data from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer  Finances (SCF) showed that in 2016, among households age 65 and  over, the bottom 20 percent, ranked by income, relied on Social Security  retirement benefits for 81 percent of their income, on average.", "But Social Security is facing financial difficulties that, if not addressed, will  affect its long-term stability. During the many years that the revenue for  Social Security\u2019s retirement program exceeded costs, the program built  up reserves in the trust fund. However, since 2010, Social Security has  been paying out more in benefits than it received and has relied on  interest income to help cover expenses. For 2018, the cost of the  program was expected to exceed total income by $2 billion and, as a  result, asset reserves were expected to decline. If no changes are made,  current projections indicate that by 2034, the retirement program trust  fund will only be sufficient to pay 77 percent of scheduled benefits.", "The underlying cause of Social Security\u2019s financial difficulties is the aging  population, driven by lower fertility rates and increased life expectancy,  and accelerated by the ongoing retirement of the baby boom generation.  The first baby boomers began receiving Social Security retirement  benefits in 2008, and growing numbers will become eligible for Social  Security benefits in coming years. Our analysis indicates that the number  of baby boomers turning 65 is projected to increase from an average of  about 10,200 per day in 2018 to more than 11,000 per day in 2029 (see  fig. 3).", "As with the Social Security retirement program, reserves had also built up  over time in the trust fund for Social Security\u2019s disability program, but in  2005, the program began paying out more than it was taking in. To avoid  benefit reductions, which were expected to begin in 2016, Congress  passed a law in late 2015 that temporarily reallocated some payroll tax  revenue from the retirement trust fund to the disability trust fund. Even  with this added boost, if no further changes are made, reductions in  disability benefits are projected to be needed beginning in 2032,  according to SSA\u2019s most recent report.", "For both the Social Security retirement and disability programs combined,  the number of workers contributing to Social Security for each aged,  disabled, dependent, or surviving beneficiary is declining, due to the  aging population and other factors. While there are currently 2.8 workers  contributing to Social Security per beneficiary, this ratio is expected to  decline to 2.2 by 2035, and to 2.0 by 2095 (see fig. 4).", "It is difficult to predict exactly what would occur if either Social Security\u2019s  retirement or disability programs were to become insolvent because the  Social Security Act does not provide for any procedure for paying less  than full benefits.

For example, over the years,  Congress has made changes to Medicare so that more people have  become eligible, even if under age 65. Also, Congress has added two  more parts to Medicare: one part allowing insurance under private plans  approved by Medicare (Medicare Advantage), and another part  providing prescription drug coverage. As of 2017, over 58 million people  were enrolled in one or more parts under Medicare. Projections indicate  that in the coming decade, as more members of the baby-boom  generation become eligible for benefits, the number of Medicare  beneficiaries will rise to 75 million in 2027. Similar to the challenges  facing Social Security, spending for Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)  is projected to outpace revenue over time, and the trust fund for  Medicare Part A is projected to be unable to pay full benefits beginning in  2026. At that time, the Hospital Insurance trust fund will only be sufficient  to pay 91 percent of hospital-related Medicare spending.", "Medicaid, which provides health care coverage and financing for millions  of low-income individuals, including those age 65 or older, also faces  financial challenges. Medicaid is the nation\u2019s primary payer for long-term  services and supports, and the elderly\u2014along with those with  disabilities\u2014are among the highest cost Medicaid beneficiaries. The  federal government and states share in the financing of the Medicaid  program, with the federal government matching most state expenditures  for Medicaid services using a statutory formula.

Over the next 7 years, Medicaid expenditures are expected to increase  significantly, reaching just over $1 trillion in 2026.", "The PBGC insures the pension benefits of most private sector DB plans  through one of its two programs: the Single-Employer Insurance Program  and the Multiemployer Insurance Program. The single-employer program  is the larger of the two programs.

Concerns about PBGC\u2019s financial future have kept both programs on  GAO\u2019s high-risk list. As long as PBGC\u2019s long-term financial stability  remains uncertain, the retirement benefits of millions of U.S. workers and  retirees are at risk of greater reductions should their benefit plans be  terminated below PBGC\u2019s current guaranteed benefit levels.", "In contrast to Social Security, PBGC is not funded by tax revenues, but by  the premiums paid by plans or their sponsors, the assets acquired from  terminated plans, and investment returns on these funds. The primary  drivers of the government\u2019s fiscal exposure related to PBGC\u2019s deficit are  the collective financial risk of the many underfunded pension plans  insured by PBGC and the long-term decline in the number of participants  covered by traditional DB plans. Since 1985, there has been a 78 percent  decline in the number of plans insured by PBGC and more than 13 million  fewer workers actively participating in PBGC-insured plans. There has  also been a recent trend of single-employer plan sponsors transferring  the liability for some of their participants to insurance companies via  group annuity \u201cbuy-outs,\u201d further reducing the number of participants in  PBGC-covered plans. As a result of these trends, even though PBGC  premium rates have increased significantly in recent years, PBGC\u2019s  premium base has been eroding over time as fewer sponsors are paying  premiums for fewer participants.", "In addition, more recently, PBGC\u2019s net accumulated financial deficit has  escalated dramatically due to the critical and declining status of a number  of large multiemployer pension plans. As we previously reported,  PBGC\u2019s multiemployer plan is projected to become insolvent in  approximately 6 years, and if that happens, participants in the insolvent  multiemployer plans who rely on PBGC guarantees will receive only a  small fraction of current statutory guarantees.

However, not everyone has access  to employer-sponsored plans, and among those who do, certain  provisions and requirements of the plans can make it difficult for  individuals to accumulate savings over time.", "Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that about one-third of private  sector workers in the United States did not have access to an employer- sponsored retirement plan in 2016, and about two-thirds did. Of those  with access, the vast majority (about 76 percent) participated in the plan,  either because they were automatically enrolled by the plan sponsor or  they chose to participate.", "Although individuals without access to an employer-sponsored plan can  save for retirement on their own, having access to an employer- sponsored retirement plan makes it easier to save, and more likely that  an individual will have another source of income in retirement beyond  Social Security. Our prior work found that employees working for smaller  firms and in certain industries, such as leisure and hospitality, are  significantly less likely to have access to an employer-sponsored plan  compared with those working in larger firms and in certain other  industries, such as information services. Also, we found that low-income  workers are much less likely than high-income workers to have access to  an employer-sponsored plan.", "Among those individuals who have access to employer-sponsored plans  in the private sector, the structure of plans has changed over time, with a  shift from traditional DB pension plans to defined contribution (DC) plans,  such as 401(k)s, as the primary type of retirement plan (see fig. 5). DB  plans are traditional retirement plans that generally promise to provide a  benefit for the life of the participant, based on a formula specified in the  plan that typically takes into account factors such as an employee\u2019s  salary, years of service, and age at retirement. DC plans are employer- sponsored account-based retirement plans, such as a 401(k) plan, that  allow individuals to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement savings in an  individual account based on employee and/or employer contributions, and  the investment returns (gains and losses) earned on the account. The  amount of assets held in individual retirement accounts (IRA) also has  increased significantly. Most of the assets in IRAs are funded by assets  rolled over from DC plans, and sometimes DB plans, when individuals  change jobs or retire.", "With DB plans, participants can accumulate retirement savings simply by  continuing to work for the employer offering the plan, and the employer is  responsible for ensuring that the amount in the plan is sufficient to pay  promised benefits at retirement. However, even when DB plans were  more prevalent, many workers did not have access, and those with  access to DB plans could still face challenges under certain  circumstances. For example, when DB plan participants change  employers, their accrued benefits are less portable than accrued savings  in a DC plan. If the change in employers takes place before they have  met vesting requirements, DB plan participants can lose all the benefits  accumulated from employer contributions to that point, which in the  private sector, generally means everything. Also, for DB plans that base  benefits on final average salary, benefit accruals are significantly  \u201cbackloaded.\u201d As a result, if a DB plan participant changes employers  mid-career, it could result in missing out on the time when the biggest  benefit accruals would have occurred. In addition, when entering  retirement, although those with DB plans can generally rely on receiving a  set monthly benefit for life, they may still face challenges. For example,  participants in certain financially troubled plans\u2014such as those in the  multiemployer plans discussed earlier\u2014could see their benefits being  suspended or cut. In addition, if a DB plan participant is offered and  accepts a lump-sum payment in place of a lifetime annuity, the participant  may face challenges similar to those with DC accounts in terms of  managing the spend down of their retirement savings.", "With DC plans, responsibility for planning and managing retirement  savings is shifted from employers to employees. Participants in DC plans  are often required to make complex financial decisions\u2014decisions that  generally require financial literacy and that could have significant  consequences for their financial security throughout retirement. For  example, workers with DC plans have to decide whether to participate in  the plan, how much to contribute to their accounts and how to manage  their investments to strike the right balance between risk and returns.", "One way DC plan enrollment and contribution levels can be encouraged  is by putting automatic mechanisms in place. For example, DC plan  sponsors can encourage participation in the plan by adopting auto- enrollment, whereby eligible workers are enrolled into a plan  automatically, unless they choose to opt out. DC plan sponsors can also  encourage increases in contribution rates by adopting auto-escalation,  whereby the employee\u2019s contributions are automatically increased to a  predetermined level on a set schedule, unless they choose to opt out.", "Participants in DC plans also have to decide whether to borrow from their  accounts if other needs arise, or cash out their accounts when they  change jobs. When leaving an employer, those with DC accounts may be  allowed to transfer their accumulated balances into a new employer plan  or an individual retirement account (IRA), but they may also be tempted to  cash out their accounts, even though they may face associated tax  consequences. Similarly, when entering retirement, those with DC  accounts may decide to transfer the account balance into an IRA, or they  may decide to receive the funds in a lump-sum payment. While some DC  plans also offer monthly payments through an annuity, most do not  provide lifetime income options or other options that can help participants  draw down their retirement funds in a systematic way.", "Findings from the most recent SCF indicate that an individual\u2019s ability to  accumulate retirement savings depends on the individual\u2019s income level.  In addition, the disparities in average account balances by income level  have increased markedly over time (see fig. 6). For example, according to  SCF data, households in the top 10 percent of income level appeared to  be substantially better prepared for retirement than most others, with an  average account balance of more than $720,000 in 2016. In contrast,  households with below average income, in the second quintile, had an  average account balance of about $47,000. Among lower-income  households, our prior work suggests that cashing out accounts when  changing jobs may be a significant drain on retirement savings, along with  unexpected events that may also cause them to withdraw funds from their  accounts prior to retirement.", "Retirement experts have posited a variety of reasons for employers\u2019 shift  to DC plans. One oft-cited reason is that the structure of DC plans gives  employers better control over how much they spend on wages and  benefits packages. With DC plans, employers may choose whether to  make contributions to participants\u2019 individual accounts; in contrast, DB  plans promise a certain future monthly benefit to employees in retirement,  and the employer must bear the risk of making adequate contributions to  the plan to make good on that promise. Another reason retirement  experts cite for the shift to DC plans was the introduction of 401(k)  accounts in the Internal Revenue Code in 1978, which they credit with  fostering the adoption of account-based plans by sanctioning the use of  salary deferrals as a source of contributions. Some retirement experts  have also suggested that employees\u2019 preferences and demands have  changed over time, making DC plans more feasible and, in some  respects, more appealing. For example, some analysts have noted that  the portability of an account-based plan can be better suited to meet the  needs of a more mobile workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pillar Three: Individuals\u2019 Savings and Other Resources", "paragraphs": ["The third pillar of the retirement savings system\u2014individuals\u2019 personal  savings\u2014is the remaining important source of retirement income, and it  also faces certain risks and challenges. Personal savings can include a  variety of assets, such as amounts saved from income or wages;  contributions to accounts outside of a retirement plan; non-retirement  financial wealth that is inherited or accumulated over time; and equity  from tangible assets such as a home. These savings are expected to  augment any income from the first two pillars: Social Security and  employer-sponsored retirement plans.", "Over the past several decades, however, the personal saving rate\u2014which  is calculated as the proportion of disposable income that households  save\u2014has trended steeply downward, from a high of 14.2 percent in  1975, to a low of 3.1 percent in 2005, before recovering somewhat to 6.8  percent in 2018 (see fig. 7).", "While the specific implications of a historically low national saving rate on  any current or future retiree are less clear, the decline in the U.S.  personal savings rate over time is concerning and could have implications  for retirement security, particularly when coupled with the recent trend of  low wage growth. After accounting for inflation, average wages remain  near the levels they were in the 1970s for most individuals (see fig. 8),  adding to the difficulty of increasing their level of saving.", "In addition, many households have accumulated little wealth. SCF data  show that among households in which the head of the household was  working, the average value of all financial assets, excluding savings in  retirement accounts, was $70,700 in 2016. For households in which the  head was retired, this average was $89,700.", "For those who become home owners and build up equity in a home, this  equity can serve as an important asset, providing a potential income  source in retirement either by selling the home or obtaining a reverse  mortgage. However, increased household debt levels may affect the  amount of income available from this source, as well as from other  assets. Data on the make-up of debt indicate that home ownership has  been declining, while education debt has been rising, especially since  2013.", "Another challenge with implications for individuals\u2019 ability to accumulate  personal savings is that economy-wide, aggregate health care  expenditures are projected to continue to grow as a percentage of the  overall economy, and individuals have to contend with rising health care  costs as they strive to save for retirement. CMS projections estimate that  the annual growth rate of out-of-pocket health care spending for the U.S.  population, per capita, will increase from 3.0 percent in 2018 to about 3.8  percent by 2026. While these costs are projected to rise for the population  as a whole, individuals age 65 and over face the highest out-of-pocket  health-related expenses. Further, health care expenses can be larger  relative to other expenses for many retirees and hard to predict, making  the amount of income retirees need to plan to spend on health care  difficult to determine.", "Simultaneously, trends in longer life expectancy have the potential to  increase economic vulnerability for retirees. Specifically, life expectancy  for those age 65 or older has increased significantly over the past century  and is projected to continue to increase. For example, a man turning 65 in  2030 is expected to live to age 85.0, on average, an additional 5.3 years  compared to a man who turned 65 in 1980, who was only expected to live  to age 79.7, on average. A woman turning 65 in 2030 is expected to live  to age 87.2, on average, an additional 3.5 years compared to a woman  who turned 65 in 1980, who was only expected to live to age 83.8, on  average.", "Moreover, these life expectancies are averages, with some individuals  living well beyond their life expectancy. As a result, people must now  prepare for this greater longevity risk\u2014that is, the risk that they will spend  more years in retirement and potentially outlive their savings.

As highlighted in appendix II, at least 25  laws pertaining to retirement have been enacted since ERISA. Some  laws\u2014such as the Social Security Amendments of 1983 and the Pension  Protection Act of 2006\u2014made large changes to the retirement system.  Other laws were more targeted. For example in 1984, Congress amended  ERISA to address concerns that women were not receiving their share of  private pension benefits by, among other things, permitting certain breaks  in service without loss of pension credits, and changing treatment of  pension benefits for widowed and divorced spouses. Similarly, in 1996,  Congress created a simplified retirement savings vehicle for employers  with 100 or fewer employees to help address concerns that smaller  employers were not sponsoring plans.", "The number of agencies that play roles in the current retirement system  has also contributed to the incremental approach to addressing concerns,  with no single federal agency being responsible for taking a broad view of  the system as a whole. As described earlier, there are at least 10  agencies that have a role in overseeing some part of the system, or that  are involved in providing supports and services to older Americans. In  addition to DOL, IRS, and PBGC, which are the agencies generally  responsible for administering ERISA, SSA administers the Social Security  program; and the Department of Health and Human Services oversees  CMS, which administers the health care programs for retirees. In addition,  various other agencies play a role in providing a range of services and  supports to assist older adults through retirement.", "Having multiple agencies involved in the system has also contributed to a  complex web of programs and requirements. For example, our prior work  identified more than 130 reports and disclosures stemming from  provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. Although each plan  sponsor is required to submit only certain of these reports and  disclosures, determining which ones can be challenging, and we found  that the agencies\u2019 online resources to aid plan sponsors with this task  were neither comprehensive nor up to date.

The 1979 President\u2019s Commission  on Pension Policy conducted a broad study of retirement-related issues  and made a series of over-arching recommendations, such as creation of  a minimum universal pension system that would provide a portable  benefit for all workers that would be a supplement to Social Security.  Other recommendations included federal protections for participants in  state and local government plans, more consistent tax treatment of  pension plans and retirement savings vehicles, provisions to strengthen  Social Security, as well as proposals regarding employment of older  workers and disability programs. However, many of the commission\u2019s  recommendations were not implemented.", "The issues identified nearly 40 years ago by the 1979 commission\u2019s  comprehensive re-evaluation of the U.S. retirement system continue to be  issues facing the nation today. In fact, these issues have only become  more complex and more urgent due to fundamental changes that have  occurred since 1979\u2014especially the growing fiscal exposure to the  federal government and the shift from DB to DC plans, with its associated  increase in risks and responsibilities for individual workers. Taken  together, these changes may make it harder for retirees to achieve  financial security in retirement, especially for those without access to  employer-sponsored plans and at the lower end of the income scale.", "A panel of 15 retirement experts convened by GAO in November 2016  agreed that there is a need for a new comprehensive evaluation of the  U.S. retirement system. They noted weaknesses in the current system\u2019s  ability to help ensure that all individuals can provide for a secure  retirement. They also discussed the burden that the current system\u2019s  complexity places on individuals, employers, and federal government.  Although there was agreement among many panelists that a more  comprehensive approach would be needed to provide a secure retirement  for future retirees, opinions varied on the types of solutions needed. For  example, some panelists suggested that a new government-sponsored  savings vehicle should be created, while others supported modifying the  existing employer-sponsored system to make any needed changes.", "In addition, several panelists commented on how the current system can  be overly complex and confusing for employers, especially small  employers. They discussed how the current private sector system poses  financial and litigation risk for employers, especially with respect to  investment decisions, fiduciary duty, and fees. For example, one panelist  suggested that DC plan sponsors may welcome the federal government  providing more guidance on the types of investments that would be  regarded as prudent and safe as a way to reduce their litigation risk.", "Panelists also noted that the experiences of other countries can provide  useful insights for ways to improve U.S. retirement programs and policies.  For example, some panelists described the approach being taken by the  United Kingdom (UK) as a potential model for expanding access to  retirement savings plans. In the UK model, universal access for workers  was implemented by mandating that all employers automatically enroll  employees in either their own or the government-sponsored retirement  savings plan, the National Employment Savings Trust.", "In our 2017 report, we suggested five policy goals for a reformed U.S.  retirement system as a starting point for discussion: (1) promoting  universal access to a retirement savings vehicle, (2) ensuring greater  retirement income adequacy, (3) improving options for the spend down  phase of retirement, (4) reducing complexity and risk for both participants  and plan sponsors, and (5) stabilizing fiscal exposure to the federal  government (see table 1 for more detail on these goals).", "Reforming the nation\u2019s retirement system to create a system that meets  all of these goals, or others identified by the Congress, will require a  careful and deliberative approach. For example, some type of consensus  about the goals would need to be established as a first step. Broad  questions are likely to be raised about how each of the goals should be  achieved. The examination of relevant issues by past federal  commissions, the discussions at our November 2016 panel, as well as  what we can learn from the experiences of other countries, further  illustrate how complex any reform effort is likely to be. Also, we recognize  that some of these goals may compete with each other\u2014in particular,  ensuring greater retirement security and minimizing fiscal exposure to the  federal government. Therefore, a balanced approach will be required,  which can only result from a more holistic examination of the issues by  those representing a broad range of perspectives.", "As a result, we recommended that Congress consider establishing an  independent commission to comprehensively examine the U.S. retirement  system and make recommendations to clarify key policy goals for the  system and improve the nation\u2019s approach to promoting more stable  retirement security. We suggested that such a commission include  representatives from government agencies, employers, the financial  services industry, unions, participant advocates, and researchers, among  others, to help inform policymakers on changes needed to improve the  current U.S. retirement system.", "Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Casey, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
