Following the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act). The act contained over 300 provisions that are intended to enhance national preparedness, emergency response and recovery, and the management of select disaster programs. In October 2012, another catastrophic hurricane\u2014Hurricane Sandy\u2014caused $65 billion in damage and once again tested the nation's preparedness and emergency response and recovery functions.", "GAO has issued multiple reports that discuss a wide variety of emergency management issues reflecting the federal government and FEMA's efforts to implement provisions of the Post-Katrina Act and address various aspects of emergency management.", "This statement discusses GAO's work on the progress FEMA has made and challenges that it still faces in three areas: (1) national preparedness, (2) disaster response and recovery, and (3) selected FEMA management areas.

Assessing capabilities is critical to ensure that they will be available when needed in emergencies. For example, GAO found in December 2014 that federal departments have identified emergency response capability gaps through national-level exercises and real-world incidents, but the status of agency actions to address these gaps is not collected by or reported to Department of Homeland Security or FEMA. GAO recommended that FEMA\u2014in collaboration with other federal agencies\u2014regularly report on the status of corrective actions. FEMA agreed with GAO's recommendation and is taking action to address it but has not established a timeframe for completion.", "GAO's recent work on disaster response and recovery programs also identified progress and challenges in a number of areas. From fiscal years 2004 through 2013, FEMA obligated over $95 billion in federal disaster assistance for 650 major disasters declared during this timeframe. With the growing cost of disasters it is vital for the federal government to address its fiscal exposure and ensure that response and recovery programs are as efficient and effective as possible. For example, in December 2014, GAO found that FEMA demonstrated progress controlling for potentially fraudulent payments to individuals during Hurricane Sandy as compared to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, GAO reported continued challenges, including weaknesses in validation of Social Security numbers and made recommendations to strengthen these processes. Further, in July 2015, GAO reported that states and localities affected by Hurricane Sandy were able to effectively leverage federal programs to enhance resilience during their recovery. However, states experienced continued challenges in implementing certain FEMA recovery programs, such as Public Assistance. GAO also found that there was no comprehensive, strategic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and implementing investments for disaster resilience. GAO made recommendations to address these continued challenges and FEMA is taking a range of actions to address them.", "FEMA has also taken steps to strengthen a number of its management areas, but GAO reported that additional progress is needed in several areas. Specifically, In December 2014, GAO found that FEMA had taken steps to control its administrative costs\u2014the costs of providing and managing disaster assistance\u2014by issuing guidelines and reduction targets. However, GAO reported that FEMA does not require the targets to be met and continued to face challenges tracking the costs. Among other things, GAO recommended that FEMA develop an integrated plan to better control and reduce its administrative costs for major disasters. Further, in July 2015 GAO reported that FEMA had taken action to address various long-standing workforce management challenges, but faced multiple challenges, including implementing and managing its temporary workforces and completing strategic workforce planning efforts. FEMA agreed with GAO's recommendations and is taking action to address them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made numerous recommendations in its prior reports to FEMA designed to address the challenges discussed in this statement.

We have  reported on a broad range of issues and currently have ongoing work for  this committee related to FEMA\u2019s disaster programs and operations. The  anniversaries of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy provide a valuable  opportunity to assess FEMA\u2019s progress and challenges in national  disaster preparedness and response and recovery efforts, as well as its  management.", "Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the largest, most destructive natural  disaster in our nation\u2019s history. FEMA estimated that Hurricane Katrina  caused an estimated $108 billion in damages. Following the federal  response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Congress passed the Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act). The act  enhanced FEMA\u2019s responsibilities and its autonomy within DHS and  contained over 300 provisions that call for DHS or FEMA action to  implement requirements or exercise authorities \u2013 or to be prepared to do  so under the appropriate condition. After the Post-Katrina Act was  enacted, we conducted reviews and issued multiple reports that  discussed a wide variety of these emergency management issues  reflecting the federal government and FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement  provisions of the Post-Katrina act and improve national disaster  preparedness, and response and recovery. A selection of our related  reports is attached to my statement. Hurricane Sandy struck the United  States in October 2012, causing an estimated $65 billion in damages,  once again testing FEMA and the federal government\u2019s ability to respond  to catastrophic disasters.", "The initial response to a disaster is the job of local government\u2019s  emergency services with help from nearby municipalities, the state and  volunteer agencies. In a catastrophic disaster, if the governor requests,  federal resources can be mobilized through FEMA for search and rescue,  electrical power, food, water, shelter and other basic human needs. The  long-term recovery phase of disaster places the most severe financial  strain on local or state government and damage to public facilities and  infrastructure, often not insured, can overwhelm even a large city. We  have recognized the rise in the number\u2014and the increase in severity\u2014of  disasters as a key source of federal fiscal exposure. Similarly, managing  fiscal exposure due to climate change has been on our high risk list since  2013, in part, because of concerns about the increasing costs of disaster  response and recovery efforts.", "My testimony today discusses progress FEMA has made and challenges  that FEMA faces in three areas: 1) national preparedness, 2) disaster  response and recovery, and 3) selected FEMA management areas.", "This statement is based on our prior work and focuses on reports issued  from September 2012 through September 2015.

For example, all 10 ESF coordinators identified at least one  nonemergency activity through which they coordinate with their ESFs\u2019  primary and support agencies. Further, all 10 ESF coordinators identified  at least one planning document\u2014in addition to the information contained  in the NRF\u2019s ESF annexes\u2014that they had developed for their ESFs to  further define the roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures for their  ESFs\u2019 coordination and execution.", "We found, however, that the ESF Leadership Group and FEMA, as the  group\u2019s chair, had not worked with other federal departments to issue  supplemental guidance detailing expectations for the minimum standards  for activities and product deliverables necessary to demonstrate ESF  preparedness. In the absence of such guidance, we found that ESF  coordinators are inconsistently carrying out their emergency response  preparedness activities. We also found that, while federal departments  have identified emergency response capability gaps through national- level exercises, real-world incidents, such as Hurricane Sandy and other  assessments, the status of federal interagency implementation of these  actions is not comprehensively collected by or reported to DHS or FEMA  and, as a result, DHS\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s ability to assess and report on the  nation\u2019s overall preparedness is hampered. Further, we found that  FEMA\u2019s plan to lead interagency actions to identify and address capability  gaps in the nation\u2019s preparedness to respond to improvised nuclear  device (IND) attacks did not contain detailed program management  information\u2014such as specific timeframes, milestones, and estimated  resources required to close any given capability gap\u2014which is needed to  better enable ongoing management oversight of gap closure efforts.", "In our December 2014 report, we recommended that FEMA\u2014in  collaboration with other federal agencies\u2014(1) issue supplemental  guidance to ESF coordinators detailing minimum standards for activities  and product deliverables necessary to demonstrate ESF preparedness,  develop and (2) issue detailed program management information to better  enable management oversight of the DHS IND Strategy\u2019s recommended  actions, and (3) regularly report on the status of corrective actions  identified through prior national-level exercises and real-world disasters.  DHS concurred with our recommendations and FEMA has taken actions  in response. For example, in June 2015, FEMA issued guidance for ESF  coordinators that details minimum standards for activities and product  deliverables necessary to demonstrate ESF preparedness. The ESF  Leadership Group established a set of preparedness performance metrics  to guide ESF coordination, planning, and capabilities assessment efforts.  The ESF Leadership Group-generated metrics set standardized  performance targets and preparedness actions across the ESFs.  Collectively, the metrics and reporting of these metrics should provide an  opportunity to better measure preparedness efforts by assessing if ESF  coordination and planning is sufficient, and whether required ESF  capabilities are available for disaster response. In addition, FEMA  developed a detailed program plan to provide a quantitative analysis of  current work and addressing existing capability gaps linked to a project  management tracking system to identify specific dates for past, present  and upcoming milestones for its IND Program. We believe that FEMA\u2019s  actions in these areas have fully met the intent of these two  recommendations. FEMA officials also collected information on the status  of National Level Exercise Corrective Actions from 2007-2014, an  important step to respond to our other recommendation and we are  continuing to monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts in this area, however it has not  provided a timeframe for its completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disaster Logistics", "paragraphs": ["We recently reported in September 2015 on FEMA\u2019s progress in working  with its federal partners to implement the National Response Framework  (NRF) Emergency Support Function #7 (ESF 7) Logistics Annex. We  found that FEMA\u2019s efforts reflect leading practices for interagency  collaboration and enhance ESF 7 preparedness. For example, FEMA\u2019s  Logistics Management Directorate (LMD) has facilitated meetings and  established interagency agreements with ESF 7 partners such as the  Department of Defense and the General Services Administration, and  identified needed quantities of disaster response commodities, such as  food, water, and blankets. Additionally, FEMA tracks the percentage of  disaster response commodities delivered by agreed-upon dates, and  available through FEMA and its ESF 7 partners. Regarding FEMA\u2019s  support of its state and local stakeholders, we found that FEMA could  strengthen the implementation of its Logistics Capability Assessment Tool  (LCAT). For example, FEMA\u2014through LMD and its regional offices\u2014has  made progress in offering training and exercises for state and local  stakeholders, developing the LCAT, and establishing an implementation  program to help state and local stakeholders use the tool to determine  their readiness to respond to, disasters. However, we found that, while  feedback from states that have used the LCAT has generally been  positive, implementation of the program by FEMA\u2019s regional offices has  been inconsistent; 3 of 10 regional offices no longer promote or support  LCAT assessments. Further, LMD did not identify staff resources needed  to implement the program, and did not develop program goals,  milestones, or measures to assess the effectiveness of implementation  efforts.", "In our September 2015 report, we recommended that FEMA identify the  LMD and regional resources needed to implement the LCAT, and  establish and use goals, milestones and performance measures to report  on the LCAT program implementation. DHS concurred with the  recommendations and is taking actions to address them. For example,  FEMA officials said they intend to work closely with regional staff to  identify resources and develop a plan to monitor LCAT performance.", "We also reported on the status of FEMA\u2019s development of the Logistics  Supply Chain Management System (LSCMS) as part of a broader look at  22 acquisition programs at DHS, in April 2015. We reported that,  according to FEMA officials, LSCMS can identify when a shipment leaves  a warehouse and the location of a shipment after it reaches a FEMA  staging area near a disaster location. At the time of our review, LSCMS  could not track partner organizations\u2019 shipments in route to a FEMA  staging area, and lacked automated interfaces with its partners\u2019  information systems. We also reported that DHS leadership had not yet  approved a baseline establishing the program\u2019s cost, schedule, and  performance parameters. According to FEMA officials, FEMA\u2019s partners  and vendors can now receive orders directly from LSCMS and manually  input their shipment data directly into a vendor portal, providing FEMA  with the ability to track orders and shipments from time and date of  shipment to the estimated time of arrival, but not the in-transit real-time  location of shipments. They also said that the program baseline was still  under consideration by DHS leadership at the time of our review. In  addition, DHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on  LSCMS in September 2014. The DHS OIG made 11 recommendations  designed to address operational deficiencies that FEMA concurred with,  such as identifying resources to ensure effective program management  and developing a training program for staff. As of July 2015, FEMA  officials report that 5 of the OIG\u2019s recommendations have been  implemented, and the agency is taking steps to address the remaining 6  recommendations.", "In addition to these completed reviews of preparedness efforts, we  currently have work underway for this committee assessing how FEMA\u2019s  regional coordination efforts support national preparedness.

We found that  FEMA primarily relied on a single criterion, the per capita damage  indicator, to determine whether to recommend to the President that a  jurisdiction receive Public Assistance (PA) funding. However, because  FEMA\u2019s current per capita indicator at the time of our report, set at $1 in  1986, did not reflect the rise in (1) per capita personal income since it was  created in 1986 or (2) inflation from 1986 to 1999, the indicator was  artificially low. Further, the per capita indicator did not accurately reflect  a jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond to or recover from a disaster without  federal assistance. We identified other measures of fiscal capacity, such  as total taxable resources, that could be more useful in determining a  jurisdiction\u2019s ability to pay for damages to public structures. We also  reported that FEMA can recommend increasing the usual proportion (75  percent) of costs the federal government pays (federal share) for PA (to  90 percent) when costs get to a certain level. However, FEMA had no  specific criteria for assessing requests to raise the federal share for  emergency work to 100 percent, but relied on its professional judgment.", "In our September 2012 report, we recommended, among other things,  that FEMA develop a methodology to more accurately assess a  jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond to and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance, develop criteria for 100 percent cost adjustments, and  implement goals for and monitor administrative costs. FEMA concurred  with the first two recommendations, but partially concurred with the third,  saying it would conduct a review before taking additional action. Since  that time, FEMA has submitted a report to Congress outlining various  options that the agency could take to assess a jurisdiction\u2019s capability to  respond to and recover from a disaster. We met with FEMA in April 2015  to discuss its report to Congress. FEMA officials told us that the agency  would need to undertake the rulemaking process to implement a new  methodology that provides a more comprehensive assessment of a  jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance. They said that they identified three potential options,  which taken individually or in some combination would implement our  recommendation by (1) adjusting the PA per capita indicator to better  reflect current national and state specific economic conditions; (2)  developing an improved methodology for considering factors in addition to  the PA per capita indicator; or (3) implementing a state-specific deductible  for states to qualify for PA. Although FEMA initially concurred with our  recommendation to develop criteria for 100 percent cost adjustments, it  has concluded that it will not establish specific criteria or factors to use  when evaluating requests for cost share adjustments. FEMA conducted a  historical review of the circumstances that previously led to these cost  share adjustments, and determined that each circumstance was unique in  nature and could not be used to develop criteria or factors for future  decision making. Based on FEMA\u2019s review and its clarification of the  intent to use cost share adjustments during only rare catastrophic events,  we agreed that their decision could lead to better stewardship of federal  dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disaster Assistance Payments To Individuals", "paragraphs": ["In December 2014, we reported on FEMA\u2019s progress in improving its  ability to detect improper and potentially fraudulent payments.

We reported that as of August 2014, FEMA stated that it had  provided over $1.4 billion in Hurricane Sandy assistance through its  IHP\u2014which provides financial awards for home repairs, rental assistance,  and other needs\u2014to almost 183,000 survivors. We identified $39 million  or 2.7 percent of that total that was at risk of being improper or fraudulent  compared to 10 to 22 percent of similar assistance provided for  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "However in December 2014, we identified continued challenges in the  agency\u2019s response to Hurricane Sandy, including weaknesses in the  agency\u2019s validation of Social Security numbers, among other things.  Although FEMA hired contractors to inspect damaged homes to verify the  identity and residency of applicants and that reported damage was a  result of Hurricane Sandy, we found 2,610 recipients with potentially  invalid identifying information who received $21 million of the $39 million  we calculated as potentially improper or fraudulent. Our analysis included  data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that FEMA does not  use, such as SSA\u2019s most-complete death records. We also found that  FEMA and state governments faced challenges in obtaining the data  necessary to help prevent duplicative payments from overlapping  sources. In addition, FEMA relied on self-reported data from applicants  regarding private home insurance\u2014a factor the agency uses in  determining benefits, as federal law prohibits FEMA from providing  assistance for damage covered by private insurance; however that data  can be unreliable.", "In our December 2014 report, we recommended, among other things, that  FEMA collaborate with SSA to obtain additional data, collect data to  detect duplicative assistance, and implement an approach to verify  whether recipients have private insurance. FEMA concurred with the  report\u2019s five recommendations and has taken actions to address them.  For example, in response to our recommendations, FEMA started  working with SSA to determine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of  incorporating SSA\u2019s identify verification tools and full death file data into  its registration process, and expects to make its determination by the end  of 2015. FEMA indicated that, depending on the determination, one  option would be to enter into a Computer Matching Agreement with SSA.", "FEMA has also approved plans to improve the standardization, quality  and accessibility of data across its own disaster assistance programs,  which includes efforts to enhance data sharing with state and local  partners, that should allow it to more readily identify potentially duplicative  assistance.

State and local officials from all 12 states,  the District of Columbia, and New York City in the Sandy affected-region  reported that they were able to effectively leverage federal programs to  enhance disaster resilience, but also experienced challenges. The  challenges included implementation challenges within PA and HMGP,  limitations on comprehensive risk reduction approaches in a post disaster  environment, and local ability and willingness to participate in mitigation  activities. We found there was no comprehensive, strategic approach to  identifying, prioritizing and implementing investments for disaster  resilience, which increased the risk that the federal government and  nonfederal partners will experience lower returns on investments or lost  opportunities to strengthen key critical infrastructure and lifelines. Most  federal funding for hazard mitigation is available after a disaster and there  are benefits to investing in resilience post disaster. Individuals and  communities affected by a disaster may be more likely to invest their own  resources while recovering. However, we concluded that the emphasis on  the post-disaster environment can create a reactionary and fragmented  approach where disasters determine when and for what purpose the  federal government invests in disaster resilience.", "In our July 2015 report, we recommended that (1) FEMA assess the  challenges state and local officials report and implement corrective  actions as needed and (2) the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group  (MitFLG) establish an investment strategy to identify, prioritize, and  implement federal investments in disaster resilience. DHS agreed with  both recommendations. With respect to the challenges reported by state  and local officials, FEMA officials said it would seek input from federal,  tribal, state, and local stakeholders as part of its efforts to reengineer the  PA program, which it believes will address many of the issues raised in  the report. In addition, DHS said that FEMA, though its leadership role in  the MitFLG would take action to complete an investment strategy by  August 2017.", "We currently have work underway for this committee assessing several of  FEMA\u2019s disaster response and recovery programs.

For example, FEMA issued guidelines  intended to better control its administrative costs in November 2010. In  addition, FEMA recognized that administrative costs have increased and  it has taken steps such as setting a goal in its recent strategic plan to  lower these costs, and creating administrative cost targets. Specifically,  FEMA established a goal in its Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 to reduce its  average annual percentage of administrative costs, as compared with  total program costs, by 5 percentage points by the end of 2018. To  achieve this goal, FEMA officials developed administrative costs goals for  small, medium, and large disasters, and are monitoring performance  against the goals. However, FEMA does not require these targets be met,  and we found that had FEMA met its targets, administrative costs could  have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. We found that  FEMA continued to face challenges in tracking and reducing these costs.  FEMA\u2019s average administrative cost percentages for major disasters  during the 10 fiscal years 2004 to 2013 was double the average during  the 10 fiscal years 1989 to 1998.

FEMA agreed with the report and its  recommendations. As of August 2015, FEMA told us it is developing an  integrated plan to control and reduce administrative costs for major  disaster declarations. According to FEMA officials, their Disaster  Administrative Cost Integrated Project Team has been working over the  past several months to analyze FEMA\u2019s historic administrative costs,  identify cost drivers, document and evaluate the delivery of disaster  assistance, and set an improved framework to standardize the way FEMA  does business.", "FEMA officials previously told us that the plan will describe the steps the  agency plans take to reduce administrative costs, milestones for  accomplishing the reduction, and clear roles and responsibilities,  including the assignment of senior officials/offices responsible for  monitoring and measuring performance. FEMA also continues to assess  the costs versus the benefits of tracking administrative costs by program.  According to FEMA officials, this project requires connecting multiple  disparate data sources. FEMA has identified some, but not all of the data  which needs to be integrated in order to be able to track administrative  costs by program area. FEMA is also evaluating its direct administrative  costs pilot program, which applies a standard fixed percentage towards  administrative costs. According to FEMA, if successful, results from this  program could inform the development of additional guidance or  regulatory modification and similar approaches could be applied in future  disasters.

We found that the size of  FEMA\u2019s contracting officer workforce at the end of fiscal year 2014 was  more than triple the size of its workforce at the time of Hurricane Katrina,  growing from a total of 45 contracting officers in 2005 to 163 contracting  officers at the end of fiscal year 2014. FEMA\u2019s workforce increases are  due in part to the creation of a headquarters staff in 2010 charged with  supporting disasters, known as the Disaster Acquisition Response Team  (DART). DART has gradually assumed responsibility for administering the  majority of FEMA\u2019s disaster contract spending, but FEMA does not have  a process for how the team will prioritize its work when they are deployed  during a busy disaster period. During this period of growth in the size of  its contracting officer workforce, FEMA has struggled with attrition at  times. We found this turnover in FEMA\u2019s contracting officer workforce has  had particular impact on smaller regional offices which, with only one or  two contracting officers, face gaps in continuity. Further, we found that  FEMA\u2019s 2011 agreement that establishes headquarters and regional  responsibilities in overseeing regional contracting staff poses challenges  for FEMA to cohesively manage its contracting workforce. For example,  regional contracting officers have a dual reporting chain to both regional  supervisors and headquarters supervisors, which heightens the potential  for competing interests for the regional contracting officers. Furthermore,  FEMA has not updated the agreement to incorporate lessons learned  since creating DART, even though the agreement states it will be  revisited each year. We also found that FEMA has not fully implemented  the four Post-Katrina Act contracting requirements we examined, due in  part to incomplete guidance and that inconsistent contract management  practices during disaster deployments\u2014such as incomplete contract files  and reviews\u2014create oversight challenges.", "In our September 2015 report, we made eight recommendations to the  FEMA Administrator and one recommendation to DHS to help ensure  FEMA is prepared to manage the contract administration and oversight  requirements of several simultaneous large-scale disasters or a  catastrophic event, to improve coordination and communication between  headquarters and regional offices with respect to managing and  overseeing regional contracting officers, and to improve the  implementation of contracting provisions under the Post-Katrina Act. DHS  concurred with our recommendations and identified steps FEMA plans to  take to address them within the next year. Specifically, FEMA plans to  update relevant guidance and policies related to headquarters and  regional office roles and responsibilities for managing regional contracting  officers and disaster contracting requirements.", "We currently have work underway for this committee assessing additional  FEMA management areas, including assessing FEMA\u2019s management of  information technology systems that support disaster response and  recovery programs. We plan to report on that work early next year.", "Chairman McSally, Ranking Member Payne and members of the  subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
