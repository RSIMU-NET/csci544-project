As you know, since  combat operations began in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. forces have been  subjected to frequent and deadly attacks from insurgents using various  weapons such as improvised explosive devices (IED), mortars, rocket  launchers, and increasingly lethal ballistic threats. Since 2003, to provide  protection from ballistic threats, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM),  which is responsible for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other  areas, has required service members and Department of Defense (DOD)  civilians in its area of operations to be issued the Interceptor Body Armor  (IBA) system.", "Congress has expressed strong interest in the quality of our ground force\u2019s  body armor protection, especially since combat operations began in Iraq  and Afghanistan and news reports citing concerns regarding body armor  shortages and quality issues. In response to these concerns, we reviewed  the Army and Marine Corps\u2019s actions regarding individual body armor  systems, and on April 26, 2007, issued a report. My testimony today  summarizes the findings in this report. Specifically, I will discuss the  extent to which the Army and Marine Corps (1) have met the theater  requirements for body armor, (2) have the controls in place to assure that  the manufacturing and fielding of body armor meet requirements, and   (3) have shared information regarding their efforts on body armor ballistic  requirements and testing. I will also include additional information  concerning whether contractors or non-DOD civilians obtain body armor  in the same way as U.S. forces and DOD civilians given the number of  contractors and non-DOD civilians in CENTCOM\u2019s area of operation.", "To assess these issues we focused on Army and Marine Corps body armor  systems for U.S. service members and DOD and non-DOD civilian  personnel deployed within CENTCOM\u2019s area of operations, including Iraq  and Afghanistan. To determine whether the Army and Marine Corps are  meeting the theater ballistic and inventory requirements for body armor,  we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from key DOD,  Army, and Marine Corps organizations, such as the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Defense  Logistics Agency, and CENTCOM, which are responsible for managing  theater ballistic and inventory requirements. We analyzed the ballistic  requirements and compared these requirements to the body armor  systems provided to personnel. Moreover, we concentrated on the body  armor system currently being used in CENTCOM\u2019s area of operation. We  also obtained and reviewed the amount of body armor systems available  worldwide for the Army and Marine Corps to determine if the available  amount met the quantity needed in theater. We analyzed the distribution  practices to assure that personnel were receiving body armor systems that  met ballistic theater requirements and that these systems were available  for those preparing to deploy. We did not independently verify that  deployed personnel wore the body armor systems as recommended by  their commanders.", "To assess the extent to which the services have controls in place during  manufacturing and after fielding to assure that body armor meets  requirements, we reviewed documentation and discussed the services\u2019  ballistic test processes and procedures with their program and technical  officials. We analyzed these test processes and procedures to determine if  controls are in place that assure body armor meets ballistic requirements  during manufacturing and after fielding. Our analysis included ballistic test  methods for the tactical vests and the protective plate inserts; however,  we did not independently verify test results. In addition, we reviewed the  services\u2019 past experiences where the services concluded that fielded body  armor systems failed to meet contract specifications and ballistic testing  requirements. We analyzed the services\u2019 actions to determine if their  actions corrected the failures. We also reviewed documentation and  interviewed Army and Marine Corps body armor program officials who  provided manufacturer production quality and ballistic testing lot failures  for early 2006 through early 2007.", "To identify the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps share  information regarding their efforts on body armor ballistic requirements  and testing, we analyzed the services\u2019 body armor programs and policies  and discussed with service officials whether there is a requirement to  share information between the services regarding their separate programs.  We also discussed with officials and reviewed documentation to determine  whether the services do share information and if shared, what specific  actions they take. To determine whether contractors or non-DOD civilians  obtain body armor in the same way as U.S. forces and DOD civilians in  CENTCOM\u2019s area of operations, we obtained and analyzed DOD and  CENTCOM policy regarding personal protection for contractors and non- DOD civilians. We also interviewed Army, Marine Corps, and CENTCOM  officials on this issue.", "We did not make recommendations in our report.

In May 2005, the Marine Corps  recalled fielded body armor because it concluded that the body armor  failed to meet contract specifications, and in November 2005, the Army  and Marine Corps recalled 14 lots of body armor that failed original  ballistic testing. Additionally, in April 2005, we reported on shortages of  critical force protection items, including individual body armor.  Specifically, we found that the shortages in body armor were due to  material shortages, production limitations, and in-theater distribution  problems. In the report, we did not make specific recommendations  regarding body armor, but we did make several recommendations to  improve the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s supply system in supporting deployed  forces for contingencies.
