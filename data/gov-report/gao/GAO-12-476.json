In response, the President tasked agencies to take corrective actions. GAO was asked to assess (1) government actions since the incident to strengthen the nominations process, (2) how the composition of the watchlist has changed based on these actions, and (3) how agencies are addressing gaps in screening processes. GAO analyzed government reports, the guidance used by agencies to nominate individuals to the watchlist, data on the volumes of nominations from January 2009 through May 2011, the composition of the list, and the outcomes of screening agency programs. GAO also interviewed officials from intelligence, law enforcement, and screening agencies to discuss changes to policies, guidance, and processes and related impacts on agency operations and the traveling public, among other things.

The nominating agencies GAO contacted expressed concerns about the increasing volumes of information and related challenges in processing this information. Nevertheless, nominating agencies are sending more information for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist after the attempted attack than before the attempted attack. Agencies are also pursuing staffing, technology, and other solutions to address challenges in processing the volumes of information. In 2011, an interagency policy committee began an initiative to assess the initial impacts the guidance has had on nominating agencies, but did not provide details on whether such assessments would be routinely conducted in the future. Routine assessments could help the government determine the extent to which impacts are acceptable and manageable from a policy perspective and inform future efforts to strengthen the nominations process.", "After the attempted attack, federal agencies took steps to reassess the threat posed by certain individuals already identified in government databases and either add them to the watchlist or change their watchlist status, which included adding individuals to the watchlist\u2019s aviation-related subset lists. For example, the number of U.S. persons (U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents) on the subset No Fly List the government uses to deny individuals the boarding of aircraft more than doubled after the attempted attack.", "Screening agencies are addressing gaps in processes that were exposed by the attempted attack. For example, based on the growth of lists used to screen aviation passengers and continued implementation of Secure Flight\u2014which enabled the Transportation Security Administration to assume direct responsibility for conducting watchlist screening from air carriers\u2014more individuals have been denied boarding aircraft or subjected to additional physical screening before boarding. Secure Flight has also reduced the likelihood of passengers being misidentified as being on the watchlist and has allowed agencies to use a broader set of watchlist records during screening. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has built upon its practice of evaluating individuals before they board flights to the United States, resulting in hundreds more non-U.S. persons on the watchlist being kept off flights because the agency determined they would likely be deemed inadmissible upon arrival at a U.S. airport. The Department of State revoked hundreds of visas shortly after the attempted attack because it determined that the individuals could present an immediate threat to the United States. These actions are intended to enhance homeland security, but have also impacted agency resources and the traveling public. An interagency policy committee is also assessing the outcomes and impacts of these actions, but it did not provide details on this effort. Routine assessments could help decision makers and Congress determine if the watchlist is achieving its intended outcomes and help information future efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism ensure that the outcomes and impacts of agencies\u2019 actions to strengthen nominations and screening processes are routinely assessed.

For instance,  subsets of the watchlist are used by the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to screen individuals before they board an aircraft,  by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to inspect or vet  individuals traveling to and from the United States, and by the  Department of State (State) to screen visa applicants.", "The Executive Office of the President\u2019s review of the attempted attack  found that the U.S. government had sufficient information to have  uncovered and potentially disrupted the attack, but shortcomings in the  watchlisting process prevented the attempted bomber\u2014Umar Farouk  Abdulmutallab\u2014from being nominated for inclusion on the watchlist.  Thus, screening agencies that could have identified him as a potential  threat were unable to identify him and take action. The Executive Office of  the President tasked departments and agencies to undertake a number of  corrective actions to help ensure that known or suspected terrorists are  identified and nominated to the watchlist and that agencies can use the  list to screen individuals for potential links to terrorism.", "We have been monitoring the government\u2019s efforts to improve its ability to  share terrorism-related information to further homeland security. In  January 2005, we designated information sharing a high-risk area  because the federal government faced formidable challenges in analyzing  and disseminating this information in a timely, accurate, and useful  manner. The federal government\u2019s sharing of terrorism-related  information remained a high-risk area in our biennial update that we  issued in February 2011. Also, in October 2007, we reported on how the  watchlist is created and maintained and how federal, state, and local  security partners use the list to screen individuals for potential threats to  the homeland. We identified potential vulnerabilities\u2014including ones  created because agencies were not screening against all watchlist  records\u2014and concluded that an up-to-date strategy could help the  government optimize use of the watchlist. We made recommendations to  enhance the effectiveness of the watchlisting and screening processes,  which agencies implemented or have actions under way to address.  Further, after the attempted attack, we reported that weighing and  responding to the potential impacts that changes to the criteria used to  nominate individuals to the terrorist watchlist would have on the traveling  public will be an important consideration in determining what changes  may be needed.", "In response to your request, we issued a classified report in December  2011 that addressed the following questions:", "What actions has the federal government taken since the December  25, 2009, attempted attack to strengthen the watchlist nominations  process, and to what extent are departments and agencies  experiencing challenges implementing these actions and assessing  impacts of the actions they have taken?", "How did the composition of the watchlist change as a result of actions  taken by departments and agencies after the attempted attack?", "How are screening agencies addressing vulnerabilities exposed by  the attempted attack, what have been the outcomes of related  screening since the incident, and to what extent are federal agencies  assessing the impacts of this screening?", "This report is a public version of the classified report that we provided to  you. The various departments and agencies we reviewed deemed some  of the information in the restricted report as classified or sensitive (e.g.,  Sensitive Security Information or For Official Use Only), which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits certain  information associated with vulnerabilities in watchlisting and screening  processes that were exposed by the December 25, 2009, attempted  attack and government actions to address these vulnerabilities. This  report also omits key details regarding (1) certain policies and procedures  associated with the development and use of the terrorist watchlist and (2)  specific outcomes of encounters with individuals who were positively  matched to the watchlist. Although the information provided in this report  is more limited in scope, it addresses the same questions as the  restricted report. Also, the overall methodology used for both reports is  the same.", "To determine federal government actions to strengthen the watchlist  nominations process and related challenges, we analyzed postattack  government reports issued by the Executive Office of the President and  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

To  help us determine how postattack changes in the watchlisting guidance  have affected the volume of nominations and any resulting impacts, we  obtained data for the period January 2009 through May 2011 from seven  federal entities involved in the nominations process. Specifically, we  obtained data from five entities that nominate individuals for inclusion on  the terrorist watchlist (nominating agencies). We also obtained  information from the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), an entity  that processes these nominations and submits them to TSC, as does the  FBI, and TSC.nominations process and interviewed agency officials\u2014including the  Director of TSC, NCTC\u2019s Deputy Director for Terrorist Identities, and  agency watchlisting program officials\u2014to discuss nomination processes,  how changes instituted as a result of the July 2010 Watchlisting Guidance  have impacted agencies, and related challenges.", "Further, we analyzed documentation on the watchlisting  To identify how the composition of the watchlist has changed since the  December 2009 attempted attack, we analyzed agency documents and  TSC data for 2009 and 2010 on the number of individuals on the terrorist  watchlist and its subset No Fly and Selectee lists, and on the number of  U.S. persons (U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents) on these  lists.

These are the primary  agencies that use the watchlist to screen and vet individuals traveling to  the United States. We obtained data\u2014generally for 2009 and 2010 but in  some cases through May 2011\u2014on how often these agencies have  encountered individuals on the watchlist and the outcomes of these  encounters to help determine what impact changes in agency screening  or vetting procedures have had on the traveling public and agency  operations, among other things. We also interviewed officials from each  agency to discuss how their screening and vetting procedures have  changed since the attempted attack and how they are assessing the  impacts of the changes. Further, to better understand the impacts of  watchlist screening on the traveling public, we analyzed data for 2009 and  2010 on individuals who had inquiries or sought resolution regarding  difficulties they experienced during their travel screening and interviewed  DHS officials who are responsible for providing redress for these  individuals.", "To assess the reliability of data on watchlist nominations, number of  watchlist records, and screening outcomes, we questioned  knowledgeable officials about the data and the systems that produced the  data, reviewed relevant documentation, examined data for obvious errors,  and (when possible) corroborated the data among the different agencies.

NCTC, and the FBI apply a reasonable-suspicion standard to determine  which individuals are appropriate for inclusion in the TSDB. NCTC and  the FBI are to consider information from all available sources to  determine if there is a reasonable suspicion of links to terrorism that  warrants a nomination. Once NCTC and the FBI determine that an  individual meets the reasonable-suspicion standard and that minimum  biographic information exists, they extract sensitive but unclassified  information on the individual\u2019s identity\u2014such as name and date of birth\u2014 from their classified databases and send the information to TSC.

For instance,  applicable TSC records are provided to TSA for use in screening airline  passengers, to CBP for use in inspecting and vetting persons traveling to  and from the United States, and to State for use in screening visa  applicants. Regarding individuals who are not citizens or nationals of the  United States seeking to travel to and lawfully enter the United States,  screening and law enforcement agencies rely on immigration laws that  specify criteria for determining whether to issue visas to individuals and  whether to admit them into the country. In many instances, individuals  who are not citizens or nationals of the United States who have engaged  in or are likely to engage in terrorist-related activities may be ineligible to  receive visas or inadmissible for entry to the United States, or both. U.S.  citizens returning to the United States from abroad are not subject to the  admissibility requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act,  regardless of whether they are subjects of watchlist records.

DHS  generally agreed with our recommendation but noted that increasing the  number of records that air carriers used to screen passengers would  expand the number of misidentifications to unjustifiable proportions  without a measurable increase in security. In general, misidentifications  occur when a passenger\u2019s name is identical or similar to a name in the  TSDB but the passenger is not the individual on the watchlist. Since then,  TSA assumed direct responsibility for this screening function through  implementation of the Secure Flight program for all flights traveling to,  from, or within the United States. According to TSA, Secure Flight\u2019s full  assumption of this function from air carriers and its use of more  biographic data for screening have improved watchlist matching. This  includes TSA\u2019s ability to correctly match passenger data against TSDB  records to confirm if individuals match someone on the watchlist and  reduce the number of misidentifications.

Specifically, TSA has implemented  Secure Flight such that as circumstances warrant, it may expand the  scope of its screening beyond the No Fly and Selectee lists to the entire  TSDB. According to the program\u2019s final rule, in general, Secure Flight is to compare passenger information only to the No Fly and Selectee lists  because, during normal security circumstances, screening against these  components of the TSDB will be satisfactory to counter the security  threat. However, the rule also provides that TSA may use the larger set of  \u201cwatch lists\u201d maintained by the federal government when warranted by  security considerations, such as if TSA learns that flights on a particular  route may be subject to increased security risk.", "Also, after the attempted bombing in December 2009, DHS proposed and  the Deputies Committee approved the Secure Flight program\u2019s expanded  use of TSDB records on a routine basis to screen passengers before they  board flights.

According to TSA, the impact on screening  operations has been minimal given the relatively low volume of matches  against these additional records each day.", "TSA noted that the entire TSDB is not used for screening since matching  passenger data against TSDB records that contain only partial data could  result in a significant increase in the number of passengers who are  misidentified as being on the watchlist and potentially cause unwarranted  delay or inconvenience to travelers. TSA also noted that as with potential  misidentifications to the No Fly and Selectee lists, passengers who feel  that they have been incorrectly delayed or inconvenienced can apply for  redress through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS  TRIP). DHS noted that TSA regularly monitors the Secure Flight  program and processes and makes adjustments as needed.", "In fiscal year 2011, TSA reprogrammed $15.9 million into Secure Flight to  begin screening against the additional TSDB records. TSA\u2019s fiscal year  2012 budget request proposed funding to make screening against the  additional records permanent. According to TSA, for fiscal year 2012,  Secure Flight requested an increase of $8.9 million and 38 full-time  personnel to continue supporting this expanded screening effort.

Other high-risk and improperly  documented passengers handled by these programs include passengers  who have criminal histories; have had their visas revoked; are in  possession of fraudulent, lost, or stolen passports; or otherwise appear to  be inadmissible.", "In response to the attempted attack in December 2009, and as part of its  border and immigration security mission, CBP implemented the Pre- Departure Targeting Program in January 2010 to build upon its process of  assessing if individuals would likely be found inadmissible at a port of  entry before they board an aircraft to cover all airports worldwide with  direct flights to the United States. Before the attempted attack, CBP  assessed individuals who were departing from airports that had CBP  Immigration Advisory Program officers on site. At airports without such a  program, passengers in the TSDB but not on the No Fly List generally  were allowed to board flights and travel to U.S. airports. Upon arrival at a  U.S. port of entry, CBP would inspect the passengers and determine their  admissibility. CBP continues to assess passengers through the  Immigration Advisory Program for flights departing from airports that have  a program presence.", "For both the Pre-Departure Targeting Program and the Immigration  Advisory Program, if CBP determines that a passenger would likely be  deemed inadmissible upon arrival at a U.S. airport, it recommends that  the air carrier not board that passenger (that is, it makes a no board  recommendation). CBP generally makes these no board  recommendations based on provisions for admissibility found in the  Immigration and Nationality Act. U.S. citizens are generally not subject  to these recommendations since they are generally permitted to enter the  United States at a U.S. port of entry if they prove to the satisfaction of a  CBP officer that they are in fact U.S. citizens. CBP may also decide to not  issue such recommendations for aliens in the TSDB if, for example (1)  CBP officers determine that, based on a review of all available  information, the individual is not likely to be denied admission to the  United States, or (2) the individual was granted a waiver of inadmissibility  by DHS, if such a waiver is available.", "For flights departing from airports without an Immigration Advisory  Program officer on site, CBP is leveraging the capabilities of its officers  within its Regional Carrier Liaison Groups to issue no board  recommendations to air carriers. These groups were established in 2006  to assist air carriers with U.S. entry-related matters\u2014with a primary focus  on verifying the authenticity of travel documents\u2014and to work directly  with commercial air carriers on security-related matters. Regional Carrier  Liaison Group staff who are located in the United States handle Pre- Departure Targeting Program no board recommendations to air carriers remotely by delivering the recommendations via phone, fax, or e-mail.

For aliens seeking admission to the United States, determinations  on admissibility are generally made by CBP officers during this inspection  in accordance with applicable provisions of the Immigration and  Nationality Act. In general, aliens who are deemed inadmissible are  detained by DHS until the individual can board a return flight home.", "Since the attempted attack, CBP predeparture vetting programs\u2014the  Pre-Departure Targeting Program and the Immigration Advisory  Program\u2014have resulted in hundreds more aliens being kept off flights  bound for the United States because CBP determined that they likely  would be deemed inadmissible upon arrival at a U.S. airport and made  corresponding no board recommendations to air carriers. In addition to  the increase in no board recommendations that resulted from  implementing the Pre-Departure Targeting Program in January 2010, the  increase during 2010 was in response to the new threats made evident by  the attempted attack, according to CBP officials. CBP data also show that  there have been instances when individuals have boarded flights bound  for the United States and arrived at U.S. airports. According to CBP  officials, the vast majority of these cases involved either (1) U.S. citizens  and lawful permanent residents who generally may enter the United  States, and therefore, CBP generally does not recommend that air  carriers not board these passengers, or (2) aliens in the TSDB who were  deemed inadmissible but were granted temporary admission into the  United States under certain circumstances, such as DHS granting a  waiver of inadmissibility.", "At the time of our review, CBP did not have readily available data on how  often aliens in the TSDB boarded flights bound for the United States\u2014 information that could help CBP assess how its predeparture programs  are working and provide transparency over program results, among other  things. According to CBP officials, the agency was working on adding  data fields to CBP systems to capture more information related to these  programs. The officials noted that these changes will allow CBP to break  down and retrieve data by U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and  aliens, and that related reports will be produced. At our request, CBP  conducted a manual review of data it compiled on the results of its  processing of passengers at U.S. airports from April 2010 through  September 2010.

According to State, as of May 2011, a number of  individuals in the TSDB continued to hold U.S. visas because the  department found that (1) they were ineligible to hold a visa under the  terrorism-related provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act but  received waivers of that ineligibility or (2) they were not ineligible to hold  visas under the terrorism-related provisions of the act following standard  interagency processing of the visa applications.", "Under current procedures, State screens visa applicant data against  sensitive but unclassified extracts of biographical information drawn from  TSDB records as part of its evaluation process for issuing U.S. visas.

For instance, applicable TSC records are  provided to TSA for use in screening airline passengers, to U.S. Customs  and Border Protection (CBP) for use in vetting and inspecting persons  traveling to and from the United States, and to State for use in screening  visa applicants. Regarding individuals who are not citizens or nationals of  the United States seeking travel to and entry into the United States,  screening and law enforcement agencies rely on immigration laws that  specify criteria and rules for deciding whether to issue visas to individuals  or to admit them into the country. In many instances, individuals who are  not citizens or nationals of the United States who have engaged in or are  likely to engage in terrorist-related activities may be ineligible to receive  visas or inadmissible for entry to the United States, or both. If a foreign  citizen is lawfully admitted into the United States\u2014either permanently or  temporarily\u2014and subsequently engages in or is likely to engage in a  terrorist activity, the individual, in certain circumstances, may be removed  to his or her country of citizenship. U.S. citizens returning to the United  States from abroad are not subject to the admissibility requirements of the  Immigration and Nationality Act, regardless of whether they are subjects  of watchlist records. In general, these individuals only need to establish  their U.S. citizenship to the satisfaction of the examining officer\u2014by, for  example, presenting a U.S. passport\u2014to obtain entry into the United  States.

When misidentifications occur, a  passenger may not be able to print a boarding pass from a computer or  an airport kiosk. Rather, the individual may have to go to the airline ticket  counter to provide identifying information that is used to determine if the  person is a positive match to the No Fly List or Selectee List.
