As a result, DOD cannot expeditiously correct data transmission issues as they arise, such as the approximately 4,000 biometrics collected from 2004 to 2008 that were separated from their associated identities. Such decoupling renders the data useless and increases the likelihood of enemy combatants going undetected within Afghanistan and across borders. Factors affecting the timely transmission of biometrics data include the biometrics architecture with multiple servers, mountainous terrain, and mission requirements in remote areas.

Army and Marine Corps guidance both  emphasize using lessons learned to sustain, enhance, and increase  preparedness to conduct current and future operations. The Army,  Marine Corps, and Special Operations Command each rely on their  respective existing processes to collect lessons learned pertaining to  biometrics to facilitate knowledge sharing. To collect lessons learned, the  military services and Special Operations Command draw from a variety of  sources, including through surveys administered to students and  instructors during training, and through interviews with personnel who  have recently returned from a deployment. These lessons learned are  analyzed to identify opportunities to improve existing practices within the  military services and Special Operations Command. For example, Army  officials said that about 10 to 15 percent of the lessons learned it collects  are subsequently identified as either best practices or issues that require  further action to resolve.", "DOD also uses informal processes to capture biometrics training-related  lessons learned. For example, monthly teleconferences are held by and  open to training representatives from Central Command\u2019s Task Force  Biometrics and the Army to discuss biometrics training-related issues and  experiences. However, this information is not disseminated across the  department. Army biometrics officials told us that it would be  advantageous to share biometrics lessons learned across the military  services and combatant commands.", "Currently, DOD has no requirement to disseminate biometrics lessons  learned across the department. However, the unpublished DOD  implementing instruction for biometrics that was drafted by the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering  includes a provision that would require DOD organizations to provide  feedback and biometrics lessons learned to the Biometrics Identity  Management Agency in its role as the Executive Manager for DOD  Biometrics. In this role, the Biometrics Identity Management Agency could  disseminate biometrics lessons learned collected by the various military  services and combatant commands to inform relevant policies and  practices. Biometrics Identity Management Agency officials told us that  while they have established a process to receive Army lessons learned  for biometrics, the agency does not plan to assume the additional  responsibility of collecting the other military services\u2019 and combatant  commands\u2019 lessons learned for biometrics issues and disseminating them  across DOD without an explicit requirement to do so. By not  disseminating biometrics lessons learned from existing military service  and combatant command lessons learned systems across the  department, DOD misses an opportunity to fully leverage its investment in  biometrics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["U.S. military forces have used biometrics as a nonlethal weapon in  counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan to remove the anonymity  sought by enemy combatants. However, issues such as minimal  biometrics training for leaders; challenges with ensuring the complete,  accurate, and timely transmission of biometrics data; and the absence of  a requirement to disseminate biometrics lessons learned across DOD  persist.

To understand the frequency and types of biometrics  training offered by the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations  Command, we reviewed training schedules and we observed the Army\u2019s  Soldier Field Service Engineer Course 2nd Pilot and Biometrics  Operations Specialist/Master Gunner Training at Fort Drum, N.Y.; the  Marine Corps\u2019 Biometrics Automated Toolset Basic Operator\u2019s Course at  Camp Pendleton, CA; and the Special Operations Command\u2019s Technical  Exploitation Course I and the Sensitive Site Exploitation Operator  Advanced Courses training at Fort Bragg, N.C..

In addition, we reviewed documents on biometrics collections  and transmissions and spoke with Office of the Secretary of Defense,  Army, Marine Corps, Central Command, and Special Operations  Command officials. We reviewed DOD biometrics submission latency  data to understand data transmission over time. We assessed the  reliability of the data by reviewing related documentation and interviewing  knowledgeable officials. Although we found the data sufficiently reliable to  provide descriptive and summary statistics, problems were identified with  the completeness and accuracy of the data due to external factors, such  as inaccurate time/date stamps on biometrics collection devices. As a  result, we developed a recommendation to assign responsibility for  biometrics data throughout the transmission process, to include the time  period between when warfighters submit their data into the Biometrics  Automated Toolset system until the biometrics data reach ABIS to better  ensure completeness and accuracy of biometrics data during the  transmission process. We also reviewed the Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government for information on data completeness  and accuracy assurance. We conducted site visits to four military  installations in Afghanistan to ascertain how biometrics are being  collected, utilized, and transmitted. Specifically, we visited Bagram Air  Field, Kandahar Air Field, Marine Corps Base Camp Leatherneck, and  Forward Operating Base Pasab to meet with military officials responsible  for leading and performing biometrics collection, analysis, and  transmission activities in Afghanistan and for operating the Last Tactical  Mile pilot project.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed a process to collect  and disseminate biometrics lessons learned, we analyzed relevant Office  of the Secretary of Defense, Army, and Marine Corps guidance and  policies, and met with officials from each of these organizations to discuss  current practices.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2011 through April 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
