In 1992, the Congress directed the Army to plan for the disposal of chemical warfare materiel not included in the stockpile. The Army has spent nearly $3.2 billion on its efforts and estimates that it will cost $24.4 billion and take nearly 40 years to dispose of the remaining chemical stockpile weapons and nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel. Although the Army is committed to destroying the chemical stockpile by the legislatively imposed deadline of December 31, 2004, only two of the nine planned disposal facilities are built and operating, 4 percent of the stockpile and little of the nonstockpile materiel have been destroyed, and environmental issues continue to delay the remaining facilities.

Since World War I, the United States has maintained a stockpile of chemical weapons and agents to deter the use of chemical weapons against its troops. The stockpile consists of rockets, bombs, projectiles, spray tanks, and bulk containers. Some munitions contain nerve agents, which can disrupt the nervous system and lead to loss of muscular control and death. Others contain a series of mustard agents that blister the skin and can be lethal in large amounts. Nonstockpile materiel consists of all other chemical warfare items, including binary chemical weapons, miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel, recovered chemical weapons, former production facilities, and buried chemical warfare materiel.", "Historically, DOD has placed a higher priority on the destruction of the chemical stockpile because most nonstockpile items did not pose an immediate hazard to the environment or public health. Potential threats to the chemical stockpile include external events such as earthquakes, airplane crashes, and tornadoes; and internal events such as spontaneous leakage of chemical agents, accidents during normal handling and maintenance activities, and self-ignition of propellant. Nonstockpile items, such as binary weapons\u2019 components, miscellaneous warfare materiel, and recovered chemical weapons, were placed in storage and old chemical production facilities were closed years ago. Although documentation surveys, interviews, and site visits have been conducted, much of the information concerning burial sites remains unknown. The priority for destroying nonstockpile materiel has increased because of recent accidental discoveries of buried materiel, congressional interest, and international efforts to destroy chemical weapons.", "The Army has spent nearly $3.2 billion on its efforts to destroy its chemical stockpile weapons and nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel. (See  app. II.)

In 1969, an Army plan to dispose of chemical agents and munitions at sea raised public concerns about the safety of transporting chemical weapons from their storage sites to a port of embarkation and about the potential effects of ocean dumping on the environment. In June 1969, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that ocean dumping be avoided and that public health and environmental protection be emphasized. It suggested two alternatives to ocean disposal: incineration of mustard agents and chemical neutralization of nerve agents. In response, the Army stopped ocean dumping operations.(See chronology in app. IV.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Use of Incineration and Chemical Neutralization", "paragraphs": ["During the 1970s, the Army destroyed obsolete chemical weapons primarily by high-temperature incineration or by chemical neutralization. The neutralization process involves altering the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties of a chemical warfare agent to render it ineffective for use as intended. In 1984, the National Research Council, under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, decided that incineration was the more desirable disposal method. It concluded that the neutralization process was more costly and produced larger quantities of waste than incineration. In 1986, the Army submitted to the Congress a plan to dispose of the chemical stockpile. Its plan considered the costs and potential problems associated with three options: (1) transferring the entire stockpile to one site for disposal, (2) transferring it to two regional disposal sites, and (3) operating separate disposal facilities at each of the storage locations. In 1988, the Army formally announced that on-site incineration was its preferred disposal method.

In the 1993 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 102-484), the Congress directed the Army to use the National Research Council\u2019s evaluation and report on potential technological alternatives to incineration. The Congress also directed the Army to consider safety, environmental protection, and cost-effectiveness when evaluating alternative technologies. Consequently, in August 1994, the Army initiated a more aggressive research and development program, called the Alternative Technologies and Approaches Project, to investigate, develop, and support testing of two technologies based on chemical neutralization of chemical agents at the bulk-only stockpile sites\u2014Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and Newport Chemical Activity, Indiana. In addition, three other technologies\u2014molten metal pyrolysis, high-temperature hydrogenation, and electrochemical oxidation\u2014have been tested and are undergoing further development by the commercial firms promoting them.

The designation was intended to (1) stabilize the disposal schedule, (2) control costs, and (3) provide more discipline and higher levels of program oversight.

The Army has spent $2.6 billion and estimates that the stockpile program could cost another $9.8 billion and take until December 2004 to complete. However, the program will likely cost more than estimated and continue past the estimated completion date. This is because reaching agreement on site specific disposal methods has consistently taken longer than the Army anticipated. Furthermore, recent congressional direction in the 1997 Authorization and Appropriations Acts to research and develop alternative technologies to destroy assembled chemical munitions indicates that there is continued public concerns about the incineration disposal method. Recognizing the difficulty of satisfactorily resolving the public concerns associated with each individual disposal location, suggestions have been made to change the program\u2019s basic approach to destruction. These have included developing an acceptable alternative disposal technology to incineration and consolidating disposal operations at a national or regional sites.

For example, the Army has established storefront information offices near some of the storage sites, developed public outreach pamphlets and information videos, distributed information to public libraries and locations, provided toll-free telephone numbers, and conducted town meetings. However, the National Research Council recently recommended that the Army increase substantially and institutionalize public involvement throughout the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program. The Council reported that the credibility of the Army was low and that the treatment of public concerns had been inadequate. It concluded that the Army\u2019s public relations and outreach efforts to educate the public about chemical stockpile activities by themselves will not be enough to facilitate the safe and timely disposal of the stockpile. The Council recommended that the Army expand its public affairs program to ensure public involvement in the program, giving the affected communities a participatory role and a sense of ownership in the program\u2019s decision-making process.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, regulates the storage, treatment, and disposal of most chemical weapons and materiel. (Environmental laws are summarized in app. III.) The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act controls hazardous waste through a permit process that requires government approval for individuals who generate, transport, store, or dispose of hazardous waste. Under the act, the Environmental Protection Agency may authorize individual states to administer and enforce hazardous waste programs that are as least as stringent as the federal program. The act also allows states to establish requirements more stringent than federal standards. The Clean Air Act, as amended, governs potential sources of air pollutants and establishes emission standards. The Army must obtain permits for air pollution control prior to operating a chemical stockpile disposal facility.", "According to the Army\u2019s 1994 risk assessment, there was a high possibility states would use their authority under these laws to delay or prevent the construction of incinerators in their states. For example, states can place restrictions on hazardous waste generators as well as the disposal of the hazardous waste generated by the chemical agent incinerators, or prohibit disposal of the waste within their jurisdictions. States may also simply delay the permit review process for an inordinate amount of time. These actions could increase the Army\u2019s costs, cause it significant administrative difficulties, or delay operations. To illustrate, before it will issue a permit for a chemical stockpile disposal facility, Kentucky requires that information showing that no alternative disposal method, including, but not limited to, neutralization and transportation, exists or could be developed. Maryland and Indiana have also passed laws or adopted regulations specific to the disposal of chemical agents within their jurisdictions.", "Although the Army\u2019s 1994 risk assessment acknowledges the potential for delays due to environmental regulations, its program schedule provides little leeway for dealing with potential problems at the remaining stockpile sites. For example, the Army\u2019s 1996 schedule only allows for slippage ranging from 1 to 6 months for delays in the permitting process, construction, systemization, and operation of the proposed facilities at Anniston, Pine Bluff, and Umatilla. The schedule for the Anniston Chemical Agent Disposal Facility shows that to destroy all of the chemical munitions at Anniston by the end of December 2004, Alabama would have to issue its permit to start construction no later than October 1996. Army officials now estimate that the permit will be issued by March 31, 1997, approximately 6 months later than scheduled. (See table 2.1.) Alabama regulatory officials expect the permit to be issued in June or July 1997\u2014a slippage of approximately 8 months. Unless the Army can shorten construction, systemization, or destruction time frames, disposal operations at Anniston would extent to mid-2005.", "The February 1996 schedule for the Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility shows construction starting by the end of fiscal year 1996 and provides a 6-month leeway to complete disposal operations by the end of 2004. Based on the Army\u2019s current schedule for the environmental permits, the start of construction in 1996 is no longer possible because the schedule shows an issuance date of June 24, 1997\u2014a slippage of 9 months. This delay eliminated the 6-month leeway and operations now are likely to continue past December 2004. The disposal schedule for the Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility provides a leeway of 4 months. The Army had expected Oregon to issue the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Clean Air Act permits for the facility by the end of September 1996. However, Army officials had estimated that the permits would have been issued by January 30, 1997, approximately 4 months later than scheduled. This delay eliminated the grace period for starting disposal operations at Umatilla.", "According to Army officials, implementation of the health risk assessment requirement has added another layer of uncertainty to the schedule. They said that the original scope of the health risk assessment to operate the disposal facilities was not completely defined, the health assessment requirements have changed, and the requirements currently vary from state to state. According to DOD officials, states have modified the requirements of their health risk assessments well into the process, delaying the development of the final assessment document. According to Environmental Protection Agency officials, the agency has issued several guidance documents concerning the health risk assessments over the last 5 years and has tried to keep the Army informed of the changes and updates in the guidance.

The data on which the Army based its assessment were old and may no longer represent the chemical weapons in storage. For example, at that time, field samples of the M55 rocket propellant had not been taken since 1989. Also, the assessment did not include an analysis of leaking munitions. Leaks increase the risk of auto-ignition during handling, which could lead to fires and potential explosions in the stockpile storage area. In addition, a contingency plan for disposal of the rockets was needed because they cannot readily be reconfigured to remove their propellant. Propellant is inherently unstable and must be stabilized to help prevent reactions that could lead to a spontaneous ignition. Manufacturers added stabilizing compounds, but they deteriorate over time.", "Recent Army initiatives to obtain better information to predict the safe storage life of the stockpile, including the M55 rockets, are encouraging. For example, the Army initiated an Enhanced Stockpile Assessment Program to determine the effects of an agent on a propellant, identify the most appropriate predictive methodology, develop sampling plans, and perform periodic assessments. In 1995, the Army completed a reassessment of the stability of the M55 rockets and concluded that the likelihood of propellent ignition through 2013 was negligible. However, data were obtained from leaker rockets on Johnston Atoll that were consistent with the theory that exposure to agent accelerates the degradation of the propellent stabilizer. Gaining a better understanding of this chemical process and its impact on the rockets\u2019 stability will be a major thrust of the Army\u2019s stockpile assessment activities in 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Alternatives Generate Trade-offs", "paragraphs": ["The concern about incineration and the cost and progress of the disposal programs have led to suggestions for alternative technologies, the transportation of agents and munitions to a national or regional site, and other measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

This provision prohibits the Army from using funds to prepare studies on the feasibility of transporting chemical weapons. Transportation options offer some cost benefits, but they also increase the risk to the general public and are likely to be opposed by most affected states and communities.", "Although transporting chemical weapons has the potential to reduce construction and procurement costs by as much as $2.6 billion, the reduction could be offset by shipping and emergency preparedness costs. The potential savings come from reducing the number of disposal facilities that must be built. According to the Army estimates, construction and procurement of a disposal facility and related equipment cost from $243 million for a small facility that will handle only bulk agent such as Newport, to $471 million for a large facility that will process all types of explosively configured munitions such as Umatilla. The reduction in costs is offset by increased storage, emergency preparedness, and program management costs from extending disposal operations at the consolidated sites. Using existing disposal rates, a national destruction facility at Tooele could extend the program to 2017 and add as much as 770 months of storage, emergency preparedness, and management costs to the program. Similarly, regional disposal sites at Anniston and Tooele could extend the program to 2010 and add as much as 320 months of storage, emergency preparedness, and management costs.", "In addition, potential savings would be offset by large transportation costs. In 1987, an Army transportation panel recommended that, prior to transporting any agent or munitions, the Army develop a shipping container that (1) provides redundant protection against agent release during normal transport, (2) prevents agent release in most transportation accidents, (3) is compatible with standard cargo handling and transport equipment, and (4) has the capability for automated agent and temperature monitoring within the transport container. In 1987, the Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization estimated that 400 containers would cost $96.4 million. An Army official who developed the on-site transportation containers estimated that the containers would cost significantly more and could cost as much as $2 million for each container. In addition, the Army\u2019s transportation concept plan found that using the rail system would require 70 to 75 rail shipments to a national disposal site, each consisting of a convoy of 136 railcars. Shipping by truck to a national disposal site would require 820 convoys, and airlifting would require several thousand sorties using C-141 aircraft. According to an Army study, transporting the Blue Grass stockpile would take 1,200 to 1,500 flights. Further, airfields capable of handling large aircraft would have to be constructed. Costs for these transportation alternatives have not been estimated. However, we reported that moving more than 100,000 U.S. chemical-filled munitions from West Germany to Johnston Atoll in 1990 cost $61.6 million, including $13.6 million for shipping containers.The Army shipped the munitions in sealed steel boxes called secondary steel containers, which were loaded into shipping containers.", "Another significant cost element could be emergency preparedness along the transportation corridor. Proposed rail routes to a national destruction center total approximately 13,000 miles and pass through 20 states. Rail routes to regional destruction sites total approximately 7,100 miles and pass through 16 states. In its response to the Army\u2019s 1987 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, the Department of Health and Human Services stated that the difficulties in preparing adequate contingency plans for a transportation alternative are staggering and that resources to cope with a worst case scenario in a consistent manner could never be mobilized. The Department reported that while it might be possible to provide hospitals near the eight existing storage sites with enough respirator equipment to support a number of casualties, it would be difficult to supply all communities along a transportation route. Few communities along the transportation routes would have the necessary equipment available to them without federal assistance.", "Any movement of chemical weapons or material could be opposed by federal agencies and the affected states and localities. Before the Army can transport a chemical weapon, it must (1) coordinate efforts with the Department of Health and Human Services and must adopt any precautionary measures that it recommends, (2) meet all regulations imposed by the Department of Transportation, and (3) obtain permits from the receiving state and potentially from each state traveled through. Although the departments of Health and Human Services or Transportation have not formally opposed transportation, both have expressed strong reservations about transportation alternatives. In 1988, 13 states provided written comments on the Army\u2019s Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. Twelve of the states opposed transporting the chemical weapons, including 7 of the 8 states where chemical weapons are stored, and endorsed an on-site disposal option.

In addition, DOD recommended against using stockpile disposal facilities to destroy nonstockpile materiel because of the strong public opposition to both the use of stockpile disposal facilities to treat any other waste materiel and the transportation of chemical materiel for disposal in these facilities.", "Our draft report recognized that some options could increase the risk to the general public and would likely be opposed by some of the affected states and localities and other interested parties. We presented the options in context of their tradeoffs should the Congress wish to address the key factors affecting the programs\u2019 disposal costs and schedule. We did not take a position on the options or current approach given the associated policy and legislative implications."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
