NSF reported that it made substantial progress in achieving its key outcomes. Although the planned strategies for achieving these key outcomes generally are clear and reasonable, some are vague and do not identify the specific steps for achieving the goals. NSF's fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan reflect continued improvement compared with the prior year's report and plan. Although the 2002 performance plan does not substantially address NSF's human capital management, NSF is developing a five-year workforce strategic plan to address strategic human capital management issues that must be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by July 20, 2001. NSF's performance report did not explain its progress in resolving information security challenges, but NSF indicated that it has internal management controls that continually monitor data security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, we reviewed the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan required by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) to assess the agency\u2019s progress in achieving selected key outcomes that you identified as important mission areas for the agency. These are the same outcomes we addressed in our June 2000 review of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plan to provide a baseline by which to measure the agency\u2019s performance from year-to-year. These selected key outcomes are:   NSF\u2019s research funding awards lead to discoveries at and across the frontier of science and engineering and   NSF efficiently and effectively administers research grants.", "As agreed, using the selected key outcomes for NSF as a framework, we (1) assessed the progress NSF has made in achieving these outcomes and the strategies that NSF has in place to achieve them and (2) compared NSF\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with its prior year performance report and plan for these outcomes. Additionally, we agreed to analyze how NSF addressed the major management challenges, including the governmentwide high- risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security, that we and NSF\u2019s Inspector General identified. Appendix I provides detailed information on how NSF addressed these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["GPRA is intended to shift the focus of government decisionmaking, management, and accountability from activities and processes to the results and outcomes achieved by federal programs. New and valuable information on the plans, goals, and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing GPRA. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of (1) the annual performance goals for agencies\u2019 major programs and activities, (2) the measures that will be used to gauge performance, (3) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and (4) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information. These annual plans, issued soon after transmittal of the President\u2019s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to subsequently report on the degree to which performance goals were met. The issuance of the agencies\u2019 performance reports, due this year by March 31, represents a new and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of GPRA\u2014the opportunity to assess federal agencies\u2019 actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance and reduce costs in the future.", "NSF\u2019s mission is to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. NSF carries out its mission primarily by making merit-based grants and cooperative agreements to individual researchers and groups in partnership with colleges, universities, and other public and private institutions. For fiscal year 2001, NSF has a budget of $4.4 billion and a staff of about 1,200 government employees to accomplish its mission.", "Implementing GPRA has been a challenge for NSF, whose mission involves funding research activities, because the substance and timing of research outcomes are unpredictable and research results can be difficult to report quantitatively. With OMB\u2019s approval, NSF uses an alternative format\u2014a qualitative scale for the assessment of outcomes\u2014for which it relies on independent committees of scientific experts. These committees determine the level of NSF\u2019s success in achieving its goals. NSF uses quantitative goals for its management and investment process goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of NSF\u2019s Progress and Strategies in Achieving Selected Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["This section discusses our analysis of NSF\u2019s performance in achieving the selected key outcomes, as well as the strategies it has in place\u2014 particularly strategic human capital management and information technology strategies\u2014for achieving these outcomes.

NSF judged its performance as successful on the basis of assessments by independent committees of scientific experts. In compiling committee members\u2019 scores and aggregating their comments, NSF took into account only those reports with substantive comments and ratings that were clearly justified. NSF officials told us that, for the scientific discoveries outcome goal, all of the committees judged NSF as successful in achieving it and justified their assessments. However, the performance report did not provide information on the specific numbers of reports it included and excluded in reaching its judgments for this outcome or any of the other outcomes. Furthermore, NSF discussed the independent scientific committees\u2019 results for only one of the scientific discoveries five areas of emphasis\u2014namely, the balance of innovative, risky, and interdisciplinary research area. Instead of providing a more complete analysis of the scientific committees\u2019 assessments, NSF contracted with an external third party\u2014PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2014to make an independent assessment of the performance results.

To implement its outcome goal, NSF has both (1) process strategies, such as supporting the most promising ideas through merit-based grants and cooperative agreements, and (2) program strategies, such as supporting programmatic themes identified as areas of emphasis. However, NSF\u2019s plan generally does not address key components of strategic human capital management, although its \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cmanagement\u201d outcome goals include such human capital initiatives as workforce diversity, an NSF Academy for workforce training, and a survey on the work environment.

While not listed as an outcome goal, the administration of grants includes many of NSF\u2019s management and investment process goals. For example, NSF exceeded by 21 percent one of its management performance goals\u2014to receive at least 60 percent of full grant proposal submissions electronically through a new computer system called FastLane. NSF also exceeded by 5 percent another management goal that at least 90 percent of its funds will be allocated to projects reviewed by appropriate peers external to NSF and selected through a merit-based competitive process. NSF continued to miss one of its investment process goals\u2014to process 70 percent of proposals within 6 months of receipt\u2014dropping from 58 percent to 54 percent in fiscal year 2000. As part of its review of NSF, PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that NSF\u2019s fiscal year 2000 processes were valid and verifiable and relied on sound business processes, system and application controls, and manual checks of system queries to confirm the accuracy of reported data.", "NSF\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan generally includes strategies for achieving NSF\u2019s performance goals that appear to be clear and reasonable. However, in some cases, the strategies are vague, and how NSF will use them to achieve its performance goals is unclear. For example, one of NSF\u2019s three strategies for identifying best management practices for its large infrastructure projects is to ensure input from members of the external community who build, operate, and utilize research facilities. Furthermore, while NSF has strategies for the process of funding awards, it does not generally address the oversight needs to ensure that funding recipients meet the awards\u2019 requirements.

Our prior year\u2019s review noted that NSF did not discuss either its reasons for falling short of a performance goal or its strategies for attaining the goal in the future. NSF\u2019s 2000 report corrected this weakness. For example, regarding the technology-related goal to submit, review, and process proposals electronically, the report states that the reason for not achieving the goal was due to the technological, financial, and legal issues related to electronic signatures. The strategy for addressing the technological issue was to demonstrate the paperless review capability by conducting 10 pilot paperless projects in 2001 that manage the review process in an electronic environment. We also questioned the quality of the information in the 1999 performance report, noting that it provided virtually no assurance that the information was credible. As mentioned earlier, NSF contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers to review aspects of its GPRA data collection efforts and its performance assessment results. PricewaterhouseCoopers found no basis for questioning the integrity of the results.", "NSF can improve its future reports in several ways. The results of the independent committees\u2019 reviews would benefit from more detailed information, such as including all of the areas of emphasis and the results. In addition, last year, we noted that the 1999 performance report did not describe NSF\u2019s financial role in the examples of scientific successes presented. Such information, we said, would help to judge the extent of NSF\u2019s role in achieving these successes. NSF officials maintain that determining NSF\u2019s financial role in these successes would be extremely difficult and would take a considerable effort.

The 2002 plan includes a new section on the means and strategies for success. For example, for its new goal of award oversight and management, NSF will ensure that the internal committee reviewing the oversight activities for large infrastructure projects has broad disciplinary expertise and experience in managing facilities. As previously mentioned, NSF is also addressing data quality concerns, providing confidence that future performance information will be credible. Furthermore, NSF revised its outcome goal such that it does not have to succeed in demonstrating significant achievement in discoveries that advance the frontiers of science, engineering, or technology. Rather, discoveries is now one of six performance indicators for which NSF will consider itself successful when a majority is achieved.
