EOS has three major components: (1) a constellation of satellites designed to collect at least 15 years of key climate-related data; (2) a data and information system designed to operate the satellites and process, archive, and distribute the data; and (3) teams of scientists who develop algorithms for converting sensor data into useful information and conduct basic research using the information. The satellites, and data and information system, which will absorb most of the program\u2019s funding, provide the researchers with measurements that will enable them to address established research priorities.", "EOS is designed to make 24 types of long-term measurements of solar irradiance and the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land cover, ice sheets, and oceans from orbiting spacecraft. By 2002, when the full constellation will be in orbit, EOS will be generating data from 25 instruments on at least  10 spacecraft. Over the 20-year EOS data-collection phase, about  80 instruments will be launched on more than 30 satellites. As currently planned, the last EOS satellite will cease operations in 2020.", "EOS measurements will support researchers\u2019 efforts to address Mission to Planet Earth\u2019s research priorities: (1) determine the causes and consequences of changes in atmospheric ozone; (2) improve seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction; (3) determine the mechanisms of long-term climate variability; (4) document changes in land cover, biodiversity, and global productivity; and (5) understand earth processes that can lead to natural disasters and develop risk assessment capabilities for vulnerable regions.", "Mission to Planet Earth is NASA\u2019s contribution to the governmentwide U.S. Global Change Research Program. An important goal of these interconnected efforts is to improve the predictive capability of numerical earth system models, especially global climate models that investigate and predict the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. NASA has identified a potentially large and diverse \u201cuser community\u201d for EOS-related information. Members of this community could be, for example, educators, businessmen, and public policymakers. The focus of our analysis, however, is the EOS basic research community, by which we mean NASA\u2019s currently funded EOS interdisciplinary science and instrument investigations.", "In our June 1995 report, we estimated that funding requirements of the EOS baseline program would total about $33 billion for fiscal years 1991 to 2022. This estimate was developed for the program described in NASA\u2019s 1995 EOS reference handbook and included costs for satellites, launch services, data systems, science, construction of facilities, and civil service personnel. However, NASA later recognized that this program was not affordable in an environment of declining budgets and began studying ways to cut costs by using advanced technology and increasing collaboration with other agencies, international partners, and the commercial sector. NASA intended to use these future savings to fund more science under EOS and to reduce the program\u2019s total cost. Over the past several years, the Congress has progressively reduced NASA\u2019s planned spending on EOS for fiscal years 1990 to 2000 from $17 billion to $7.25 billion. In response, NASA changed EOS in 1991 and 1992 from a complete earth system measuring program that would have supported a wide array of global change investigations to a measurement program that will primarily support investigations of global changes to the earth\u2019s climate. For example, NASA dropped the measurement of upper atmospheric chemistry and solid earth processes. Other changes followed in order to further adjust EOS to its progressively lower budget profile through 2000. NASA officials stated the current planned spending for EOS through 2000 is about $6.8 billion.", "The administration\u2019s fiscal year 1997 request for Mission to Planet Earth is $1.402 billion, of which $846.8 million is for development of EOS\u2019 data and information system, spacecraft, instruments, and algorithms. NASA\u2019s request includes $47.5 million for EOS interdisciplinary science. According to NASA\u2019s 5-year plan based on its fiscal year 1996 budget submission, NASA intends to increase spending on EOS interdisciplinary science to $73.2 million per year in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA\u2019s Strategy for Developing EOS\u2019 Basic Research Community", "paragraphs": ["Like EOS-related space systems and information systems, the development of the EOS basic research community that will conduct interdisciplinary global climate change research requires planning. The current number of EOS investigations funded by NASA is relatively small, and NASA recognizes that it needs to increase their number, broaden the membership of EOS science teams, and take other steps to develop and sustain an EOS-era research community. NASA\u2019s strategy for developing the EOS research community is partly based on increased funding. In 1995, it began efforts to fund additional investigations and to reevaluate the current investigations. NASA\u2019s ability to add more investigations is uncertain within its expected future budgets, especially if it must depend on savings from improved technology and increased collaboration with others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Number of EOS Investigations Is Relatively Small", "paragraphs": ["The EOS program is currently funding 29 interdisciplinary science investigations that were selected in 1989 and 1990 to use data from EOS instruments in more than one earth science discipline, such as geology, oceanography, meteorology, and climatology. Scientists associated with these investigations serve as members of the Investigator Working Group, developing detailed science plans and assisting NASA in optimizing the scientific return of the EOS mission. Currently, these 29 investigations are led by 31 interdisciplinary principal investigators (2 of the interdisciplinary science investigations have coprincipal investigators). There are 354 coinvestigators associated with the 29 interdisciplinary science investigations, as well as 20 instrument principal investigators/team leaders and 197 other instrument team members.", "The number of EOS investigations is relatively small when compared with (1) the number of currently funded investigations associated with two pre-EOS missions\u2014the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and the U.S.-French Oceanography Satellite Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX/Poseidon)\u2014to their EOS-era counterparts and (2) the ratio of the number of investigations to the raw data acquisition rate expected from instruments on EOS spacecraft to the number of investigations and raw data acquisition rates of UARS and TOPEX.", "The comparison is based on the following EOS spacecraft and instruments: AM; PM; Chemistry mission (CHEM); Landsat-7; Radar ALT; Laser ALT; Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III on space station; and Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE), Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM), and Clouds and Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) on flights of opportunity. The data rates of the EOS spacecraft and UARS/TOPEX are not strictly comparable because the instruments on the latter satellites do not directly observe the Earth. Imaging instruments are more data intensive than nonimaging instruments. However, data rate comparisons can serve as a rough indicator of the magnitude of potential research opportunities afforded by EOS and two pre-EOS-era missions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used similar comparisons in its 1993 and 1995 editions of the EOS reference handbook. In the 1995 edition, NASA graphically compared the combined data rates of EOS-era satellites with the combined data rates of numerous pre-EOS-era (including UARS and TOPEX) and foreign satellites to demonstrate that the magnitude of potential research opportunities for EOS is much greater than for other combinations of Earth-sensing satellites. In its handbooks, NASA depicted the data streams flowing from the two groups of satellites to \u201c10,000 users\u201d in the 1993 edition and a more vaguely defined \u201cuser community\u201d in the 1995 edition. In place of the broadly defined \u201cusers\u201d and user community, we used the actual number of currently funded EOS, UARS, and TOPEX investigations to illustrate (1) that the magnitude of potential EOS basic research opportunities is much greater than those afforded by UARS and TOPEX (as indicated by their respective data rates) and (2) that the number of currently funded EOS investigations is small compared to the number of currently funded UARS and TOPEX investigations.", "UARS, launched in September 1991, consists of 10 instruments that are measuring the composition and temperature of the upper atmosphere, atmospheric winds, and energy from the sun. The UARS science investigations are led by 22 teams. NASA broadened the UARS science investigations in 1994 by selecting 40 additional teams led by \u201cguest\u201d investigators. It is also funding correlative measurement investigations led by 38 teams to develop an independent database to validate and complement measurements made by UARS\u2019 instruments. In the EOS era, solar energy and atmospheric chemistry measurements will be made principally by the ACRIM, SAGE, and SOLSTICE instruments and the CHEM spacecraft. Currently, only 12 instrument and interdisciplinary science investigations are associated with these instruments and the CHEM spacecraft. In contrast, UARS supports research conducted by  62 instrument and science teams.", "TOPEX was launched in August 1992 to study the circulation of the world\u2019s oceans. The primary instrument is an altimeter that measures the height of the satellite above the ocean, wind speed, and wave height. NASA and its French partner, Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales, selected 38 science investigations. The 38 TOPEX-related science teams have about 200 members, and NASA plans to solicit additional investigations. In the EOS era, the follow-on mission to TOPEX is Radar-ALT. An instrument team has not yet been selected, but only 7 of the 29 interdisciplinary science investigations currently plan to use Radar-ALT data.", "There is a large difference between the number of (1) currently funded EOS investigations and the expected volume of data from EOS and (2) the currently funded UARS and TOPEX investigations and volume of data of these two pre-EOS missions. The combined number of the UARS and TOPEX science investigations is a little larger than the current number of EOS investigations, even though EOS\u2019 data rate (our indicator of the magnitude of potential research opportunities) is close to 1,000 times greater than the combined data rate of UARS and TOPEX. EOS will provide up to 42 million bits of data per second to 49 interdisciplinary science and instrument investigations. The corresponding ratio for UARS and TOPEX is a total of 48 thousand bits of data per second to 60 investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA\u2019s Strategy to Expand EOS Research Community", "paragraphs": ["The National Research Council\u2019s Board on Sustainable Development reviewed the U.S. Global Change Research Program, Mission to Planet Earth, and EOS in 1995 and stated that one of the \u201cfundamental guiding principles\u201d of the U.S. Global Change Research Program is an \u201copen and accessible program\u201d that will \u201cencourage broad participation\u201d by the government, academic, and private sectors. Some NASA officials and EOS investigators are concerned that the Earth sciences research community perceives EOS\u2019 science teams as a \u201cclosed shop,\u201d whereby membership on a current team is a precondition for conducting future EOS-related research.", "To counter this perception, NASA\u2019s current strategy to expand the EOS research community involves (1) an open data access policy and (2) efforts to broaden and change the current community by adding investigations, reevaluating the current science investigations, and recruiting new investigators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EOS Data Policy", "paragraphs": ["A vital part of the EOS data policy is that EOS data will be available to everyone: there will be no period of exclusive access for funded investigators. This has not always been NASA\u2019s policy. On some past Earth observing missions, funded investigators had exclusive use of the data for an extended period of time. For example, the original investigators associated with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite had exclusive access to the first year\u2019s data for up to 2 years. EOS data users as a rule will not be charged more than the cost of distributing data to them. The data policy contemplates a variety of potential user groups, not all of whom will be engaged in basic research. In 1995, NASA sponsored a conference to better define the user groups. The conferees identified 12 potential user groups, of which only 3 were primarily composed of scientists. The others included commercial users, resource planners, and educational groups.", "NASA officials stated that about 10,000 Earth scientists might use EOS-related data. Even with the large size of this potential research community and the open-access data policy, the sufficiency of EOS investigations might appear to be the least of NASA\u2019s problems. Even though 10,000 Earth scientists may be potential users of EOS data, they still need to be funded to conduct basic research. According to NASA officials, as a general rule, for this type of work, scientists analyze data when they are paid to do so.", "We sought to confirm this observation by reviewing the authorship of  172 journal articles about 2 pre-EOS-era satellites\u2014UARS and TOPEX/Poseidon. Our review showed that publicly funded investigators wrote all but 10 of the articles. We reviewed the authorship of UARS and TOPEX articles published in scientific journals from the approximate dates of launch through May 1995; these articles were selected from a database consisting of about 4,500 periodicals. The principal investigators wrote 123 (72 percent) of the 172 articles. In addition, we identified two other kinds of investigators probably associated with the principal investigators and/or government funded\u2014that is, investigators associated with the principal investigator\u2019s institution (most often a university or government agency) or another government agency. These \u201cassociate\u201d investigators wrote 39 (23 percent) of the journal articles.", "Not all people who get Earth sciences data use it to do basic research. For example, from January through May 1995, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent 55,521 TOPEX-related data files to 28,495 requesters through the Internet. This figure does not necessarily represent separate requesters. The laboratory does not know how these requesters use TOPEX data, but according to a laboratory official, data accessed through the Internet is generally not sufficient for doing basic research. Investigators want less processed data for this type of research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adding Investigations", "paragraphs": ["NASA originally solicited proposals for EOS interdisciplinary science and instrument investigations in January 1988. The solicitation noted that NASA planned to fund 10 to 20 science investigations, with other selections possible before the launch of the first EOS platform, then scheduled for late 1995. NASA received 458 proposals in response to its solicitation, including about 250 for interdisciplinary science investigations. As previously noted, 29 interdisciplinary science and 20 instrument investigations are being funded by NASA and its international partners. The lifetime of the science investigations was to extend for 4 years beyond the launch of the first satellite, or until 1999. In other words, NASA intended to add to this first group of investigations over a 10-year period (1989 to 1999). However, at a minimum, the lifetime of this first group of investigations has been extended to 13 years (1989 to 2002, including 4 years beyond AM-1\u2019s 1998 launch date).", "NASA\u2019s plan to supplement the first group of science investigations with a second group within 6 years was not too optimistic given its funding expectations at that time. NASA\u2019s EOS mission planning (1982-87) took place during a time of expanding resources. During the 1980s, NASA\u2019s funding increased each year, essentially doubling from about $5 billion to $10 billion between fiscal years 1981 and 1989.", "NASA has recognized that more EOS investigations are needed, and last year it took a first step to add more. NASA solicited proposals in September 1995 to address, among other things, specific interdisciplinary science issues that are not well covered by existing NASA-funded investigations. It received 134 interdisciplinary science proposals and hopes to add 20 to 25 investigations with grants of about $250,000 to $400,000 per year for a period of up to 3 years.", "NASA is funding the interdisciplinary science part of the September 1995 solicitation with a $9-million \u201cfunding wedge\u201d created, in part, from reductions in the previously planned funding levels for some existing EOS investigations.

Instead, NASA is asking for proposals on interdisciplinary research that primarily uses existing data sets from past satellite missions and field experiments.The nature and membership of the EOS science teams has largely remained unchanged for 6 years. According to NASA officials, this longevity has created a perception among some Earth scientists that currently funded investigators constitute a \u201cclosed shop.\u201d NASA attempted to correct this perception by conducting an internal program review in 1992 and 1993 and an external peer review in 1995 and 1996. The review by EOS investigators\u2019 peers in the Earth sciences research community is not yet finished, but it could lead to the possible deselection and recompetition of some EOS interdisciplinary science teams. NASA opted for the peer review, rather than have all the current investigations reevaluated as part of a new solicitation for proposals.", "NASA\u2019s 1992-93 program review found weaknesses in many interdisciplinary science teams. The reviewers generally found that only 30 percent of 23 investigations could be rated \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of science-related assessment measures.

The Committee, however, rejected the idea that the existing investigations should be evaluated through a new competition. It noted that a new competition could cause a loss of credibility with EOS supporters and that many interdisciplinary science teams had committed themselves \u201cfar beyond\u201d just their science tasks.", "In contrast, NASA struck a different balance between continuity and change in the pre-EOS-era U.S.-Japan Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. The goal of the spacecraft\u2019s three principal instruments is to measure rainfall more accurately than before, particularly over the tropical oceans. The science of a long-term investigatory group was reevaluated after 3 years by holding a new funding competition for this program. NASA and Japan\u2019s National Space Development Agency first solicited research proposals in 1990 for a possible launch in 1994. Both agencies selected a total of 35 investigators.
