NNSA is responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and naval reactors programs. Since its creation, NNSA has continued to experience security problems, such as unauthorized access to a NNSA unclassified computer system, and cost and schedule overruns on its major projects, such as the National Ignition Facility. GAO reviewed the extent to which NNSA has taken steps to (1) improve security at its laboratories and plants and (2) improve its management practices and revise its organizational structure. To carry out its work, GAO reviewed legislation; NNSA policies, plans and budgets; and interviewed current and former NNSA and DOE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although NNSA has begun to build an effective security organization, it still cannot demonstrate that all of its security program objectives are being met at all of its sites. Specifically, the results of internal and independent security oversight assessments have identified weaknesses in physical security at several NNSA sites, including the Nevada Test Site, Sandia National Laboratories and the Y-12 National Security Complex, and weaknesses in cyber security throughout NNSA. The following factors have contributed to this situation: Weak organization of headquarters security. Until recently, NNSA did not have consistent leadership or direction at the headquarters level for its security program. Security staffing shortages at NNSA site offices. Since NNSA became operational, five of its six site offices have not been staffed at the required levels, according to GAO's analysis. Site offices oversee NNSA contractor security operations. Inadequate security staff training. NNSA has not implemented a training program that provides federal security officials with the skills needed to effectively oversee contractor security programs. Incomplete security data. DOE's database for tracking security deficiencies identified by security oversight assessments is incomplete, and, as a result, NNSA lacks a comprehensive understanding of the overall effectiveness of its security program. NNSA has taken several actions to improve its management practices, including developing a planning, programming, budgeting and evaluation process. However, management problems continue, in part, because NNSA and DOE have not fully agreed on how NNSA should function within the department as a separately organized agency. This lack of agreement has resulted in organizational conflicts that have inhibited effective operations. GAO also identified the following areas where additional management improvements are needed: Project management. NNSA has not developed a project management policy, implemented a plan for improving its project management efforts, and fully shared project management lessons learned between its sites. Program management. NNSA has not identified all of its program managers and trained them to a certified level of competency. Financial management. NNSA has not established an independent analysis unit to review program budget proposals, confirm cost estimates, and analyze budget alternatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the late 1990s, the Department of Energy (DOE) experienced  management difficulties with its nuclear weapons programs\u2014particularly  with the lack of clear management authority and responsibility\u2014that  contributed to security problems at the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons  laboratories and significant cost overruns on major projects. According to  a June 1999 report by the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  (the Board), DOE\u2019s management of the nuclear weapons laboratories,  while representing \u201cscience at its best,\u201d also embodied \u201csecurity at its  worst\u201d because of \u201corganizational disarray, managerial neglect, and \u2026a  culture of arrogance.\u201d", "The Board urged the Congress to create a new organization to oversee the  nuclear weapons complex and to insulate it from DOE. The Board stressed  that the new organization, whether established as an independent agency  or a semi-autonomous entity within DOE, should have a clear mission,  streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of authority and  accountability. Responding to the Board\u2019s recommendations, in 1999, the  Congress created the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  under Title 32 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2000\u2014the NNSA Act\u2014to correct the problems identified.", "The NNSA Act established NNSA as a \u201cseparately organized agency\u201d within  DOE and made NNSA responsible for the management and security of the  nation\u2019s nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactor  programs. To implement its programs, NNSA relies on contractors to  manage day-to-day site operations and to adhere to DOE policies when  operating the laboratories, production plants, and other facilities within the  complex. Because many NNSA sites handle special nuclear material,  including nuclear weapons, plutonium, and highly enriched uranium,  effective federal oversight is critical to ensuring that national security,  human health and safety, and the environment are not harmed.", "The NNSA Act also established the position of DOE Under Secretary for  Nuclear Security, who was also designated as the Administrator of NNSA.  The Secretary of Energy and the Deputy Secretary of Energy were allowed  to establish policy for NNSA and to give direction to NNSA through the  Administrator; however, other DOE employees were prohibited from  directing the activities of individual NNSA employees. Furthermore, the  NNSA Act established, within NNSA, deputy administrators for defense,  nonproliferation, and naval reactors programs. Finally, the NNSA Act  required that, among other things, NNSA develop a planning, programming,  and budgeting process in order to ensure that the administration operated  under sound financial management principles.", "Since its inception, however, NNSA has continued to experience both  security and overall management problems. For example, with respect to  security, in 2003 we reported that NNSA had not been fully effective in  managing its safeguards and security program. Specifically, we found that  NNSA had not fully defined the roles and responsibilities of officials in its  security program and that NNSA had shortfalls in security staff at the site  offices that oversee its contractors. In addition, two NNSA studies  commissioned in July 2003 found ongoing problems with NNSA\u2019s security  program, including weaknesses in its security culture, organization, and  staffing and training. Finally, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General found  security problems with NNSA\u2019s contractors, including inadequate control of  firearms inventories and improprieties in the testing of the officers who  protect NNSA\u2019s sites. In terms of the management of major projects, the  National Ignition Facility and the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic  Test Facility\u2014two major facilities needed to support NNSA\u2019s nuclear  weapons programs\u2014experienced major delays and cost overruns because  of problems with project management and are still not complete.", "To implement the NNSA Act and in response to these problems, NNSA has  initiated a series of improvements, including recently creating a new NNSA  headquarters unit to oversee security across the nuclear weapons complex;  establishing a planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation process;  and putting in place a policy to improve program management. In addition,  in December 2002, the Administrator reorganized NNSA. Specifically, the  Administrator (1) removed a layer of management by abolishing NNSA\u2019s  three operations offices located in New Mexico, Nevada, and California; (2)  removed some functions from a fourth operations office at Oak Ridge,  Tennessee, and established the Y-12 site office; (3) strengthened the  oversight role of its site offices; (4) consolidated business and technical  support functions, such as procurement and contracting, into a single  \u201cservice center\u201d organization located in Albuquerque, New Mexico; and (5)  reduced NNSA\u2019s staff by about 17 percent by the end of fiscal year 2004.", "In this context, you asked us to evaluate the extent to which NNSA has  taken steps to (1) improve security at its laboratories and plants and (2)  improve its management practices and revise its organizational structure.", "To evaluate the extent to which NNSA has taken steps to improve security  at its laboratories and plants, we reviewed the security requirements  contained in DOE directives. We met with security officials from NNSA  headquarters and the NNSA Service Center in Albuquerque; and at the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Nevada Test Site, Sandia  National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Pantex and Y-12  National Security Complex site offices. We also met with security  contractor officials at the Livermore, Nevada, Sandia, Los Alamos, and Y- 12, as well as with officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and  Security (formerly the Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance). In addition, we met with former DOE and NNSA officials,  including the Director of NNSA\u2019s Security Workforce Panel, and the  Director of the NNSA Security Panel. In reviewing the extent to which  NNSA has taken steps to improve security at its laboratories and plants, we  collected and analyzed performance ratings contained in security oversight  reports, issued by DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety and Security and NNSA  site offices, from fiscal years 1996 through 2005. We used these  performance ratings because there was wide agreement among NNSA and  DOE security officials that these ratings represented the best available  information on the overall performance of NNSA\u2019s safeguards and security  program. To assess the reliability of security oversight report ratings, we  (1) reviewed existing information about the methodology and timeframes  used in making performance rating determinations; (2) interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials; and (3) based on document reviews,  ensured that we had received all available performance information. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We also used reports on NNSA\u2019s security efforts prepared by GAO,  the DOE Inspector General, and outside groups, such as a 2005 report  commissioned by NNSA. To address the extent of security staffing  shortfalls, we collected and analyzed staffing data provided by NNSA site  offices. We relied primarily on staffing data from the NNSA site offices, as  this data was the most comprehensive and because these offices are  responsible for processing and managing security staffing requirements. To  assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed NNSA security officials  who were responsible for compiling these data and performed basic  reasonableness checks of the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. Finally, we reviewed  documents related to NNSA\u2019s efforts to improve the organization and  operation of its security oversight program.", "To evaluate the extent to which NNSA has taken steps to improve its  management practices and revise its organizational structure, we reviewed  the NNSA Act as well as two House of Representatives reports in 2000 on the act\u2019s implementation. Because the establishment of NNSA as a  separately organized agency in DOE was a key provision of the NNSA Act,  we met with officials from NNSA headquarters; the NNSA Service Center;  the NNSA site offices; and DOE offices where NNSA and DOE need to  interact, including DOE\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  (formerly the Office of Counterintelligence), Chief Financial Officer, Chief  Information Officer, General Counsel, and Human Capital Management. To  understand how NNSA and DOE were intended to interact, we interviewed  officials and reviewed documents, such as DOE\u2019s January 2000  implementation plan for NNSA. We also interviewed officials with the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the  Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Department of Transportation\u2019s  Federal Aviation Administration to obtain their views on the reporting  relationships that need to be in place for an entity designated as a  \u201cseparately organized agency\u201d to succeed. We contacted the first two  agencies cited because they were identified in the Board\u2019s June 1999 report  as good models of a separately organized agency. We contacted the latter  two agencies cited after consultation with staff in your offices. We also  interviewed former NNSA and DOE officials, including the first and second  Administrators and Deputy Secretary of Energy, who helped establish  NNSA, to get their perspective on the difficulties involved in creating a  separately organized agency within a department.", "With respect to other management improvements, we met with officials  from NNSA headquarters, the NNSA Service Center, NNSA site offices, and  NNSA contractors; and various DOE offices, including the Office of  Engineering and Construction Management. To develop information on the  status of NNSA\u2019s efforts to improve project and program management, we  analyzed DOE\u2019s annual performance and accountability reports;  construction project data from NNSA\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 1995  through 2005; and DOE program management performance information.  Finally, we reviewed documents on NNSA\u2019s planning, programming,  budgeting, and evaluation process and human capital efforts.", "We conducted our work from March 2005 to January 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards, which included an  assessment of data reliability and internal controls."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NNSA conducts its activities at research and development laboratories,  production plants, and other facilities (collectively referred to as the  nuclear weapons complex). Specifically, NNSA operates three national  laboratories that design nuclear weapons\u2014Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory, California; Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico; and  the Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico and California; and four  nuclear weapons production sites\u2014the Pantex Plant, Texas; the Y-12  National Security Complex, Tennessee; the Kansas City Plant, Missouri;  and parts of the Savannah River Site, South Carolina; as well as the Nevada  Test Site.", "To implement its programs, NNSA received about $9.1 billion for fiscal year  2006, including almost $6.4 billion for its nuclear weapons activities, about  $1.6 billion for its defense nuclear nonproliferation programs, and about  $782 million for the Naval Reactors program. NNSA\u2019s appropriation also  included about $766 million to provide security at its sites. NNSA requested  over $9.3 billion for fiscal year 2007, including $6.4 billion for its nuclear  weapons activities, $1.7 billion for its defense nuclear nonproliferation  programs, and $795 million for the Naval Reactors program. According to  NNSA\u2019s Future Years Nuclear Security Program plan, between fiscal years  2007 and 2011, NNSA is proposing to spend almost $48.5 billion on its  nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactors programs.", "For several years before NNSA was established, external studies found  problems with the organization and operation of what is now NNSA\u2019s  principal organization\u2014DOE\u2019s Office of Defense Programs. These studies  cited continuing problems in the areas of overall management,  organization, priority setting, and maintenance of a viable infrastructure  and workforce. For example, the Institute for Defense Analysis\u2019s March  1997 study, often called the \u201c120-Day Study,\u201d cited ambiguities and overlaps  between the roles of headquarters and the field as a primary source of  inefficiencies and conflict. Most influential in the creation of NNSA was  the study conducted by a Special Investigative Panel of the President\u2019s  Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Prepared in response to a series of  security problems, including public access to classified documents at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Board found that DOE was a  dysfunctional bureaucracy incapable of reforming itself and that  reorganization was clearly warranted to resolve security and  counterintelligence problems. As noted earlier, the Board urged the  Congress to create a new organization that, whether established as an  independent agency or a semi-autonomous entity within DOE, should have  a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of  authority and accountability. To correct the problems identified by the  Board and others, in 1999, the Congress created the NNSA.", "For the last several years, we have monitored various high-risk areas  impacting NNSA operations and NNSA actions to implement the NNSA Act.  In January 2001, and again in January 2003, we identified strategic human  capital management as a governmentwide, high-risk area. We found that  the lack of attention to strategic human capital planning had created a risk  to the federal government\u2019s ability to perform its missions economically,  efficiently, and effectively. In that context, we have stated that strategic  workforce planning is needed to address two critical needs:  (1) aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals and (2) developing long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic  goals.", "In April 2001, we testified that NNSA\u2019s efforts to establish a new  organization looked promising. However, we highlighted the need for  NNSA to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of headquarters and  field staff and to establish clear lines of authority between NNSA and its  contractors, among other things. In May 2001, NNSA announced plans to  reorganize its headquarters operations. In December 2001, we noted that  NNSA had set several important goals for its overall reorganization efforts,  including establishing clear and direct lines of communication, clarifying  the roles and responsibilities of NNSA\u2019s headquarters and field offices, and  integrating and balancing priorities across NNSA\u2019s missions and  infrastructure. However, we found that NNSA\u2019s plans for the headquarters  reorganization did not contain a clear definition of the roles and  responsibilities of the headquarters organizational units.", "In addition to reorganizing its headquarters, in February 2002, NNSA  proposed reorganizing its entire operation to solve important, long- standing issues. Specifically, NNSA proposed a new organizational  structure that would (1) remove a layer of management by converting  existing operations offices to one support office, (2) locate NNSA  operational oversight close to laboratories and plants by strengthening its  site offices, and (3) streamline federal staff and hold federal staff and  contractors more accountable. In February 2002, we testified that, with the  proposed new organizational structure, resolution of NNSA\u2019s long-standing  organizational issues appeared to be within NNSA\u2019s grasp. However, we  noted that NNSA\u2019s lack of a long-term strategic approach to ensuring a well- managed workforce precluded it from identifying its current and future  human capital needs, including the size of the workforce; its deployment  across the organization; and the knowledge, skills, and capabilities needed  to fulfill its mission. In December 2002, the Administrator of NNSA  implemented the proposed reorganization.", "Our May 2003 report on the management of NNSA\u2019s security program  identified similar concerns about NNSA\u2019s security organization and  management. Specifically, we found that NNSA (1) had not fully defined  clear roles and responsibilities for its headquarters and site security  operations and (2) had shortfalls at its site offices in the total number of  staff and in expertise, which could make it more difficult for the site offices  to effectively oversee security activities. We therefore concluded that  NNSA could not be assured that its contractors were working to maximum  advantage to protect critical facilities and material from individuals seeking  to inflict damage.", "In June 2004, we found that NNSA\u2019s reorganization had addressed some  past problems by better delineating lines of authority and improving  communication. However, we also found that NNSA\u2019s reorganization had  not ensured that the agency had sufficient staff with the right skills in the  right places because it had downsized its federal workforce by about 17  percent without first determining the critical skills and capabilities needed  to meet its mission and program goals.", "Recently, in response to a July 2005 report by the Secretary of Energy\u2019s  Advisory Board\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Complex Infrastructure Task Force on  the nuclear weapons complex of the future, NNSA changed the reporting  relationship of the site office managers. To facilitate the transformation of  the nuclear weapons complex, the Task Force recommended that the site  office managers begin reporting to the Deputy Administrator for Defense  Programs instead of to the Administrator. The Task Force believed that the  Deputy Administrator was the primary line manager with mission  responsibility for the work conducted at the sites and that this change  would better align responsibility and management of the program. In May  2006, the Administrator made this change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Action Needed to Improve NNSA\u2019s Security Program", "paragraphs": ["Although NNSA has improved its headquarters oversight of security across  the nuclear weapons complex, NNSA continues to experience difficulties  in developing a safeguards and security program that provides reasonable  assurance that all protection objectives are being met, especially at certain  locations and in several topical areas, most notably cyber security,  according to our review of NNSA site office surveys and independent  inspections by DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight. We analyzed the  results of the surveys and inspections because NNSA and DOE security  officials generally agreed that the survey and inspection results  represented the best available information on the overall performance of  NNSA\u2019s security program. While the results of the surveys and inspections  are not entirely consistent, they do identify weaknesses with physical  security at several NNSA sites, including the Nevada Test Site, Los Alamos  National Laboratory, and the Y-12 National Security Complex, and  weaknesses throughout NNSA in the cyber security area. Over the last  several years, NNSA\u2019s security program has been hampered by several  factors, including (1) the lack of an effective headquarters organization, (2)  security staffing shortages at its site offices, (3) the lack of adequate  training resources and opportunities for its site office security staff, and (4)  the lack of metrics to gauge program effectiveness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Is Experiencing Difficulty in Meeting All Security Program Objectives", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE Manual 470.4-1, Safeguards and Security Program  Planning and Management, NNSA must develop a safeguards and security  program that ensures NNSA has the necessary protections in place to  protect its security interests against malevolent acts, such as theft,  diversion, sabotage, modification, compromise, or unauthorized access to  nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons components, special nuclear materials,  or classified and unclassified information. NNSA\u2019s DNS is responsible for  developing the administration\u2019s security program.", "To determine the overall effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s safeguards and security  program, NNSA and DOE principally rely on two types of evaluations.  Specifically, NNSA site offices conduct surveys of contractors\u2019  performance while the Office of Independent Oversight conducts periodic  inspections, typically every 18 months. These evaluations identify the  strengths and weaknesses of NNSA\u2019s security program and provide a basis  for line management to decide on program implementation activities,  including allocating resources and correcting security deficiencies.", "Site Office Surveys. NNSA\u2019s site offices assess the extent to which day-to- day security activities at its contractor-operated laboratories and  production facilities ensure that program objectives are met. According to  DOE\u2019s Safeguards and Security Program Planning and Management  manual, the frequency of these surveys varies from 12 months to 24  months, depending on the site\u2019s importance rating and type of materials  stored at that location. The site office surveys cover 8 topical areas and 33  subtopical areas and are based on observations of performance, including  compliance with DOE and NNSA security directives. Table 1 shows the 8  topical and 33 subtopical safeguards and security areas covered.", "The surveys assign the following color-coded performance ratings to  communicate the extent of performance and compliance with required  procedures and practices, as well as the impact of any deficiencies along  with other mitigating factors:  Satisfactory (Green). The element being evaluated meets protection  objectives or provides reasonable assurance that protection objectives  are being met.", "Marginal (Yellow).

The Office of Independent  Oversight independently evaluates DOE sites, facilities, organizations, and  operations in the areas of safeguards and security, cyber security,  emergency management, and environment, safety, and health programs.  The Office of Independent Oversight inspects both federal and contractor  operations at a site and identifies findings, issues, and opportunities for  improvement. It also performs follow-up reviews to ensure corrective  actions are effective and that weaknesses in the safeguards and security  program are appropriately addressed. As shown in table 2, the Office of  Independent Oversight\u2019s inspections cover eight topical and 36 subtopical  safeguards and security areas.", "As shown in table 2, the Office of Independent Oversight examines areas  that are comparable to those that NNSA site offices assess through their  surveys. Similarly, the Office of Independent Oversight's rating scale is  comparable to the one NNSA site offices use. Specifically, the Office of  Independent Oversight may assign the following color-coded ratings to  overall programs, selected topical areas, or both:    Effective performance (Green). The system inspected provides  reasonable assurance that the identified protection needs are met. That  is, (1) the protection meets all applicable standards, (2) the protection  did not meet all standards, but other systems or compensatory measures  provide equivalent protection, or (3) the failure to fully meet a standard  does not significantly degrade the protection. Line managers are  expected to effectively address any specific deficiencies identified.", "Needs improvement (Yellow). The system inspected only partially  meets identified protection needs or provides questionable assurance  that the identified protection needs are met. That is, one or more  applicable standards are not met and are only partially compensated for  by other systems, and the resulting deficiencies degrade the  effectiveness of the inspected system.

In response to these findings, DOE requires that contractors  develop corrective actions to correct the security deficiencies. These  corrective actions include risk assessment, root cause and cost-benefit  analyses. To facilitate the tracking of security findings and the development  of corrective actions by the responsible organization, DOE Manual 470.4-1  requires site office and the Office of Independent Oversight staff to ensure  that findings are entered into the Safeguards and Security Information  Management System (SSIMS) \u2014a centralized information management  system\u2014in a timely manner."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Site Office Survey and Office of Independent Oversight Inspection Results, While Not Entirely Consistent, Identify Several Problem Areas", "paragraphs": ["To evaluate the extent to which NNSA has addressed security issues at its  laboratories and plants, we reviewed and compared the results of NNSA\u2019s  site office surveys and DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight inspections  for the 5-year period before the administration became operational\u2014fiscal  years 1996 through 2000\u2014and the 5-year period after it became  operational\u2014fiscal years 2001 through 2005. While the results of these  surveys and inspections are not entirely consistent, they do indicate that  NNSA continues to experience difficulties in implementing a safeguards  and security program that provides reasonable assurance that all  protection objectives are being met, especially at certain locations and in  several topical areas, most notably cyber security.", "Initially, we totaled the ratings given to each topical area shown in table 2  and determined the cumulative percent of ratings that resulted in either a  satisfactory, marginal, or unsatisfactory rating. With respect to the site  office surveys, the cumulative percentage of topical areas that received a  satisfactory rating declined slightly between the two periods. Specifically,  as shown in table 3, 86 percent of the areas covered by the survey received  a satisfactory rating for the period before NNSA became operational, while  81 percent received a satisfactory rating after NNSA was established.", "The results for our analysis of the overall Office of Independent Oversight  results showed a different picture. Specifically, while 82 percent of the  areas covered by the Office of Independent Oversight inspections received  a satisfactory rating for the period before NNSA became operational, only  52 percent received a satisfactory rating after NNSA was established. Most  notably, the percentage of areas receiving a marginal rating increased from  16 percent for the period 1996 through 2000 to 39 percent for 2001 through  2005.", "Because of (1) the importance of physical security in response to the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and (2) ongoing concerns about the  vulnerability of DOE computer systems to cyber security attacks, and to  identify where the differences were occurring between the NNSA site  office survey and the Office of Independent Oversight inspection results,  we analyzed the results for the physical security and cyber security topical  areas in the NNSA site office surveys and the Office of Independent  Oversight inspections for the 5-year period before the administration  became operational\u2014fiscal years 1996 through 2000\u2014and the 5-year  period after it became operational\u2014fiscal years 2001 through 2005.", "With respect to physical security, as shown in table 4, for the site office  surveys, the cumulative percentage of physical security topical areas that  received a satisfactory rating remained relatively unchanged between the  two periods for the seven sites we reviewed. In each period, slightly more  than 80 percent of the assessments resulted in a satisfactory rating, even as  physical security requirements have been strengthened in response to the  September 11, 2001 attacks.", "While the site surveys showed relatively little change between the periods  reviewed, the Office of Independent Oversight\u2019s evaluation of physical  security showed a pronounced decline. Specifically, as shown in table 4,  while about 80 percent of the Office of Independent Oversight\u2019s physical  security assessments resulted in a satisfactory rating for the period  between fiscal years 1996 and 2000, only about 49 percent of the Office of  Independent Oversight\u2019s physical security ratings were satisfactory for the  period of fiscal year 2001 through 2005.", "Several factors contributed to the differences between the NNSA site office  ratings and the Office of Independent Oversight inspections for physical  security. First, while more site offices surveys were performed in fiscal  years 2001 through 2005 than the Office of Independent Oversight  inspections, proportionately more Office of Independent Oversight ratings  were marginal and unsatisfactory. In particular, we found that at three  sites\u2014the Nevada Test Site; Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico;  and the Y-12 National Security Complex\u2014over half of the Office of  Independent Oversight ratings were either marginal or unsatisfactory. In  contrast, only the Y-12 National Security Complex\u2019s site office surveys had  more than 50 percent of the ratings as marginal or unsatisfactory over the  same period. Moreover, the Office of Independent Oversight inspections  had a higher percentage of marginal and unsatisfactory ratings in the  Physical Security Systems, Classified Matter Protection and Control, and  Materials Control and Accountability topical areas than did the site office  surveys.", "With respect to cyber security, both the site office surveys and the Office of  Independent Oversight inspections show declines. Specifically, as shown in  table 5, 92 percent of the cyber security assessments in NNSA site office  surveys resulted in a satisfactory rating for both classified and unclassified  cyber security before NNSA was operational, but only 77 percent of the  assessments resulted in a satisfactory rating after NNSA became  operational.", "Similarly, Office of Independent Oversight inspection results also indicated  that cyber security performance had declined. Before NNSA became  operational, 86 percent of cyber security assessments resulted in  satisfactory ratings, compared with only 60 percent after NNSA became  operational.", "With respect to the individual sites, the Office of Independent Oversight  inspections gave the most marginal or unsatisfactory ratings for cyber  security to four sites:  Los Alamos National Laboratory; Pantex; Sandia  National Laboratories, New Mexico; and the Y-12 National Security  Complex. In contrast, the NNSA site office surveys assigned marginal  ratings to every NNSA site.", "Concerns about cyber security were also raised in one of the two  independent analyses NNSA commissioned in July 2003 and by NNSA  officials with whom we spoke. Specifically, one analysis, NNSA Security:  An Independent Review, found that NNSA cyber security policies,  procedures and practices were less mature than their counterparts in other  security disciplines. Furthermore, the review found that NNSA was  \u201cresource poor\u201d and cyber security implementation varied widely  throughout NNSA because of inadequate funding, insufficient cyber  security personnel and expertise, and inadequate collaboration between  DOE and NNSA cyber security organizations. According to current and  former NNSA officials, and several site office security directors, the cyber  security program has received inadequate attention and was poorly  implemented because NNSA lacks a risk-based approach to physical and  cyber security. In this regard, in June 2006, DOE officials revealed that a  hacker had attacked an unclassified computer system at NNSA\u2019s Service  Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had gained access to a file  containing the names and social security numbers of over 1,500 NNSA  employees.", "More recently, in September 2006, DOE\u2019s Inspector General reported on the  weaknesses associated with the department\u2019s cyber security programs,  including NNSA\u2019s. According to the Inspector General, while DOE has made  progress in addressing some cyber-related problems, ongoing problems  continue to place DOE\u2019s critical information systems and data at risk of  compromise. The report cited weaknesses in the following areas:  systems  inventory, certification, and accreditation; contingency planning; access  controls; and configuration management and change controls. These  problems occurred, in part, because program and field offices did not  always implement departmental and federal cyber security requirements.  For example, the Inspector General reported, NNSA site officials stated  that they were required to comply with NNSA cyber security policy, rather  than standards established by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST). However, the DOE Inspector General also found that  NNSA sites had not fully implemented NNSA\u2019s cyber security policy and  that many NNSA field sites were permitted to follow a less thorough  certification and accreditation process that did not include all NIST or  NNSA requirements.", "Some of the differences between the site office survey and the Office of  Independent Oversight inspection results may be due to continued  differences in how each organization conducts its evaluations. We and  other oversight organizations have reviewed this issue over the last 6 years.  For example, in February 2000, we reported that from 1994 through 1999,  the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory received inconsistent oversight ratings. During a given year,  Los Alamos National Laboratory received ratings ranging from marginal to  excellent, depending on the DOE organization conducting the assessment.  Similarly, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory received ratings  ranging from marginal to far exceeds expectations. We reported that this  inconsistency resulted, in part, from various organizations\u2019 use of different  criteria as well as the timing of the rating. Similarly, in May 2000, DOE\u2019s  Office of Inspector General reported on various factors affecting the  safeguards and security ratings and found that certain security ratings were  changed without a documented rationale.", "More recently, in 2005, the Office of Independent Oversight issued a report  on the inconsistencies in safeguards and security ratings. Specifically, the  report noted that the Office of Independent Oversight tended to identify  significant safeguards and security program deficiencies that the site office  surveys did not detect. Furthermore, the report identified several major  weaknesses commonly found in survey programs, including a lack of  comprehensiveness in conducting surveys; insufficient, or insufficiently  rigorous, performance testing; a reluctance to assign formal findings when  deficiencies were identified; and the lack of sufficient detail to justify, or  even to explain, the assigned ratings in some survey reports."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Have Contributed to Problems in NNSA\u2019s Safeguards and Security Program", "paragraphs": ["Because many NNSA sites handle special nuclear material, including  nuclear weapons, plutonium, and highly enriched uranium, effective  federal oversight is critical to ensuring that the national security is not  harmed. While NNSA has recently improved its headquarters oversight of  security, it has been hampered over the last 7 years by several factors,  including (1) the lack of an effective headquarters organization, (2) security  staffing shortages at its site offices, (3) lack of adequate training resources  and opportunities for its site office security staff, and (4) the lack of a  complete security information database and framework for evaluating  security review results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Has Had Difficulty Developing an Effective Headquarters Security Organization", "paragraphs": ["Under GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  federal agencies must establish and maintain an effective system of internal  controls over their operations. Such a system is the first line of defense in  safeguarding assets and preventing and detecting errors. Under our  standards, managers should, among other things, ensure that (1) the  organizational structure clearly defines key areas of authority and  responsibility, (2) staff have the required skills to meet organizational  objectives, (3) progress can be effectively measured, and (4) operations  can be effectively monitored. However, during much of its history, NNSA\u2019s  security program has experienced the following organizational issues:    Initial organizational arrangements were not productive. The NNSA  Act established the position of Chief of DNS to advise the NNSA  Administrator on security-related matters and implement the security  policies directed by the Secretary and the Administrator. NNSA also  established the Nuclear Safeguards and Security Program (NSSP) within  NNSA\u2019s Facilities and Operations organization to provide assistance to  NNSA\u2019s site offices on such issues as implementing the Design Basis  Threat and developing budget requests for security. However, the  heads of the two offices had strained relations and often disagreed on  how to improve physical security at NNSA facilities. In September 2002,  the NSSP Director was replaced and his position eventually terminated,  and other NSSP staff either retired or left NNSA. As a result, the  effectiveness of the NSSP program was greatly reduced and the field  lost a source of guidance and leadership in NNSA headquarters.", "Leadership turned over several times. NNSA\u2019s headquarters security  organization experienced considerable turnover in the position of Chief  of DNS and changes in the reporting level of that position within NNSA.  Specifically, four individuals have occupied that position since NNSA\u2019s  creation, often in an acting capacity. In addition, these Chiefs have  reported to different levels within NNSA. For example, the original  Chief reported directly to the Administrator of NNSA. However, when  he retired in 2003, his replacement occupied two positions\u2014Chief of  DNS and Associate Administrator for Facilities and Operations\u2014a  practice often referred to as \u201cdual-hatting.\u201d When NNSA reorganized its  headquarters security organization in 2004, the Chief of DNS once again  reported directly to the Administrator. The second Administrator, who  resigned in January 2007, told us that he regretted having dual-hatted the  Chief of DNS position because it lowered the position\u2019s visibility within  NNSA. He believed that it was correct to elevate the current Chief to  serve as an Associate Administrator reporting directly to the  Administrator.", "Without effective leadership, important oversight activities were  ignored. The third Chief of DNS employed only a small staff and took  the position that virtually all headquarters oversight responsibility  rested with the Office of Independent Oversight. This approach was  strongly criticized in the April 2005 NNSA Security, An Independent  Review, which noted that the Office of Independent Oversight had little,  if any, direct responsibility, authority, and accountability for day-to-day  supervision of the NNSA complex and that the Office of Independent  Oversight\u2019s principal role was one of periodic independent performance  assessment.", "To his credit, the current Associate Administrator for DNS has taken  numerous steps to build an effective headquarters security organization.  Specifically, he has  issued a program management plan to establish an integrated, NNSA- wide, performance-based management approach for implementing work  and defining security performance expectations among DNS, NNSA site  offices, and their contractors to ensure full integration of security  requirements with the programmatic missions of NNSA;   issued specific requirements for NNSA\u2019s Performance Assurance  Program, which provides a multi-tiered system of self-assessments and  other reviews of security performance and is aimed at assuring  comprehensive assessments of safeguards and security interests;  improved interaction between NNSA headquarters and site office  security elements. For example, the Associate Administrator  established the Defense Nuclear Security Leadership Coalition, which  comprises all safeguards and security directors and meets regularly to  address security implementation challenges. He also conducts monthly  teleconferences with both federal and contractor security officials at  NNSA sites;  established the Office of Security Oversight to assess safeguards and  security performance, serve as the point of contact for correcting  security deficiencies identified during surveys and independent  inspections, ensure the quality and consistency of federal oversight of  contractor activities, and identify areas for improvement throughout the  weapons complex; and  adopted a more proactive approach to security through stronger  accountability. For example, within the last 2 years, NNSA has replaced  three federal security directors at the Los Alamos, Nevada and Y-12 site  offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Continues to Experience Security Staffing Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["Having sufficient staff to oversee the security programs of its contractors  has been a persistent problem since NNSA\u2019s creation. For example, in our  May 2003 report on the management of NNSA\u2019s security program, we found,  among other things, that NNSA had shortfalls at its site offices in the total  number of security staff and in security expertise, which may have made it  more difficult for the site offices to effectively oversee security activities.  Given this situation, we concluded that NNSA could not be assured that its  contractors were working to maximum advantage to protect critical  facilities and material from individuals seeking to inflict damage. We  raised a similar concern in our June 2004 report on NNSA\u2019s reorganization.  Specifically, we found that NNSA\u2019s reorganization had not ensured that the  agency had sufficient staff with the right skills in the right places because it  had downsized its federal workforce without first determining the critical  skills and capabilities needed to meet its mission and program goals. For  example, we noted that some site offices, namely Pantex, Y-12, and Los  Alamos, were having difficulty filling critical skills in the safety and  security disciplines.", "Complementing our work was an independent analysis commissioned by  NNSA. Specifically, in a March 2004 report, the \u201cChiles Commission\u201d  identified a number of challenges that NNSA faces in recruiting, training,  and retaining enough skilled federal staff members to fill the current and  future security positions needed to effectively oversee the security of its  weapons complex. These challenges included identifying the (1) number  and skills mix of the security staff, (2) near-term retirement eligibility of a  significant percentage of the security workforce, (3) lack of professional  development and training programs, and (4) lack of adequate resources.  The commission found that federal security personnel were managed on a  site-specific basis, noting that NNSA lacked a comprehensive human  capital plan to identify the areas of needed experience, ensure timely  hiring, and manage the skills mix of the federal security workforce across  the complex.", "As part of this review, we assessed the continuing extent of security  staffing shortfalls at NNSA site offices. Specifically, we requested  information on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) security positions  required to conduct effective oversight versus the actual number of FTEs  on board for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. As table 6 shows, three of the  six site offices\u2014the Los Alamos, Livermore and Sandia Site Offices\u2014did  not report information on the required level of staffing needed to  effectively oversee contractors\u2019 security performance for at least 3 of the 5  years for which we requested data. According to site office security  officials at these locations, they could not find the records showing official  staffing shortfalls.", "According to NNSA\u2019s data, five of the six site offices have experienced  security staffing shortfalls during at least one fiscal year. For example,  since fiscal year 2001, the Nevada Site Office has been increasingly  understaffed, and in fiscal year 2005, the Los Alamos Site Office had half of  the required staff it needed to conduct oversight. Consequently, according  to site office security officials, most site offices have only one staff member  responsible for a safeguards and security topical area and do not have  additional staff on board to fill in if necessary. Site offices have  compensated in various ways. For example, the Los Alamos Site Office has  recently obtained detailees from other site office elements to assist in  conducting oversight. According to one Safeguards and Security Director,  security personnel have to work excessive overtime to complete assigned  tasks. Finally, because it does not have a dedicated survey team, the  Nevada Site Office has had to request survey assistance from other site  offices to conduct surveys. According to a former NNSA official involved in  the administration\u2019s initial organization, NNSA did not tailor security  staffing numbers to actual needs and could have better planned its  allocation of staff to site offices during the reorganization.", "To address the lack of security staff, NNSA has taken two actions. First, it  has implemented the Defense Nuclear Security Intern Program. This  program, which was established in 2004 and is administered by the Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory, is designed to attract and train individuals  to fill critical NNSA security positions and support the development of a  qualified, experienced pool of security professionals to supplement site  office staffing. Participants are assigned to a specific NNSA site for 12 to 15  months. Successful interns may have an opportunity for permanent  placement as federal employees within NNSA\u2019s safeguards and security  program if they successfully complete the program. To date, four  participants have done so, with three of the four converted to permanent  positions at the Pantex, Y-12, and Nevada site offices. According to site  office officials, the most significant challenge associated with successfully  implementing the intern program is obtaining clearances in a timely  manner.", "Second, in April 2005, NNSA held a staffing summit to determine site  offices\u2019 needs. Headquarters and site offices provided their end-of-year  staffing levels, the number of additional FTE staff needed to meet critical  needs based on available resources, and an estimate of the optimal FTE  levels. Based on available resources, NNSA site offices were granted  authority for six FTE security staff. However, according to site office  officials, site offices remain understaffed for security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training for Security Staff Can be Improved", "paragraphs": ["NNSA has not implemented an appropriate training program to meet the  needs of its security personnel. As a result, the number of security staff  with adequate training and the right skills continues to be a problem.  According to our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, managers should ensure that their personnel possess and  maintain a level of competence needed to accomplish their assigned duties.  Specifically, skill needs must be continually assessed, and training should  be aimed at developing and retaining the skills needed to achieve changing  organizational goals. In addition, DOE requires that critical training needs  for federal staff are identified and met and that a systematic mechanism for  providing training be established. Training needs are both organizationally  and individually driven. Site offices are required to identify performance  gaps for newly hired employees and specialized training for subsequent  years and are responsible for ensuring that training requirements are met.  For their part, employees are required to develop an individual  development plan and discuss their training needs with their supervisors,  who are responsible for authorizing all training.", "In March 2004, the Chiles Commission reported that NNSA\u2019s federal  security workforce was forgoing needed training because of the press of  urgent business and a shortage of resources. The Commission found that  over 50 percent of NNSA personnel surveyed believed that the existing  training and education of the federal security workforce was not adequate.  In addition, the Commission reported that staffing plans did not have the  built-in flexibility needed to allow for professional development and  training. NNSA officials told us that problems associated with site office  workloads resulted from the 2002 reorganization where all oversight  responsibilities formerly at the operations offices were transferred to the  newly formed site offices without sufficient allocation of staff. In addition,  site office security directors told us training budgets do not address the  needs of their staff. For example, according to NNSA officials, the Los  Alamos Site Office did not receive training dollars for fiscal year 2006, and  the Nevada Site Office received only a minimal training budget for its  security staff. According to a human resource official at the NNSA Service  Center, there is an \u201cenormous disconnect\u201d between training needs and  budgets, noting that training needs are not addressed systematically. To  address this issue, Safeguards and Security directors at each site office  have recently developed site-specific technical qualifications programs for  their staffs.

According to our Standards for Internal Control, for an agency  to run and control its operations, it must have relevant, accurate  information that is recorded and communicated to management in a form  and within a time frame that enables managers to carry out their  operational responsibilities. According to NNSA officials, NNSA has not  developed a framework for evaluating the results of independent and  internal security reviews. NNSA officials told us that while they believe that  security across the weapons complex has improved, NNSA does not have  good metrics to support the assertion that security has improved. DNS is  currently working to develop performance metrics that will allow NNSA to  track processes and make decisions about its safeguards and security  program, but NNSA does not plan to develop an overall indicator of its  security status to assist in efforts to gauge program effectiveness.", "In addition, NNSA does not have complete data for tracking security  deficiencies identified by security oversight reviews. According to NNSA  security officials, not all security deficiencies have been entered into  SSIMS because (1) the database is very difficult to use, (2) connections to it  are slow because of the lack of high-speed encrypted modems, and (3) it  often crashes once a connection is established. Therefore, some site office  officials questioned SSIMS\u2019s usefulness as a management tool and  suggested that it be replaced. As a result, most site offices have begun to  use their own tracking systems, or those developed by contractors, to track  identified security deficiencies. For example, the Los Alamos National  Laboratory uses REDBOOK, a custom-designed classified system operating  on an ACCESS platform to internally track the status of security  deficiencies and associated corrective action plans. Previously, Los Alamos  had read-only access to SSIMS, but lost its connection after the 2004 stand- down of operations because of missing computer disks. Similarly, during  the summer of 2004, the Y-12 Site Office developed PEGASUS\u2014an  interactive tracking system that is tailored to the site office\u2019s oversight  efforts and links all oversight-related correspondence. According to Y-12  site office officials, the system informs site office security staff  electronically about their daily oversight tasks, reduces the amount of  paperwork associated with resolving security deficiencies, and allows the  security director to track whether federal security personnel are  performing their oversight duties. In addition, PEGASUS, which is updated  weekly, has the ability to automatically identify recurring security  deficiencies and provides better quality data than SSIMS. According to one  security contractor official, the difficulty associated with logging onto  SSIMS results in security deficiencies being reported 6 to 12 months after  they are resolved.", "In commenting on our report, officials in the Office of Health, Safety, and  Security indicated that NNSA sites offices have not reported to the SSIMS  helpdesk any logon problems that would result in a 6- to 12-month  reporting delay. In addition, the officials said that (1) a significantly high  percentage of the officials who have taken SSIMS training have indicated  that SSIMS is one of the best, if not the best, computer database  experiences they have had, (2) since July 2004, SSIMS has offered high  speed encrypted connectivity to all NNSA sites, and (3) NNSA sites would  not lose their SSIMS connection if the sites installed and used this high  speed encrypted connectivity. The Director of the Office of Security  Technology and Assistance in the Office of Health, Safety, and Security  agreed that the SSIMS database was not complete and therefore not useful  for providing oversight; however, he felt the problem was with how the  NNSA site offices were using the database.", "Finally, NNSA has not implemented a formal process for sharing best  practices or lessons learned to guide security improvements across the  weapons complex. According to site office security officials, lessons  learned have been informally shared in some instances, including monthly  meetings with NNSA safeguards and security directors, teleconferences  with contractor security officials, and the review of results from the Office  of Independent Oversight inspections conducted at other sites. According  to the Associate Administrator, he has taken the initiative to informally  communicate lessons learned throughout the complex, but these lessons  have yet to be fully implemented. For example, as early as February 2005,  the DOE Inspector General identified problems with the retrieval of badges  from terminated employees at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. After  the report was issued, the Associate Administrator sent the findings to  NNSA site offices and requested that they review their respective  processes. Nevertheless, the DOE Inspector General identified similar  problems at other NNSA sites in subsequent reviews of their respective  badge retrieval processes.", "While best practices and lessons learned have been communicated  informally, it is important that NNSA sites have a formal means for  communicating these lessons. Absent updated information in SSIMS, or a  sufficient connection to it, it is difficult to determine whether proven  corrective actions for security deficiencies identified have been  implemented across the complex.

The Board cited several  models for either course of action. If the first approach were chosen, the  Board identified as potential models the National Security Agency, the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency within the Department of  Defense (DOD), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  within the Department of Commerce.

As we testified in April 2001, this  practice caused considerable concern about NNSA\u2019s ability to function with  the independence envisioned in the NNSA Act. In its October 2000 report  on the establishment of NNSA, the Special Oversight Panel on Department  of Energy Reorganization noted that the Secretary, facing criticism for  having impeded NNSA\u2019s autonomy, retreated from the dual-hatting  philosophy and appointed separate individuals to NNSA offices. Dual- hatting was subsequently forbidden by an amendment to the NNSA Act.", "In a July 2000 hearing before the Special Oversight Panel, the incoming  NNSA Administrator testified that establishing NNSA as a semi- autonomous entity would require developing a single, interconnected set of  policies and principles that permeated the entire NNSA and minimized  outside inputs.

Consequently, although some NNSA programs have set up specific policies  and procedures for how they will interact with their DOE counterparts,  other programs have not. Without formal procedures, several functions\u2014 budgeting, procurement, information technology, management and  administration, and safeguards and security\u2014have not been effectively or  efficiently implemented, as the following points detail.", "Budgeting. DOE and NNSA do not have a formal order defining how  DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s budgeting requirements would be combined into a  practicable process.

According to both DOE and NNSA officials, since  2004 the Department has blocked NNSA\u2019s efforts to issue its own  acquisition regulations.

The DOE and NNSA offices of the Chief  Information Officer have yet to reach agreement on a DOE order drafted  in September 2004 to define the relationship between the two offices.  According to DOE and NNSA officials, the draft order has not been  made final because of DOE\u2019s concern that the NNSA office would have  too great a role in tasks that should be performed by DOE\u2019s chief  information officer. Absent this order, certain problems have developed.  For example, according to a NNSA official, the two information offices  verbally agreed that all direction given to NNSA contractors about  information technology must come from NNSA, not DOE. However,  because this guidance was not formally documented, NNSA contractors  continue to receive dual requests for data from both the DOE and NNSA  offices of the Chief Information Officer.

However, DOE\u2019s Office of General Counsel has delayed the development  of this process because it believes that NNSA should not be treated any  differently than any other departmental element and should thus be  limited to using the flexibility already available in DOE orders. As a  result, NNSA\u2019s efforts to promulgate Administration-specific procedures  have become entangled in a cumbersome review process with no  certainty that closure of that review will occur, according to NNSA  officials. NNSA officials cited instances in which the Administration has  attempted to promulgate NNSA-specific procurement regulations and  policies on the roles of the DOE and NNSA Offices of the Chief  Information Officer.

As a result, security officials at contractor facilities  told us they have received safeguards and security oversight from a  number of sources, including DOE; DNS; and the NNSA site offices that  oversee the contractor facilities. Furthermore, the oversight they  receive from these various sources can conflict. For example, DNS  requires contractors to demagnetize electronic media before disposing  of it. However, DOE Manual 470.4-4 requires physical destruction of  electronic media through pulverization or other appropriate methods.  Uncertain about which requirement to follow, the Sandia National  Laboratories requested, and was subsequently granted by the NNSA  Sandia site office manager, an exemption to DOE\u2019s physical destruction  requirement. However, the Office of Independent Oversight reported  that Sandia National Laboratories, the NNSA Sandia site office, and DNS  had not fully evaluated the risks associated with following alternative  destruction procedures. Sandia National Laboratories now follows the  DOE requirement.", "While the lack of formal procedures has adversely affected some functions,  the presence of formal procedures has not always ensured that the roles  and responsibilities of DOE and NNSA offices are clearly defined and that  the offices operate together effectively and efficiently. Specifically, the  original NNSA Act prescribed roles and responsibilities for DOE\u2019s Office of  Counterintelligence and NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Nuclear  Counterintelligence. Under section 3204 of the NNSA Act, the director of  DOE\u2019s Office of Counterintelligence was responsible for establishing policy  for counterintelligence programs and activities at departmental facilities.  At the same time, section 3232 of the NNSA Act specified that NNSA\u2019s Chief  of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence was responsible for developing and  implementing the Administration\u2019s counterintelligence programs.", "To better define the relationship between the two counterintelligence  offices, DOE issued a Secretarial Policy Memorandum in January 2001 and  a DOE order in December 2004. The Secretarial memorandum, in part,  directed that the DOE headquarters counterintelligence program offices  would be a shared resource between the DOE Office of Counterintelligence  and the NNSA Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence but that the  funding needed for those program offices would come from DOE\u2019s Office  of Counterintelligence budget. The December 2004 DOE order contained  similar provisions but specified that the headquarters inspections and  polygraph programs would be directed solely by the Director of DOE\u2019s  Office of Counterintelligence.", "According to DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials, the  organizational relationship created by the Secretarial memorandum and  the DOE order led to the following problems:  DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials have disagreed over the  scope and direction of the counterintelligence program. NNSA  counterintelligence officials would like NNSA\u2019s counterintelligence  program to emphasize a multifaceted and proactive approach to prevent  intelligence activity. This program would integrate all of the tools of the  shared counterintelligence program offices\u2014Analysis; Operations and  Investigations; Plans, Policy, Training and Awareness; and Information  and Special Technologies\u2014as well as the DOE-directed Polygraphs and  Inspections program office. However, DOE\u2019s Office of  Counterintelligence emphasized a reactive approach to  counterintelligence\u2014one that primarily focused on investigating  counterintelligence incidents that have already occurred. NNSA  counterintelligence officials stated that they would have liked to have  changed the scope and direction of the NNSA counterintelligence  program. However, such changes require the concurrence of DOE\u2019s  Office of Counterintelligence, according to NNSA counterintelligence  officials, which did not occur.", "DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials also disagreed over their  ability to jointly direct the staff in the headquarters counterintelligence  program offices. Funding for these offices was included in DOE\u2019s  counterintelligence budget, and DOE\u2019s Office of Counterintelligence  senior management provided the program office directors with their  performance rating, with advisory input from the NNSA  counterintelligence office. Consequently, NNSA counterintelligence  officials believed that NNSA had less leverage in assigning tasks to the  program office staff, while DOE counterintelligence officials believed  that the DOE and NNSA counterintelligence offices had equal leverage.", "DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials disagreed over the  allocation of counterintelligence resources. The NNSA Chief for  Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence believed that counterintelligence  resources should be allocated according to risk management and  priority-setting principles. She noted that the risk associated with NNSA  nuclear weapons facilities was generally higher than the risk associated  with other DOE facilities because the loss of nuclear weapons  information or materials to foreign intelligence would constitute a  serious breach of national security. Therefore, in an August 2005  memorandum, the NNSA chief asked the Director of DOE\u2019s Office of  Counterintelligence to comprehensively evaluate whether resources  could be redirected to benefit higher-risk counterintelligence targets  and to provide guidance for future decision making about resource  allocation. As of November 2006, the DOE director had not responded to  the NNSA memorandum.", "DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials disagreed over  counterintelligence policymaking. For example, from September 2004 to  August 2005, the NNSA counterintelligence office unsuccessfully  attempted to obtain the DOE counterintelligence office\u2019s concurrence  on issuing a joint DOE/NNSA policy on personnel security file reviews  and sharing of counterintelligence information. When the DOE  counterintelligence office did not respond, the NNSA  counterintelligence office issued a NNSA-specific policy on August 12,  2005. This issuance without DOE\u2019s concurrence sparked a series of  verbal and e-mail exchanges between DOE and NNSA  counterintelligence officials, according to NNSA officials. DOE  counterintelligence officials stated in the e-mails we reviewed that  NNSA did not have the authority to issue NNSA-specific  counterintelligence policy without DOE concurrence. As such, the DOE  counterintelligence office initially demanded that the NNSA office  retract the policy. Subsequently, in April 2006, the DOE  counterintelligence office issued a memorandum that embraced the  NNSA policy.", "DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials disagreed over, or were  confused about, their roles and responsibilities in handling specific  counterintelligence matters. A case in point was the department\u2019s  handling of the well-publicized mid-2005 intrusion into an unclassified  NNSA computer system and removal of the names and social security  numbers of 1,502 individuals working for NNSA. The 1,502 NNSA  individuals were not notified of this incident until June 2006, after the  incident was acknowledged during a congressional hearing held earlier  in the month. Subsequently, the Secretary of Energy requested that the  Office of Inspector General examine the department\u2019s response to this  incident. In its July 2006 report, the Inspector General identified  multiple factors that contributed to the lack of a timely response to this  incident, including the delay in notifying the 1,502 NNSA individuals that  certain personal information had been compromised. The Inspector  General recommended that the department redefine and clarify the  roles and responsibilities of DOE and NNSA counterintelligence  officials.", "DOE and NNSA counterintelligence officials told us that they spent an  enormous amount of time resolving these types of problems between the  two offices and that this effort detracted from their focus on  counterintelligence activities. According to NNSA counterintelligence  officials, the arrangement did not meet the intent of the NNSA Act to create  a separately organized counterintelligence program within NNSA. As a  result, these officials added, NNSA\u2019s ability to execute a separate  counterintelligence program that meets its unique needs was impeded and  largely limited to what the two counterintelligence offices could agree on.", "Subsequently, the Congress amended the NNSA Act to address the  problems with the NNSA\u2019s and DOE\u2019s counterintelligence programs.  Specifically, section 3117 of the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 contained provisions to consolidate  the counterintelligence programs of DOE and NNSA under the Department  of Energy. Section 3117 also established the Intelligence Executive  Committee within the Department of Energy, consisting of the Deputy  Secretary of Energy, who would chair the committee, and each Under  Secretary of Energy. The section requires the Secretary of Energy to use  the committee to assist in developing and promulgating the  counterintelligence and intelligence policies, requirements, and priorities  of the entire Department. The section also established within the staff of  the Administrator, NNSA, a position of NNSA Intelligence and  Counterintelligence Liaison who would be responsible for liaison between  the NNSA and the Department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and  Counterintelligence. The amendment sunsets on September 30, 2010, and  the NNSA functions, personnel, funds, assets, and other resources  transferred to the Secretary of Energy will be returned to the control of the  Administrator, NNSA.", "The conference report stated that the Congress reluctantly provided this  authority to consolidate the program despite the ongoing skepticism of  many in the Congress over the Department's ability to implement a strong  security program for the Department and its laboratories. The conference  report noted that with the recent Departmental initiative to combine the  Offices of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and with the authority  provided in this provision, the intelligence and counterintelligence  functions would be organized as they were when the Department  experienced significant counterintelligence problems.  The conference  report stated that the conferees believed that the Department could have  addressed many of the perceived issues associated with having separate  counterintelligence offices for the Department and NNSA by demonstrating  greater management resourcefulness. The report also stated that the  conferees were unpersuaded that the Department fully and faithfully  implemented the counterintelligence program structure called for in the  NNSA Act.", "Nevertheless, the conference report noted that the Department had  continued--under the leadership of two different Secretaries of Energy and  two different Deputy Secretaries--to identify the counterintelligence  structure of the NNSA Act as an impediment to the smooth functioning of  security operations within DOE. Therefore, the conferees agreed to include  a provision that would provide temporary authority for the  disestablishment of the Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence  within NNSA and the transfer of NNSA counterintelligence personnel to the  Department's Office of Counterintelligence. DOE officials told us that they  are in the process of developing plans to implement the consolidation of  the counterintelligence programs and expect full implementation in early  2007. According to these officials, the consolidation should be a seamless  process and will provide the leadership necessary to effectively implement  DOE\u2019s counterintelligence activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Entities Continue to Express Concern about NNSA\u2019s Organizational Relationship", "paragraphs": ["Almost 7 years after NNSA was created, concerns persist about the  organization and management of the nuclear weapons complex that led to  NNSA\u2019s establishment. For example, in January 2006, DOD\u2019s Defense  Science Board Task Force on Nuclear Capabilities reviewed alternative  institutional arrangements that it believed could provide for more efficient  management of the nuclear enterprise. The task force expressed concern  that other elements of DOE were continuing to micromanage NNSA. To  correct this situation, the task force proposed the following three options:  Reform the existing structure. The task force would accomplish this  reform by having the Secretary of Energy enforce the requirement that  the Administrator be autonomous and accountable only to the  Secretary. The task force believed that this approach would require a  significant change in DOE culture, but it had little confidence in the  prospect for effective, lasting change within DOE.", "Move NNSA to DOD. The task force believed that there was more  confluence between DOD\u2019s core missions and the nuclear weapons  complex. However, the task force noted that, historically, the Congress  has been reluctant to concentrate nuclear weapons authority in a single  department and that, on balance, DOD was not a good fit for the  development and production of nuclear weapons.", "Create a National Nuclear Weapons Agency. The task force supported  this option, believing that the nuclear weapons enterprise was unique in  its missions and the demands placed upon managers and that a unique  organizational approach was therefore warranted. The National Nuclear  Weapons Agency would report through a Board of Directors, comprising  the Secretaries of several cabinet offices, including Energy and Defense,  to the President.", "However, former senior DOE and NNSA officials, as well as, one Defense  official with whom we spoke, generally did not favor removing NNSA from  DOE. These officials included the first and second Administrators of NNSA,  the former Deputy Secretary of DOE, and a senior member of the Defense  Science Board Task Force responsible for the January 2006 report. These  officials offered the following comments on NNSA\u2019s organization:  According to the second NNSA Administrator, it would not be a good  idea to make NNSA a totally independent agency. The Administrator   indicated that NNSA is very much entangled in the operations of DOE  and the costs associated with making NNSA totally independent from  DOE would outweigh the benefits.", "One former senior official told us he never knew what it meant to have  NNSA as a separately organized agency. In this official\u2019s view, because  DOE and NNSA had not clearly defined the concept, there was some  uncertainty in the relationship between the DOE Secretary and the  Administrator of NNSA. While this official would not be in favor of  establishing NNSA as a totally separate agency, he believes that NNSA  needs to take a half-step away from DOE to gain more independence.", "According to another former senior official, the DOE/NNSA  organizational relationship might have benefited from a more formal  definition. Regarding organizational changes, in this official\u2019s view, the  Congress should either make NNSA a totally independent agency or fold  it back into DOE.", "NNSA is not a separately organized agency, a Defense Science Board  Task Force official told us. In this official\u2019s view, DOE ensured that fate  by deciding, in its 2000 implementation plan, that certain functions  would not be transferred to NNSA. When NNSA was created, this  official said, the Congress was clear in the enabling legislation about the  type of entity it wanted NNSA to be. However, the Congress has allowed  the problems associated with DOE\u2019s implementation to languish."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Needs to Fully Resolve Its Human Capital Issues", "paragraphs": ["Under GAO\u2019s internal control standards, agencies should ensure that they  have a sufficient number of staff, particularly in managerial positions, and  that staff have the skills required to carry out the agency\u2019s organizational  objectives. While NNSA has engaged in a variety of human capital activities  since its creation, DOE and NNSA have yet to fully determine the  appropriate size of their respective workforces.", "In its January 2000 NNSA Implementation Plan, DOE outlined a series of  steps it would take to staff NNSA. In order to be prepared when the NNSA  Act took effect on March 1, 2000, DOE indicated that current employees  assigned to those program offices that would become part of NNSA would  be transferred to NNSA. For other employees, such as those in  departmental support offices, DOE stated that a more detailed analysis  would be necessary to determine those employees subject to transfer.", "In February 2002 testimony before the Special Oversight Panel on  Department of Energy Reorganization of the House Armed Services  Committee, the then Administrator stated that NNSA was taking a \u201cphased  approach\u201d to assess the status of each NNSA function and the costs and  benefits of continued reliance on DOE for service. For example, in the area  of human resources, the former Administrator stated that NNSA had  decided to develop an independent capability to select, promote, and  develop its own executive workforce. In other areas, such as the  investigation of serious accidents, NNSA would continue to rely on DOE  personnel. However, DOE and NNSA have never conducted a systematic,  detailed analysis of NNSA\u2019s staffing needs in relation to DOE\u2019s.", "During this review, we identified areas where potential staff imbalances  have affected NNSA\u2019s ability to operate as a separately organized agency  within DOE. These imbalances occur even though NNSA\u2019s federal staff  deals with about 40 percent of DOE\u2019s budget and programs, according to a  June 2006 DOE analysis. The imbalance is most notable in NNSA\u2019s Office of  General Counsel. Section 3217 of the NNSA Act established the position of  the NNSA General Counsel to serve as NNSA\u2019s chief legal officer. Initially,  DOE assigned the DOE General Counsel to also serve as the NNSA General  Counsel. This dual-hatting was subsequently prohibited by an amendment  to the NNSA Act. NNSA has since hired a General Counsel and 34 other  attorneys to provide NNSA with legal advice and analysis. In contrast, the  rest of DOE has 277 attorneys. According to NNSA\u2019s General Counsel, who  has been at NNSA since September 2001, no formal analysis of his office\u2019s  staffing needs has ever been done. However, he believes that such an  analysis would show that his office needs about 15 to 20 additional  attorneys to fully handle NNSA\u2019s legal workload with minimal assistance  from DOE. Absent additional attorneys, NNSA must rely on DOE\u2019s Office of  General Counsel to perform a significant portion of its legal work.", "The June 2006 DOE analysis also showed a large difference between the  size of the NNSA federal staff compared with the rest of DOE federal staff  in other areas. NNSA concurred with this analysis. (See table 7.)", "According to the first Administrator, because of the difference in staff size,  DOE can control NNSA\u2019s agenda by deciding which issues will get reviewed  and when. In his view, this problem began when NNSA was created and has  only gotten worse. He also stated that because NNSA did not have a plan  for how it would fully staff its headquarters organization, he tried to hire  the people he needed one at a time. An April 2005 NNSA report on its  security program raised similar concerns, noting that the disparity in size  between NNSA and DOE headquarters staffs greatly impaired NNSA\u2019s  effectiveness within the headquarters bureaucracy. For example, the report  said, DOE dominated the development of security policy because its staff  was significantly larger. In addition, a May 2005 NNSA staffing analysis  noted that the far larger DOE staff are able to devote considerable effort to  \u201csecond-guessing\u201d NNSA actions or to excessive requests for data and that  other DOE staff sometimes seek to interfere with NNSA.", "Reconciling any disparity between the size of the NNSA and DOE staffs,  and determining the staff NNSA needs to carry out its overall mission,  should take place within the context of a broader, data-driven workforce  plan. In December 2001, we reported that NNSA did not have the coherent  human capital and workforce planning strategies it needed to develop and  maintain a well-managed workforce over the long run. We therefore  recommended that, before NNSA allocated any additional excepted service  positions, it develop a thorough human capital and workforce planning  strategy. In June 2004, we reported that while the workforce plan NNSA  developed in December 2003 attempted to establish a framework for long- term workforce planning, the plan was of limited use because it did not  have current statistics on workforce, positions, and organizational  structures. Furthermore, the downsizing NNSA was completing at the  time was taking place in an unstructured environment. Under these  conditions, agencies can experience significant challenges in deploying  people with the right skills, in the right places, and at the right time, and in  ensuring that they perform their missions economically, efficiently, and  effectively. In NNSA\u2019s case, we noted at the time that there were early  indications that the lack of planning was contributing to skill imbalances  such as those imbalances in security staff already discussed. We further  stated that without a functional long-term workforce plan, NNSA ran the  risk of facing more serious staff shortages or skill imbalances in the future,  which would affect its ability to adequately oversee its contractors and  ensure the safety and security of its various facilities.", "To its credit, NNSA has recognized that it needs to improve its human  capital management, and in a November 28, 2005, memorandum to NNSA  senior managers, the Administrator announced a workforce planning  initiative. The Administrator acknowledged that NNSA had no systematic  way to assess current, or forecast future, human capital needs.  Consequently, he asked the NNSA Office of Human Resources to develop  and refine a workload analysis and planning approach. While the  Administrator expected that this approach would be usable by the middle  of fiscal year 2006, according to the Director for NNSA\u2019s Office of Human  Resources, he made certain changes to the workload analysis to ensure  that more appropriate data could be collected. As a result of those changes,  the Director said, the workload analysis and planning approach would take  longer to complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Can Take Additional Action to Improve Project Management", "paragraphs": ["Project management remains a significant concern for NNSA and DOE and,  over the last several years, both have initiated improvement efforts.

In July 2006,  DOE issued a new program and project management order. Nevertheless,  DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2006 performance and accountability report still  identified project management as a significant issue. Furthermore,  according to NNSA\u2019s November 2006 report on project management  performance, 5 of 31 NNSA projects, or about 16 percent, are in jeopardy of  breaching their cost baseline, schedule baseline or both.

While NNSA has  been involved in drafting a revised DOE order on project management,  and creating and promulgating DOE project management guides, in an  April 2003 memorandum, the NNSA Administrator committed to issuing  an NNSA-specific project management policy to (1) further assist in the  implementation of the DOE project management manual issued in  March 2003 and (2) assure consistent application with the NNSA Act.  However, according to an official in NNSA\u2019s Office of Project  Management and Systems Support\u2014which would be responsible for  developing a project management policy\u2014no NNSA project  management policy has been issued.", "Prepare a project management improvement plan. Short- and long- range plans are critical to implementing a project management policy.  However, NNSA developed its last project management improvement  plan in December 2000. According to information presented at NNSA\u2019s  2005 Project Management Training Workshop, the Administration  successfully accomplished many of the eight goals in this plan, including  using qualified, experienced project managers to oversee NNSA projects  and establishing formal procedures for obtaining senior manager review  and approval of projects. However, the NNSA staff presenter at the  workshop also noted that NNSA was not completely successful in  creating a cultural shift in NNSA that emphasizes the importance of  project management or creating incentives to improve project  managers\u2019 performance. As a result, NNSA has not significantly reduced  project delivery times or costs. The NNSA staff presenter, therefore,  proposed the development of new short- and long-range improvement  plans, which officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of Project Management and  Systems Support acknowledged the Administration currently does not  have. While these officials acknowledged the need for such plans, NNSA  management indicated that it was not aware of the staff proposal.", "Prepare project management annual reports. After its creation, NNSA  began preparing an annual status report to the Congress on its  construction project accomplishments. However, it submitted only two  reports\u2014for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. In fiscal year 2000, NNSA  reported, among other things, that about 70 percent of its Defense  Programs\u2019 46 projects were progressing satisfactorily and that Defense  Programs had many success stories during the year, including (1)  reestablishing the quarterly project review process, (2) developing and  implementing a project management improvement plan, and (3)  sponsoring a project management workshop. However, NNSA also  reported that the root causes of project management problems were  deeply entrenched and could not be eliminated without a basic cultural  change, which would require at least 3 years. In fiscal year 2001, NNSA  reported that 30, or about 73 percent, of its 41 projects were progressing  satisfactorily and noted accomplishments in project management.  However, NNSA also reported that (1) management costs for projects  were nearly double those of other organizations and (2) projects took  approximately 3 years longer to accomplish than similar projects  performed elsewhere. The Director of NNSA\u2019s Office of Project  Management and Systems Support\u2014who assumed his position in  2004\u2014did not know why the reports were discontinued.

In response to a February 2004  memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Energy citing inadequate  management of critical activities within DOE and NNSA, NNSA  indicated that it intended to treat more of its activities as projects so  that the cost and schedule performance associated with those activities  could be improved. While NNSA has applied project management  principles to more of its activities, we identified four major NNSA  projects\u2014estimated to cost over $100 million each\u2014that are not  enrolled in the PARS system and do not receive senior management  oversight through that system (See table 8.)  NNSA indicated that these  projects are not in PARS because they are information technology  projects or programmatic efforts.

In addition, information technology projects are not  prohibited from inclusion in PARS.", "We are particularly concerned that the life extension projects were not  included in the PARS database. In our July 2003 report on NNSA\u2019s life  extension program, we recommended that NNSA establish the  individual life extensions as projects and manage them according to  DOE\u2019s project management requirements. As we reported, the then  NNSA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Military Application and  Stockpile Operations acknowledged that the three life extensions were  projects, and NNSA concurred with our recommendations. During our  current review, however, we could not find any evidence that NNSA  had taken any action to establish the life extensions as projects.", "Complete a lessons learned report database. DOE\u2019s project management  manual states that a lessons learned report should be completed,  distributed, and included in a project\u2019s permanent file; however, the  manual does not require the establishment of a comprehensive lessons  learned project management database. To its credit, the Administration  has attempted to create such a database on one of its internal Web  pages, but we found that certain key NNSA lessons learned reports were  not included, including, for example, reports for NNSA\u2019s Accelerated  Strategic Computing Initiative and W-87 Life Extension. We believe that  these reports provided information worthy of dissemination across the  NNSA complex. For example, the W-87 lessons learned report noted that  the project plan was prepared too late in the development cycle and was  not used as a tool to identify problems and take corrective actions. In  addition, the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative report noted  that the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories had  mixed success, in part, because they did not look at the lessons learned  from other communities. While officials in the Office of Project  Management and Systems Support acknowledged that the Web page  was incomplete, they said the forthcoming DOE project management  order would reinforce the importance of lessons learned information.  However, the final order, issued in July 2006, did not discuss a lessons  learned database; instead, it required that a lessons learned report be  prepared and submitted to DOE\u2019s Office of Engineering and  Construction Management for broader sharing among the DOE project  management community. According to that office, it has yet to develop  internal procedures for sharing this information.", "Develop contractor performance benchmarks. Benchmarking is an  integral part of project management. It is used to analyze the gap  between actual and preferred performance in order to identify  opportunities for improvement. We found that while NNSA tracks cost  and schedule performance on individual projects through various  reporting systems, including information contained in the PARS system,  neither the PARS system nor any other departmental system ranks the  collective project management performance of NNSA\u2019s contractors. On  its own initiative, however, the Los Alamos National Laboratory  contracted in 2004 to have its project management performance  benchmarked against comparable organizations. The August 2004 report  found that, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 as the lowest, Los Alamos\u2019 project  management rated a 2. Los Alamos had project management processes,  although such processes were not considered an organizational  standard on all projects. According to NNSA site office managers we  contacted, it would be helpful to know how their contractor ranked in  project management performance against other NNSA contractors. The  Sandia Site Office Manager added that this ranking, as well as an NNSA  national average, would help determine if project management at her  laboratory was doing well or not. Overall, the managers added, if their  contractor\u2019s project management performance was not at a comparable  level to other contractors, they could identify problems and develop  solutions.", "Require contractors to receive project manager training. DOE and  NNSA have initiated a program to train and certify all departmental  project managers on projects costing $5 million or more. However,  because departmental projects are usually undertaken by an outside  contractor, the training of the contractor\u2019s project manager is equally  important. Several studies conducted at the request of either DOE,  NNSA or their contractors have recommended training and certifying  contractors\u2019 project managers. For example, in 1999, the National  Research Council found that the lack of project management skills was  a fundamental cause of poor project performance and recommended  that DOE require all contractors\u2019 project managers to be experienced,  trained, and qualified in project management appropriate to the   project. Similarly, in 2004, the Civil Engineering Research Foundation  reported that project management competence was a critical factor in  project success and recommended that formal project management  training of contractor project managers be made a contract  requirement. Despite this support for contractor project manager  training and certification, neither DOE nor NNSA has a policy on  contractor project manager training.

To fulfill that  responsibility, NNSA program managers are expected to have a working  knowledge of such diverse areas as contracting, budgeting, and  engineering. Recognizing the importance of program managers, NNSA has  taken several actions, such as initiating a project and program management  improvement team and developing a program management policy.  However, DOE\u2019s performance and accountability reports indicate that  additional improvements in program management are possible. For  example, according to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2006 performance and  accountability report, NNSA fully met only about 52 percent of its program  goals, compared with about 79 percent for the rest of DOE. Similarly,  according to departmental information, NNSA met about 74 percent of its  performance targets from fiscal years 2002 through 2006, compared with 87  percent for the rest of DOE. To further improve its program management  performance, NNSA will need to take the following actions:   Prepare status reports on program management improvement. In any  performance-based management system, once a problem has been  identified, a corrective action plan is prepared and reports are generated  to periodically evaluate the status of the corrective action. In a July 2004  memorandum to the DOE Under Secretary, NNSA indicated that each  NNSA office would prepare a corrective action plan, known as a  program management implementation plan.  While all NNSA offices  completed at least a portion of these implementation plans, only the  offices of Defense Programs, Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Defense  Nuclear Security outlined specific tasks, or deliverables, in their plans  that needed to be completed. More importantly, of these offices, only  Defense Programs and Nuclear Nonproliferation identified a due date  for each task. Plans prepared by the offices of Emergency Operations,  and Infrastructure and Environment did not include any specific tasks  or due dates. Moreover, none of the NNSA offices have prepared  periodic reports on the status of their efforts to improve program  management. Therefore, it is unclear how much progress each NNSA  office has made.", "Complete a best practices guide on program management. In response  to the Government Performance and Results Act, agencies have learned  that they can improve performance by emulating the best practices of  leading organizations. In October 2003, an internal review of NNSA\u2019s  program management found that, among other things, NNSA needed to  have (1) a common language and terminology about program  management, (2) consistency in program manager functions and  qualifications, and (3) a clear channel of direction and consistent and  timely flow of information from NNSA programs to contractors. It  recommended that NNSA develop and issue a best practices guide by  December 1, 2003. The draft guide was never issued in final form and disseminated within NNSA. According to a NNSA official and a NNSA  contractor official who served on the program management team, the  best practices guide floundered after NNSA made certain organizational  and employee changes and the guide no longer had a person serving as a  champion of program management improvement.", "Identify and train program managers. NNSA\u2019s August 2004 program  management policy largely superseded earlier NNSA team  recommendations on program manager training. According to the  August 2004 policy, NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Administration  was responsible for developing and maintaining a database of NNSA  program managers to identify (1) the manager for each program, (2) the  training and certification requirements for each program manager  position, (3) the dates the program manager initially completed various  training and certifications, and (4) when, if applicable, the training and  certification must be renewed. The policy did not stipulate any deadline  for the database\u2019s completion. Consequently, according to an official in  NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Administration, this program  manager database has not been created. In contrast, according to an  official in DOE\u2019s Office of Engineering and Construction Management,  the department has developed a training curriculum for DOE program  managers with approval of that curriculum by the DOE Deputy  Secretary expected in the next few months. Unlike the NNSA program  management policy, DOE will not initially require that program  managers be certified on the amount of training received."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Financial Management Weaknesses Remain Despite NNSA Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Under section 3252 of the NNSA Act, NNSA had to develop a planning,  programming, and budgeting process that comported with sound financial  and fiscal management principles. The NNSA Act also requires NNSA to  annually submit to the Congress a Future Years Nuclear Security Program  plan that details NNSA\u2019s planned expenditures for the next 5 years. Very  early in his tenure, the first NNSA Administrator indicated that he intended  to comply with the NNSA Act by instituting a planning, programming and  budgeting process similar to DOD\u2019s. While DOD\u2019s approach has not been  without its problems over the past 40 years, it is generally recognized as a  system that, when properly led and staffed, can provide cost-effectiveness  comparisons and develop the detailed program and budget plans called for  in the NNSA Act. Although NNSA has made significant progress in  implementing its PPBE process over the last 4 years, it still needs to (1)  complete its PPBE policy guidance, (2) establish an independent analysis  unit to assist the Administrator in making budget allocation decisions, (3)  develop criteria for compiling an NNSA-wide priorities list, (4) develop an  up-to-date schedule of those programs requiring budget validation, and (5)  establish a DOE-compliant budget validation process.", "Complete NNSA\u2019s PPBE policy. As recognized in Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, an important part of internal controls  over financial reporting is having policies and procedures in place to  ensure that management directives are carried out and that  management\u2019s assertions in its financial reporting are valid. To this end,  NNSA has issued 10 policy letters providing guidance to NNSA staff on  various aspects of the PPBE process:  6 of these 10 letters are final, 3  have been in draft for more than 1 year, and 1 has been in draft for more  than 2 years. According to the director of NNSA\u2019s Office of Planning,  Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation, the four draft policy letters  have not been made final, in part, because NNSA has been waiting to see  DOE\u2019s position on issues in the draft letters. However, we believe that  waiting 2 years for DOE\u2019s views is inconsistent with NNSA\u2019s operation as  a separately organized agency with its own PPBE budgeting process.  NNSA indicated that it is continuing to evaluate aspects of the PPBE  budgeting process and expects to finalize at least three of the draft  policy letters during fiscal year 2007.", "Establish an independent analysis unit. PPBE provides a mechanism  for centralized resource allocation decisions. In NNSA, that mechanism  consists of having senior NNSA managers develop a budget for their  program and then collegially review, through a management council, the  budgets from the other programs, including the programs\u2019 justification  for additional resources to meet requirements they cannot fund within  their target allocation. The council can either decide to shift funding  between programs to meet such requirements or determine whether the  issue should be presented to the Administrator for resolution. The  Administrator reviews the council\u2019s decisions, resolves issues identified  by the council, and makes final resource allocation decisions. Such a  mechanism places considerable pressure on the Administrator alone to  make difficult funding decisions.", "While the NNSA PPBE process was modeled after the process DOD  uses, it differs markedly in one aspect. Unlike DOD, NNSA has not  established an independent group responsible for reviewing program  proposals, verifying cost estimates, and analyzing alternatives. In  August 2003, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that most  NNSA senior managers interviewed believed such an analytical group  could be of value. For example, the then NNSA Acting Associate  Administrator for Management and Administration said that he  supported the formation of such a group to provide objective analyses  to the Administrator when he had to move resources between programs.  Several senior managers also stated that resource allocation decisions  among program offices were likely to become more frequent in future  years and, therefore, NNSA\u2019s need for independent analytical services  was likely to grow. Although NNSA agreed with the Inspector General\u2019s  recommendation regarding the need for an independent analytical  support group, it did not believe that such a group could be created  before the end of calendar year 2005, after downsizing and  reorganization had been completed.", "NNSA indicated that its management is fully supportive of the  importance of independent analysis at both the NNSA and DOE level,  but mindful that the resources needed to create this capability must be  balanced with all of the competing needs within NNSA in a highly  constrained funding and staffing environment. However, in our view, in  such an environment, the need for an independent budget analysis unit  to ensure that appropriate budgetary decisions are made becomes even  more important.", "Develop criteria for compiling an NNSA-wide priorities list. In order  to make trade-off decisions among organizations and programs within  an organization, DOE formally requires each of its organizations to  annually submit a report to its Office of Budget that ranks its programs  for the budget year and provides a rationale for the ranking. As we noted  in July 2003, NNSA did not submit these ranking reports for fiscal years  2002 through 2004. It submitted a list for the first time for the fiscal  year 2007 budget, after the Secretary of Energy specifically requested it.  According to an NNSA budget official, each NNSA program, such as  Defense Programs and Nuclear Nonproliferation, prepared its list  individually. Afterwards, this official stated, the NNSA Administrator  compiled an overall priority list without using any formal criteria.", "According to an official in DOE\u2019s Office of Budget, his office had some  questions about the ranking of activities on the NNSA list. For example,  the impact associated with not funding a particular activity was not  always sufficiently clear to explain NNSA\u2019s ranking rationale. While  NNSA subsequently answered all of the Office of Budget\u2019s questions  satisfactorily, he noted that NNSA might have benefited from preparing  and following some formal criteria for developing its priority ranking  list, as do other DOE organizations, such as the Office of Environmental  Management. Formal criteria, in this official\u2019s view, would consider the  impact of not funding an activity plus the probability of success if  additional funding occurred.", "NNSA indicated that it annually issues strategic planning guidance and  program and fiscal guidance, holds internal NNSA office programming  sessions, and convenes a senior NNSA leadership meeting to discuss the  various NNSA office proposals. NNSA added that, considering all these  actions and balancing competing priorities, the Administrator makes his  decisions which are documented in the Administrator\u2019s Final  Recommendations report. In our view, having formalized criteria to  follow would assist the Administrator in making his decisions and  render those decisions more transparent and defensible to outside  review.", "Develop an up-to-date schedule of those programs requiring budget  validation. Under the PPBE process, once NNSA establishes the  relative priority of its programs, the budget associated with those  programs must be developed and validated. During validation, NNSA  evaluates the need for the program\u2019s proposed activities and the cost  estimates in support of those activities. In a May 2004 memorandum,  NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Administration announced the  Administration\u2019s 5-year schedule for conducting budget validations for  fiscal years 2005 through 2009. NNSA indicated that it would select  programs for validation on the basis of several factors, including  programs receiving OMB Performance Assessment Rating Tool reviews,  program manager requests, Administrator direction, significant external  interest, and high program visibility. Using those factors, for fiscal year  2006, NNSA planned to validate the budgets for the Office of the  Administrator, Science Campaign, Readiness Campaign, Safeguards and  Security, International Nuclear Materials Protection and Cooperation,  Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production, and Naval  Reactors Operations and Maintenance, and for the fiscal year 2007  budget, it would validate Directed Stockpile Work/Stockpile Services,  Nuclear Weapons Incident Response, Nonproliferation and Verification  research and development, and Highly-Enriched Uranium Transparency  Implementation.", "While NNSA followed the May 2004 schedule for fiscal years 2006 and  2007, it had not updated this schedule as of November  2006 to reflect  program changes. For example, new major program initiatives\u2014such as  the Reliable Replacement Warhead and the efforts to transform the  nuclear weapons complex, called Responsive Infrastructure\u2014are not  listed on the May 2004 validation schedule for fiscal years 2005 through  2009. While the amounts requested in the fiscal year 2007 budget for  these two initiatives are low compared with other program efforts, both  initiatives are considered centerpieces in the NNSA budget, will require  significant additional funding in succeeding fiscal years, and meet  NNSA\u2019s selection criteria for program validation on the basis of  significant external interest and high program visibility. Because the  May 2004 schedule has not been updated, NNSA does not know when  certain programs like the Reliable Replacement Warhead and  Responsive Infrastructure would be validated, according to an official  in NNSA\u2019s Office of Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation.  This official added that NNSA is contemplating updating the program  validation schedule later in 2006.", "NNSA indicated that it would not be beneficial to add the Reliable  Replacement Warhead and Responsive Infrastructure programs to its  budget validation schedule until DOE and the Office of Management  and Budget have made decisions to proceed with these activities.  However, both of these programs are ongoing and are expected to  grow; therefore, in our view, they should be considered when NNSA  updates its budget validation schedule.", "Establish a DOE-compliant budget validation process. NNSA\u2019s May  2004 draft budget validation policy also outlined the Administration\u2019s  approach to budget validation. Specifically, the Administration will  follow a two-phased validation approach. During phase one, NNSA will  assess selected programs\u2019 conformance with strategic guidance,  program plans, and performance data and seek insight into how each  organization formulates its budget. During phase two, NNSA will choose  a few of the programs from the phase one review and conduct a detailed  review that examines the reasonableness of the cost estimates  supporting the program\u2019s budget. Following this two-phased approach,  NNSA performed a detailed validation review on only approximately 12  percent of the Administration\u2019s budget submitted for fiscal years 2006  and 2007. However, in our view, this approach does not adhere to DOE\u2019s  guidance on that subject. According to the director of DOE\u2019s Budget  Operations Division, commencing in fiscal year 2001 as a performance  measure, DOE has required that at least 20 percent of the budget  undergo a detailed review, so that 100 percent of the budget would be  evaluated every 5 years. In our 2003 report on NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Life  Extension Program, we also found that NNSA was not conducting  proper budget validation reviews and, consequently, recommended that  NNSA validate its stockpile life extension budget request in accordance   with DOE directives. NNSA indicated that its budget validation review  focuses on the process used in developing budget requests and is not an  audit of the resulting budget estimates. NNSA further indicated that it  does not have the capabilities to audit and instead relies on DOE\u2019s Office  of Inspector General and GAO for those reviews. While such reviews are  helpful in evaluating budget estimates, we believe these reviews do not  abrogate NNSA\u2019s responsibility to adhere to DOE requirements.", "NNSA also noted that the results of its progress in implementing PPBE are  reflected in (1) the average scores received through the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Program Assessment Rating Tool scores which  are among the highest in DOE and the U.S. Government, (2) NNSA  management and operating contractors working without serious  interruption through multiple continuing resolutions in the past four years,  and (3) NNSA transitioning smoothly to the DOE budget formulation  process in the summer of 2006."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the creation of NNSA, DOE\u2019s management of the nuclear weapons  complex was widely considered, in the words of the President\u2019s Foreign  Intelligence Advisory Board as \u201cscience at its best\u201d and \u201csecurity at its  worst.\u201d Underpinning this characterization was a long departmental history  of organizational disarray and poor security, project and program  management. Consequently, producing a well-organized and effective  agency out of what was widely considered a dysfunctional enterprise has  been a considerable challenge. In some areas, NNSA should be viewed as a  success. Most notably, through its internal reorganization efforts, NNSA  has addressed many major organizational issues and has made important  progress in establishing critical management systems, especially PPBE.", "However, without a workable model on how a separately organized agency  should function, NNSA and DOE officials have had to develop their  working relationships largely on a case-by-case basis, often with limited  success. The fact that the Congress felt it necessary to step in and modify  the NNSA Act to address continuing organizational conflict within the  counterintelligence program demonstrates, in our view, that DOE and  NNSA need to take a more active approach to clearly defining DOE and  NNSA\u2019s working relationships and determining how conflict will be  resolved. While there have been continuing calls for removing NNSA from  DOE and establishing it as a separate agency, we do not believe that such  drastic change is necessary to produce an organization that can provide  effective oversight of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.", "Beyond addressing organizational issues, if NNSA is ultimately to provide  comprehensive oversight of the operation and security of the nation\u2019s  nuclear weapons programs, it must address a variety of lingering, often  unrelated, but important management issues.
