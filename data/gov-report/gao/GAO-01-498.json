You raised concerns about the supply of organs and the number of pediatric organs that are allocated to adults. You also raised concerns about how children in need of an organ transplant are faring in comparison with adults waiting for a transplant and whether organ allocation policies sufficiently recognize the unique needs of children. Specifically, you asked us to determine (1) the trends in organ donation and demand among adults and children and the factors that affect pediatric donation, (2) the extent to which pediatric organs are transplanted into adults, (3) whether pediatric patients are disadvantaged in terms of waiting times and survival, and (4) how the national organ allocation policies compare for adult and pediatric patients.", "In conducting this study, we interviewed officials and obtained documents from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which regulates and provides oversight of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). We also interviewed officials and obtained documents on organ allocation policies and data on donation, transplant, survival, and waiting times from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the organization that coordinates the OPTN for HHS. The OPTN develops policies for organ allocation, maintains the waiting list, and tracks the OPTN data on each patient.

Additionally, we visited six transplant centers that represented different geographic locations and perform a high volume of pediatric organ transplants. At these centers, we interviewed medical and other transplant services personnel and obtained relevant documents about donation and allocation issues, survival measures, and coverage for medication therapy.

We also obtained and analyzed data on the causes of death most likely to result in organ donation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s mortality and population database.

Some of these centers accept both adults and children, and others are for children only. In 1998, pediatric kidney transplants were performed at 129 of the 241 centers that performed kidney transplants; pediatric liver transplants were performed at 77 of the 116 centers that transplanted livers; and pediatric heart transplants were performed at 54 of the 134 centers that transplanted hearts.", "In 1984, Congress enacted the National Organ Transplant Act (P.L. 98-507), which requires HHS to establish the OPTN.

The criteria that determine the order of candidates on the list are applied or defined differently for each type of organ and for pediatric versus adult patients. With certain limitations, organs from pediatric donors can be transplanted into adults, and vice versa. The UNOS computer matches each patient in the OPTN database against a donor\u2019s characteristics and then generates a different ranked list of potential recipients for each transplantable organ from the donor.

For livers, research showing better survival for pediatric patients who received a pediatric liver led to a policy change giving priority for pediatric livers to pediatric patients.

Originally, Medicare limited immunosuppressive drug coverage to 1 year. However, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) expanded this coverage with a series of annual 6- month increases beginning in 1995.

In 1999, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-113) extended this immunosuppressive drug coverage benefit for an additional 8 months.
