Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, total requirements for small caliber ammunitions more than doubled, from about 730 million to nearly 1.8 billion rounds, while total requirements for medium caliber ammunitions increased from 11.7 million rounds to almost 22 million rounds. DOD has initiated several steps to meet the increased demand, including funding about $93.3 million for modernization improvements at the three government-owned ammunition plants producing small and medium caliber ammunition. DOD is currently able to meet its medium caliber requirement through modernization efforts at the government-owned ammunition plants and through contracts with commercial producers. The government-owned plant producing small caliber ammunition cannot meet the increased requirements, even with these modernization efforts. Also, commercial producers within the national technology and industrial base have not had the capacity to meet these requirements. As a result, DOD has had to rely at least in part on foreign commercial producers to meet its small caliber ammunition needs. DOD has taken steps to ensure that the national technology and industrial base can meet future small caliber ammunition needs by building flexibility into the acquisition system to address fluctuations. In addition, a planning process has been put in place to ensure that the base can respond to longer-term DOD ammunition needs, including small and medium caliber ammunition.

In early 2002, the Army  established the Office of the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for  Ammunition as part of a larger effort to establish greater accountability  and responsibility in the life-cycle management of DOD\u2019s ammunition  programs. A year later, the Army designated this office as the executor for  the single manager for conventional ammunition mission and delegated to  that office limited authority to make determinations on restricting  procurements of conventional ammunition as directed by section 806 of  the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1999 (Public Law 105-261).

Section 806 of the Strom Thurmond  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105- 261) vests the single manager with the authority to restrict the  procurement of conventional ammunition to sources within the national  technology and industrial base. The Secretary of the Army was authorized  to delegate, within the Army, this authority. A January 28, 2003,  memorandum from the Secretary of the Army delegated authority to make  section 806 determinations to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology.

See figure 1 for an example  of a 5.56mm cartridge.  It takes, on average, 23-months from the time a  production order is placed until final delivery.", "Since World War II, DOD has relied primarily on a government-owned  base to meet its conventional ammunition needs. During the Cold War,  there were as many as 34 government-owned plants producing  conventional ammunition. The end of the Cold War and subsequent  changes to defense missions resulted in declining requirements. At its  peak in 1985, funding for conventional ammunition was $4.3 billion; by  1999, funding had dropped by more than half to about $2 billion. Currently,  there are 14 government-owned ammunition plants, 11 of which are  contractor-operated. Three of these 11 facilities\u2014Lake City (Missouri),  Milan (Tennessee), and Radford (Virginia)\u2014are the government-owned,  contractor-operated producers of DOD\u2019s small and medium caliber  ammunition.", "Lake City is the primary producer of small caliber ammunition. Lake City  is operated by a commercial ammunition producer under a contract that  runs from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2008. The contract initially  called for a minimum production capacity amount of 350 million rounds  and a maximum of 800 million rounds of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and .50-caliber  ammunition. The PEO increased the upper capacity requirement to  1.5 billion rounds per year to be accomplished by early 2006 through  modifications made to the original contract.", "The PEO relies on annual contracts with three commercial producers  within the national technology and industrial base for most of DOD\u2019s  supply of 20mm, 25mm, and 30mm medium caliber ammunition. Currently,  one of these producers is manufacturing medium caliber ammunition at  Radford which specializes in the production of propellants and explosives;  the other two commercial producers manufacture medium caliber  ammunition at their own facilities. Radford\u2019s current contract was  awarded in fiscal year 2003 and has been renewed on an annual basis  through fiscal year 2005.

Since 2000, requirements for small caliber  ammunition have more than doubled, and requirements for medium  caliber ammunition have almost doubled.", "Over the last decade, the Army began transforming its warfighting  capabilities to respond more effectively to the growing number of  peacekeeping operations, small-scale contingencies, and nontraditional  threats, such as terrorism. According to Army officials, the transformation  is the most comprehensive change in the Army in over a century and will  affect all aspects of its organizations, training, doctrine, leadership, and  strategic plans as well as its acquisitions. As part of its transformation, the  Army is planning for its forces to be self-sustaining and capable of  generating combat power and contributing decisively to combat  operations. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Army  accelerated its force transformation to mobilize and deploy soldiers in  support of various missions, most notably war-fighting operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq.", "To meet its force transformation objectives, the Army began requiring all  soldiers to gain additional weapons qualifications training after they  complete initial basic training. The Army also began requiring that  personnel in all deployed elements, including combat support and combat  service support units, achieve and maintain greater proficiency in the use  of specified weapons. For example, beginning in late 2001, the Army  established a policy requiring each soldier to qualify twice a year on small  caliber firearms instead of once a year as previously required. According  to Army officials, in addition to the increased annual training  requirements, small caliber ammunition needs have increased by an  additional 66 percent due to a combination of the mobilization of units and  contingency training, for example, training to react to defend against  attacks on truck convoys; and, to a lesser extent, due to operations in Iraq  and Afghanistan. The increased requirements are likely to continue to a  significant extent beyond current operational deployments due to the  increased training requirements.", "Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, total requirements for small caliber  ammunition increased from about 730 million to nearly 1.8 billion rounds  (see figure 2).", "The 5.56mm rounds\u2014used in the M16 rifle, the standard weapon used by  soldiers\u2014accounted for much of the small caliber increase (see table 2).", "Medium caliber requirements have also increased over the past few years.  Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, medium caliber requirements almost  doubled, from 11.7 million rounds to almost 22 million rounds (see figure  3).", "The 40mm rounds represent the bulk of the increases between fiscal years  2000 and 2005 (see table 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PEO Is Meeting Increased Requirements through Modernization Efforts Supplemented by Commercial Buys", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to help meet the increased need for small and medium caliber  ammunition in the near term, the PEO upgraded the equipment at the Lake  City, Milan, and Radford Army Ammunition plants. While these upgrades  enabled Milan and Radford\u2014the government-owned, contractor-operated  producers of medium caliber ammunition\u2014to meet DOD\u2019s requirements,  Lake City\u2014the small caliber ammunition producer\u2014was unable to meet  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004 requirement of about 1.6 billion rounds of  ammunition. As a result, the PEO made additional procurements from the  commercial market to make up for fiscal year 2004 shortfalls.", "The three government-owned, contractor-operated plants that produce  small and medium caliber ammunition were built in 1941. Between fiscal  years 2001 and 2005, DOD funded a total of about $93.3 million to upgrade  these facilities. This included replacement or refurbishment of  ammunition cartridge production equipment and other facility  improvements. According to a PEO official, ongoing modernization is  needed for the Army ammunition plants to continue to operate into the  future, and in the case of the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, additional  equipment and facility upgrades will be needed to increase capacity to  address future needs. According to a PEO official, the Army plans to  replace and refurbish ammunition production equipment through fiscal  year 2011. See table 4 for examples of funded modifications.", "According to PEO officials, the national technology and industrial base has  been able to meet the increased requirements for medium caliber  ammunition. In an effort to meet DOD\u2019s small ammunition requirements,  the PEO initiated additional modernization efforts at Lake City to increase  production from a maximum capacity of 800 million rounds in fiscal year  2001 to approximately 1.2 billion rounds per year in July 2004. Despite this  increased production capacity, Lake City was unable to meet fiscal year  2004 requirements for small caliber ammunition.", "Consequently, the PEO was forced to rely on other ammunition sources.  While many commercial ammunition producers responded to the PEO\u2019s  sources sought announcements, few were able to satisfy DOD\u2019s  ammunition specifications. For example, seven of nine commercial  producers responding to the PEO\u2019s announcement for a specific type of  5.56mm ammunition were unable to meet the specifications, such as  producing metal cartridge cases. For an announcement for different types  of .50-caliber ammunition, none of the 10 respondents were able to meet  all of the specifications. Several respondents were foreign ammunition  producers. According to officials from U.S. commercial ammunition  producers, the recent surge in DOD\u2019s small caliber ammunition  requirements could only be met by accessing available worldwide  capacity.", "The PEO was eventually able to find commercial producers qualified to fill  DOD\u2019s small caliber ammunition shortfall in fiscal year 2004. These  included Israel Military Industries and Olin-Winchester\u2014a U.S.  ammunition producer. According to data provided by the PEO, almost  313 million rounds of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and .50-caliber ammunition were  purchased from commercial ammunition producers in fiscal year 2004.  According to a PEO official, DOD paid about $10 million more than a  similar amount of small caliber ammunition would cost from Lake City.  However, Lake City could not meet the 2004 requirement. Although DOD  paid a premium as a result of the need to procure ammunition outside the  government-owned base, we did not analyze whether maintaining a more  robust base would have been cost-effective.", "According to DOD officials, the increased buys for small caliber  ammunition are being funded through supplemental appropriations.", "Tables 5 and 6 illustrate how much funding for small and medium caliber  ammunition acquisitions has been proposed by the President\u2019s Budget,  and the final funding including supplemental funds for fiscal years 2001 to  2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PEO Is Taking Steps to Meet Future Small and Medium Caliber Needs, but Implementation Problems Exist", "paragraphs": ["The PEO has taken certain steps to ensure that the national technology  and industrial base can meet future small and medium caliber ammunition  needs.

First, the PEO plans to increase Lake  City\u2019s production capacity to 1.5 billion rounds per year by March 2006  through additional modernization. Moreover, the PEO is in the process of  selecting a commercial contractor that will provide an additional  300 million small caliber ammunition rounds per year. This commercial  producer will serve as a second source in addition to Lake City, to meet  small caliber ammunition needs. The contract is to be awarded in mid  2005, with initial deliveries to start in January 2007. Also, the PEO is  requiring that this commercial source be able to supply an additional  200 million rounds of small caliber ammunition, if requirements continue  to increase.", "In the event that future small caliber ammunition requirements were to  decrease, which would likely happen if war fighting operations were  scaled back, the PEO plans to reduce the amount of ammunition produced  at Lake City, while maintaining the 300 million rounds of ammunition  production provided by the commercial producer. According to a PEO  official, the reduction at Lake City will be accomplished by reducing the  number of work shifts rather than by storing or mothballing equipment.  Therefore, a future need for increased production could be met by adding  shifts. By building this flexibility into the production at Lake City, whose  production the PEO can expand or contract under a new contract starting  in fiscal year 2008, the PEO hopes to avoid the need for future additional  buys, while retaining the capacity to expand production at Lake City."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Planning Process for Ammunition Has Been Initiated, but Information Needed for Effective Implementation and Measuring Performance Is Lacking", "paragraphs": ["The PEO has initiated a planning process to ensure that the national  technology and industrial base for conventional ammunition\u2019s capacity  can effectively and efficiently respond to future DOD ammunition needs,  including small and medium caliber ammunition requirements. While the  process is ongoing, information needed to effectively implement all  aspects of the process and performance metrics needed to annually  measure progress and ensure accountability are lacking.", "In November 2003, the PEO issued a plan with the following five goals:  (1) balance industrial base and acquisition management risk; (2) transform  to meet current and future requirements; (3) incentivize industry to  reinvest in capital equipment and processes; (4) modernize required  manufacturing and logistics capacity; and (5) operate effectively and  efficiently. In addition to these five goals, the plan establishes 30 initiatives  that are intended to help meet the goals. (See appendix II for a list of the   30 initiatives by goal.)", "The PEO has begun taking actions to implement several of the 30  initiatives to achieve the plan\u2019s goals. For example, the PEO has begun  implementing initiatives that address determining whether procurements  of conventional ammunition should be restricted to sources within the  national technology and industrial base, as provided by section 806 of   Public Law 105-261. The PEO, the Joint Munitions Command, and the  Defense Contract Management Agency have worked together to begin the  development of a risk assessment tool that will include industrial base  data such as requirements, suppliers, capacities, deficiencies, production  schedules, and inventories. The tool also will be capable of developing  reports with \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios to anticipate production problems. To  date, the Joint Munitions Command and the Defense Contract  Management Agency have identified hundreds of conventional  ammunitions items that could not be produced if only one supplier of the  necessary components needed to build the item would suddenly become  unavailable. As part of its efforts to implement its section 806  responsibilities, the PEO is encouraging all ammunition program managers  to provide acquisition plans for their conventional ammunition needs, as  required by regulation. This process is intended to help the PEO ensure  that other Army and DOD components are developing procurement  strategies that adhere to section 806.", "Despite these actions, the implementation of the planning process has two  major weaknesses. First, the PEO lacks the information needed to  effectively implement several initiatives. For example, conducting a  business case analysis to determine the future size and scope of the  government-owned base to preserve critical capabilities and reduce costs  is key to meeting the PEO goals. However, implementing the business case  analysis is outside the PEO\u2019s scope of responsibility. Further, who will  need to take action and what needs to be done to develop the business  case have not yet been specified. Further, in the case of the acquisition  plans, the PEO has encouraged ammunition program managers to submit  acquisition plans so that determinations can be made as to what should be  procured within the national technology and industrial base, as called for  in section 806. Some services program managers (other than Army) have  not been forthcoming with all the information needed to make these  determinations.  The authority to require program managers to submit  these plans rests with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics.", "Second, the performance measures in place are not sufficient to monitor  progress made in meeting the plan\u2019s goals and objectives and ensure  accountability. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (Public Law 103-62) provides guiding principles that agencies should use  to gauge progress towards long-term goals. These principles include  identifying required resources such as staff, schedules, and costs.  Additionally, the act requires agencies to report actual performance  against performance goals, the reasons certain goals were not met, and  future planned actions to meet stated goals. The 30 initiatives included in  the PEO\u2019s plan establish some accountability for implementation because  they identify the objectives for each goal and general performance  measures. Further, the PEO is developing plans for each of the   30 initiatives\u201414 of which have been developed. These plans contain  information on major activities or actions that must be taken to complete  an initiative and identify the PEO staff responsible for managing each  initiative. However, the PEO has not yet completed the development of  implementation plans. Furthermore, the initiatives in the strategic plan do  not include key results-oriented principles such as identifying key  resources needed to meet the plan\u2019s goals and objectives including costs,  schedules, and responsible DOD components for individual initiatives. In  addition the plan does not include an annual review process to compare  the actions taken to the desired performance.

However, it is imperative that the warfighter be provided with sufficient  ammunition to carry out missions to counter ongoing and emerging  threats without amassing wasteful unused stockpiles.
