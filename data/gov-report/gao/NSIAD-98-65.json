One major exception is in the medical area, since some personnel assigned to institutional positions are expected to deploy in wartime. A significant amount of the Army\u2019s personnel and budget are devoted to institutional functions. For example, the Army\u2019s Program Objective Memorandum for fiscal year 1998 included about 132,000 active Army and about 247,000 civilian institutional positions. These positions represented about  27 percent of the total active Army and 100 percent of Army civilians. Funding for institutional personnel totals about $18 billion per year.", "Army institutional functions have received increasing scrutiny in recent years because the Army has been unable to (1) support personnel requirements based on workload and (2) ensure that these functions are carried out in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, the Army continues to rely on its active personnel to perform institutional functions despite shortfalls in operational forces. The Army Audit Agency reported in 1992 and 1994 that the Army did not know its workload and thus could neither justify personnel needs and budgets nor improve productivity and efficiency. Our February 1997 report recommended that the Secretary of the Army report to the Secretary of Defense, as a material weakness under the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act, the Army\u2019s long-standing problem with determining institutional personnel requirements without an analysis of the workload. The Army agreed with the recommendation and prepared a plan, as required by the act, to resolve the weakness. The plan was approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs in October 1997. All corrective actions detailed in this plan are to be completed by December 1999.", "In January 1995, the Army began an effort to reengineer institutional processes and redesign organizational structures so that the institutional Army would effectively and efficiently develop, generate, deploy, and sustain operational forces. The Army\u2019s reengineering principles include eliminating unnecessary layering of functions and reducing the number of major headquarter commands. The Army stated that savings in active Army institutional positions are to be reinvested in the operational forces. The redesign effort, referred to as Force XXI Institutional Redesign, is to be conducted in three phases, with each phase examining different functions. Phase I was completed in March 1996, and phases II and III are expected to be completed in March 1998 and March 2000, respectively. In May 1997, the Secretary of Defense announced the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, which included reducing 33,700 civilian Army positions and some active Army positions. According to Army officials, these reductions would be in addition to the 13,000 positions already programmed between fiscal years 1998 and 2003 or those resulting from phase I redesign efforts.", "In September 1997, the Deputy Secretary of Defense introduced DOD\u2019s strategic plan to implement the Government Performance and Results Act.

Second, as of October 1997, critical subplans outlining how the Army intends to meet its milestones had not been developed for the costing system and the computer-based methodology. The Army\u2019s progress in implementing the computer-based methodology during its initial pilot test has been slower than the Army has estimated. Last, milestones for critical portions of the plan have slipped from original estimates, even though the plan\u2019s overall completion date has remained the same.

AWPS was developed to integrate workload and workforce information so depot managers can project the workforce needed to accomplish various levels of workload. The 12-step methodology was developed to link personnel to workload, reduce the cost of accomplishing work, and help managers make choices as they balance personnel and workload. The Army plans to integrate the workload and workforce information provided by the 12-step methodology and AWPS with the Civilian Manpower Integrated Costing System.

Figure 1 shows the components of the 12-step method. Even though Army commands will continue to have some flexibility in creating their own requirements program, they will be required to perform all of the analyses included in the 12-step method.

Also, the Command did not perform efficiency reviews (step 3) because it assumed that the organization had already become efficient as a result of downsizing. Further, the Command did not consider customer satisfaction (step 7) as an element of timeliness and quality of services or examine best practice approaches (step 3).

The performance measurement control module compares actual to planned cost and schedule performance, thereby allowing users to identify problem areas. This module can identify the work centers contributing to the most significant cost and schedule variances. The workload forecasting module stores project data, labor expenditures, performance data, and scheduling information by work center. This module allows managers to compare workload levels to available direct labor and analyze changes in forecasted workload. This comparison can reveal mismatches or overloads before firm commitments are made to customers. Finally, the workforce forecasting module contains information on employee skills and leave and attrition rates. This information provides shop and depot managers with an accurate picture of the overall number of employees and the number that are available in each work center. Analyzing the workforce by skill groups allows depot commanders to plan for the amount of work that can be handled and to consider overtime, contracting, or reassigning workers among different work centers.", "The Army has been developing AWPS since February 1996. The established goals for AWPS are (1) having all three modules operational at all five depots by January 1998; (2) operating a supplementary module  (i.e., resource schedule and control) for supporting personnel assignments to projects by fiscal year 2000; and (3) having all modules on line and operational at depots, arsenals, and ammunition facilities by fiscal  year 2000. However, as of December 1997, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs had not written the subplan for implementing AWPS or identified the specific steps or milestones needed to achieve the goals. Instead, the Army has set short-term, interim steps as AWPS progresses. For example, in August 1997, the Army established specific steps for correcting data errors between August 1997 and January 1998. Without a detailed implementation schedule, however, the Army lacks the tools it needs to ensure that it can meet the milestones in the material weakness plan. For example, the Army\u2019s milestone for implementing AWPS at arsenals and ammunition facilities has already changed from July to December 1998.

However, according to Industrial Operations Command officials, the Army must still test and validate two of the three modules at Corpus Christi and correct data errors from feeder systems. Our review showed that, even though AWPS equipment and software had been installed at all five depots, none of the three modules is being fully used at any location, including Corpus Christi.", "Army Materiel Command officials cited problems that could affect the Army\u2019s ability to implement AWPS at the depots by December 1997. First, the performance measurement control module has been undergoing testing and validation since March 1997 and was planned to be fully operational by December 1997, assuming that the data errors would be corrected. As of August 1997, the Corpus Christi Army Depot was correcting data errors and therefore was not using this module to manage any depot work, not even work at the shop floor level as the Army had originally claimed. The other two modules are planned to be operational by February 1998, assuming that the data errors are corrected. An unresolved problem in the workload forecasting module is how to program work that will be started in one fiscal year and completed during the following fiscal year.

However, as of November 1997, AWPS users were not fully trained, and some training requirements were not yet defined. Army officials stated that training on the performance measurement control module has been completed at the five depots. However, Corpus Christi Army Depot officials stated in August 1997 that 257 staff members at the depot have been trained. The depot employs approximately 1,500 personnel. Although not all 1,500 personnel need further training, depot and Industrial Operations Command officials agreed that additional training is required to teach shop floor supervisors and depot managers how to interpret AWPS data and how to use it to identify work areas needing improvement. Command officials stated that training for the workforce forecasting module was to be completed by December 1997, but training requirements for the workload forecasting module have not yet been defined.", "Last, Industrial Operations Command officials told us that AWPS is still an evolving concept and that corporate-level system requirements are not yet defined.

In July 1997, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that all depots and arsenals using AWPS will be able to match workload requirements and personnel projections. Thus, any personnel reductions will be based on the knowledge of work that will not be performed.

Officials from the Army Program Analysis and Evaluation and Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans offices concurred. For example, the fiscal year 1998-2003 memorandum claimed savings of approximately $430 million for the single stock fund initiative. This effort is based on the belief that a single stock fund eliminates duplicative materiel and financial management functions. However, the Army Materiel Command, as the proponent for this initiative, claims that fiscal year 1998 projected savings of $30 million will not be realized because of problems in implementing changes to financial systems.

As a result, we recommended that the Secretary of the Army closely monitor the military positions the Army planned to save from the redesign initiatives and have a contingency plan in place in the event the personnel savings do not materialize.

However, RAND currently estimates the initiative will yield between 800 and 1,050 spaces because the Army decided not to contract out all 2,100 spaces and is testing a combination of active, reserve, and contract personnel.", "Additionally, the transfer of positions is also based on reducing attrition.The Army assumed reduced attrition would free 750 training and recruiting institutional positions. If personnel stay in the Army, then it would not need to recruit and train replacements. However, the Training and Doctrine Command currently projects an increase in initial entry training requirements from fiscal years 1998 to 1999 rather than a decrease. Army headquarters officials acknowledged that they could not explain how the 750 spaces were calculated, and Command officials said that it was not involved in deriving the 750 spaces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Office Monitors the Results of Redesign Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Even though the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans is the executive agent for redesign assessments, there is no single office that systematically manages and monitors redesign results.

However, the Office of the Assistant Secretary states that institutional redesign initiatives are monitored and discussed only if their implementation or savings become jeopardized. A Financial Management and Comptroller written statement explains that none of the redesign initiatives have been designated as topics to be monitored during the quarterly reviews, including the Senior Reserve Officer\u2019s Training Corps, which accounts for one-half the projected position transfers and $336 million in unaccounted for implementation costs.

Such a methodology is essential for the Army to make data-based decisions on how to allocate resources among institutional organizations, have assurance the highest priority functions are funded, and be aware of the risks in not funding some institutional functions. The use of workload-based criteria in implementing the programmed downsizing of 13,000 positions and Quadrennial Defense Review reductions could help the Army minimize effects on its ability to perform institutional functions and may help introduce more efficient organizations and processes. A smaller institutional force may also generate savings the Army could apply to its modernization programs or its operational forces.", "Although the Army has a plan to correct this material weakness, the plan is incomplete, and the Army may have difficulty accomplishing the corrective actions within established time frames. The plan provides a mechanism to ensure compliance with the Army\u2019s methodology for determining institutional requirements. However, if the plan\u2019s certification and quality assurance milestones are extended due to insufficient resources, the Army will be making reductions without knowing if commands are performing the analyses required to make sound decisions about staffing levels and reduce the cost of accomplishing institutional functions.", "The Army\u2019s plan is to simultaneously develop workload approaches (12-step method and AWPS) and a system to calculate the cost for institutional positions. Until all three efforts are completed and integrated, the Army cannot be assured that it has the minimum essential institutional force, and the Army\u2019s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution system for institutional functions will not be based on workload. If key subplans remain undeveloped, the Army has no method for assessing its progress toward meeting the plan\u2019s current completion date of December 1999. As a result, further reductions or retention of institutional personnel may result without the benefits of workload analysis and assessments of risks and tradeoffs.", "Army oversight is necessary to ensure that Force XXI institutional redesign results are achieved. To date, the Army has not identified specific, measurable redesign goals, even though its own guidance acknowledges the importance of doing so. Army documents include general goals for improving institutional efficiency but, other than reducing the number of major commands, do not specify measures to achieve efficiencies. Without measurable performance goals, it may be difficult for the Army to know when its vision for the institutional force, as stated in Pamphlet 100xx, is achieved. Further, savings will be less than projected. In fact, the Army may not know the source of the savings because no single office monitors the status of redesign initiatives or their implementation costs.", "The Force XXI redesign concept includes proposals to reduce the number of major commands and realign their functions. Since the 12-step methodology includes analyses of how to structure and staff organizations efficiently, the Army could coordinate implementing major command realignments with the 12-step analysis techniques. Such coordination could result in institutional efficiencies, which would provide the Army an opportunity to transfer military institutional personnel to fill shortfalls in support forces.
