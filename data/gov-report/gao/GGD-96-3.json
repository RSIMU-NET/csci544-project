Hence, TSM has become part of IRS\u2019 business vision for both technological and organizational change.", "IRS\u2019 business vision includes the following basic organizational components: (1) submission processing centers to receive paper returns, correspondence, and other tax documents; (2) customer service centers to interact with taxpayers mainly by telephone; (3) district offices to use face-to-face contacts to assist taxpayers and enforce the tax laws; and (4) computer centers to maintain taxpayer accounts, process electronically filed returns, and receive electronic fund transfers.", "IRS\u2019 customer service vision is a plan for changing the way IRS interacts with taxpayers. IRS does this in a number of ways, such as answering inquiries, clarifying and correcting tax returns, and collecting unpaid taxes. The agency has decided that these interactions are too fragmentary in its current organization and that taxpayers who contact IRS are too often told to call or write to other offices. It thus developed a plan to consolidate, in 23 customer service centers, work that has been done in at least 70 organizational units in 44 locations, including much work currently done by correspondence.", "As shown in figure 1, this consolidation of functions involves a major restructuring of IRS operations, including a reduction in the number of staff doing customer service work in 1994 from about 29,000 to an estimated 22,240 in 2001. Customer service centers would absorb the functions of toll-free taxpayer assistance sites, which answer calls about tax law and procedures, taxpayer accounts, and notices that taxpayers receive from IRS. In addition, customer service centers would attempt to convert to the telephone some work now done by correspondence in the collection, adjustment, taxpayer relations, and underreporter branches of service centers. Customer service centers would also absorb the workload of the current automated collection call sites, which contact taxpayers to secure payments and answer calls from taxpayers who are the subjects of collection actions.

One of IRS\u2019 reasons for consolidating taxpayer interaction functions is its perception that taxpayers are often referred from one office to another or told to write a letter to resolve their inquiries.", "The difficulty of achieving this goal and of measuring its achievement is illustrated by one of IRS\u2019 first experiences with initial contact resolution in 1991. By giving telephone assistors additional computer terminals with access to taxpayer accounts and more authority to resolve issues, IRS tried to reduce the contacts taxpayers had to make to resolve questions about their accounts. However, we reported that IRS was not reliably measuring its performance in this area. For fiscal year 1993, IRS reported achieving 96-percent initial contact resolution for these types of calls, but we found that about 80 percent of a small sample of these callers had to make additional contacts to resolve their account concerns. IRS acknowledged that its methodology for measuring initial contact resolution was flawed and agreed to develop a more accurate way to measure initial contact resolution for all types of calls.", "IRS intends to reach its initial contact resolution goal by bringing functions together in customer service centers, giving its representatives broader responsibility and authority, and giving them better technological tools with easy access to the needed data.", "Another IRS goal is to improve telephone accessibility. Currently, many taxpayers find it difficult to reach IRS by telephone. In fiscal year 1994, 73 percent of all call attempts received busy signals.

When dealing with a taxpayer from another area, they had to request data from the IRS service center responsible for that area and recontact the taxpayer. In early 1995, IRS implemented a networking procedure among the 10 service center computers so that customer service representatives could have on-line access to some taxpayer account data nationwide, rather than only within their service areas. IRS plans to give its customer service representatives additional on-line access to taxpayer data nationwide. IRS also has an automated system that routes calls nationwide when one area is overloaded, and plans for the system to route specific calls and assign compliance cases on a nationwide basis to those customer service representatives that have the appropriate level of expertise to resolve the taxpayer\u2019s concern.

As of June 30, 1995, the Fresno, CA, Customer Service Center had substantial experience in converting correspondence, and the Cincinnati, OH, Customer Service Center had just begun. IRS has calculated that the Fresno prototype Customer Service Center, working by telephone, has been at least twice as productive as the service center adjustments branch, working by correspondence. However, the director of the study noted that the range of inquiries handled by the customer service center may not have been as complicated as at the adjustments branch. In addition, the study showed that the cost to process inquiries was lower using the customer service approach; however, telephone charges were not factored in the cost. Thus, while converting work from written correspondence to the telephone appears on the surface to be more efficient and less costly, the extent of savings from this approach is still unknown.", "Success in converting correspondence to the telephone may require that IRS have authority to resolve more issues based on oral evidence from taxpayers rather than signed statements. Presently, some oral evidence is acceptable for such issues as penalty abatements up to a certain dollar amount. An IRS official told us that IRS might need legislation to remove some of the existing requirements for written evidence to meet its workload conversion goal. Achieving this goal would also depend on the willingness of taxpayers to resolve issues by telephone, which in turn may depend on the accessibility of the telephone service.

Earlier access would come from the improved technology expected for processing returns and checking the returns against information from employers and other reporting sources at the time the return is filed. IRS estimates that through increased voluntary compliance, to which customer service will contribute, and increased enforcement efforts, overall compliance will increase from 86.4 to 87.2 percent by 1997.

IRS has defined an owner as an individual assigned to be responsible and accountable for all the activities associated with a core business system, subsystem, or process. This responsibility often includes establishing business requirements, setting quality measures, and overseeing the development of new products and services intended to enhance the performance of the core business system in meeting taxpayers\u2019 needs.", "IRS has designated owners for the six core business systems and for most of the subsystems and processes that comprise the majority of IRS\u2019 activities. Two of these core business systems, Managing Accounts and Ensuring Compliance, include the subsystems and processes that are to be transferred to customer service. Thus, the subsystems and processes that are to make up customer service are divided between two current IRS core business systems. (As the boundaries of the two functional organizations involved, Taxpayer Services and Compliance, are identical to the core business system boundaries, customer service responsibilities are split between the functional organizations also.)", "Because IRS\u2019 current organizational structure does not match the structure planned for customer service, no owner for the emerging customer service organization has yet been designated. The result is that responsibility for carrying out the many projects and tasks necessary to work toward the goals of the customer service vision is divided between two IRS organizations, which are headed by two different senior managers called chiefs, who are also responsible for directing current returns processing, taxpayer services, examination, and collection activities.", "The divided ownership of the components of the customer service vision also raises the question of how the new customer service organization that will emerge as more sites are rolled out will be managed. Traditionally, IRS offices that carried out the service activities being combined at customer service sites have been part of a district and/or regional office, with the National Office providing policy guidance and oversight. However, significant changes have recently been made in both the number and responsibilities of IRS\u2019 District and Regional offices. And, in some instances, components of IRS\u2019 National Office have been structured in such a way that they have greater control over field operations than has traditionally been the case.

Assigning process owners at the operational level has been difficult because there was confusion about who they should be and what their specific roles and responsibilities should be, especially in activities involving more than one core business system.", "IRS did not assign a process owner for its Voice Balance Due (VBD) interactive telephone system until late in its development, thus risking the need for changes late in the development process. The VBD system cuts across the Managing Accounts and Ensuring Compliance core business systems. IRS officials told us that in cases where core businesses overlap there has been confusion about who the owner should be. In the case of the VBD system, Managing Accounts personnel told us they owned it, but because the system includes collection activities, the Customer Service Site Executive\u2019s Office believed the system belonged to Ensuring Compliance. However, the Director of Ensuring Compliance said that his office was not the owner of the project, although it had been involved.", "IRS officials in the Telephone Routing Interactive System (TRIS) Project Office, the developer of the new telephone systems, told us that they needed to have process owner input for the VBD quality measures so that they could plan and collect the management data needed to measure the system\u2019s performance. TRIS officials also told us they did the best they could to determine the management data needed for the pilot test.", "Near the end of the pilot test, in June 1995, IRS assigned the Assistant Commissioner for Taxpayer Services\u2014a process owner\u2014responsibility for all the interactive systems, including the VBD. This was over 2 years after the TRIS Project Office began the design and development of the VBD. As a process owner, the Assistant Commissioner for Taxpayer Services is responsible for coordinating the requirements and overseeing the development for all interactive telephone systems, including those that involve more than one core business system.

Quality measures are important because IRS plans to use the measures to determine the success of the new systems and whether to implement them in the field. To avoid delays in development, the TRIS Project Office established quality measures and began testing the systems based on those measures. About 3 weeks into the 30-day test period, the owners required that additional measures be tested, and the pilot period was extended for at least 30 days.

On the other hand, too much division of responsibility could undermine the flexibility needed for efficient operations and the goal of providing one-stop service to taxpayers.", "IRS\u2019 task is complicated by the redeployment understanding it reached with NTEU. One of the considerations in filling customer service positions is that preference must be given according to the seniority of employees whose jobs will be adversely affected by reorganization. While some of these employees work at the current taxpayer services and collection call sites, more than half are in service center positions that do not involve telephone interaction with taxpayers.

However, IRS studies have also shown that the success of such programs is very sensitive to menu design.

ICP is being developed in four increments that will progressively expand the capability of representatives to interact with the databases for taxpayer accounts, collection, examinations, and underreported income. ICP is to provide a series of questions and prompts to help representatives work through various kinds of taxpayer issues, as well as make queries and updates to account data with assurance that the data will be reconciled among the different databases. Under ICP, IRS also intends to develop a workload management system that would allocate representatives\u2019 time to various functions, create electronic case folders, and assign cases to representatives who have been certified to handle the issues involved.", "As of June 30, 1995, the first increment of ICP had been piloted at Nashville, allowing customer service representatives to access existing databases from a single terminal. Through 1998, IRS plans to develop, test, and install the remaining increments, as well as train representatives in their use. ICP includes plans to transfer IRS data from its existing separate databases to its eventual consolidated database.

Electronically filed returns contain few errors compared to paper returns and thus should generate fewer problems to be resolved by customer service representatives. Similarly, electronic scanning through the Document Processing System is expected to reduce data input errors in processing paper returns. IRS expects these two projects to replace most of the manual processing of tax returns and greatly reduce errors.", "As of June 30, 1995, results of these projects were somewhat disappointing. The number of electronically filed returns received was running 17.8 percent below that of the same period in 1994 (11.1 million compared to 13.5 million in 1994). Attempts to use scanning equipment to process the simplest tax returns were also not succeeding as planned. The final outcome of these projects will not be known for several years. To the extent that the projects fail to achieve projected results, the follow-up workload generated for customer service centers will be greater than anticipated. This would mean that estimated savings in staffing and costs may not accrue to the degree that IRS had envisioned. In response to our attempt to learn how shortcomings with certain TSM projects could affect customer service, IRS officials told us that a statement of work has been written to contract out for a comprehensive analysis of the costs and savings associated with customer service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Measuring Success and Managing Competing Workload Demands in Customer Service Centers", "paragraphs": ["IRS has not determined all of the indicators by which success in customer service centers will be measured, although it has committed itself to goals of 95-percent initial contact resolution and near-100 percent accessibility.The customer service centers are to combine work that is currently done in several different organizational components of IRS. IRS has recognized that simply transplanting the workload priorities and performance measures of these components to the new centers would be inappropriate. It intends to develop work plans and performance measures relevant to the new organizations.", "Without appropriate performance indicators in place, IRS has only physical indicators, such as sites established, persons redeployed, and technological programs installed to measure progress toward the customer service vision. While useful, these indicators do not measure the value of the reorganization and may not alert IRS to developing problems. Developing meaningful indicators will not be easy because IRS is attempting to achieve qualitative as well as quantitative change.", "Managing the workload of customer service centers will also be a significant challenge. We believe that the new centers will likely feel the tension of competing demands to answer inquiries, adjust accounts, follow up on examinations, and collect unpaid taxes. If taxpayers are dissatisfied with accessibility and waiting times, pressure will build to answer more calls at the expense of compliance and collection activities. IRS will no longer have organizational walls to protect these different functions and will have to balance them within a single organizational structure. IRS is counting on technology to cope with such problems. Under ICP, IRS intends to develop an automated Workload Management System (WMS) that will provide the capabilities to create and manage cases, track and control correspondence, and maintain employees\u2019 skills inventories.

It is too soon to conclude whether IRS will eventually accomplish its goals, but the gap between current operations and its customer service vision is very great.", "A lack of clarity in management responsibilities has, to some extent, hampered IRS in the early stages of implementing its customer service vision. This lack of clarity exists both at the senior management level and at the lower management levels for specific TSM projects crucial to the vision. The reasons for this are in part related to IRS\u2019 current organizational structure, but are also due to problems in adjusting to a new management structure based on the core business system approach. At the senior management level, IRS has not designated an owner to be responsible and accountable for all the work units that will be part of customer service and the many projects that must be successfully completed to make the customer service vision a reality. IRS officials plan to address the need for an owner for customer service at the senior management level.", "At lower management levels, the process owner was assigned late for overseeing an interactive telephone system that involved both the Managing Accounts and Ensuring Compliance core business systems. Also, in two other instances owners for such systems had assumed ownership roles, but had not adequately carried out their responsibilities.", "The problems we identified have not had a serious adverse effect to date because IRS\u2019 implementation of the customer service vision is still in the early stages. However, failure to deal with them as soon as possible could delay the development and implementation of new products and services needed for customer service.", "Finally, to achieve its customer service goals, IRS will have to overcome a number of challenges involving managing the transition to a new organization while meeting ongoing workload demands, defining customer service representatives\u2019 responsibilities, realizing the benefits of new information technology, and developing effective ways to measure performance in the new centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue clarify the criteria for assigning process owners responsibility for TSM projects when they involve more than one core business system; define process owners\u2019 roles and responsibilities for TSM projects involving more than one core business system; and emphasize to those designated as process owners the need for them to provide the business requirements necessary to develop, test, and implement new customer service products and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained oral comments on a draft of this report from senior IRS officials in a meeting on August 21, 1995.
