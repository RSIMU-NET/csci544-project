For example, GSA officials stated that the process to  certify Google to meet government standards for their migration to  cloud-based e-mail was a challenge. They explained that, contrary to  traditional computing solutions, agencies must certify an entire cloud  vendor\u2019s infrastructure. In Google\u2019s case, it took GSA more than a  year to certify more than 200 Google employees and the entire  organization\u2019s infrastructure (including hundreds of thousands of  servers) before GSA could use Google\u2019s service.", "Ensuring data portability and interoperability: To preserve their ability  to change vendors in the future, agencies may attempt to avoid  platforms or technologies that \u201clock\u201d customers into a particular  product.

The department stated that it has  established an annual requirement for all programs and initiatives to  conduct an alternative analysis for retiring legacy systems and using  cloud-based services, if feasible. The analysis includes the  development of estimated costs, milestones, performance goals, and  legacy system retirement plans. The department disagreed with our  recommendation to establish cost estimates, performance goals, and  plans to retire associated legacy systems for each of the department\u2019s  cloud-based services discussed in this report, noting that these  services did not have associated legacy systems to be retired. In a  clarifying conversation, the Division Chief, Bureau of Information  Resource Management, explained that one of the two migrated  services ran on a virtual machine that hosts many other programs,  and the other service transitioned from internally-managed software to  a cloud-based service, neither of which required the retirement of an  existing system. We acknowledge that a retirement plan may not be  applicable for these two services; however, our recommendation is  not focused solely on the need for legacy retirement plans, but also  identifies the need to establish cost estimates and performance goals  for each cloud-based service discussed in this report. As stated in this  report, State did not establish performance goals for its electronic  library service. Performance goals help to set priorities and drive  progress toward key outcomes, thus enabling agencies to measure  performance and determine whether the acquired cloud-based service  is performing as intended and achieving the desired outcome.  Therefore, we believe that the recommendation is applicable and  relevant to the department.

We then selected agencies from each budget category to include (1) a  mix of services (e.g., e-mail, collaboration, and website hosting) that  agencies had proposed moving to the cloud and (2) agencies that were  cited by OMB as having successfully implemented a cloud solution.  Seven agencies were selected: the Departments of Agriculture (USDA),  Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), State, and  the Treasury; and the General Services Administration (GSA) and the  Small Business Administration (SBA). We analyzed documentation from  the selected agencies, including project plans and progress reports,  which described the actions agencies have taken to migrate services to a  cloud solution. We also compared agencies\u2019 migration plans to OMB\u2019s  associated guidance to determine any variances. We interviewed officials  responsible for implementing the cloud solutions to determine how the  services were selected and migrated. Finally, we interviewed officials  from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and OMB  to understand cloud computing standards, requirements, and guidance  for federal agencies.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed officials from each of  the selected agencies and asked them to describe challenges associated  with their implementation of cloud solutions. Because of the open-ended  nature of our discussions with agency officials, we conducted a content  analysis of the information we received in order to identify and categorize  common challenges. To do so, two team analysts independently reviewed  and drafted a series of challenge statements based upon each agency\u2019s  records. They then worked together to resolve any discrepancies,  choosing to report on challenges that were identified by two or more  agencies. These common challenges were presented in the report.  Finally, we compared the challenges to OMB\u2019s Federal Cloud Computing  Strategy and the Chief Information Officers Council\u2019s and Chief  Acquisition Officers Council\u2019s cloud computing guidance to determine the  extent to which they were addressed.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 through July  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
