Treasury has a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions of disbursing payments and collecting revenue. Since the 1980s, Treasury has used agents to move from paper to electronic transactions as it has modernized its systems. For example, Treasury began using financial agents to collect tax revenue electronically in response to a 1984 law and to make payments electronically in response to a 1996 law. Such changes have continued since Congress enacted a permanent, indefinite appropriation in 2004 for Treasury to reimburse financial agents, after which Treasury began including in its annual budget the total amount paid to financial agents. Compensation to financial agents has grown from $378 million in fiscal year 2005 to $636 million in fiscal year 2015, partly due to increases in the number of debit and credit card payments made to federal agencies that are processed by financial agents. While Treasury discloses in its annual budget the total amount paid to financial agents, it has not fully disclosed in a central location information about individual agents, including their compensation and services provided. Treasury officials said they are not required and have not determined a need to publicly disclose compensation under each financial agency agreement. According to an Office of Management and Budget directive on open government, transparency promotes accountability by providing the public with information about government activities. Greater disclosure and transparency could enhance the accountability of Treasury's use of financial agents by informing the public and Congress about how much and for what purposes it is spending federal funds to obtain services from financial agents.", "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service)\u2014the largest user of financial agents within Treasury\u2014developed its financial agent selection process (FASP) guidance to document the steps and internal controls that its program offices generally are expected to follow in selecting and designating financial agents. The guidance provides assurances that a FASP is effective and efficient, documents key information, and complies with applicable laws and regulations. The guidance directs program offices to maintain an administrative record of key documents generated during a FASP. GAO selected five financial agents designated between 2010 and 2015 to review their administrative records but could review only four because the record for one was not created. None contained all the documents listed in the guidance, but three contained the majority. For example, the record for my RA\u00ae, a new retirement savings program using a financial agent to provide custodial services, contained 6 of 11 key documents\u2014missing, for example, certain planning and approval documents. As a result, the records varied in the extent to which they complied with Fiscal Service's guidance, including controls. In November 2015, Fiscal Service revised its guidance to require not only program offices to deliver an electronic copy of their administrative records to the Bank Policy and Oversight (BPO) Division but also BPO to use a checklist to ensure that the records are complete. The 2015 guidance was not in effect for the records GAO reviewed. However, BPO's implementation of the new procedure should provide assurances that future designations are in compliance with the FASP guidance, including controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Treasury publicly disclose in a central location information about its financial agents, including their compensation and services provided.

Treasury uses financial agency agreements to  designate financial institutions as financial agents. Once designated by  Treasury, a financial agent is subject to the agreement\u2019s terms and  certain other requirements. Additionally, the agreements generally state  that the financial agent owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty and fair dealing to  the United States. Before 2004, Treasury used compensating balances to  reimburse financial agents for their services.

Revenue collections programs use financial agents to collect federal  revenue from individuals and businesses, including for taxes, student loan  repayments, and customs duties. Payments programs use financial  agents to help Fiscal Service disburse payments to individuals and  businesses on behalf of federal agencies, such as benefit payments  made by the Social Security Administration and the Department of  Veterans Affairs and payments to businesses for goods and services  provided to the federal government. The debt collection program uses a  financial agent to operate a centralized service to assist federal agencies  with the management of their accounts receivable. Fiscal Service\u2019s  Treasury securities program area manages the issuance and sales of  Treasury\u2019s marketable and nonmarketable securities.

Subsequently, Treasury, through Fiscal Service, has continued to  promote electronic transactions for its revenue collections and payments  programs, including information systems for tracking those transactions,  through various efforts to increase efficiency, reduce fraud, and promote  transparency.", "In 1984, Congress directed Treasury to provide more electronic services  for collecting payments. As more states took advantage of technological  advances to implement electronic tax collection systems, Treasury began  piloting programs modeled on individual states\u2019 programs that used  financial agents to collect tax receipts electronically. For example, TAX- LINK was an early pilot program that used three financial agents to  explore different concepts for implementing a nationwide electronic tax  payment system. TAX-LINK evolved into the Electronic Federal Tax  Payment System, which is Treasury\u2019s current program for collecting tax  payments from the public electronically. Treasury, through Fiscal Service,  uses a financial agent to operate the Electronic Federal Tax Payment  System and to provide customer support for taxpayers using the system.  As shown in figure 2, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System  expedites the collection process by collecting tax payments electronically  rather than by paper check.", "The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act of 2003 also allowed the  conversion of paper checks into electronic images, called substitute  checks, which are the legal equivalent of a paper check. As a result,  Treasury developed the Electronic Check Processing program, which  uses a financial agent to operate a web-based platform to convert paper  check payments into electronic transactions, thereby reducing the amount  of time and costs associated with processing paper-based collections.

In response, Treasury developed programs that use  financial agents to help disburse payments electronically, particularly for  programs related to benefits payments. For example, Treasury developed  Electronic Transfer Accounts, which use financial agents to establish low- cost electronic accounts for recipients of federal benefits payments. In an  effort to increase electronic payments in areas where Electronic Transfer  Accounts were not available, in 2008, Fiscal Service developed the Direct  Express program, which uses a financial agent to provide pre-paid debit  card access to electronic benefits payments. In 2010, Treasury launched  an \u201call-electronic\u201d initiative, in part to further move federal benefit  payments away from paper checks to electronic options. Under the  initiative, Treasury required individuals receiving certain federal benefits  to receive payments electronically, such as through Direct Express cards.  According to Treasury officials, more than 98 percent of federal benefits  payments are currently made electronically as a result of Treasury\u2019s  expansion of its electronic payments programs, thus improving efficiency  and reducing costs and fraud.", "Fiscal Service is exploring new ways to use modern payment  technologies to further reduce the amount of paper-based payments  made by the federal government.

For example, it implemented the Over the Counter Channel  Application and the Collections Information Repository, which use  financial agents to gather and store information about revenue collection  transactions. The Over the Counter Channel Application and the  Collections Information Repository do not hold or disburse public money;  rather, they use financial agents to process and account for information  on the collection of public money. For example, the Over the Counter  Channel Application primarily collects data from the electronic processing  of checks and provides a web-based application for federal agencies to  access information on these transactions. The Collections Information  Repository provides a web-based means of tracking, reconciling, and  storing revenue collections transactions.

The first steps include obtaining approvals to use a financial  agent. Such steps and related internal controls include Fiscal Service\u2019s  program offices taking the following actions:  consulting with the Office of Chief Counsel as to whether designating  an agent is acceptable for the particular project, obtaining approval from the appropriate assistant commissioner to  designate a financial institution to provide the services, and  creating appropriate governance documentation, including a business  case or alternatives analysis, to justify the need for a particular  service, which is reviewed by the Investment Review Board for a new  program, or the assistant commissioner for an existing program  selecting a new financial agent.", "In addition, the FASP guidance highlights the need for program offices to  consider as early as possible the portability of the financial agent  services\u2014that is, the ability to transfer services from one agent to another  with minimum difficulty. According to the guidance, portability helps to  ensure that a program can continue without interruption if services need  to be transferred to another agent and promotes competitive pricing and  high-quality service.", "The next steps and related controls focus on planning and include Fiscal  Service\u2019s program offices taking the following actions: developing and documenting a FASP high-level strategy that outlines  the services needed and process for obtaining them, such as a  solicitation open to all or a limited number of financial institutions;  forming a selection team that consists of representatives, as needed,  from various areas; working with the Office of Chief Counsel to draft a financial agency  agreement using the model agreement as a starting point; drafting and updating, as needed, a FASP project plan, which is a  schedule of activities, action items, and expected time frames for  completion; and  specifying the criteria that will be used to evaluate and select financial  agents.", "The FASP guidance also discusses two other internal controls in this  phase. First, employees involved in selecting or designating the financial  agent should complete ethics training before their involvement in the  FASP. Second, program offices are to prepare, assemble, and maintain  throughout the process an administrative record comprised of documents  that describe and support the decisions made in each phase.", "The solicitation phase generally involves the selection team, in  collaboration with the Office of Chief Counsel, writing the financial agent  solicitation; publishing the solicitation to notify eligible financial institutions  about the FASP; and holding information sessions with eligible financial  institutions, if needed. Internal controls discussed in the guidance include  that (1) the selection team should have the solicitation\u2019s content approved  by an assistant commissioner before it is distributed and (2) the  solicitation should, among other things, state that interested financial  institutions must submit a proposal to be considered and, by submitting a  proposal, are agreeing to the FASP approach under which the selection  will be conducted.", "The FASP guidance notes that a financial institution should describe in its  proposal its ability to perform the work, which may include its experience in providing the same or similar services, ability to meet security requirements, personnel and infrastructure capabilities, and private sector and government references.", "The selection phase spans the receipt of proposals from financial  institutions to the selection (but not designation) of the financial institution  as a financial agent. According to the 2015 FASP guidance, employees  involved in selecting or designating the financial agent should sign a  conflict-of-interest statement before evaluating proposals. Other key steps  and related controls during this phase include the selection team taking  the following actions: having its members independently rate proposals of financial holding individual information sessions with financial institutions  determined to be the best able to meet the needs identified in the  solicitation and requiring them to sign an acknowledgment form  indicating that they, if selected, will accept the terms of the financial  agency agreement, subject to negotiation of services and other terms; using the selection criteria and scoring methodology previously  created to determine which financial institutions are least qualified to  perform the required services; notifying financial institutions that were least qualified to perform the  required services that they were not selected; asking the remaining financial institutions to produce a \u201cbest and final\u201d  offer and evaluating them against the selection criteria; and negotiating with the financial institution that submitted the best overall  offer to obtain the best possible level of service, price, or quality that is  required.", "Following its selection of the financial institution, the selection team must  prepare a recommendation memorandum explaining the reasons for  recommending the financial agent and a selection decision memorandum,  which the assistant commissioner signs to indicate his or her approval of  the final selection. According to the 2015 FASP guidance, except in an  exigency, no designation of a financial agent should be made without  being preceded or accompanied by a recommendation memorandum and  selection decision memorandum. Fiscal Service officials said that before  approving the selection, the assistant commissioner should obtain the  approval of the deputy commissioner, and the approval of the  commissioner on a case-by-case basis.", "The designation phase involves designating the selected financial  institution as a financial agent and closing out the process. The financial  agency agreement is used to designate a financial institution as a  financial agent, and the agreement is signed by authorized  representatives of the financial institution and Fiscal Service.", "The 2015 FASP guidance directs the program office responsible for  designating the financial agent to provide Fiscal Service\u2019s Bank Policy  and Oversight (BPO) Division with an electronic copy of its administrative  record. In turn, the guidance directs BPO to use a checklist to provide  assurance that the necessary documents for the administrative record  have been created and delivered.", "Unlike the 2010 FASP guidance, the 2015 FASP guidance includes a  two-part addendum that provides guidance on financial agent  compensation. Part one seeks to establish consistent compensation  policies across Fiscal Service\u2019s financial-agent-related business lines. It  discusses different pricing methodologies that can be used to  compensate financial agents and instructs that the selected methodology  should be based on (1) the financial agent\u2019s ability to minimize the  government\u2019s costs under normal and changing conditions but provide  the highest possible quality of service and (2) the degree to which the  prices of the financial agent services can be compared to the prices of  similar or identical financial industry services as a way of gauging cost  containment. Part two seeks to reduce the need for specialized  compensation policy negotiations by delineating Fiscal Service\u2019s  compensation policies.

Fiscal Service officials also told us Fiscal  Service takes steps to identify and mitigate potential conflicts of interest in  drafting the financial agency agreement. For example, Fiscal Service did  not want the myRA program\u2019s financial agent using myRA data to sell or  cross-market its own financial products to myRA account holders. To that  end, the agreement specifies that the agent may use any confidential  information received in connection with the agreement for the purposes of  fulfilling its duties under the agreement and not for its own commercial  purposes or those of a third party.", "In contrast, as required by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of  2008, Treasury issued regulations to address and manage actual and  potential conflicts of interest that could arise under the act, including from  financial agency agreements. The regulations require, among other  things, prospective financial agents to provide Treasury with sufficient  information to evaluate any organizational conflicts of interest and plans  to mitigate them. For example, an existing or potential financial agent  under the Troubled Asset Relief Program that provides advice or asset  management services to clients that own certain assets under the  program would be required to disclose that fact. Fiscal Service generally  does not face such conflicts of interest because it uses agents primarily to  provide payment and collection services rather than services related to  the acquisition, valuation, disposition, or management of assets.", "Financial agency agreements generally state that the agent, once  designated as a financial agent, owes Treasury a fiduciary duty of loyalty  and fair dealing when acting as a financial agent of the United States and  agrees to act at all times in the best interests of the United States when  carrying out its responsibilities under the agreement. Fiscal Service  officials said that if a financial agent faced a conflict of interest under its  agreement, the agent would have a duty to disclose and address that  conflict. Based on a recommendation recently made by the Treasury  Inspector General, Fiscal Service amended its model financial agency  agreement to include a provision requiring the financial agent to notify the  Inspector General if it becomes aware of any possible violation of federal  criminal law regarding fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or illegal  gratuities affecting services performed under the financial agency  agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Records for Financial Agents Designated between 2010 and 2015 Were Not Complete, but Recently Adopted Internal Controls Are Designed to Address the Deficiency", "paragraphs": ["Between 2010 and 2015, Fiscal Service created three new programs  (Centralized Receivables Service, myRA, and the Non-Traditional  Alternative Payments Service) and selected a financial agent for each,  according to Treasury officials.

Similarly, Treasury officials said they  decided to use a financial agent for myRA, a retirement savings program,  because Fiscal Service (1) had not been qualified to act as a Roth IRA  custodian under IRS rules, (2) had not yet established the necessary  infrastructure to operate a Roth IRA program, and (3) could implement  the program more quickly by using a financial agent.

For example, the record  for myRA, a new retirement savings program using a financial agent to  provide custodial services, contained 6 of 11 key documents\u2014missing,  for example, certain planning and approval documents. As a result, the  documents comprising the administrative records varied in the extent to  which they complied with Fiscal Service\u2019s internal controls set forth in the  2010 FASP guidance.

Importantly, no assurances  exist that program offices will be able to produce any missing documents.  For example, consistent with our findings, a report issued by the Treasury  Inspector General in 2015 disclosed instances where Fiscal Service was  unable to produce requested documents concerning its use of financial  agents. In response to the finding, the Inspector General recommended  that Fiscal Service ensure that the selection process for financial agents  is documented and that the documentation is maintained through the life  of the financial agency agreement. Fiscal Service agreed with the  recommendation and noted that it was revising its FASP guidance and  expected to complete the revisions by year-end 2015.

BPO developed a checklist  of 18 of the 19 types of documents listed in the 2015 FASP guidance as  examples of documents to be maintained in the administrative record and  incorporated fields to check to verify whether each document was  provided. In addition, the checklist includes fields to document the  reviewer\u2019s name, date of the administrative record\u2019s review, and  comments on the administrative record.

Treasury officials said that if  a financial agent faced a conflict of interest under its agreement, the  agent would have a duty to disclose and address that conflict. Based on a  recommendation recently made by the Treasury Inspector General, Fiscal  Service amended its model financial agency agreement to include a  provision requiring the financial agent to notify the Inspector General if it  becomes aware of any possible violation of federal criminal law regarding  fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or illegal gratuities affecting services  performed under the financial agency agreement. The financial agency  agreement for myRA includes this provision.", "Once myRA accountholders reach a limit of $15,000 in their account or  the account reaches a maturity of 30 years, they are required to roll over  their account into another retirement savings account. Fiscal Service  officials told us that to address concerns that the financial agent would try  to promote its own products to myRA accountholders, the financial  agency agreement includes additional controls that place limits on the  financial agent\u2019s ability to cross-market its own products to  accountholders so that, for instance, the financial agent would not be able  to steer accountholders to its own products when they are required to roll  over their account."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Richard Tsuhara (Assistant  Director), Heather Chartier (Analyst-in-Charge), William R.
