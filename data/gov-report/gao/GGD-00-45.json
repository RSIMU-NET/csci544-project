This report responds to your request that we review DOJ\u2019s policy and guidance for selecting structured settlement brokers.

The payments may be scheduled for any length of time, even as long as the claimant\u2019s lifetime, and may consist of installment payments and/or future lump sums. Payments can be in fixed amounts, or they can vary. The schedule is structured to meet the financial needs of the claimant.", "For years, structured settlements have been widely used in the tort area to compensate severely injured, often profoundly disabled, tort victims. Cases generally involve medical malpractice and other personal injury. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is the statute by which the United States authorizes tort suits to be brought against itself. With certain exceptions,it makes the United States liable for injuries caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any federal employee acting within the scope of his or her employment, in accordance with the law of the state where the act or omission occurred. Generally, a tort claim against the United States is barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within 2 years after the claim accrues.", "In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended, created a mechanism for compensating persons injured by certain pharmaceutical products.  The act established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) as an alternative to traditional product liability and/or medical malpractice litigation for persons injured by their receipt of one or more of the standard childhood vaccines required for admission to schools and by certain employers.  VICP is \u201cno- fault.\u201d  That is, claimants need not establish that the vaccine was defective, or that any degree of negligence was involved in its administration.  The only liability-related question is causation\u2014did the vaccine cause the injury for which compensation is sought?", "The industry standard of practice requires the use of a licensed broker or insurance agent to obtain a settlement annuity. DOJ\u2019s Civil Divisionestimated that structured settlements constitute between 1 and 2 percent of all settlements in litigated tort cases. Brokers receive no direct compensation from the government; rather, they are compensated by the insurance company from whom the annuity is purchased.  The insurance company typically pays the brokers\u2019 commissions, which amount to 3 or 4 percent of the annuity premium. The government attorney negotiating the case is responsible for selecting the broker.", "Structured settlements for the federal government are negotiated by the Civil Division\u2019s torts attorneys, Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs), or agency attorneys. AUSAs are authorized to settle certain cases. An agency may not settle a tort claim for more than $25,000 without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or her designee, unless the Attorney General has delegated to the head of the agency the authority to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To ascertain DOJ\u2019s policies and guidance for the selection of settlement brokers, we reviewed the Torts Branch handbook, Damages Under the Federal Tort Claim Act (section V: Settlements), and other relevant documents pertaining to broker selection policies.

DOJ identified six agencies\u2014HHS and VA; the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and the U.S. Postal Service. At each of the six agencies, we met with officials who were responsible for negotiating structured settlement claims. We discussed their policies and procedures for selecting structured settlement brokers and asked them what factors they considered during the selection process. In addition, we obtained and reviewed a copy of the Army\u2019s standard operating procedures pertaining to structured settlements.  Also, we asked the six agencies to supply information pertaining to the number of structured settlements since May 1997.", "To provide the list of DOJ\u2019s structured settlement annuities between May 1, 1997, and May 1, 1999, we used data DOJ collected from the Civil Division and the United States Attorneys Offices. The Civil Division\u2019s data came from the Torts Branch, which routinely handles structured settlements. The United States Attorneys\u2019 data were collected by EOUSA and include all the data received by EOUSA as of August 12, 1999.

The Justice Department expressed appreciation that the report \u201coutlines the many steps undertaken by the Department to ensure fairness in the broker selection process.\u201d", "DOJ said its existing policies and guidance to ensure that the selection of brokers is fair are effective.  Therefore, it disagreed with our recommendation that DOJ implement an adequate internal control to ensure that the reasons for selecting a specific structured settlement broker are always fully documented and readily available for examination. DOJ noted that the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government specify that management should design and implement internal controls based on the related costs and benefits.  It stated that it was DOJ\u2019s belief that the costs of implementing the recommendation, in terms of diversion of attention from substantive issues and generation of extra paperwork, would substantially outweigh any benefits.", "We recognize that determining whether to implement a particular internal control involves a judgment about whether the benefits outweigh the costs. We believe that the benefits of implementing our recommendation would outweigh any associated costs and paperwork.  As stated in this report, these benefits are twofold: requiring documentation would help enable DOJ to (1) determine if its policies and guidance on selecting brokers are being followed and (2) protect DOJ from charges of favoritism towards a specific broker or brokers.   Further, noting the reasons for selecting a specific broker in the case file at the time the selection is made would appear to require only minimal paperwork or cost. For example, a concise memo to the file stating the rationale for the selection would suffice.", "DOJ also expressed concern that, although we observed that most structured settlements have been awarded to a relatively small number of companies, we did not mention that many of the selected companies had multiple offices and brokers that competed for the same work.  According to DOJ, by \u201ctreating as a monolith all brokers affiliated with the major companies, the draft report ignores the actual way those businesses are run and runs the risk of significantly understating the actual number of brokers competing to handle DOJ structured settlements.\u201d", "In response, we have noted that according to DOJ, because structured settlement companies may have multiple offices and brokers, the number of companies could be misleading.  Data were not readily available for us to determine the extent to which multiple brokers within a single company competed for the same settlement.  Nevertheless, the number and cost of settlements by brokerage company show that DOJ placed the majority of its settlement work with a relatively small number of companies\u2014a situation that still could open it up to charges of favoritism towards these companies.", "Cognizant officials at HHS, VA, Air Force, Army, Navy, and the Postal Service said they generally agreed with the information presented in the report.
