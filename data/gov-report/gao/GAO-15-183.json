Foreign offices reported that building relationships with foreign counterparts and gathering and assessing information were among their top priorities. As directed by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), foreign offices also inspected foreign food facilities. Under FSMA, FDA is to inspect at least 600 foreign food facilities in 2011 and, for each of the next 5 years, inspect at least twice the number of facilities inspected during the previous year. As shown in the figure below, FDA is not currently keeping pace with the FSMA mandate. FDA officials told GAO that they do not plan to meet the FSMA mandate because of funding, and they question the usefulness of conducting that many inspections. However, FDA has not conducted an analysis to determine whether the number of inspections in the FSMA mandate or the lower number of inspections it is conducting is sufficient to ensure comparable safety of imported and domestic food. Without such an analysis, FDA is not in a position to know what is a sufficient number of foreign inspections and, if appropriate, request a change in the mandate.", "FDA foreign offices cite their contributions to the safety of imported food, but the agency's performance measures do not fully capture these contributions. GAO recommended in 2010 that FDA develop performance measures that can be used to demonstrate the offices' contributions to imported food safety. This recommendation remains valid. FDA has initiated a review to determine how to better reflect the value of the foreign offices in the agency-wide performance systems. Until the offices' contributions are captured, FDA will have less information to effectively measure their progress toward meeting agency goals.", "FDA has taken some steps to address recruitment challenges since GAO last reported, but it still does not have a strategic workforce plan. In 2010, GAO recommended that FDA develop such a plan for the foreign offices to help ensure that it recruits and retains staff with the necessary experience and skills.

For example, melamine- and cyanuric acid-contaminated pet food  imported from China sickened and killed U.S. cats and dogs in 2007 and  raised concerns about the safety of imported human and animal food.  Melamine, an industrial chemical that is not approved for use in food in  the United States, was used by a Chinese manufacturer to mimic  increased protein levels in food ingredients. The U.S. reliance on  imported food as a percentage of all food consumed has grown from  about 9 percent in 2000 to more than 16 percent in 2011. Some food  categories are now more likely to come from foreign sources than  domestic ones. For example, about 91 percent of seafood consumed in  the United States was imported in 2011, according to the National Marine  Fisheries Service. The United States also imported $4.6 billion in fresh  vegetables and $3.1 billion in fresh fruit (excluding bananas) from Mexico  in 2013, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

According to FDA, the mission of the foreign offices is to  engage with stakeholders in strategic areas abroad to help prevent  unsafe products, such as food, drugs, and medical devices, from reaching  U.S. borders and to help FDA make informed decisions about product  entry into the United States. In 2010, we examined the activities of FDA\u2019s  foreign offices and found that they engaged in a variety of activities to  help ensure the safety of imported products, but FDA faced challenges  due to an increasing workload and other factors.

We selected  these locations based on an analysis of the volume of food imports, the  percentage of food imports refused at the border, and the number of food  facility inspections for fiscal year 2013, among other factors. Our review  included site visits to FDA\u2019s locations in Beijing and Guangzhou, China,  and Mexico City, Mexico, to interview key FDA and U.S. embassy  officials, as well as foreign food safety regulatory authorities. We selected  those locations because they conduct food inspections, among other  reasons. We also accompanied foreign office staff on site visits to food  facilities to learn how inspections are conducted in other countries. To  examine the activities FDA\u2019s foreign offices have engaged in since our  2010 report, we evaluated answers the foreign offices submitted to  questions about their activities, conducted structured interviews with  officials from the foreign offices, and compared the numbers of food  inspections completed by FDA investigators with targets mandated in the  FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). To examine the extent of  the foreign offices\u2019 contributions to the safety of imported food, we  analyzed documents describing outcomes of the foreign offices\u2019  activities\u2014including inspection reports and import alerts\u2014and interviewed  officials.

To examine the extent to which FDA has engaged in  workforce planning for its foreign offices, we evaluated staffing numbers,  interviewed officials, and reviewed workforce planning documents. We  also reviewed leading practices for workforce planning that we have  previously identified.

FDA officials told us that, given limited funding, the  agency determined that additional foreign inspections were not the best  use of FSMA-related funds. FDA officials said they were focusing  resources instead on technical assistance to the domestic and foreign  food industry to help manufacturers comply with new FSMA rules, as well  as training for FDA investigators and other agency staff to modernize  FDA\u2019s food inspection program.

Figure 6 shows a timeline of developments, including White  House involvement, related to FDA\u2019s efforts to obtain visas for new staff  in the China Office.", "In an effort to facilitate the granting of visas for new staff, FDA agreed to  close its locations in Guangzhou and Shanghai and consolidate all China  Office staff in Beijing. However, officials in the China Office expressed  concern that they will lose a valuable resource because one of the two  locally employed staff members in Guangzhou will not be able to relocate  to Beijing. The language skills of the locally employed staff are especially  important in China, where the investigators do not typically speak the  local language. OIP officials told us that, in the absence of locally  employed staff available to translate, investigators in China rely on  translators provided by the firms that are being inspected. Consolidating  all China Office staff in Beijing also poses challenges in providing enough  office space within the embassy. OIP officials told us that when adding  investigators to the China Office was first proposed in February 2012,  they knew that they might face space constraints regardless of whether  staff were placed in the China Office\u2019s locations in Shanghai, Guangzhou,  or Beijing. There is not enough space in the U.S. embassy in Beijing to  house additional FDA staff, so FDA will be one of the occupants in a new  annex building that the Department of State is currently constructing. FDA  anticipates moving into that space in October 2015.", "Other factors that have affected the recruitment of staff for the foreign  offices include issues that are directly affected by FDA personnel policies,  such as reintegration of staff who have returned from assignments at a  foreign office location. In the past, FDA handled reintegration on a case- by-case basis. Foreign office officials told us that not having a  reintegration policy for staff members who have completed foreign  assignments had hampered their ability to recruit staff to work in the  foreign offices. Foreign office officials said U.S.-based ORA investigators  have been hesitant to transfer to foreign offices because they were  concerned about whether they would be able to return to their previous  geographic location once they completed their posting abroad. They have  also been concerned about whether FDA would value the experiences  they gained while abroad. To address the uncertainty surrounding  reintegration, FDA adopted a set of standard operating procedures, which  were finalized in November 2014. OIP officials said they, in conjunction  with the Office of Human Resources, have been engaging in outreach  efforts to help managers understand the reintegration process.", "Foreign office officials told us that lengthy hiring processes also have  affected FDA\u2019s ability to staff its foreign offices. According to information  published by the Office of Management and Budget, in 2009 it took  federal agencies an average of 122 days to fill an open position.  According to the most recent data available, that time dropped to an  average of 93 days for fiscal year 2011 and 87 days for fiscal year 2012.  For FDA, during fiscal years 2013 and 2014, it took an average of 121  days to fill staff positions in the Asia-Pacific Office, 140 days in the China  Office, 172 days in the Europe Office, 200 days in the India Office, and  104 days in the Latin America Office. FDA has recently implemented an  agency-wide initiative known as FDA\u2019s Accelerated Staffing Track to  reduce the time it takes to hire a candidate to 80 calendar days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Taken Some Steps to Address Workforce Challenges in Its Foreign Offices", "paragraphs": ["OIP has undertaken initiatives to help recruit and develop staff. According  to OIP officials, one successful initiative was to implement temporary duty  assignments of investigators for 60, 90, or 120 days to meet immediate  resource needs of the foreign offices. Officials in the foreign offices told  us that the investigators assigned on temporary duty were a staffing  resource that helped the offices conduct inspections. Temporary duty  assignments also served as an important recruiting tool since  investigators returning from a temporary overseas assignment can  provide a firsthand account of their foreign office experiences to their U.S.  colleagues. In addition, OIP officials told us that they were able to use  information from a draft workforce gap analysis to implement some  learning and development initiatives to help ensure that the foreign office  staff had the necessary skills to perform their job duties. OIP identified  \u201cdiplomacy\u201d and \u201cglobal awareness\u201d as training topics for foreign office  staff. OIP also sought to strengthen staff members\u2019 foreign language skills  by offering language training.", "However, OIP does not have a formalized staffing mechanism through  which it can decide on strategic resource allocations based on a targeted  analysis of the specific staffing needs of its various foreign offices. Such a  staffing mechanism would be included in a strategic workforce plan.  Currently, the foreign offices provide input into staffing decisions through  office-level staffing proposals, but some of the needs identified in their  proposals have not been met. For example, officials from one foreign  office expressed a need to have a staff member located in headquarters  to represent them in real time during face-to-face discussions of policy  matters. That office also identified a need for additional information  technology support because of the challenges created by operating in a  time zone when headquarters staff are not typically working and the  security requirements for accessing FDA computer systems in an  embassy setting.", "OIP officials told us that they are developing a strategic workforce plan  that requires an FDA-wide perspective and approach that recognizes the  broad role of FDA\u2019s centers and ORA in its international activities. To that  end, OIP has developed a strategic workforce planning framework, and  officials told us that, over the next year, they will develop the first phase of  a forward-looking strategic workforce plan for the foreign offices.  However, OIP has yet to define what the workforce plan will entail, and  there are no time frames for completion. Strategic workforce planning is  an essential tool to help agencies align their workforces with their current  and emerging missions and develop long-term strategies for acquiring,  developing, and retaining staff. In our 2010 report on FDA\u2019s foreign  offices, we recommended that FDA develop a strategic workforce plan for  the foreign offices to help ensure that the agency is able to recruit and  retain staff with the necessary experience and skills. We continue to  believe that completing a strategic workforce plan for the foreign offices is  critical to FDA\u2019s ability to address staffing challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FDA established foreign offices to help prevent unsafe products from  entering the United States. Through their activities, FDA\u2019s foreign offices  have helped the agency to increase the total number of foreign food  inspections conducted annually.

FDA is planning to conduct  1,200 foreign food inspections through the end of the mandate\u2014well  below either scenario that might satisfy the FSMA mandate to increase  inspections each year through 2016. FDA officials cited limited resources  as the primary reason they are not conducting more foreign food  inspections. FDA officials also questioned the usefulness of conducting  the number of inspections mandated by FSMA. However, FDA has not  conducted an analysis to determine whether the number of inspections  mandated by FSMA or the number of inspections it is now conducting is  sufficient to ensure comparable safety of imported and domestic food.  Without such an analysis, FDA is not in a position to know what is a  sufficient number of foreign inspections and, if appropriate, request a  change in the mandate regarding the number of foreign inspections to be  conducted.", "In addition, in 2010, we recommended that FDA develop performance  goals and measures that can be used to demonstrate the foreign offices\u2019  contributions to long-term outcomes related to improving the safety of  imported food products. According to FDA officials, the agency has  initiated a review to determine how to better reflect the value of the  foreign offices in the agency-wide performance system. However, FDA  has not yet implemented new performance measures or determined when  its review would be completed. We continue to believe that performance  measures that demonstrate the foreign offices\u2019 contributions to long-term  outcomes for the safety of imported food are important to provide  information to help the agency track progress toward meeting its goals  and to provide managers with crucial information on which to base  funding decisions. We also recommended that FDA develop a strategic  workforce plan for the foreign offices to help ensure that the agency is  able to recruit and retain staff with the necessary experience and skills.  FDA has taken some steps to address recruitment challenges, but the  agency has not yet completed a strategic workforce plan. We continue to  believe that a strategic workforce plan for the foreign offices is critical to  FDA\u2019s ability to address staffing challenges, especially given the number  of vacancies abroad. There are other challenges affecting the foreign  offices, such as problems obtaining visas for the China Office staff.

FDA said that foreign  inspections are an important part of FSMA, providing accountability for  inspected foreign firms, incentives for them to comply with U.S. import  requirements, and intelligence about foreign food safety practices. FDA  added that foreign inspections will not, in themselves, ensure comparable  safety of imported and domestic food, and the agency is expanding its  collaborations with foreign governments to assist in ensuring the safety of  imported food. As noted in its comments, FDA is optimistic that additional  visas will be approved to expand its presence in China, which would help  reduce the number of vacant staff positions that we cite in this report.

For the purposes of this report, imported  food refers to food for human or animal consumption, unless otherwise  specified.", "To examine the activities of FDA\u2019s foreign offices, we reviewed and  analyzed documents including FDA reports to Congress that were  mandated by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) that  describe the activities of all foreign offices, evaluated written answers to  questions about their activities since the 2010 report, and conducted  structured interviews with FDA officials in the foreign offices, and  analyzed counts of foreign food facility inspections for each year of the  FSMA mandate. We questioned all FDA offices that reported conducting  food safety activities at the time of our review. The Sub-Saharan Africa  post was vacant and, therefore, was not included in the structured  interview. Based on conversations with officials from the China Office and  Latin America Office, the Chile post and Shanghai post were not included  in the structured interview because the posts did not focus on food. As  part of our questions, we asked the officials to identify their three top  priority activities. In addition, we analyzed food inspections conducted by  the foreign offices compared with targets mandated in FSMA between  2011 and 2016. We cross-checked FDA\u2019s foreign inspection numbers, as  provided by the Office of Regulatory Affairs through its FACTS database,  with information in FDA reports to Congress and additional information  obtained during our site visits to locations in Beijing and Guangzhou,  China, and Mexico City, Mexico. We selected those offices, in part,  because they conducted food inspections. Through this examination of  the data and interviews with FDA officials who were knowledgeable about  foreign food inspections, we determined that the inspection counts  provided by the agency were sufficiently reliable for use in our review.", "To examine how FDA foreign offices have contributed to imported food  safety, we reviewed and analyzed documents and data that described the  outcomes of the foreign offices\u2019 activities, including inspection reports and  import alerts. We conducted structured interviews with FDA officials from  the foreign offices, including the Asia-Pacific Office, China Office, Europe  Office, India Office, and Latin America Office to determine the outcomes  of the foreign offices\u2019 activities. We also discussed the outcomes of the  foreign offices with FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  and Center for Veterinary Medicine. We analyzed performance planning  and management planning documentation to determine the extent that  FDA had performance measures that were outcome oriented and  captured the activities of the foreign offices, based on leading practices  that we have previously identified. We interviewed FDA officials in the  Office of International Programs (OIP) and the Office of Strategic  Planning and Analytics to understand how FDA is measuring the  performance of the foreign offices.

We selected  these locations based on an analysis of the volume of food imports, the  percentage of food imports refused at the border, and the number of food  facility inspections for fiscal year 2013. We also considered the number of  active import alerts (i.e., warnings about particular products,  manufacturers, and countries based on FDA experience or information  that triggers a more intensive inspection at the U.S. border). We visited  FDA\u2019s offices in Beijing and Guangzhou, China, and Mexico City, Mexico.
