Each DHS component is responsible for administering, managing, and reviewing their respective programs to ensure that, consistent with law and policy, rates charged to users of program services are set to collect amounts sufficient to recover program costs and ensure efficient operations, but not in excess of operational needs.", "GAO was asked to review DHS's management and oversight of these programs. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS components receive fees and other collections to recover program costs and manage any differences, as appropriate; (2) DHS components have processes in place to manage unobligated balances; and (3) DHS ensures components review their programs and monitors component action to address any management and operational deficiencies.", "GAO analyzed DHS financial information for 38 programs receiving fees and other collections in fiscal year 2014, examined DHS fee reviews and study results, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received $15 billion in fees and other collections across 38 programs in fiscal year 2014 that help fund homeland security functions, such as the screening and inspection of persons and goods entering the United States. Our analysis of DHS collections and cost data showed that 14 of the 38 programs receiving fees and other collections in fiscal year 2014 collected amounts that fully covered identified program costs. Of the remaining 24 programs, collections for 20 programs partially covered identified program costs, and DHS did not provide cost data, or we determined such data may not be reliable, for 4 programs. DHS components have taken action to address the estimated $6 billion difference between collections and identified program costs, with 6 programs comprising about 85 percent of the difference. However, components did not document processes for managing differences and making decisions on how to address the estimated $726 million difference across the 10 remaining programs. Such documentation of processes and decisions could help improve transparency and accountability over cost recovery efforts.", "DHS components have processes in place to manage unobligated balances carried over across fiscal years for 25 programs, with such balances totaling $2.6 billion at fiscal year-end 2014. These processes generally focused on ensuring continuity of program operations rather than efficiently using funds. For example, while components established targets for minimum balances for 21 of these 25 programs, none of the components established processes and related maximum targets to manage excessive unobligated carryover balances. Establishing such management processes and targets for minimum and maximum balances would enable components to show that management actions will be sufficient and appropriate to ensure the efficient use of funds\u2014such as the Immigration Examinations Fee Account, which had an approximately $983 million unobligated balance as of fiscal year end 2014, and the User Fee Facility program account for small airports which has an unobligated balance of $14 million that has exceeded 100 percent of total operating costs each year from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014.", "DHS does not ensure that all components review their programs or monitor component actions to address management and operational deficiencies identified in those reviews. GAO found that three of the seven DHS components that have fee or other collection programs did not conduct such reviews for 6 of their programs, and that components had not taken recommended actions to address 9 of 20 deficiencies identified through program reviews as of fiscal year-end 2014. Further, DHS did not report the extent to which components are conducting such reviews or any proposals to address identified management and operational deficiencies. DHS oversight to ensure that components complete these reviews and report the results for all programs would enable Congress and others to receive information necessary to better ensure that fee and other collection programs are operating effectively and efficiently."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS ensure components document processes for managing differences in collections and costs, establish balance targets, and conduct program reviews and address identified deficiencies. DHS concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received  fees and other collections totaling approximately $15 billion that  contributed to its approximately $60 billion in budget authority available to  execute its mission-critical activities related to preventing terrorism,  securing the nation\u2019s borders, and enforcing and administering  immigration laws, among other things. DHS\u2019s reliance on resources  derived from fees and other collections highlights the need for DHS to  ensure it has processes in place to comprehensively manage and  oversee its portfolio of 38 programs that derive some or all resources  from these sources.", "Within DHS, each component is responsible for administering, managing,  and reviewing its portfolio of programs. The Office of the Chief Financial  Officer (OCFO) is responsible for the fiscal management, integrity, and  accountability of the department and, among other things, provides  guidance and oversight for the department\u2019s resource management  systems to ensure that funds necessary to carry out its missions are  obtained, allocated, and expended in accordance with departmental  priorities and relevant laws and policies. As such, the OCFO is  responsible for ensuring that the DHS components administering  programs receiving fees and other collections do so in a manner  consistent with applicable statutory authorities and federal guidance. This  includes providing components with guidance for maintaining appropriate  levels of unobligated balances to ensure programs are resilient to  revenue instability and surges in program activity, and do not overcharge  program users beyond the costs of services provided. Such guidance is  intended to help ensure that balances do not fall so low as to impair the  efficient management of operations or rise too high so as to suggest fee  collections do not align with operational needs. In addition, DHS OCFO  has responsibility for ensuring components provide decision makers and  stakeholders with timely and accurate financial information in order to  inform the budget formulation and regulatory processes.", "We have previously reported on DHS\u2019s management and oversight of its  overall resources, as well as management and oversight of resources  derived from specific fees and other collections. For example, DHS  management remains on our high-risk list. We have found that while  DHS\u2019s efforts to strengthen and integrate its management functions have  resulted in it meeting or partially meeting five of GAO\u2019s criteria for removal  from the high-risk list, DHS continues to face challenges in ensuring  strong management practices and effective oversight in meeting its  mission needs, and concluded that progress was needed to mitigate the  risks that management weaknesses posed to mission accomplishment  and the efficient and effective use of the department\u2019s resources. In  regard to management for programs receiving fees or other collections,  we have previously found that changes to the management of collections  can affect the efficiency, equity, and revenue adequacy of, and reduce  administrative burden on, programs. Specifically, we reported in May  2011, that the National Protection and Programs Directorate\u2019s (NPPD)  Federal Protective Service (FPS)\u2014an agency funded primarily by  reimbursable agreements with federal customer agencies for services\u2014 did not review its rates to develop an informed, deliberate design, and  that although expenses incurred through the protection of federal facilities  vary, FPS did not know the extent to which some facilities subsidized  others. Additionally, in March 2013 we found that, among other things,  U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) share of fee collections from  the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program (AQI) did not properly  align with its costs of conducting AQI inspection activities, and  recommended that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in consultation  with CBP, ensure that fee collections are allocated consistent with each  agency\u2019s program costs. Some recommendations addressing the  management challenges we identified have been addressed.  Understanding DHS components\u2019 processes for aligning collections with  identified program costs, estimating and managing unobligated balances  carried over from one fiscal year to another, and DHS OCFO\u2019s process  for overseeing its portfolio of programs receiving fees and other  collections provides valuable insights into how effectively the department  anticipates program needs and ensures the efficient use of its resources  derived from fees and other collections.", "You asked us to review the approach DHS uses to manage and oversee  its portfolio of programs receiving fees and other collections to ensure  management and operational challenges are identified and resolved. This  report addresses the extent to which: (1) fees and other collections cover  program costs and DHS components have taken appropriate actions to  manage any differences between program costs and collections; (2) DHS  components have processes in place to manage unobligated carryover  balances, and have taken appropriate actions to ensure the efficient use  of such unobligated carryover balance; and (3) DHS OCFO ensures  components review programs receiving fees and other collections and  monitors component actions to address identified management and  operational deficiencies.", "In conducting our work, we identified 38 programs receiving fees and  other collections by interviewing DHS OCFO officials and by reviewing  relevant budget documents for fiscal year 2014\u2014the most recent fiscal  year with complete data at the time we started our review\u2014and DHS  studies and reviews of programs receiving fees and other collections.  We obtained financial information from seven components administering  these 38 programs\u2014including collections, unobligated carryover  balances, and program costs identified for each program from  components\u2019 respective financial accounting systems. To assess the  reliability of these data, we (1) conducted interviews with agency officials  responsible for producing the data; (2) reviewed the extent to which  components have procedures and controls for ensuring that the data  maintained in their financial systems are consistent and accurate; (3)  examined the data for obvious errors and inconsistencies; (4) compared  the data with DHS\u2019s Congressional Budget Justification for fiscal year  2015; and (5) reviewed related GAO reports, DHS biennial fee reviews,  related DHS Inspector General reports, and independent public  accounting firm reports related to these data. In addition, for program  costs identified by the components, we reviewed documentation\u2014such  as past GAO reports and biennial reviews\u2014describing how program  costs are identified, and interviewed knowledgeable component officials  about the limitations of these data. We identified limitations to the cost  data provided by components such as the inability to accurately estimate  and report direct and indirect cost, and note these limitations in the body  of our report. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report to convey the general magnitude of collections,  identified program costs, and unobligated carryover balances.", "To determine the extent that program collections recovered identified  costs, and DHS components haven taken appropriate actions to manage  any differences, we first compared amounts DHS collected in fiscal year  2014 to identified program costs for each of the 38 programs. We then  compared our analysis of these differences across programs to those  programs for which DHS and its components had identified a need to  increase cost recovery as documented in DHS biennial fee review  reports, annual agency budget submissions, proposals for legislative or  regulatory change, and discussion with DHS OCFO and component  officials. In addition, we reviewed and assessed available DHS  component documentation of processes and analysis guiding the  rationale for decisions and actions taken to address differences between  collections and program costs, compared to tenets of the DHS Fiscal  years 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, project management guidance, and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which provides  guidance to agencies to achieve their mission goals and improve  transparency and accountability. We also interviewed relevant DHS  officials regarding the impacts of differences between collections and  program costs and actions taken to pursue increases in cost recovery for  certain fee and collection programs.", "To determine the extent to which DHS components have processes in  place to manage unobligated carryover balances and ensure efficient use  of these funds, we first analyzed the size and composition of any  unobligated balances DHS components carried over from the end of fiscal  year 2014 to the beginning of fiscal year 2015 for each of the 38  programs. We then discussed with DHS component officials the extent  that they had processes in place to manage unobligated carryover  balances, to include targets for minimum unobligated carryover balances  necessary to ensure continuity of operations and targets for maximum  balances to ensure efficient use of resources. To determine the extent  components had managed their programs to targets for minimum  balances, we compared the amount of unobligated carryover balance  from the end of fiscal year 2013 and the amount obligated in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2014 for each program as described in DHS\u2019s  Contingency Plan. Further, as components had not identified maximum  unobligated carryover balance targets for programs, we compared  unobligated carryover balances as of the end of fiscal year 2013 to  identified program costs for fiscal year 2014 and conducted interviews  with DHS component officials to determine the extent carryover balances  may or may not be excessive to operational needs of each program. We  compared component management of unobligated carryover balances  with criteria identified in our past work on evaluating carryover balances  and managing revenue instability (e.g., annual fluctuations in fee  collections).", "To determine the extent that DHS OCFO ensures components review  programs and monitors action to address identified management and  operational deficiencies, we analyzed the extent that DHS components  reviewed programs receiving fees and other collections on a biennial  basis and made recommendations to address any identified deficiencies  consistent with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) and  implementing guidance in Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Circular A-25. To determine the extent the DHS OCFO reports, as  appropriate, on the results of components\u2019 biennial fee reviews and  resulting proposals, we also reviewed DHS OCFO\u2019s Agency Financial  Report for Fiscal Year 2014 and DHS quarterly reports for programs  receiving fees and other collections. We interviewed DHS OCFO and  relevant component officials regarding the extent DHS components  comply with biennial reporting requirements for each of the 38 programs  receiving fees and other collections, identify any management and  operational deficiencies, and track the implementation status of  recommended actions consistent with Standards for Internal Controls in  the Federal Government. We also interviewed OMB staff to obtain the  agency\u2019s perspective on the extent DHS is compliant with biennial  reporting requirements and takes actions consistent with relevant OMB  policies and guidance. We also reviewed documentation relating to  results of DHS studies of programs receiving fees and other collections  including DHS\u2019s 2012 Fee Structure Review and 2014-2015 User Fee  Winter Study (Winter Study) to determine the extent management  challenges were identified and actions were taken to address these  challenges. In addition, we interviewed DHS OCFO officials regarding the  actions DHS has taken to address management challenges identified as  part of department-wide fee portfolio reviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

An  agency\u2019s authority to charge fees or establish other collections is derived  either from the general statutory authority to assess user charges  pursuant to the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or  from a statutory provision authorizing or directing an agency to establish a  particular fee or other collection. IOAA provides that, in general, each  service or thing of value provided by an agency to a person is to be self- sustaining to the extent possible, and provides the head of each agency  with authority to prescribe regulations to establish the charge for a service  or thing of value provided by the agency. Fees assessed under IOAA  must be (1) fair and (2) based on costs to the government, the value of  the service or thing to the recipient, public policy or interest serviced, and  other relevant facts. Without additional statutory authority to retain fee  collections, however, such collections are deposited as miscellaneous  receipts in the U.S. Treasury and are not available to the agency  collecting the fees. OMB Circular A-25 establishes federal policy  regarding fees assessed in accordance with IOAA and provides guidance  for agency implementation of charges and disposition of such  collections. More specifically, agencies must apply the provisions of  OMB Circular A-25 to fees assessed pursuant to IOAA. For fees  assessed pursuant to another statutory authority, OMB Circular A-25  provides guidance to agencies that is intended to be applied only to the  extent permitted by law and to the extent it is not inconsistent with a  controlling statute. In many instances, agencies receive specific  authority through authorizing or appropriations legislation to collect fees  and retain and obligate the collections. Such legislation may establish a  specified rate or amount to be assessed, how the fee is to be calculated,  the method and timing of collection, the authorized purposes for which fee  collections may be used, and the degree of flexibility an agency has to set  and revise fee rates through the regulatory process. Regardless of  whether a fee program is established under the authority of IOAA or some  other statute, we have reported on the benefits agencies could realize by  applying the principles of OMB Circular A-25 to their programs receiving  fees and other collections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Congress\u2014through the authorization and appropriations processes\u2014 oversees DHS funding typically at the account level and may, through  enacted legislation, specify the purpose for which appropriated funds may  be used, restrict the amount or purpose for which the funds can be used,  and require that an agency report on activities conducted at the account  or program level. For each program receiving fees or other collections,  DHS or its components must be provided with authority to (1) conduct the  activity for which the fee or other collection is authorized, (2) collect the  fee or other collection at authorized levels, and (3) obligate and expend  the funds collected. Furthermore, the degree of flexibility a DHS  component has with respect to managing its programs receiving fees and  other collections depends upon the statutory authority upon which the fee  or other collection is based. For example, in cases where a statute  prescribes a specific amount the agency is to charge, component officials  may lack the flexibility to adjust the amount charged through the  regulatory process and instead must submit a legislative proposal seeking  statutory changes if it is determined that circumstances warrant an  adjustment.", "DHS OCFO has responsibility to oversee the department\u2019s budget  formulation process in order to ensure, among other things, that DHS  resources from fees and other collections are used and managed in  accordance with applicable laws and policies. To this end, DHS OCFO is  to ensure components comply with the biennial reporting requirements  and other applicable provisions of the CFO Act and OMB Circular A-25.  For example, the CFO Act provides that, among other things, an agency\u2019s  CFO is to review the fees, royalties, rents, and other charges imposed by  the agency for services and things of value it provides on a biennial basis,  and make recommendations on revising those charges to reflect costs  incurred by the agency. In addition, DHS OCFO periodically conducts  department-wide reviews of its portfolio of programs receiving fees and  other collections to identify ways to minimize the effects of increasing  fiscal constraints on DHS\u2019s mission and reduce reliance on annual  appropriations. DHS OCFO has completed two such reviews. In fiscal  year 2012, DHS OCFO conducted a Fee Structure Review that  considered whether opportunities existed to increase flexibility in the  discretionary budget in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 from both existing  programs receiving fees and other collections and prospective new fees.  The study focused on the amount of costs recovered by programs from  collections for activities that are funded jointly by collections and annual  appropriations for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. In March 2015, DHS  completed the 2014-2015 User Fee Winter Study (Winter Study).  According to DHS OCFO officials, this study was initiated as part of the  DHS Secretary\u2019s \u201cUnity of Effort\u201d initiative, and the results of the Winter  Study were expected to inform DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget formulation  process and educate internal DHS stakeholders on DHS\u2019s portfolio of  programs receiving fees and other collections. According to the Winter  Study Terms of Reference, the purpose of the Winter Study was to  provide DHS with an opportunity to consider broadly the use of user fees  and similar financing alternatives\u2014such as fines and trust funds\u2014across  DHS to examine how the use of these fees and other collections further  key policy objectives and whether there is a need for greater cohesion in  the management, budgeting, and oversight of user fees. Specifically, the  goals of the study were to consider how to (1) best leverage resources  from its fees and other collections across DHS; (2) examine how the use  of fees and other collections further key policy objectives; and (3)  strengthen management, budgeting, and oversight of user fees and other  collections. According to DHS officials, to achieve these goals,  representatives from each DHS component met on an ad hoc basis as  part of the Winter Study working group. More specifically, the Winter  Study sought to identify the current amounts of user fees and other  collections and respective legal authorities, the intended degree of cost  recovery, the history of previous requests for fee adjustments, and best  practices among components. Findings and recommendations from the  Fee Structure Review and Winter Study are discussed later in this report.", "DHS components have responsibility for the collection and obligation of  fees and other collections in accordance with applicable laws and  policies. CBP and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  collected more than half of the approximately $15 billion DHS received  from fees and other collections in fiscal year 2014, as shown in figure 1,  with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services (USCIS), and NPPD programs also collecting in  excess of a billion dollars.

For the 14 programs with full cost  recovery, collections exceeded identified program costs by approximately  $1.4 billion, and DHS did not rely on annual appropriations to cover any  program costs. The $1.4 billion in collections that exceeded program  costs was maintained in several ways, such as unobligated carryover  balances, maintained in reserve funds, or deposited to the Treasury in  accordance with applicable laws. For the 20 programs that had identified  program costs exceeding collections in fiscal year 2014, costs exceeded  collections by an estimated $6 billion. (See app. II.) A fee or collection  may be assessed at a rate that either partially or fully recovers costs from  the user, or it may be assessed according to some other basis, such as  market value of the benefit provided. If a fee or collection is set at a rate  that does not achieve full-cost recovery, the difference is generally funded  through amounts received in an agency\u2019s annual appropriations acts.  According to component documentation, annual appropriations covered  about 97 percent of the estimated $6 billion difference, unobligated  carryover balances covered about 3 percent of the estimated difference,  and transfers of collections from one fee program to another fee program  covered less than 1 percent of the estimated difference in fiscal year  2014.", "For the 4 remaining programs, either DHS component officials cited  reasons they could not provide cost data or we determined such data  may not be reliable. For example, a CBP official stated that CBP\u2019s activity  based costing model does not capture costs for the Harbor Maintenance  Fee, which is administered by another agency, and the Merchandise  Processing Fee, from which CBP deposits collections in the general fund  to offset CBP\u2019s salaries and expenses appropriation. In addition, CBP  does not collect cost or volume data at the level of detail needed to fully  identify the costs associated with the 78 specific fees included under the  Miscellaneous Fees Collections account that collectively constitute less  than 1 percent of CBP\u2019s total collections as reported in its biennial review.  For the fourth remaining program\u2014TSA\u2019s Aviation Security Infrastructure  Fee (Air Carrier Fee)\u2014TSA reported that the statutes governing the Air  Carrier Fee and the Passenger Civil Aviation Security Service Fee specify  that collections from these programs be used to offset the authorized  costs of providing civil aviation security services and, hence, TSA only  tracks the costs of these programs in aggregate.", "Of the 20 programs with costs exceeding collections, DHS (or the U.S.  Department of Agriculture for one program) initiated actions intended to  increase cost recovery for 6 fee programs, comprising about 85 percent  of the estimated $6 billion difference in fiscal year 2014. One of the  programs\u2014TSA\u2019s Passenger Civil Aviation Security Service Fee\u2014 accounted for nearly 76 percent of the difference. Most recently, DHS  submitted legislative proposals with its fiscal year 2017 budget  submission to increase fees for three programs that support the provision  of civil aviation security services (the Passenger Civil Aviation Security  Service Fee), customs-related inspections (the Consolidated Omnibus  Budget and Reconciliation Act  Fee), and inspection and  detention services at air and sea ports of entry (the Immigration  Inspection User Fee ). DHS reported that the proposals to increase  collections for these programs would accomplish such things as reduce  reliance on annual appropriations, fund additional CBP officers, and  contribute to deficit reduction as a portion of collections would go directly  to the general fund of the Treasury. Additionally, DHS pursued regulatory  adjustments to one program that provides for the registration of  commercial vessels (Coast Guard\u2019s Commercial Vessel Documentation  Fee) and the Department of Agriculture amended the regulation for one  program through which CBP conducts inspectional activities for  international arrival of passengers, conveyances, animals, plants, and  agricultural goods at port of entry (AQI Fee). In addition, at DHS\u2019s  request, OMB authorized a rate adjustment for one program that provides  law enforcement services on federally controlled property (FPS\u2019s Basic  Security and Oversight Fees).

Specifically,  TSA has plans to amend regulations to increase fees for two fee  programs\u2014the Security Threat Assessments for Hazmat Drivers, and the  Commercial Aviation and Airport Fee and Other Security Threat  Assessment Fee\u2014as it seeks to harmonize the entire set of TSA\u2019s vetting  and credentialing fees, which includes seven different programs, by fiscal  year 2018, according to TSA officials and documentation. In addition, ICE  officials told us they plan to submit a legislative proposal to increase  spending authority to cover program costs for the Student and Exchange  Visitor Program (SEVP) in fiscal year 2017. According to ICE  documentation, the proposed increase is necessary to fund the costs of  future mission requirements and to invest in modernization initiatives for  the program, among other things.

For the remaining 4 programs, component officials  said that they did not document reasons for not addressing the  differences because they did not consider it required or necessary.  Reasons cited for not documenting the processes for managing and  making decisions on how to address the estimated $726 million difference  included that some fees and other collections are set in statute and not  intended to cover full program cost and that some fees and other  collections had other funds available to cover the difference between  identified program costs and collections in fiscal year 2014 (see table 2).", "While we were able to determine\u2014through a review of data, DHS fee  studies, biennial fee reviews, and through interviews\u2014why components  decided not to take actions to address differences in collections and  program costs for these 10 programs, components have not documented  the processes, analyses, and resulting decisions in a way that would  enable systematic oversight of these decisions or inform management in  their decision making. For example, CBP officials stated that the  component has an informal decision-making process, with a goal to  prioritize action to increase cost recovery for the three fee programs with  the highest volume of fee collections across its portfolio of fees and other  collections (AQI, COBRA fees, and IUF). However, CBP has not  documented its decision-making process, making it difficult for  stakeholders to determine why action was initiated for some fee and  collection programs and not others such as the Land Border Inspection  Fee, which is a fee that while small relative to the rest of CBP\u2019s fee  program portfolio, comprised nearly 10 percent\u2014or $645 million\u2014of the  difference in identified program costs over collections for the overall DHS  fee program portfolio in fiscal year 2014.", "DHS has emphasized the importance of documenting processes and  analysis to inform decision makers and achieve agency goals in the DHS  Fiscal years 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.

In addition, federal programs are subject to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government which states  that agencies should ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs during the  course of normal operations to help evaluate program effectiveness.

In addition, Coast Guard officials stated that its biennial fee  reviews of the Commercial Vessel Documentation Fee program\u2014a  relatively small fee program collecting fees averaging about $2 million  annually from fiscal years 2010 through 2014\u2014are important because the  Coast Guard is generally authorized to maintain funds for obligation only  during the fiscal year in which they become available (1-year authority)  and thus cannot carryover unobligated balances into subsequent fiscal  years. As such, biennial fee reviews help the Coast Guard to ensure fee  collections are sufficient to cover program costs, and provide information  to relevant stakeholders about the need to adjust fee rates.", "Furthermore, we have previously concluded that a regular process of  reviewing fee programs could reveal and help address challenges  identified by agencies in a more timely and systematic manner. For  example, FEMA reported that the Radiological Emergency Preparedness  Program, a program for which FEMA does not conduct biennial fee  reviews because it does not consider the program to be a traditional user  fee, faced challenges accurately estimating costs, resulting in FEMA  refunding nearly $14 million to Radiological Emergency Preparedness  Program users from fiscal year 2013 through 2015.
