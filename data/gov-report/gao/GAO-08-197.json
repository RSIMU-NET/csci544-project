GAO's work over the years has shown that building ownership often costs less than operating leases, especially for long-term space needs. GAO was asked to identify (1) the profile of domestically held, federally leased space including the overall amount and type of space agencies lease, and any related trends; (2) the factors that drive agencies to lease space that may be more cost-effective to own; and (3) any actions taken by the administration and alternative approaches proposed to address this issue. GAO reviewed fiscal year 2006 Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) leasing data and relevant documents and interviewed officials from the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). GAO also reviewed 10 building leases that were among those with the largest dollar value in 3 locations GAO visited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies rely extensively on leasing, occupying about 398 million square feet of leased building space domestically in fiscal year 2006, according to FRPP data. GSA, USPS, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture lease about 71 percent of this space, mostly for offices, with the military services leasing another 17 percent. GSA is increasing its use of leased space and predicts that in 2008 it will, for the first time, lease more space than it owns. In the 10 GSA and USPS leases GAO examined, decisions to lease space that would be more cost-effective to own were driven by the limited availability of capital for building ownership and other considerations, such as operational efficiency and security. For example, for four of the seven GSA leases GAO analyzed, leasing was more costly over time than construction--by an estimated $83.3 million over 30 years. Although ownership through construction is often the least expensive option, federal budget scorekeeping rules require the full cost of this option to be recorded up-front in the budget, whereas only the annual lease payment plus cancellation costs need to be recorded for operating leases, making them \"look cheaper\" in any year even though they generally are more costly over time. USPS is not subject to the scorekeeping rules and cited operational efficiency and limited capital as its main reasons for leasing. While the administration has made progress in addressing long-standing real property problems, efforts to address the leasing challenge have been limited. GAO has raised this issue for almost 20 years. Several alternative approaches have been discussed by various stakeholders, including scoring operating leases the same as ownership, but none have been implemented. The current real property reform initiative, however, presents an opportunity to address the leasing challenge."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2003, we designated federal real property as a high-risk area,  citing the government\u2019s overreliance on costly leasing as one of the major  reasons for our designation. Other reasons for the designation included  unreliable data, excess and deteriorating property, and challenges  associated with protecting assets against the threat of terrorism. Under  certain conditions, such as fulfilling short-term space needs, leasing may  be a lower-cost option than ownership. However, our work over the years  has shown that building ownership often costs less than operating leases,  especially for long-term space needs. For example, in 1995, we found that  55 of 73 operating leases that the General Services Administration (GSA)  had entered into cost a total of $700 million more than construction. In  1999, we reported that for eight of nine major operating lease acquisitions  GSA had proposed, construction would have cost less than leasing and  saved the government $126 million over 30 years.", "In February of 2004, the President signed Executive Order 13327, which  created the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC). Real property  management also was added to the President\u2019s Management Agenda to  address the problems we had raised in our high-risk report. The order  required executive branch agencies to standardize real property data for  inclusion in a governmentwide database of owned and leased space,  known as the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP). FRPP is maintained  by GSA on behalf of FRPC, which controls access to the data. Shortly after  signing the executive order, the President added the Federal Asset  Management Initiative, commonly referred to as the real property  initiative, to the President\u2019s Management Agenda. Under the executive  order, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was given the  responsibility to, among other things, review the efforts of agencies in  achieving the governmentwide policies established in the executive order.  In our April 2007 update on real property high-risk issues, we concluded  that these efforts provided a good foundation for strategically managing  federal real property, but that more progress was needed for us to remove  real property management from our high-risk list.", "You requested that we evaluate federal leasing trends and challenges. To  do so, we addressed the following questions:  1.  What is the profile of domestically held, federally leased space,  including the overall amount and type of space agencies lease, and  what are any related trends?  2.  What factors drive agencies to lease space that may be more cost- effective to own?  3.  What actions has the administration taken, and what alternative  approaches have been proposed, to address agencies\u2019 reliance on  costly leased space?", "To answer the first question, we used publicly available data from FRPP,  as well as additional data analyses we requested from OMB. These  additional analyses used data from the three civilian real-property-holding  agencies with the largest portfolios of leased building space held within  the United States and U.S. territories\u2014GSA, the U.S. Postal Service  (USPS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Agriculture)\u2014to develop  a more detailed analysis and assessment of FRPP data. We used data from  GSA\u2019s Public Building Service to examine trends in leasing because GSA  had historical data and GSA\u2019s tenants represent a cross-section of federal  agencies. These data are different from those of FRPP. FRPP data are  governmentwide, while Public Building Service data are more detailed and  are only for properties that GSA controls. The FRPP data were generally  reliable for describing the inventory, but data quality concerns, such as  missing data, which we identified both during this review and previously,  would limit the usefulness of FRPP for other purposes, such as strategic  decision making. OMB is taking action to address these data quality  concerns. USPS and Agriculture could not provide us with an electronic  copy of historical data on their leases; therefore, we could not include  information from these agencies in our analysis of trends. We determined  that the FRPP and GSA Public Building Service data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our review by reviewing GSA\u2019s data systems  and other reports. In addition, we defined \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201cdomestically  held\u201d leased space as being in the United States and U.S. territories.", "To answer the second question, we analyzed seven GSA and three USPS  building leases to determine the estimated cost of leasing versus the cost  of new construction. We visited GSA regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia;  Chicago, Illinois; and Fort Worth, Texas; and USPS facility service offices  in Lawrenceville, Georgia; Bloomingdale, Illinois; and Dallas, Texas, to  determine the reasons that led these agencies to lease certain building  space. We selected these locations because multiple agencies leased space  there, the number of larger-dollar-value leases was high, and the locations  were geographically diverse. The building leases we selected were among  the larger-dollar-value leases within these locations. Our findings from  visits to, and economic analyses of, federally leased space cannot be  generalized to federally leased space nationwide. USPS provided similar  data for its leases but requested that we not provide them in this report  because of a Postal Regulatory Commission ruling that such data should  not be disclosed to the public.", "To answer the third question, we analyzed administration and agency  efforts to address long-standing problems in real property and past  proposals for reforming federal leasing policy. For this question, we did  not focus on issues related to USPS, because USPS is not subject to OMB  guidance on leasing. In addressing each of the three questions, we  interviewed agency officials and obtained and analyzed relevant laws and  documents. Additional information on our methodology appears in  appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from July 2006 to  January 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal real property environment has many stakeholders and involves  a vast and diverse portfolio of assets that are used for a wide variety of  missions. Real property is generally defined as facilities, land, and  anything constructed on or attached to land. According to FRPP data, the  federal government owned and leased 1.2 million assets with a  replacement value of $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2006. The Department of  Defense, USPS, GSA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs hold the  majority of the owned and leased facility space. The makeup of the federal  government\u2019s facilities reflects the diversity of agencies\u2019 missions and  includes office buildings, prisons, post offices, courthouses, laboratories,  and border stations.", "GSA is authorized by law to acquire, manage, utilize, and dispose of real  property for most federal agencies. These authorities are contained in title  40 of the U.S. Code, and GSA is responsible for its implementation.  Agencies are subject to title 40 authorities unless they have their own  specific real estate authority and are exempted from title 40. Under title  40, GSA is authorized to enter into lease agreements for up to 20 years that  the Administrator of GSA considers to be in the interest of the federal  government and necessary to accommodate a federal agency. GSA uses  this authority to lease space on behalf of many federal government  agencies. In 1996, GSA began a program called \u201cCan\u2019t Beat GSA Leasing\u201d  that offered federal agencies the choice of using GSA as their leasing agent  or assuming responsibility for their own leasing. Under this program, GSA  delegated leasing authority for general purpose space to the heads of all  federal agencies. GSA\u2019s original delegation consisted of six conditions,  which included the requirements that federal agencies acquire and utilize  leased space in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. In  December of 2002, GSA revised its regulations to specifically state that all  agencies must follow the budget scorekeeping guidelines and OMB\u2019s  requirements for leases, capital leases, and lease purchases identified in  appendixes A and B of OMB Circular A-11. Federal agencies also may  have their own independent statutory authority related to real property. In  November 2007, GSA amended its delegations of leasing authority to  acquire general purpose office space and special purpose office space.  GSA said its basis for amending these delegations of authority was to  increase oversight and to facilitate compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations governing the acquisition of real property, since several  recent audits of its delegation program found instances in which agencies  had failed to meet the requirements of their leasing delegation. USPS,  which is an independent establishment in the executive branch, is  authorized to sell, lease, or dispose of property under its general powers  and is exempt from most federal laws dealing with real property and  contracting.", "Since 2003, we have reported that federal real property is a high-risk area  due to excess and deteriorating property, reliance on costly leasing,  unreliable data, and security challenges. Specifically, problems are  exacerbated by underlying obstacles that include competing stakeholder  interests, legal and budgetary limitations, and the need for improved  capital planning. For example, agencies cited local interests as barriers to  disposing of excess property, and agencies\u2019 limited ability to pursue  ownership leads them to lease property that may be more cost-effective to  own over time. In February of 2004, the President signed Executive Order  13327 and added real property management to the President\u2019s  Management Agenda, which scores agencies on their progress in meeting  performance targets. The order applies to 24 executive branch  departments and agencies, but not to USPS. Agencies under that  executive order have, among other things, designated senior real property  officers, established asset management plans, standardized real property  data reporting, and adopted various performance measures to track  progress. The administration\u2019s establishment of FRPC also supports  reform efforts. Furthermore, OMB staff said that the administration  intends to work with Congress to provide agencies with tools to more  effectively manage their real property assets. To meet the order\u2019s  requirement for standardized real property data reporting, FRPC worked  with GSA to develop FRPP. The first governmentwide reporting of  inventory data for FRPP took place in December of 2005, and selected  data were included in the fiscal year 2005 Federal Real Property Report,  published by GSA on behalf of FRPC in June of 2006.

GSA also leases about   15 million square feet, or about 9 percent of its overall leased portfolio, for  warehouses for agencies. Additionally, GSA leases building space for such  purposes as laboratories, family housing, and other miscellaneous uses.  These uses account for about 1 percent of its leased space.

However, we noted some  data quality issues that would be cause for concern if FRPP were used for  more than describing the inventory, such as strategic decision making. For  example, USPS categorized its 28,108 leased assets \u201cmission dependent  not critical\u201d and did not include annual operating costs for each leased  asset. The categorization of USPS\u2019s leased facilities as \u201cmission dependent  not critical\u201d and \u201cnot mission critical\u201d could be questioned, since USPS\u2019s  facilities serve as the main channel for providing mail delivery service to  all people residing in the United States. In our April 2007 report, we  recommended that OMB develop a framework that agencies can use to  better ensure the validity and usefulness of key real property data in  FRPP.

The most striking trend in GSA-leased space, GSA predicts, is that  for the first time it will lease more space than it owns in 2008. From fiscal  year 2003 through fiscal year 2006, GSA increased its leased space from  about 160 million square feet to about 172 million square feet while its  owned space decreased from about 180 million square feet to about   174 million square feet.", "Besides tracking total leased square footage, as all federal agencies are  required to do for FRPP, GSA captures, analyzes, and evaluates a number  of other leasing trends, including trends in lease extensions, vacancy rates  in leased facilities, negative net operating income leases, and GSA lease  rates compared with market lease rates. GSA conducts trend analysis  using the data from prior years that it retains, or annually archives. GSA  officials stated that annually archiving data is the key to establishing  baselines and conducting trend analysis because it aggregates data for  similar fields over time, which allows for analyses of comparable data  each year. According to GSA officials, these analyses can then be used to  better anticipate and react to market changes, helping to ensure the most  efficient management of the lease portfolio. GSA officials said they can use  annually archived data to isolate key trends, examine the causes of these  trends, and identify potential solutions. According to GSA officials, they  are broadening the use of outside published data to forecast market  conditions and rent for leasing activity.", "GSA officials told us that trend analysis with annually archived data can  identify \u201clow- value\u201d leases\u2014those for which the government is currently  paying above-market rates. Such analysis also can identify leases in  markets where rental rates are forecasted to grow quickly and the  government risks paying higher lease rates in the future. Second, trend  analysis of market data comparisons can indicate whether a lease  extended without full competition is more expensive than a lease fully  competed in the free market. GSA estimated that approximately 65  percent of its expiring leases were extended at the request of tenant  agencies. GSA officials said that leases that are extended could potentially  place GSA at risk, especially in areas where the agency may be overpaying  because of changing market rates.

According to GSA officials, before deciding to enter into the lease in 2006  for the new field office, which has a 14-year term, GSA pursued other  options for its tenant agency, including repair and alteration and building  construction.

Specifically, for fiscal years 2006 through  2008, the President requested funding for GSA primarily for courthouses  or border stations, although for all 3 years GSA requested funds to cover  other construction and repair and alteration projects. According to GSA  real property officials, these types of constraints on construction funding  for federal office space often limit their ability to pursue ownership for  general purpose office space.", "For this review, GSA developed and provided a 30-year net present-value  analysis of leasing versus ownership for the building leases we selected.  When proposing a lease, GSA no longer provides this type of analysis to  Congress. According to GSA officials, until the submission of the fiscal  year 1995 capital investment and leasing program, GSA included the  results of a 30-year net present-value analysis of housing alternatives in  lease prospectuses. Now, according to GSA officials, GSA instead  performs a scoring analysis for all lease prospectuses. The scoring  analysis, GSA officials said, includes an estimate of construction costs.  Other estimated costs include those for the proposed asset\u2019s design,  management, and inspection and site acquisition. According to GSA, these  combined estimates provide a total asset value based on cost that forms  the basis for determining whether the proposal scores as a capital or an  operating lease. GSA officials said GSA\u2019s authorizing committees  requested that they provide this information with lease prospectuses in  lieu of the 30-year net present value analysis.", "Although USPS is self-financed and not dependent on appropriations or  subject to the scorekeeping rules that apply to other federal agencies,  USPS officials said that limited up-front capital to fund construction  projects is also a hindrance to ownership. USPS\u2019s leasing guidance states  that a lease-versus-purchase analysis is to be conducted when new  construction leasing or the purchase of a building is the recommended  building acquisition alternative. These lease-versus-purchase analyses  consider the net present value and the return on investment of acquisition  alternatives. The lease-versus-purchase analysis at USPS includes the  purchase of a newly constructed building, but also can include the  exercise of options available in certain lease contracts to purchase a  currently leased building. USPS officials at the three facilities service  offices we visited said major reductions in capital funding dictated many  of their decisions about leasing and ownership. In particular, USPS  headquarters officials stated that they would prefer to own all of the larger  facilities, such as mail-processing facilities, but that capital constraints can  prevent ownership of all such facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Considerations Also Drive Decisions to Lease", "paragraphs": ["While GSA and USPS officials emphasized that the limited availability of  capital was a major impediment to building ownership, they also cited  operational requirements\u2014 such as changes to an agency\u2019s mission,  immediate space needs, security requirements, or a desire for flexibility\u2014 as drivers of the decision to lease rather than own space. Other factors,  such as shorter-term or smaller space needs, also may influence agencies\u2019  decisions to lease space. GSA and USPS officials cited agency mission as a  reason they chose to pursue leasing rather than building ownership for  certain projects. For instance, USPS officials said they strive to locate  postal service buildings in areas that will optimize the efficiency of mail  delivery. Thus, when deciding between leasing and constructing a  building, they may consider operational factors such as the size of a  facility, traffic routes, access to parking, and convenience for the  customer. USPS officials noted, particularly for customer service post  offices, that leasing in existing retail space, rather than constructing a new  facility, is usually the optimal way to reach customers. However, as we  have previously reported, significant challenges remain related to USPS\u2019s  planning and implementation of its infrastructure realignment, which is  designed to reduce excess capacity as well as reflect changes in  operations. Further challenges persist related to USPS\u2019s identification and  disposal of excess property. We previously have recommended that USPS  develop a facilities plan that includes a strategy for how USPS intends to  rationalize the postal facilities network and remove excess processing  capacity and space from the network. In some instances, officials told us  that operational requirements take precedence over economic  considerations. For instance, automation at USPS has affected operational  planning requirements for future facilities by changing the expected need  for square footage. GSA officials also cited changes in a tenant agency\u2019s  mission as dictating an immediate need for space. For instance, expanding  mission requirements for the Department of Homeland Security created  additional space requirements. Faced with a changing mission and  relatively immediate space needs, agencies may opt for lease construction  rather than federal construction, GSA officials told us, because lease  construction is perceived to take less time than federal construction.  Under lease construction, an agency works with the private sector to  design and build a building that the government leases to meet the  agency\u2019s mission needs. The private developer finances the construction of  the building and agrees to lease the finished building to the agency. This  arrangement allows an agency to obtain a new building suited to its needs  without having to pay the up-front costs associated with federal  construction. GSA officials said that it is highly challenging to determine  when a tenant agency\u2019s mission may change and what space needs may  subsequently emerge.", "Both GSA and USPS cited the need for flexibility in their space  assignments as a reason for leasing rather than owning space. Certain  agencies that GSA obtains space for, such as the Social Security  Administration, try to locate their facilities close to their customers. As  demographic shifts occur in certain areas of the country, customers can  potentially move to new areas. GSA real property officials stated that  leasing rather than ownership is frequently used to give these agencies the  flexibility to relocate closer to their customers, if necessary. Postal  officials also cited flexibility as a reason for leasing retail post office  space. According to Postal Service officials in the Southwest Facilities  Service Office, recent population increases in Texas and Northwestern  Arkansas may expand the need for retail postal facilities in these areas.  Because the majority of the space USPS obtains in the region is small and  subject to demographic shifts, leasing provides flexibility to meet changing  operational needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Considerations Can Lead to Leasing", "paragraphs": ["Due to the expansion of security requirements in recent years, such as  those for blast-resistant building exteriors and the need for greater  setbacks, GSA officials said that agency requirements have become more  stringent and complex. In some circumstances, GSA officials said, these  security needs cannot be met in existing federal buildings, causing  agencies to pursue lease construction. When acquiring space for the FBI  field office in Chicago, GSA first pursued the option of repair and  alteration and then building purchase. GSA officials said that after  reviewing the federal inventory and investigating the site with the most  potential, GSA determined that the repairs needed to make existing federal  building space comply with post-September 11 security requirements  would be cost prohibitive. Given the costliness of the repair and alteration  method and the limited availability of capital for construction, GSA  officials selected lease construction as the method to acquire a building  for FBI. Similarly, when looking for new space to consolidate FBI  operations in Tampa, GSA real estate specialists told us they eliminated  downtown Tampa\u2014where existing federal buildings were located\u2014as a  site because of the difficulty of locating space with the required 100-foot  building setbacks.

GSA  officials stated that in certain rural locations, construction would not be  economically advantageous. The amount of square footage needed also  may dictate whether an agency chooses to lease rather than own space.  For instance, more than 80 percent of GSA\u2019s leases are for 20,000 square  feet or less. When agencies require less than 20,000 square feet, GSA  officials stated, leasing is usually cost-competitive with ownership, and  federal construction is an unlikely option.

Overreliance on costly leasing was, and continues to be, a major reason  why real property management is on GAO\u2019s high-risk list. Trends show  continued reliance on significant amounts of leased space. In particular,  GSA predicts that in 2008 it will lease more space than it owns\u2014an  unprecedented situation. The predilection for leasing has been driven, in  part, by federal budget scorekeeping rules, which make operating leases  an attractive alternative to ownership. The scorekeeping rules, though  rooted in sound budget policy and intended to improve transparency, have  had this undesirable effect. Various alternatives have been proposed to  remedy the problem, but it persists, and reaching a resolution will not be  easy.

OMB asked us to narrow the scope of the recommendation to  identify instances in which agencies are relying on costly, long-term  leasing. A means of identifying such leases could logically be part of the  strategy we are recommending and seems worthwhile pursuing. However,  our report objectives did not include how best to identify costly leases,  and therefore we chose not to change our recommendation. Over the last  decade, our work has shown that GSA relies heavily on operating leases to  meet new long-term space needs and that building ownership often costs  less than operating leases, especially for long-term space needs. In these  reports, we cite examples of leases that were estimated to cost millions of  dollars more than construction over the long-term, including operating  leases for the Patent and Trademark Office in Northern Virginia and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s headquarters building and the Securities  and Exchange Commission building in Washington, D.C. In this report, we  identify examples in which the comparative cost advantage of building  ownership would result in significant financial savings over the long term,  including the FBI field office buildings in Chicago, Illinois, and Tampa,  Florida (see table 2). Also, OMB said that we carefully selected long-term  lease arrangements in our report. Our report methodology clearly  indicates that we chose GSA\u2019s regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia;  Chicago, Illinois; and Fort Worth, Texas; and USPS facility service offices  in Lawrenceville, Georgia; Bloomingdale, Illinois; and Dallas, Texas,  because these locations had a high number of larger-dollar-value leases  and were geographically diverse.", "OMB said that our report recognizes 80 percent of GSA\u2019s leases are for  20,000 square feet or less. OMB also said that when there is general  purpose office space available in a competitive marketplace, leasing may  be a more viable option. Our report acknowledges that leasing is a  practical way to address issues such as a limited amount of available  federal space in a geographic area or a need for a small amount of square  footage. In addition, we cite operational requirements\u2014 such as changes  to an agency\u2019s mission, immediate space needs, security requirements, or a  desire for flexibility\u2014as drivers of the decision to lease rather than own  space. OMB said that the 30-year economic comparison of leasing to  ownership will almost always show that ownership is more cost-effective  than leasing, especially when including land values, and that the federal  government may not recoup the value the 30-year comparison suggests.  We believe that the 30-year net present-value analysis, which GSA has used  for decades and that measures multiyear cash flows in present-dollar  terms so the value of a dollar received today can be compared against the  value of a dollar received in the future, remains a valid measure for  evaluating long-term costs of leasing versus building ownership. Finally,  OMB states that in instances where there is a long-term need or if there is  a need for a special purpose facility not readily available in the leasing  market, that acquisition is an appropriate strategy and that agencies  should budget accordingly. Our report discusses at length GSA\u2019s and  USPS\u2019s concerns that they lack the up-front capital to pursue building  ownership for facilities. For example, GSA officials we spoke with in the  field said that construction funds are available for capital projects in their  region but these dollars tend to be designated for the construction of  agency headquarters, courthouses, and border stations and typically are  not used for federal office space, such as that needed to fulfill FBI\u2019s field  office needs.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

FRPP is maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA)  on behalf of the Federal Real Property Council, which controls access to  the data. We eliminated federal agencies from consideration that lease  their building space overseas. We identified three civilian real-property- holding agencies that are the largest in terms of leased building space held  within the United States and U.S. territories for a more detailed analysis  and assessment of FRPP data. These agencies are GSA, the U.S. Postal  Service (USPS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Agriculture),  which collectively hold 71 percent of domestic, federally leased space. We  analyzed GSA\u2019s, USPS\u2019s, and Agriculture\u2019s fiscal year 2006 FRPP leasing  data, including the data for elements such as real property type, use, legal  interest, status, reporting agency, using organization, size, rate of  utilization, value, condition index, mission dependency, annual operating  and maintenance costs, and general location. To analyze the major trends  in leased space, we were not able to use FRPP, since fiscal year 2005 was  the first year federal agencies were required to submit information on their  leased real property assets to FRPP. Therefore, we reviewed annually  archived GSA leasing data for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, including  analyses of certain aspects of the leased portfolio such as vacancy rates in  leased buildings, lease extensions, and leases that are operating at a  negative net operating income. Because GSA leases a variety of different  space types for many government agencies, its leased portfolio provides a  governmentwide perspective on federally leased building space. Issues  related to collection techniques and availability precluded USPS and  Agriculture from providing us with an electronic copy of annually archived  leasing data, and therefore we could not include information from these  agencies in our analysis of trends under this objective. We also reviewed  GSA\u2019s System for Tracking and Administering Real Property and GSA- generated reports on real property, including the State of the Portfolio and  the Lease Portfolio Reports.

To determine the major  factors that guide these decisions, we interviewed GSA and USPS  headquarters and regional officials with authority over leasing building  space. In addition, we visited GSA regional offices and USPS facility  service offices that are either in the same metropolitan area or near to it.  We visited GSA regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and  Fort Worth, Texas; and USPS facility service offices in Lawrenceville,  Georgia; Bloomingdale, Illinois; and Dallas, Texas. We selected these  locations because they had space leased to multiple agencies and a high  number of larger-dollar-value leases and were geographically diverse. The  leases we selected were among the larger-dollar-value leases within these  locations. To determine the cost of leasing versus the cost of new  construction ownership, we selected seven GSA and three USPS building  leases. For GSA buildings, we used GSA economic analyses we requested  that compared the estimated costs of leasing with the estimated costs of  ownership, while for USPS buildings, we reviewed analyses previously  prepared by USPS officials comparing these estimated costs. For GSA  properties, we worked with budget allocation specialists from GSA\u2019s real  property division to estimate the costs of leasing versus ownership over a  30-year period. We developed this estimate through a net present value  analysis of both leasing and purchasing using GSA\u2019s The Automated  Prospectus System (TAPS). To estimate leasing costs, we used data from  the selected leases for each of the sample buildings, such as usable square  footage, tenant alteration costs, services and utilities, and lease terms. If  this information could not be located on a particular GSA lease, TAPS  program defaults were used. Certain rental rates, such as \u201cstep rents\u201d that  increase over a period of years, were adjusted to present-value terms, as  appropriate. To estimate the costs of new construction ownership, we  used cost data from GSA\u2019s General Construction Cost Review Guide (for  estimated construction costs), commercial real estate data from CoStar  (for estimated land costs), and the Public Building Service\u2019s Design and  Construction Professional Services Budget Estimating Tool (for estimated  design and review and management and inspection costs). All inputs for  both estimated leasing and ownership costs were adjusted to 2005 dollars  using OMB inflation and interest rate data and certain TAPS program  defaults from that year. We selected 2005 as the base year because it was  the most recent year for which the General Construction Cost Review  Guide contained updated actual construction data, rather than estimates.  After estimating the costs of both leasing and ownership, we compared  these amounts to determine which method of financing would have  greater financial savings over the long term.
