As of May 2013, GAO found project managers had submitted final reports for 55 of the 88 projects (about 63 percent) funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2010 and submitted follow-on reports for 27 of the 41 projects (about 66 percent) funded from 2005 through 2007.", "DOD requires the military departments to collect and report to the Corrosion Office key information from equipment-related corrosion projects about new technologies or methods; however, DOD does not have complete information about the benefits of all projects. GAO found that the military departments inconsistently reported measures of achievement other than the return on investment (ROI), such as when outcomes prompted changes to military equipment specifications. Further, the military departments did not always collect required information needed to recompute the estimated ROI and were unable to determine whether projects had achieved their estimated ROI. Corrosion Office officials plan to revise guidance on how project managers should be reassessing the ROI. Without specific guidance to require that follow-on reports include details of measures of achievement other than ROI, the Corrosion Office will be missing the opportunity to know whether equipment-related corrosion projects have achieved outcomes to prevent corrosion.", "DOD has taken steps to improve oversight of its equipment-related corrosion projects, such as revising its DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan to provide additional guidance on reporting requirements. However, DOD does not have a comprehensive overview of the status of all equipment-related corrosion projects. While the reports provide the status for each project, GAO found that the Corrosion Office does not consolidate information to monitor the status of all these projects, such as if a project has not transitioned to service use or has been discontinued. Further, GAO found that project managers vary in how they reported the ROI for discontinued projects. Without a mechanism to consolidate projects' status to facilitate monitoring and guidance for reporting ROIs for discontinued projects, the Corrosion Office and the military departments may not have timely information of whether the corrosion projects produced proven methods and products to prevent the corrosion of military equipment.", "DOD has identified and incorporated lessons learned from equipment-related corrosion projects and shared some lessons with the corrosion community; however, DOD has no centralized and secure database or other source to share lessons from all project reports, including those with sensitive information. While DOD has begun to develop a database that would contain lessons learned on all projects, development is in the early stages, and DOD is unsure when it will be completed. Until a comprehensive, centralized, and secure database is developed that includes lessons learned from all completed projects, officials from DOD's corrosion community will not have full and complete information on lessons learned, including proven methods or products to prevent or mitigate corrosion of military equipment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends four actions to improve the oversight of DOD\u0092s corrosion-prevention and control program.

The vast majority of these costs,  approximately $19 billion, are related to corrosion issues on military  equipment and weapons. Corrosion is defined in Section 2228 of Title 10  of the United States Code as the deterioration of a material or its  properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical  environment.

Projects, including  equipment-related projects, are specific corrosion-prevention and  mitigation efforts, funded jointly by the Corrosion Office and the military  departments, with the objective of developing and testing new  technologies. To propose a project for Corrosion Office funding, the  military departments first refer to requirements in DOD\u2019s strategic plan.  The requirements include initial submission of a project plan, and, if  approved, future submissions of final and follow-on reports. The military  departments\u2019 proposals are evaluated by a panel of experts assembled  by the Director of the Corrosion Office. The Corrosion Office generally  funds up to $500,000 per project, and the military departments generally  pledge matching or complementary funding for each project that they  propose. The level of funding by each military department and the  estimated return on investment (ROI) are two of the criteria used to  evaluate the proposed projects. For the project-selection process, the  military departments submit preliminary project proposals in the fall and  submit final project proposals in the spring, and the Corrosion Office  considers the final proposals for funding.

First, the project  manager begins the research and development phase, also known as the  demonstration phase. During this phase, project managers and project  personnel test new technology, both in military laboratory and real-world  settings. Typically, the demonstration phase takes 1 to 2 years, and the  Corrosion Office requires submission of a final report upon completion of  the demonstration. In this final report, project managers document test  conditions, performance of the new technology, lessons learned, and their  recommendations for the new technology to be transitioned to a military  service\u2019s use. Finally, project managers submit a follow-on report, which  is a checklist, to evaluate a project within 2 years after a project is  completed and the technology has transitioned to use within the military  department. The purpose of the follow-on report is to inform the  Corrosion Office of the overall outcome of the project and to reassess the  ROI. The Strategic Plan provides detailed instructions on how to reassess  the ROI. For example, the ROI reassessments consist of updating the costs and benefits associated with the new technology  reviewing assumptions used earlier in computing the estimated ROI;  resulting from the project;  recalculating the ROI based on reassessed data; and providing an assessment of the difference, if any, between the  estimated ROI and the reassessed ROI.", "Figure 2 provides a breakout of the number of projects that have reached  various reporting milestones, as of May 2013.

We recommended, in part, that DOD fund and complete  ROI validations. DOD concurred and noted that plans were already  underway to address this requirement within the Corrosion Office and  with the Corrosion Executives. Also, in September 2012, we reported that  the Corrosion Office performs an analysis to determine the average ROI  estimates for projects that it cites in its annual corrosion-control budget  report to Congress. Additionally, we reported that the Corrosion Office  did not use the most up-to-date data for the projects\u2019 ROIs or provide  support for the projects\u2019 average ROI that was cited in its fiscal year 2013  corrosion-control budget report to Congress.

The follow-on report,  which consists of a checklist, shows items to be reviewed on the status  and the results of corrosion projects that have completed research and  development, transitioned to service use, and been in use for 2 years.  Project managers have the option to include comments on details about  items on the checklist. Appendix II shows a copy of the checklist used for  project review.

Second, the  strategic plan provides guidance on collecting information on the  estimated ROI for corrosion projects that have completed research and  development and transitioned to service use (i.e., whether a service  implemented the demonstrated technology or method).

For example, some  project managers and project personnel explained that they rely on repair  personnel to collect and record data on the performance of a new  technology or method, which would provide data to verify the initial  investment in corrosion projects. However, according to Corrosion  Executives, project managers, and project personnel, the repair  personnel do not have a consistent way to collect and record the data.  Also, some project managers and project personnel stated it is difficult to  monitor progress of a new corrosion-related technology or method  because the maintenance and repair community does not always note in  maintenance records the reason for repair or replacement. For example,  officials on an Air Force project noted that when electronic circuit cards  failed and were removed from aircraft, repair personnel removed them  and inserted new ones, but did not take the time to figure out why they  failed (such as whether sand and salt corroded the electronic circuit  cards). In some cases, the new technology or method goes beyond  affecting one military service, and effective recordkeeping would involve  the other services tracking, collecting, and reporting back information on  their use of the new technology or method, but we found that such  recordkeeping is not done consistently. Further, some equipment-related  projects are driven by environmental concerns, such as those aimed at  finding an alternative chemical to use to prevent corrosion. According to  officials, these concerns, such as measuring the environmental effect on  reducing pollution, are difficult to measure.", "Consequently, the military departments and DOD management have  been unable to determine whether the projects are achieving their  estimated financial benefits. Officials from the Corrosion Office  acknowledged that project managers have not followed DOD\u2019s strategic  plan regarding collecting information to verify whether projects are  achieving the benefits initially estimated in project plans because of  challenges in collecting and monitoring relevant data.

Until a comprehensive, centralized, and secure  database is developed that includes lessons learned from all completed  corrosion projects, officials from DOD\u2019s corrosion community will not have  full and complete information on lessons learned, including proven  methods or products to prevent or mitigate corrosion of military  equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making four recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s corrosion- prevention and control program:  To enhance DOD in its oversight of the status and potential benefits of its  equipment-related corrosion projects, we recommend that the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics require  the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, to", "Revise the DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan or  other guidance to require that the military departments include in all  follow-on reports the details of measures of achievement other than  ROI, such as the features, results, and potential benefits of the  project.", "To enhance tracking of DOD\u2019s equipment-related corrosion projects, we  recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics require the Director, Corrosion Policy and  Oversight Office, to develop a tool or mechanism to assist in monitoring and consolidating  the status information for each equipment-related corrosion project  about whether the demonstrated technology or method has  transitioned to military departments\u2019 use.", "To ensure consistent reporting for all equipment-related corrosion  projects, we recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics require the Director, Corrosion  Policy and Oversight Office, to  revise guidance to specify how project managers should report the  ROI for discontinued projects.", "To enhance planning for corrosion prevention and mitigation, we  recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics require the Director, Corrosion Policy and  Oversight Office, to establish a time frame for completing the comprehensive and secure  database so that all relevant officials of DOD\u2019s corrosion community  have access to the proven technology methods, products, and other  lessons learned from all corrosion projects to prevent or mitigate  corrosion of military equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.

DOD partially concurred with one  recommendation, and based on additional information provided in its  comments, we revised that recommendation. Finally, DOD did not concur  with one recommendation.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, enhance tracking of DOD\u2019s  equipment-related corrosion projects by developing a tool or mechanism  to assist in monitoring and consolidating the status information for each  equipment-related corrosion project about whether the demonstrated  technology or method has transitioned to military departments\u2019 use. As  DOD notes in its comments, the Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office  will monitor transition status using the corrosion Engineering Resource  Data Management (ERDM2) database program currently under  development.   According to DOD, ERDM2 is designed to collect, classify,  and file data on all aspects of corrosion projects and to provide the DOD  corrosion community access to information and tailored status reports.", "DOD concurred with our fourth recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight, could enhance planning for corrosion  prevention and mitigation by establishing a time frame for completing the  comprehensive and secure database so that all relevant officials of  DOD\u2019s corrosion community have access to the proven technology  methods, products, and other lessons learned from all corrosion projects  to prevent or mitigate corrosion of military equipment. DOD stated in its  comments that the development of the comprehensive and secure  ERDM2 data-management tool is underway and is a high priority.   According to DOD, development and deployment will occur incrementally  and simultaneously to ensure that needs of all stakeholders are met.  DOD anticipates that the initial phase of ERDM2 will contain data from  completed projects and will be in place by December 31, 2013.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation in the draft report  that the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, revise guidance  to specify how the military departments\u2019 Corrosion Executives and project  managers should report the ROI for discontinued projects to ensure  consistent reporting for all equipment-related corrosion projects. In  partially concurring with this recommendation, DOD stated that the  military departments\u2019 Corrosion Executives do not actively execute  projects or engage in the calculation of the ROI process, so the next  revision of DOD\u2019s Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan will  address only how project managers will calculate and report ROI on  discontinued projects to the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight.   While we found that the military departments\u2019 Corrosion Executives  review and coordinate through their respective chain of command to  provide information on corrosion projects to the Director of the Corrosion  Office, we agree that the military executives do not actively execute the  corrosion projects or engage in the calculation of the ROI. Thus, we have  revised the recommendation to include only the project managers.", "DOD did not concur with our first recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, revise the DOD Corrosion  Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan or other guidance to require that  the military departments include in all follow-on reports the details of  measurements of achievement other than ROI, such as the features,  results, and potential benefits of the project. In its response, DOD stated  that the DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan currently  provides sufficient guidance in this regard and believes it is not necessary  to revise this guidance. DOD cited instructions in section 3, appendix D of  the strategic plan about the 2 year follow-on reporting, which is to include  a focus on assessing the ROI computed at project completion, as well as  other features and benefits of the projects. Additionally, this appendix  accompanying the strategic plan includes instructions on completing and  submitting a checklist, also regarded as the follow-on report, to fulfill the  requirements. We noted in our report that the checklist for the follow-on  report that shows items to be reviewed on the status of the projects  allows project managers to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each item, but project  managers are not required to write details about any benefits of the  project. During our review, we found that about three-fourths of the  completed checklists for the follow-on reports were modified by project  managers on their own accord to include some measures of achievement  of completed projects, such as when outcomes prompted changes to  military equipment specifications and standards. However, one-fourth of  the follow-on reports did not include information about features and  benefits of completed projects. Specifically, we found that 8 of 30 follow- on reports contained little to no narrative detail because there was no  requirement to do so. While DOD\u2019s strategic plan provides instructions for  the 2 year follow-on reporting, the plan with its accompanying instructions  for completing the follow-on reports does not require that project  managers include details about any benefits of the project. We maintain  that DOD could enhance its oversight of corrosion projects by providing  additional, specific guidance to require that follow-on reports include  details of measures of achievements other than ROI, including project  benefits, to allow the Corrosion Office to have additional information  about whether equipment-related corrosion projects have achieved  outcomes to prevent or mitigate corrosion.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force and the Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director of  the DOD Office of Corrosion Policy and Oversight; and other interested  parties.

We originally received project documentation for 129  projects, from which we selected our sample. However, one project was  eliminated because it was funded in fiscal year 2013. We obtained project  information for 128 equipment-related corrosion demonstration projects  funded by the DOD Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office (hereafter  referred to as the Corrosion Office) for fiscal years 2005 through 2012.  We requested and reviewed the project documentation\u2014project  proposals, final reports, and follow-on reports\u2014to determine if the data  and related reports met the Corrosion Office\u2019s reporting requirements. For  the purposes of our work in reviewing projects funded in fiscal years 2005  through 2010, we considered a final or follow-on report to be submitted as  required if the Corrosion Office had a copy of the report in its records  system, and confirmed the accuracy with the Corrosion Control and  Prevention Executives (hereafter referred to as Corrosion Executives).  We did not consider the timeliness of the submitted reports. We received  project documentation through May 15, 2013. Additionally, for follow-on  reports, we could assess only the projects funded in fiscal years 2005  through 2007 because the DOD strategic plan\u2019s milestone requires  submission of follow-on reports for completed projects within 2 years after  the projects have been completed and transitioned to use within the  military departments. We determined that the project-reporting data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining the extent to which the  military departments met the Corrosion Office\u2019s reporting requirements.  We did not assess elements of the actual report. We interviewed officials  from the Corrosion Office, as well as the Army, Navy, and Air Force  Corrosion Executives, to understand the process of what reports are  required and when; challenges and limitations, if any, in completing the  reports; and how projects are tracked if required reports have not been  submitted. Further, we interviewed these officials to determine why the  required reports were not submitted. Also, we determined what actions, if  any, they planned to take to complete the reports. Moreover, we selected  a nongeneralizable sample of 43 projects for further review and  conducted an in-depth analysis of the projects selected. We selected the  sample using a random systematic approach. We ordered the population  first by service, then by fiscal year, location, and project manager. Next  we selected a random starting point and then selected every third project.  Our nongeneralizable, sample-selection methodology ensured selection  of a variety of projects over all fiscal years, locations, and services. We  used a semistructured interview tool to obtain information from project  managers and project personnel to understand reporting requirements  and time frames as well as challenges and limitations, if any, that they  had in completing the reports. We also reviewed prior GAO work on  DOD\u2019s corrosion-prevention and mitigation program.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has collected the information  needed to determine whether benefits and other measures have been  achieved from equipment-related corrosion projects, we reviewed key  documents, including DOD Instruction 5000.67 and DOD\u2019s strategic plan.  We examined DOD Instruction 5000.67 to gain an understanding of the  roles and responsibilities to develop procedures for corrosion planning  and implementation, and to review, manage, and document project  results. We examined DOD\u2019s strategic plan to gain an understanding of  the department\u2019s strategy to justify funding for corrosion projects by  verifying the initial investment of corrosion projects and guidance on  collecting information to check on any changes to the assumptions used  in the initial estimated return on investment (ROI) in order to compare, or  recompute, the ROI and determine whether the ROI is lower than  expected, as expected, or better than expected. Finally, we examined  guidance on internal controls to identify relevant responsibilities and  practices that could be used as criteria. We reviewed all follow-on reports  provided by the Corrosion Office and the military departments, which  included 30 follow-on reports on projects funded in fiscal years 2005  through 2008, to determine whether the military departments have  collected and reported measures of achievement of their completed  corrosion projects other than ROI, such as when outcomes prompt  changes in specifications, standards, technical manuals, and other  reference or guidance documents. We compared the amount of detail  provided in the follow-on reports. Additionally, we interviewed officials  from the Corrosion Office as well as the military departments\u2019 Corrosion  Executives to understand whether and how they collect data in order to  determine whether the estimated ROIs have been achieved. Additionally,  from our nongeneralizable random systematic sample of 43 projects, we  interviewed project managers and project personnel to gain an  understanding of how they provide information on the status and the  results of corrosion projects that have completed research and  development, transitioned to a service\u2019s use, and been in use for 2 years.  Specifically, we interviewed these officials to understand how they verify  the initial investment of corrosion projects, including what the project\u2019s  assumptions were, how the assumptions were tracked during the first few  years of the project, and the extent to which the implementation affected  the ROI recomputation. For projects that were still in the demonstration  phase, or had just been transitioned to a service\u2019s use, we interviewed  the officials to understand their plans to collect information to verify the  initial investment.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has tracked the status of  equipment-related corrosion projects, we reviewed relevant law to  understand legislative requirements, including a long-term strategy and a  coordinated research and development program for the prevention and  mitigation of corrosion for new and existing military equipment, which  includes a plan to transition new corrosion prevention technologies into  operational systems. Further, we examined DOD Instruction 5000.67 to  gain an understanding of the department\u2019s policy on the prevention and  mitigation of corrosion on DOD military equipment as well as roles and  responsibilities of the Corrosion Office and Corrosion Executives to  collect, review, reassess, and distribute information on proven methods  and products that are relevant to prevent corrosion of military equipment.  We analyzed documentation for each of the 43 projects in our sample,  specifically reviewing the project plans, final reports, and follow-on  reports, to analyze variables, including assumptions, initial estimated ROI  and the reassessed ROI, recommendations to transition to service use,  project status, and benefits and outcomes other than the ROI, among  others. We interviewed Corrosion Office officials to determine what status  information is collected for each project, how such information is  consolidated, and what analysis is done to oversee the status and  outcomes of each project. Likewise, we interviewed Corrosion Executives  to determine their approach to collect, review, reassess, and distribute  information on proven methods and products that are relevant to prevent  corrosion of military equipment. Specifically we interviewed these officials  to gain an understanding on how project results were reviewed,  managed, and documented.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has identified, shared, and  incorporated lessons learned from equipment-related corrosion projects  into future planning to prevent or mitigate corrosion, we reviewed key  documents, including relevant law to understand legislative  requirements, and DOD policy and guidance. For example, we examined  DOD Instruction 5000.67 to understand the department\u2019s policy to ensure  a focused and coordinated approach throughout DOD to collect, review,  reassess, and distribute information on relevant proven methods and  products. We also examined DOD\u2019s strategic plan to understand the  department\u2019s guidance on using rapid and effective web-based strategies  for communicating and sharing best practices, capturing corrosion-related  technical information across the services, and to determine the  requirements for lessons learned to be incorporated into project  documentation, specifically the final report. Finally, we examined  guidance on internal controls to identify relevant responsibilities and  practices that could be used as criteria. We analyzed all final reports to  determine whether lessons learned were being included and the extent to  which they were being incorporated into future planning and guidance.  We interviewed Corrosion Office officials to learn about their efforts to  develop a centralized database for project information that included  lessons learned. We interviewed Corrosion Executives and their staffs to  learn about how lessons learned are shared and incorporated.  Additionally, from our nongeneralizable random systematic sample of 43  projects, we interviewed project managers and project personnel to gain  an understanding of how lessons learned are collected, documented,  shared, and incorporated into future corrosion planning.
