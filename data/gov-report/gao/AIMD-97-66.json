Data IRS used to determine how much more money and staff it needed to process those additional returns show only a small difference between the number of FTEs needed to process a million electronic returns and the number needed to process a million paper returns.

IRS is reviewing one other project for $7 million and has canceled the remaining projects, which had projected fiscal year 1997 costs totaling about $36 million.", "According to IRS\u2019 Chief Information Officer (CIO), IRS canceled these systems because business case analyses did not justify continued development. The canceled projects include the Corporate Accounts Processing System, the Integrated Case Processing System, and the Workload Management System.", "The CIO also stated that IRS does not plan to start any new system development projects until it has developed the internal capability needed to effectively manage system development projects, which includes developing a modernization systems architecture and a systems deployment plan.

One important step IRS took to achieve that end was to increase the number of FTEs devoted to taxpayer service. According to IRS estimates, the number of taxpayer service FTEs will increase from 8,031 in fiscal year 1996 to 9,091 in fiscal year 1997.

That increase may be due, in large part, to a change in the tax package IRS sent eligible TeleFile users this year. In past years, IRS sent taxpayers who appeared eligible to use TeleFile a package that included not only TeleFile materials but also a Form 1040EZ and related instructions. Thus, taxpayers who could not or did not want to use TeleFile had the materials they needed to file on paper, assuming they were still eligible to file a Form 1040EZ. This year, IRS eliminated the Form 1040EZ and related instructions from the package sent eligible TeleFile users\u2014hoping that more taxpayers would be inclined to use TeleFile if they only received the TeleFile materials.", "A second noteworthy trend this year is an increase in the ability of taxpayers who have questions about the tax law, their refunds, or their account to reach IRS by telephone. As shown in table 3, the accessibility of IRS\u2019 telephone assistance, as we have defined it in the past, has increased substantially.", "As table 3 indicates, the increase in accessibility is due to a combination of fewer calls coming in and more calls being answered. The two factors are not unrelated. The more successful IRS is in answering the phone, the fewer times taxpayers should have to call in an attempt to get through.", "IRS has another way of measuring accessibility, called \u201clevel of access\u201d, which tracks the percentage of callers who were eventually able to get through to IRS rather than the number of call attempts. As of February 22, 1997, according to IRS data, the level of access was 71 percent, a substantial increase over the 52-percent level of access as of the same time last year.", "There are several factors that appear to have contributed to IRS\u2019 increased telephone service: (1) an increase in the number of staff assigned to answer the phone, some of which was achieved by detailing staff from other IRS functions; (2) an attempt to reduce the need for persons to call IRS by eliminating certain notices that IRS deemed to be unnecessary; and (3) revisions to IRS\u2019 procedures for handling calls.", "As an example of the latter, this year, unlike past years, callers who indicate, through the choices they select on the automated telephone menu, that they have a question in a complex tax area (such as \u201csale of residence\u201d) are to be connected to a voice messaging system. Those callers are asked to leave their name, telephone number, and best time for IRS to call back, and they are told that someone will be calling back within 2 working days. Those return calls are being made by staff detailed from IRS\u2019 Examination function.

To ensure that these views are considered, GPRA requires agencies to consult with Congress as they develop their strategic plans.", "Congress and the administration have both demonstrated that they recognize that successful consultations are key to the success of GPRA and therefore to sustained improvements in federal management. For IRS, these consultations provide an important opportunity for Congress, IRS, and Treasury to work together to ensure that IRS\u2019 mission is focused, goals are specific and results oriented, and strategies and funding expectations are appropriate and reasonable. The consultations may prove difficult because they entail a different working relationship between agencies and Congress than has generally prevailed in the past. The consultations are likely to underscore the competing and conflicting goals of IRS programs, as well as the sometimes different expectations of the numerous parties involved.", "As a GPRA pilot agency, IRS should be ahead of many federal agencies in the strategic planning and performance measurement process. Nonetheless, IRS remains a long way from being able to ensure that its budget funds the programs that will contribute the most towards achieving its mission goals. While IRS needs more outcome-oriented indicators, it also has difficulty in measuring its performance with the indicators it has. For example, IRS\u2019 top indicator is its Mission Effectiveness Indicator. This is calculated by subtracting from the revenue collected the cost of IRS programs and taxpayer burden and dividing that result by true total tax liability. While this approach may be conceptually sound, IRS does not have reliable data to calculate taxpayer burden nor can it calculate true total tax liability.", "In summary, IRS\u2019 1997 filing season is going very well in two areas that we have criticized in the past.
