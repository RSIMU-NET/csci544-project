Instances of IRS correspondence being incorrect, incomplete, unclear, and nonresponsive have been documented by GAO and IRS. The need to improve the formats of notices has also been identified. In a recent annual report, IRS acknowledged that taxpayers too often find its notices confusing. Describing its written communications with taxpayers as a \u201cseemingly intractable problem,\u201d IRS made a commitment to improve the clarity of these documents. Its current Business Master Plan, a strategic planning document, establishes measurable clarity improvements in notices as one of its goals.", "IRS master file notices may request payment, seek information, inform taxpayers of account activity, or provide instructions related to account settlement. Many notices concern discrepancies identified during the processing of returns or result from collection efforts, examination of returns, and related audit activities.", "Under IRS procedures, notices are comprised of standard paragraphs written by staff in IRS functional units such as Returns Processing, Collections, Examination, and IRS field offices. NCU reviews notices to ensure that the text is clear and understandable.", "IRS\u2019 master files contain specific account information for each taxpayer and IRS relies on these data to generate notices. The Individual Master File (IMF) and the Business Master File (BMF) contain histories of transactions maintained by IRS, including returns submitted by taxpayers, information returns submitted by third parties, and payments made. IMF and BMF notices may be generated, for example, when a discrepancy occurs between information reported on a taxpayer\u2019s return and data stored in the master file. At that point, the notice is automatically printed and sent to the taxpayer. Appendix I illustrates a flowchart of a common situation precipitating the issuance of a notice\u2014a mathematical error made by the taxpayer. The flowchart shows the steps involved in processing the notice.", "IRS has 94 different IMF-generated notices that it sends to taxpayers. However, as figure 1 shows, in 1993 13 IMF notices comprised approximately 71 percent of all IMF-generated notices sent that year.", "Figure 2 shows the distribution of the 152 different BMF-generated notices during 1993. A total of 31 BMF notices accounted for 92 percent of all BMF-generated notices sent to business taxpayers.", "Because a notice\u2019s content and format may affect the taxpayer\u2019s ability and willingness to comply, it is important that notices be clear, informative, and comprehensive. If a notice is unclear, a taxpayer may become less willing to respond out of frustration with IRS. IRS recognized the need to improve the quality of its written communication to taxpayers and established NCU in 1990 to initiate clarity reviews. NCU was tasked with evaluating notice revisions proposed by functional units as well as examining notices suspected of confusing taxpayers. This unit, comprised of approximately eight professional staff, analyzes notices for clarity, readability, and logical material presentation. According to IRS officials, functional units are required to obtain NCU\u2019s approval of new notices and text revisions to existing notices before computer programs containing text will be created or altered. Appendix II depicts the notice revision process and the various IRS units involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to (1) review a group of commonly used notices and offer suggestions to enhance their clarity where appropriate and (2) determine if the IRS\u2019 process for issuing notices produces clear notices.", "To address the first objective, we examined 47 high-volume IMF and BMF notices. We selected the notices that were most frequently sent to taxpayers by IRS, excluding those we previously reviewed for our April 1993 report. These 47 notices resulted in the issuance of more than 33 million notices in 1993, or almost 52 percent of all IMF and BMF notices sent to taxpayers that year. We reviewed the versions of the notices currently being sent to taxpayers as well as any revisions to these notices proposed by NCU, but not yet implemented.", "In reviewing these notices for clarity, understandability, and usefulness, we considered if more specific language, clearer references, and consistent use of terminology would enhance these documents. We assessed whether the material was logically presented, whether sufficient information and detail was provided so taxpayers could evaluate their situations, and whether the taxpayer could resolve the matter without additional guidance. We also evaluated the notice\u2019s format, the suitability of the notice\u2019s title, the directions or guidance provided in enclosures or remittance forms, and whether IRS provided the taxpayer with all pertinent information in a single notice or whether additional notices would have to be sent to resolve the situation.", "Each notice was independently reviewed by at least two GAO evaluators. They considered the same factors in determining if the notices clearly conveyed the message IRS wanted to convey to taxpayers, including whether the text of the notice contained IRS\u2019 intended message; title of the notice was consistent with the text; tax statement or statement of adjustment or other transaction was easy to read and compare to the taxpayer\u2019s return; notice made any assumptions and, if so, whether they were clearly explained; terminology in the notice was easy to understand and logically presented; notice clearly explained what, if any, action was expected of the taxpayer notice provided the taxpayer with sufficient, but not excessive, information regarding the situation; and notice provided the taxpayer a telephone number to call or address to write to should he or she have questions or need additional guidance.", "We used appropriate guidance found in IRS\u2019 Taxpayers Service\u2019s Handbook and the Catalog of Federal Tax Forms, Form Letters and Notices to verify the purposes of the 47 notices. We also discussed all of our concerns and suggestions with the NCU Chief. However, we did not attempt to determine if the notices we reviewed were appropriate given a taxpayer\u2019s particular circumstances.", "In addressing the second objective, we also gathered information to help us assess whether IRS had established a workable process for adopting and implementing notice text improvements. We also obtained data on the number of notice revisions proposed by NCU and the number implemented. However, data were not available on the length of time IRS took to implement the revisions. We identified the computer programming changes required to implement the revisions. We also gathered information concerning how IRS set priorities for requested computer programming changes, including notice revisions, and obtained information on proposed revisions that were rejected. Finally, we identified IRS\u2019 efforts to improve the quality of notices and documented its recent testing of notice production on the Correspondex computer system, which may make revisions more efficiently.", "We did our work at IRS\u2019 National Office in Washington, D.C., from August 1993 to June 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We provided a draft of this report to pertinent IRS officials including the National Director of Planning, the Chief of NCU, and representatives from the Information Systems Management Division (ISM) and other organizational units involved in the notice development and review process. We met with these officials on September 26, 1994, to discuss this report. They suggested several minor technical modifications, which we adopted, but generally agreed with the facts presented as well as our conclusions and recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Notice Language and Format Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["Our review of 47 IMF and BMF notices revealed problems with both the language and format of 31 of these notices. For example, we found that many of the 31 notices would have been improved by more specific language, clearer references, consistent terminology, logical presentation of material, and sufficient information and guidance.", "Format problems included instances where the attached remittance form contained directions that were in conflict with those found in the body of the notice. Another format problem we identified was IRS\u2019 inability to issue notices that addressed multiple or inter-related tax problems with a taxpayer\u2019s account in a single piece of correspondence. Instead, taxpayers would receive several notices in a relatively short time period that addressed several different problems with their tax accounts rather than a detailed, comprehensive notice. This could cause taxpayers confusion and frustration and give taxpayers the impression that IRS is unsure of its position."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Computer System and Competing Priorities Impede Notice Revision", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 computer system is old and inefficient and is largely responsible for the delay in implementing notice language changes. Because of the time-consuming nature of the programming required to make notice text revisions along with other program changes, a bottleneck occurs. Consequently, IRS must evaluate and prioritize program requests.", "Notices are presently maintained on an aging computer system, which uses an old computer programming language\u2014known as assembler language\u2014that is difficult to change. Each master file notice exists as a separate program and, because of the technical difficulties involved in implementing language changes, minor revisions can result in major reprogramming efforts. Unlike modern word processing technology, which processes text changes almost as quickly as typing, the assembler language uses an older programming technique that requires each letter of every word and every character to be separately programmed. This character-by-character programming is known as hard coding and affects all IMF and BMF notices. Consequently, these notice revisions are not simple or quick to do. A single change in a word or punctuation mark would require that every subsequent character be reprogrammed. This is time consuming and inefficient and serves as a deterrent to improving notices.", "IRS established the National Automation Advisory Group (NAAG) in 1992 to facilitate establishment of programming priorities. According to IRS officials, NAAG is comprised of representatives from IRS\u2019 Returns Processing, the major initiator of programming changes, and computer programming officials from ISM. NAAG allows Returns Processing to establish its own priorities, in view of limited resources and the technical difficulties specifically associated with the proposed changes.", "Faced with numerous demands to alter existing operational programs, ISM has found that it does not have the resources to respond to all requests. Programming changes to process returns for the next filing season and those related to implementing new tax laws, for example, take precedence over notice text revisions. These higher priority demands for computer programming changes lessen the likelihood that notice text changes will be made. While recommended notice text changes remain unprogrammed, the old version of the notice continues to be issued to taxpayers.", "The cyclical nature of IRS\u2019 programming activities further delays prompt implementation of text revisions. Because certain programming must be performed at certain times of the year, IRS schedules specific programming tasks to be performed at particular times\u2014for example, preparation for the upcoming filing season. If the development of a notice revision does not coincide with the appropriate programming cycle, its implementation may be delayed for months, until the next available cycle. Generally, because of the high demand for programming changes, IRS staff submit programming requests 6 to 12 months in advance of their preferred implementation date, to allow sufficient scheduling time.", "IRS officials responsible for programming notice text changes said that in most instances proposed notice revisions should be submitted at the beginning of the calendar year so they can be scheduled. Those submitted later in the year may not be considered for scheduling until the beginning of the next calendar year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Demand for Reprogramming Not Met", "paragraphs": ["Because of the high demand for computer programming changes, the submission of a revision request by a functional unit does not guarantee that the reprogramming will be done. Revisions may be assigned as priority 1 or priority 2, or the revision may be rejected outright. According to NCU officials, a priority 2 status has only a slight chance of being programmed.", "Only one programming request for a notice was given a priority 1 status at NAAG\u2019s March 1994 meeting. Fifty-nine various programming requests were presented, and 17 related to notices. Of the 59 programming requests, only 22 received priority 1 status, 8 were granted a priority 2 status, 1 was withdrawn, and the remaining 28 were rejected. Of the 17 notice-related requests, only 1 was assigned as priority 1. This request called for the establishment of new notices to accompany a new tax form. IRS needed these notices for those taxpayers with tax problems who used the new form. Four notice-related requests were designated as priority 2s. The remaining 12 requests were rejected. Although a few of these rejected requests called for changes that would improve IRS\u2019 internal processing of notices, others involved improving the clarity or usefulness of the notices to taxpayers. These rejected requests for improvements to benefit taxpayers could have enhanced over 3 million taxpayer contacts, the notice volume associated with these notices in 1993.", "One rejected request concerned a notice sent in 1993 to nearly 1 million earned income credit (EIC) filers. NCU officials identified an erroneous reference to a section of the EIC tax form in the text of the notice. By the time this error was discovered, the notice had already been sent to a group of recipients. When the request to correct the language was brought to NAAG, it decided to retain the incorrect reference. According to NCU officials, NAAG made this decision because some taxpayers had already received the incorrect version and, it seemed too late to do anything about the problem, which was not viewed by NAAG members from other units as very serious compared to other programming needs.", "Another request would have merged information now contained in two notices into a single notice with revised text. IRS had anticipated that this merger would not only simplify matters for taxpayers but also annually save an estimated $2.4 million in reduced processing and mailing costs. This request received a priority 2 status and was forwarded to ISM for consideration. Because of higher priority requests, including legislative changes, ISM determined it could not implement the change in January 1995 as requested. According to ISM computer programming officials, they could not make the large commitment of resources needed to make the change.", "Even when notice revisions are approved, it may be months before they are actually programmed. Because of the backlog of programming requests, the intense level of effort associated with those changes, and the cyclical nature of completing the program changes, revisions were often submitted months in advance. For example, the requester of the single notice revision that was approved at the March 1994 NAAG meeting had proposed a January 1995 implementation, as had many others requesting changes during that session."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Notice Revisions Not Tracked", "paragraphs": ["Revisions to improve the clarity of notices made by NCU were not always adopted promptly. Among the notices we reviewed were several that had been revised by NCU more than a year earlier, but not implemented as of May 1994. We believe that the changes NCU had made will improve the clarity of these notices, but we are concerned with the length of time that has elapsed since NCU revisions were proposed.", "Although programming delays are significant, IRS has not established a tracking system that would enable it to measure the extent of the delays. There is no system for monitoring whether requested changes are made, or if approved, the progression of notice revisions from submission to implementation. Without a system to track the progress of these revisions through the computer programming stage, it is difficult to document the overall timeliness of notice revision implementation. Without this documentation, delays and other problems may go unobserved.", "To collect data on the implementation of its recommendations, NCU conducted a special review in March 1993 to determine the status of all its prior recommendations. The study revealed that 36 percent of NCU\u2019s revisions were never implemented.

First, several high-volume collection notices have been programmed and tested on IRS\u2019 Correspondex computer system, a letter-writing system used for replying to taxpayers\u2019 correspondence. Text changes can be made more quickly and easily on the Correspondex system than on the assembler language system currently producing notices.", "Correspondex officials acknowledge that while this system is not as efficient as word processing technology, Correspondex can make text revisions much sooner than the 6 to 12 months that it often takes to implement assembler language system changes. These officials told us that text changes to IRS\u2019 Correspondex letters typically take 30 days but under critical circumstances can be made within 1 day.", "Correspondex has the capacity to produce most IMF and BMF notices. According to Correspondex officials, it seems that only those notices with an unusually large amount of data imported from a taxpayer\u2019s master file record are unsuitable for transfer. Correspondex also provides the advantage of more visually appealing print features presently unavailable on the assembler language system, such as lower-case letters. Figure 3 shows an example of a commonly sent collection notice as it would look if produced by the assembler system. Figure 4 shows the same notice produced by Correspondex.", "The testing of notices on Correspondex has not fully demonstrated its suitability for producing IMF and BMF notices. Testing has been limited to the collection notices maintained on the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), which operates on the same computer system as Correspondex. This computer system is different from the computer system on which IMF and BMF operate. IDRS notices are easier to convert to Correspondex than IMF and BMF notices.", "However, Correspondex officials said that they are confident they can successfully produce IMF and BMF notices even though transferring these notices will technically be more difficult than the IDRS notices. While the officials said it would be fairly simple to reproduce the standard notice text on Correspondex, new computer programs would have to be written to merge taxpayer data into the appropriate places in the new Correspondex text. Assembler language system programmers would need to develop these programs and would continue to be responsible for accessing the master file. However, once this programming transition is complete, the assembler programming staff would play a smaller role in the notice process and may be able to devote more time to higher priority work.", "Correspondex officials also told us that they hope to test several IMF and BMF notices this year and, if successful, would like to ultimately transfer most notices, including IMF and BMF notices, to Correspondex. Even if all IMF and BMF notices could not be transferred, a substantial number of other notices could be improved by transferring those with recognized clarity problems or volume. As we discussed earlier, many taxpayer contacts could be improved by changing a relatively few notices.", "Both Correspondex and NCU officials are optimistic about this testing and view it as a way to improve the clarity and format of notices, at least until more sophisticated developments arrive later this decade under TSM. However, IRS management has not committed to expanding the testing to IMF and BMF notices.", "A second effort in progress is the testing of a new notice format, which includes a revised \u201ctax statement\u201d modelled after a version suggested in our April 1993 report on IRS forms, publications, and notices. Taxpayers who are sent math error notices from the IRS Kansas City Service Center receive either the traditional IRS format or the new version modelled after our suggestion. Each version has a unique control number. Taxpayers calling or writing IRS about the notice provide this unique number, thereby enabling IRS to determine which version generates the most questions. This test will help IRS decide whether it would be cost beneficial to convert to the new format.", "Preliminary response data clearly demonstrate that taxpayers who receive the traditional version continue to contact IRS with questions at twice the rate of the taxpayers receiving the new version.", "A third effort involves the acquisition of new printing equipment for IRS\u2019 10 service centers. These printers should improve the general appearance of notices. IRS prints master file notices in upper-case type because with the current equipment its lower-case type is illegible. The new printers could feature lower-case type and different fonts. Another advantage would be that the notice borders would be printed as text. These borders often contain important information regarding where taxpayers should call or write for additional assistance. Presently, borders are contained on various plastic overlays that are copied on to paper before the notice text is printed. By printing these borders as text, the likelihood that a notice would be issued with an inappropriate border, which could confuse taxpayers, should be reduced.", "Finally, a fourth effort involves a TSM initiative that may also lead to improved notices. TSM is exploring ways of issuing single notices that could address multiple tax issues. IRS currently sends taxpayers with multiple or inter-related tax problems a separate notice for each tax matter. The receipt of several notices within a brief period may both confuse and frustrate taxpayers. The master file lacks the ability to identify and address multiple tax problems in a single notice. However, TSM officials hope to be able to deliver to taxpayers comprehensive notices containing all account activity and adjustments.", "In addition to these ongoing efforts, IRS is considering other ways of supplementing notices so they become more useful and understandable to taxpayers. IRS is considering (1) placing commonly asked questions and answers on the back of each notice and (2) expanding the existing tele-tax system to include notice information. This system operates on a toll-free number and provides prerecorded explanations about tax return preparation. IRS officials told us that often taxpayers merely want to speak to a telephone assistor and confirm that their interpretation of a notice is correct. These officials speculated that the common questions and answers placed on the notices themselves, along with the general notice information to be put on tele-tax, may provide some taxpayers with sufficient information and a greater comfort level, thereby decreasing the number of taxpayers who require the assistance of a telephone assistor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS can do more to improve the clarity of its notices. We suggested clarity changes to 31 of the 47 notices we reviewed. These suggestions related to the content, appearance, and sufficiency of instructions the notices provided to taxpayers. In addition, the series of multiple notices, which may be sent to taxpayers with numerous or inter-related tax problems, is another area where gains in clarity improvement can be made. An ongoing TSM effort addressing this problem, if successful, would make a major contribution to notice clarity.", "While IRS recognizes the importance of better communications with taxpayers and makes efforts to enhance taxpayer understanding of existing notices, taxpayers continue to receive notices that do not reflect the most recently recommended versions approved by NCU. These recommended notice changes include language and format modifications that are designed to improve notice clarity and usefulness.", "Computer limitations appear to be one of the most important causes of continued use of notices that IRS processes have identified as needing revision. Notices are generated from the IMF-BMF computer system, and this system cannot make notice revisions efficiently. Text changes require extensive and time-consuming programming efforts. Because of other high-priority programming requests and limited programming resources, computer programming priorities generally do not favor notice language changes. Thus, few changes survive this process. Those that do are made with great difficulty and may take over a year to complete because of the programming requirements.", "IRS has a different computer system on which Correspondex operates, and Correspondex may provide an alternative to the IMF-BMF computer system for issuing notices.
