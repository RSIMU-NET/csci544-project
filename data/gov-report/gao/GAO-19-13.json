However, the issues GAO identified with VBA's quality and timeliness information limit VBA's ability to effectively oversee contractors. For example, VBA officials said they were unable to track the timeliness of exam reports sent back to contractors for corrections, which is needed to determine if VBA should reduce payment to a contractor. The new system implemented in spring 2018 tracks more detailed data on exam timeliness. However, VBA has not documented how it will ensure the data are accurate or how it will use the data to track the timeliness and billing of corrected exam reports.

At the time of our  review, VBA had released one quarterly performance report for the fourth  quarter of calendar year 2017, and officials said they were drafting  others.

More  specifically, VBA can use performance data to help determine how to  allocate exams in each district that has two contractors, as outlined in the  contracts. For example, VBA can decide to allocate more exams to the  contractor with higher performance results. Further, the contracts outline  how VBA can use performance data to administer financial incentives  linked to performance targets. For example, VA is to provide a bonus to a  contractor who meets or exceeds the 92 percent quality standard for a  quarter, and meets or exceeds the 20- or 30-day timeliness standard.
