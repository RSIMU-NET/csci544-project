GAO analyzed documented policies and procedures regarding FAMS's operational approach and a July 2006 classified report based on an independent evaluation of that approach. Also, GAO analyzed employee working group reports and other documentation of FAMS's processes and initiatives for addressing workforce-related issues, and interviewed the FAMS Director, other senior officials, and 67 air marshals (selected to reflect a range in levels of experience).

In assigning air marshals, FAMS seeks to maximize coverage of flights in 10 targeted high-risk categories, which are based on consideration of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. In July 2006, the Homeland Security Institute, a federally funded research and development center, independently assessed FAMS's operational approach and found it to be reasonable. However, the institute noted that certain types of flights were covered less often than others. The institute recommended that FAMS increase randomness or unpredictability in selecting flights and otherwise diversify the coverage of flights within the various risk categories. As of October 2008, FAMS had taken actions (or had ongoing efforts) to implement the Homeland Security Institute's recommendations. GAO found the institute's evaluation methodology to be reasonable. To address workforce-related issues, FAMS's previous director, who served until June 2008, established a number of processes and initiatives--such as working groups, listening sessions, and an internal Web site--for agency personnel to provide anonymous feedback to management on any topic. These efforts have produced some positive results. For example, FAMS revised its policy for airport check-in and aircraft boarding procedures to help protect the anonymity of air marshals in mission status, and FAMS adjusted its flight scheduling process for air marshals to support a better work-life balance. The air marshals GAO interviewed expressed satisfaction with FAMS efforts to address workforce-related issues. Further, the current FAMS Director, after being designated in June 2008 to head the agency, issued a broadcast message to all employees, expressing a commitment to continue applicable processes and initiatives. Also, FAMS has plans to conduct a workforce satisfaction survey of all employees every 2 years, building upon an initial survey conducted in fiscal year 2007. Although the 2007 survey indicated positive changes since the prior year, it was answered by 46 percent of the workforce, well short of the 80-percent response rate that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) encourages for ensuring that results reflect the views of the target population. OMB guidance gives steps, such as extending the cut-off date for responding, that could improve the response rate of future surveys. Also, several of the 2007 survey questions were ambiguous, and response options were limited. Addressing these design considerations could enhance future survey results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With a shared responsibility for protecting the approximately 29,000  domestic and international flights operated daily by U.S. commercial  passenger air carriers, the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) is a key  component of the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) layered  approach for aviation security. FAMS\u2019s overall mission is to help secure  the nation\u2019s aviation system by detecting, deterring, and defeating hostile  acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. In  particular, FAMS\u2019s core mission is to deploy trained and armed federal air  marshals\u2014a workforce generally characterized as the nation\u2019s most  mobile law enforcement officers\u2014to provide an on-board security  presence on selected flights.", "In response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and pursuant to  the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, FAMS\u2019s mission was  expanded to provide coverage of domestic as well as international flights,  with priority given to nonstop, long-distance flights such as those targeted  on September 11. As a result, the agency\u2019s cadre of air marshals grew  significantly.  Nonetheless, because the total number of air marshals is  less than the approximately 29,000 domestic and international flights  operated daily by U.S. commercial passenger air carriers, FAMS routinely  must determine which flights are to be provided an on-board security  presence. To facilitate making these decisions, FAMS developed an  operational approach\u2014commonly referred to as the agency\u2019s concept of  operations\u2014for deploying air marshals on selected flights.", "In addition to flight-coverage decisions, FAMS also faces challenges in  addressing various operational and quality-of-life issues that affect the  ability of air marshals to carry out the agency\u2019s mission\u2014issues that have  been noted by our prior work and also have received extensive media  coverage. Such issues range, for example, from maintaining anonymity  during aircraft boarding procedures to mitigating the various health  concerns associated with frequent flying.", "You requested that GAO evaluate FAMS\u2019s concept of operations and  workforce-related issues.

For criteria in reviewing the agency\u2019s documentation regarding  these efforts, we drew on our prior work regarding leading organizations  and the best practices for strategically managing human capital. Further,  we interviewed the Director of FAMS and other senior officials at agency  headquarters, and we visited 11 of the agency\u2019s 21 field offices, where we  interviewed managers and a total of 67 air marshals. We selected the 11  field offices and the 67 air marshals based on nonprobability sampling.  Regarding field office selections, we considered various factors, such as  geographic location and the involvement of local management in  agencywide working groups to address issues affecting air marshals. Our  selections of air marshals were made to encompass a variety of experience  levels. Because we selected a nonprobability sample of FAMS field offices  to visit and air marshals to interview, the information we obtained in these  visits and interviews cannot be generalized either to all 21 field locations  or to all air marshals in the offices we visited. However, the interviews  provided us a broad overview of issues important to air marshals. We also  reviewed documentation regarding the implementation and results of a  workforce satisfaction survey that FAMS conducted in 2007. Our  engagement team, which included social science analysts with extensive  survey research experience, reviewed the questionnaire used in the survey  for clarity and the related response options for appropriateness. Also, we  discussed with FAMS officials the extent to which efforts were made to  obtain an overall response rate as high as possible.

Within the 10-month period immediately following  September 11, 2001, the number of air marshals grew significantly. Also,  during years following the 2001 attacks, FAMS underwent various  organizational transfers. Initially, FAMS was transferred within the  Department of Transportation from the Federal Aviation Administration to  the newly created TSA. In March 2003, FAMS moved, along with TSA, to  the newly established Department of Homeland Security. In November  2003, FAMS was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE).

In November 2005, we  reported that we had reviewed the directive and believed that it addressed  two of our recommendations\u2014the first and the third recommendations.  More recently, in March 2008, FAMS issued an addendum to its written  directive establishing a means for providing feedback on the status and  outcome of FAMS mission reports to the federal air marshals who submit  them (fourth recommendation).", "Additionally, FAMS revised its policy and procedures regarding interaction  with airline personnel during the check-in and boarding processes in order  to better protect the anonymity of air marshals in mission status. To help  ensure effective implementation, the new policy and procedures have  been incorporated into TSA\u2019s Aircraft Operator Standard Security  Program, which specifies requirements that domestic passenger air  carriers must implement as part of their TSA-approved security programs.  According to FAMS officials, the recent update constitutes the first time  that the Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program guidance specifically  includes a section regarding the boarding of federal air marshals.", "Through use of a database created in fiscal year 2006 to track mission  incidents, FAMS senior executive staff noted that analysis and monitoring  are conducted daily of reported incidents, including those that could  compromise the ability of air marshals to operate discreetly (second  recommendation).

The revisions allow air marshals greater discretion in  selecting appropriate attire to wear on missions and choosing hotels for  overnight trips. Before the revisions, air marshals reported that the dress  code policy was too restrictive and forced them to dress too formally for  certain flights, such as those to vacation-oriented destinations. According  to the air marshals, this restrictive policy resulted in their standing out  from the other passengers, a situation that compromised their anonymity.  Similarly, before being revised, FAMS\u2019s hotel policy directed air marshals  to stay at certain hotels on overnight missions so that they could be  located easily by management in an emergency. Additional considerations  of FAMS management for restricting the hotel selection were to ensure  that air marshals were able to stay at hotels within per diem rates and  would have ready access to transportation between the hotel and the  airport. Air marshals expressed concerns that repeatedly staying at the  same hotels risked exposing their anonymity. The revised policy allows air  marshals to select their own hotels, provided the hotels are within per  diem rates and have adequate transportation options. To alleviate  concerns of FAMS management about being able to contact air marshals  in an emergency, the revised policy requires air marshals to report their  hotel locations via the FAMS intranet.", "All 67 of the air marshals we interviewed in the 11 field offices we visited  said that the revised dress code and hotel policies adequately addressed  their concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Air Marshal Service Is Planning to Replace Its Inventory of Personal Digital Assistant Communication Devices by Early Fiscal Year 2009", "paragraphs": ["FAMS has described the agency\u2019s personal digital assistant (PDA)  communication device as being a lifeline for air marshals. The current  device carried by air marshals is intended to function as a cell phone and  personal computer and allow users to place phone calls, access the  Internet, send e-mails, pull up basic Microsoft Word documents, store  documents, and submit reports. However, the findings of FAMS\u2019s  applicable working groups indicated that the current PDA communication  device has proven unreliable. Similarly, all 67 of the air marshals we  interviewed in 11 field offices stated that they had experienced problems  with their PDA device while on missions. Examples of problems reported  by air marshals included dropped calls or lost signals in certain  geographical areas, limited audio quality and durability, and lack of ability  to send certain required documents (such as time and attendance reports).  Another reported problem was the frequent freezing or locking of the PDA  device, which then necessitated use of a cumbersome reset process. As a  result of such problems, air marshals reported that the PDA device has  hindered their ability to communicate effectively with management while  in mission status. Additionally, the air marshals we interviewed  commented that the current PDA device is relatively large and bulky,  which potentially contributes to loss of anonymity.", "In response to air marshals\u2019 feedback and the working groups\u2019  recommendations, FAMS is taking steps to procure new PDA  communication devices and distribute them to air marshals. Furthermore,  according to FAMS officials, the procurement contract for the new PDA  devices will provide for a 2-year replacement cycle. In the interim, to  improve voice communication capabilities pending arrival of the new  devices, FAMS officials reported that it issued new cell phones to air  marshals in June 2008.

To be fully effective, air  marshals must be healthy, fit, and alert. However, FAMS\u2019s Medical Issues  Working Group reported that air marshals have experienced various types  of health issues\u2014poor physical fitness as well as musculoskeletal injuries  and upper respiratory infections\u2014that may potentially be attributable to  frequent flying and the overall nature of their jobs. The working group  noted various challenges to ensuring that air marshals have adequate  sleep, exercise, and recovery time. A contributing factor noted is that the  agency\u2019s automated scheduling tool historically has lacked the capability  to consistently program an air marshal\u2019s daily start and end times  throughout a roster period, which makes normal sleep patterns difficult to  maintain and often results in fatigue. For instance, an air marshal may  have been scheduled to begin some days at 5 a.m. and other days at 10  a.m., with unpredictable ending times because of flight delays. In addition  to inconsistent shifts, the Medical Issues Working Group noted that air  marshals are subject to long hours\u2014including arriving home late on a  Friday and then having to depart early the following Monday morning.  These types of schedules, according to the working group, make allowing  adequate time for workouts and maintaining healthy eating habits difficult  and also limit the amount of time available to take care of family and  personal needs.", "To address these scheduling issues, FAMS has implemented or is planning  to implement various changes:", "Mission exchange program\u2014This program, which FAMS initially  piloted in 2006 and is now available to all 21 field offices, allows air  marshals within the respective field office to exchange mission days  based on a demonstrated need, such as medical issues or family- related issues. For instance, an air marshal with an 8 a.m. mission start  time and a 9 a.m. medical appointment could exchange shifts with  another air marshal for a later mission start time. The program is  intended to reduce the amount of unscheduled leave taken by air  marshals and otherwise mitigate the hardships or other effects  associated with FAMS\u2019s current policy of requiring air marshals to  submit requests for annual leave 38 to 66 days in advance.", "Preset ending time and 60-hour rule\u2014In September 2006, FAMS  instituted a change to its mission-scheduling policy. The change is  designed to help ensure that air marshals complete their mission  flights by a preset time on the day before a regular day off (or the day  before scheduled annual leave) and not begin a new mission until  receiving a minimum of 60 hours rest. For example, if an air marshal\u2019s  regular days off are Saturday and Sunday, and this individual\u2019s mission  ended on Friday evening, the next mission assignment (on Monday)  would begin no earlier than Monday morning.", "Limit on number of flight days\u2014In April 2007, FAMS implemented  another change in mission-scheduling policy designed to distribute  flight days equitably and improve the balance between work and  personal life for air marshals. Specifically, under the new policy, each  air marshal\u2019s total flight days are targeted to not exceed 18 days per  roster period and 200 days annually.", "More rest time after completing extended international missions\u2014Also  in April 2007, FAMS issued guidance to field offices to make every  attempt at increasing rest time for air marshals after completing an  extended international mission. Under this guidance, air marshals  returning from an international mission are to be given a non-flight day  as their next duty day when any one of the following three conditions  apply: (1) the return flight exceeds 10 hours in the air, (2) the flight  crossed the international date line, or (3) the overall mission (round- trip flights plus overnight stays) was 4 days or longer in duration.  Depending on an air marshal\u2019s schedule, a non-flight day could be a  training day, a regular day off, or a non-mission status day.", "More consistent start times\u2014FAMS is currently developing a  modification to its scheduling tool to provide a consistent, defined  scheduling window (encompassing, for example, 3 hours) for air  marshals in mission status to report for duty during a 7-day period.  Under the planned modification, for instance, FAMS schedulers would  assign an air marshal to flights departing during 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.,  9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., or other 3-hour window during the week. FAMS  officials stated that this modification, which is intended to provide  more consistent start times for each air marshal throughout the  applicable week, should be completed and ready for pilot testing by  the middle of calendar year 2009.", "The 67 air marshals we interviewed in 11 field offices generally expressed  satisfaction with the various enhancements to mission scheduling,  although most (43) mentioned that implementation of the mission  exchange program was still evolving.", "To more specifically address the health implications of flight scheduling,  several efforts were recently completed or are planned. For instance, the  Homeland Security Institute conducted a benchmark analysis and  assessment of fatigue issues related to air marshals and issued a report to  FAMS in July 2008. In its analysis, the institute compared FAMS\u2019s  workday rules against other occupations\u2014largely in the aviation realm\u2014 that face challenges involving frequent travel, jet lag, long work hours,  rotating shifts, and the stress of maintaining a schedule across multiple  flights and airports. The Homeland Security Institute noted that although  no other occupation is identical to that of air marshals, meaningful  comparisons were made with similar occupations, such as commercial  airline pilots and cargo pilots and law enforcement officers working in  aviation (e.g., U.S. Marshals Service aviation enforcement officers  responsible for transporting prisoners). In its July 2008 report, the  Homeland Security Institute noted that while stress and fatigue issues are  a part of all organizations and cannot be entirely eliminated, air marshals  are provided considerable blocks of rest within their schedules, when  assessed against similar occupations. Overall, the institute reported that  the results of the benchmark analysis showed that air marshals are  provided above-average time to recuperate from duty days.", "Further, the institute noted that FAMS has taken various steps, including  implementation of the mission exchange program, to improve aspects of  mission scheduling. In addition, in October 2008, FAMS officials informed  us that the agency has funded a contract with the National Institute of  Justice to implement FAMS-specific research regarding mission  scheduling, work-rest cycles, fatigue, and performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "To Further Address Quality-of-Life Issues, the Federal Air Marshal Service Has Implemented a Voluntary Lateral Transfer Program", "paragraphs": ["According to FAMS officials, air marshals frequently cited the need for a  voluntary lateral transfer program during listening group sessions and  dinners with the director. FAMS working groups that examined quality-of- life issues also reported that the agency would benefit from implementing  a transfer program for air marshals to express interest in relocating to  another field office. Thus, in October 2006, FAMS management  implemented a voluntary lateral transfer program. Under the program, an  air marshal in good standing may request a transfer for up to three field  offices, ranked by order of preference, and FAMS management is to make  decisions based on the number of vacancies in each office and the  seniority of air marshals who apply for transfer.", "In December 2006, FAMS announced that 176 air marshals had been  selected, during the first phase of the program, for transfer to new offices  within 60 days. In the second phase, which occurred in the spring of 2007,  FAMS management made transfer offers to 40 air marshals\u2014all of whom  accepted. In the third and most recent phase, which occurred in the spring  of 2008, FAMS management made offers to 48 air marshals\u2014of whom 45  accepted.

The 2007 survey questionnaire consisted of a total of 60  questions that covered 13 topics\u2014senior leadership;  supervisor/management; resources and technology; training and  education; career development; policies and procedures; employee  involvement and autonomy; rewards and recognition; communication;  safety, health, and medical issues; work and family life; organizational  commitment; and job satisfaction. According to FAMS management  officials, the survey provided useful information on quality-of-life and  other issues affecting the ability of air marshals and other agency  personnel to perform their jobs. In addition, the officials reported that  survey results indicated that employees generally were pleased with the  policy changes and other actions implemented by management to address  relevant issues. For example, although the 2007 workforce satisfaction  survey had an overall response rate (46 percent) that constituted less than  half of the FAMS workforce, 79 percent of the respondents indicated that  there had been positive changes from the prior year. Regarding future  plans, FAMS expects to administer a workforce satisfaction survey every 2  years. FAMS officials stated that a purpose of the initial workforce  satisfaction survey was to establish a baseline for use in comparing the  results of future surveys.", "In reviewing the 2007 survey\u2019s implementation and results, we made  several observations that are important for enhancing the potential  usefulness of future surveys. First, as noted previously, the overall  response rate was 46 percent. FAMS officials expressed satisfaction with  this response rate given the highly mobile nature of their workforce. The  FAMS officials also noted that the 46 percent response rate was similar to  the response rates for other federal workforce satisfaction surveys.  However, the 46 percent response rate was substantially less than the 80  percent rate OMB encourages for federal surveys that require its approval.  Although internal workforce surveys such as the one conducted by FAMS  do not require OMB approval, we believe the OMB standards and guidance  provide relevant direction on planning, designing, and implementing high- quality surveys\u2014including the need to obtain a high response rate to  increase the potential that survey responses will accurately represent the  views of the survey population.", "Specifically, the OMB guidance stipulates that agencies must design  surveys to achieve the highest practical rates of response to ensure that  the results are representative of the target population and that they can be  used with confidence as input for informed decision-making. OMB  encourages agencies to obtain at least an 80 percent response rate, and its  guidance states that response rates are an important indicator of the  potential for nonresponse bias, which could affect the accuracy of a  survey\u2019s results. For instance, survey estimates may be biased if the  individuals who choose to participate (respondents) differ substantially  and systematically in some way from those who choose not to participate  (nonrespondents). In general, a higher response rate increases the  likelihood that any bias problem is decreased, resulting in the views and  characteristics of the target population being more accurately reflected in  the survey\u2019s results. Thus, for any federal survey that must be approved by  OMB, applicable guidelines stipulate that an analysis for possible  nonresponse bias must be conducted if the final response rate is less than  80 percent.", "Regarding the 46 percent response rate for the 2007 survey, FAMS  management reported that an analysis of potential nonresponse bias was  conducted by comparing various demographic data provided by the  respondents to the FAMS workforce as a whole. Based on the analysis of  the available demographic data, FAMS concluded that nonresponse bias  did not exist as the respondents were representative of the entire  workforce. Although the analysis conducted by FAMS was a useful effort,  the potential for a nonresponse bias still exists given that over half of the  FAMS workforce did not respond to the survey.", "As noted previously, concerns about nonresponse bias could be avoided or  mitigated by obtaining a higher response rate. FAMS employees were  given 3 weeks (August 23 through September 14, 2007) to complete the  2007 workforce satisfaction survey. According to FAMS management, even  though all employees (not just nonrespondents) were sent four messages  reminding them of the deadline for completing the voluntary survey, the  final overall response rate was 46 percent. We believe that other widely  acknowledged methods, outlined in OMB guidance, could improve the  response rate of future FAMS surveys. These methods include, for  example, promoting awareness of the survey through outreach efforts with  groups of prospective respondents and extending the cut-off date for  responding to the survey. Also, monitoring questionnaire returns and  targeting extra follow-up efforts to air marshals in particular field  locations that have comparatively low response levels could help.", "Additional observations we made in reviewing the 2007 workforce  satisfaction survey\u2019s questionnaire involve the sentence structure of  certain questions and the response options. Generally, any question that  combines two or more issues\u2014but does not provide for separate or  respective answers\u2014can cause uncertainty about how to respond if the  answer to each issue is different. Table 2 lists the seven 2007 workforce  satisfaction survey questions that used these types of sentence structures.  For instance, regarding the senior leadership of FAMS, question 3 cites  two concepts (\u201cvisions\u201d and \u201cinitiatives\u201d), as well as two actions (\u201cshared\u201d  and \u201csupported\u201d) associated with these concepts. However, the response  options did not account for the fact that experiences could be different  with each of these concepts and actions. Similarly, question 10 addresses  the reliability of equipment used by agency personnel and cites four  different devices. However, the response options did not account for the  fact that experiences could be different with each of these devices.", "Also, none of the 60 questions in the 2007 workforce satisfaction survey  provided for response options such as \u201cnot applicable\u201d or \u201cno basis to  judge\u201d\u2014responses that would be appropriate when respondents had little  or no familiarity with the topic in question. Not providing response options  such as \u201cnot applicable\u201d or \u201cno basis to judge\u201d could lead to potentially  misleading question responses. In the interest of being compliant,  respondents might be compelled to give a response, such as \u201cneutral,\u201d to a  question when they actually have no opinion due to either non- applicability or lack of familiarity with the question topic. While it might  be assumed that all individuals being surveyed should be familiar with the  topic of all questions, this might not be the case and will not be known  unless the questionnaire contains the relevant response options. For  example, question 39 (see app. VI), reads as follows: \u201cI am satisfied that  the work-related concerns I address with management are addressed  appropriately.\u201d As written, this sentence assumes that every employee has  raised work-related concerns with management. If a respondent had never  expressed work-related concerns with management, this individual might  not know how to respond, given the question\u2019s existing response options.", "Thus, based on the sentence structure of certain questions and the  response options, the results from the 2007 survey may provide an  incomplete assessment of employees\u2019 perspectives and attitudes to FAMS  management. Regarding our observations on the design of survey  questions and response options, FAMS officials stated that limited  personnel resources precluded investing more time in development of the  survey questionnaire and that the survey had served a useful purpose in  providing information on issues of concern to be more fully explored  through other communication processes or initiatives. Nonetheless, in  developing future survey instruments, designing questions to avoid these  types of ambiguities could provide FAMS management with information  that is more focused and complete. Although we recognize that FAMS has  a variety of other processes and initiatives\u2014in addition to the customer  satisfaction survey\u2014for identifying and addressing workforce issues,  customer satisfaction surveys can be particularly useful given that they are  distributed to all employees and provide for anonymity of respondents.

Involving employees in the planning process helps agencies to  develop goals and objectives that incorporate frontline insights and  perspectives about operations. Further, such involvement can also serve  to increase employees\u2019 understanding and acceptance of organization  goals and objectives and improve motivation and morale. Our work has  shown that leading organizations commonly sought their employees\u2019 input  on a periodic basis and used that input to adjust their human capital  approaches. Among other means, the organizations collected feedback by  convening focus groups, providing opportunities for employees to  participate in working groups or task forces, and conducting employee  satisfaction surveys.", "As discussed earlier in this report, FAMS has implemented a variety of  processes and initiatives to address workforce issues by soliciting the  views of front-line staff across the agency.
