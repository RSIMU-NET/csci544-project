Because $246.5 million of that request has not been justified on the basis of analytical data or derived using a verifiable estimating method, we believe that Congress should consider reducing the administration\u2019s request by that amount.

Each of these areas are important to good customer service and are in need of improvement. \u2022 Each year, IRS submits detailed budget estimates to support the administration\u2019s budget request. The utility of this information for oversight purposes is limited because (1) the intermingling of enforcement and assistance resources within various budget activities precludes an assessment of the balance between those two areas; (2) periodic restructuring of IRS\u2019 appropriations and the budget activities within those appropriations hinders long-term trend analyses; and (3) the estimates provide inadequate information on the resources being devoted to critical areas, such as the Year 2000 effort and the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office. \u2022 One aspect of IRS\u2019 budget estimates that has improved over the years involves the use of performance measures. However, there is still much work to be done and many challenges to overcome. These challenges include (1) developing a reliable measure of taxpayer burden, including the portion that IRS can influence; (2) developing measures that can be used to compare the effectiveness of IRS\u2019 various customer service programs; and (3) refining or developing new measures that gauge the quality of the services provided. \u2022 Data on the first 2 1/2 months of the 1998 filing season indicate that IRS is continuing to make progress in two important areas\u2014the use of electronic filing and the ability of taxpayers to reach IRS by telephone.

Assessments for the two other tiers and telecommunications systems, not all of which are under the control of the Chief Information Officer, started late and were delayed, in part, because IRS did not have a complete inventory for these areas. Since receiving its fiscal year 1998 appropriation, IRS has been trying to complete its inventory and refine its cost estimates for these information systems areas as well as for non-information systems, such as building facilities and security. Thus far in fiscal year 1998, IRS has (1) reallocated funds among the spending categories identified in the fiscal year 1998 appropriation, (2) identified specific needs for the $42 million initially set aside for contingencies, and (3) identified additional needs of about $60 to $70 million that are not yet funded.

The $3.2 billion and 46,130 FTEs being requested for that appropriation include an unspecified amount of money and FTEs for various forms of assistance, including walk-in service, taxpayer education efforts, and problem resolution. The $143 million and 2,184 FTEs being requested for the EIC compliance initiative, which we discuss in more detail later, also involve a mix of assistance and enforcement, but, again, that mix is not apparent in IRS\u2019 budget estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Restructuring Hinders Trend Analyses", "paragraphs": ["It is often useful, in assessing agency operations, to analyze trends over several years.

Another restructuring seems likely if and when the Commissioner\u2019s proposed reorganization becomes reality.", "We are not taking issue with the changes IRS made for fiscal year 1998 or with the need to restructure in general. Our intent is to point out how restructuring can hinder the ability to conduct long-term trend analyses. For example, IRS established a new budget activity in fiscal year 1998 called Telephone and Correspondence, which was formed by merging pieces from the Taxpayer Services budget activity, which was discontinued, and the Examination and Collection budget activities, which were retained in reconfigured forms. When IRS restructured its budget activities for fiscal year 1998, it recalculated its fiscal year 1997 accounts to be compatible with the new structure. However, years before 1997 are not compatible with the new structure, making long-term analyses difficult. For example, it would be of little value to compare IRS\u2019 request for the Examination budget activity in fiscal year 1999 with the actual figures for that activity in fiscal year 1996 because the 1999 version of that activity includes certain programs (such as Taxpayer Education) that were not part of the 1996 version and excludes programs (such as Service Center Correspondence) that were part of the 1996 version.", "Even with restructuring, long-term analysis could still be possible if there was adequate detail behind the various budget activities.

IRS\u2019 budget estimates do not accurately reflect the level of resources being devoted to problem resolution. In addition, concerns about independence may be exacerbated by the way IRS funds the work of the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office.", "According to IRS, the fiscal year 1999 budget request includes about $38 million and 628 FTEs for the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office, an increase of about $14 million and 191 FTEs over the proposed operating level in fiscal year 1998. Those resources are not separately identified in IRS\u2019 budget estimates but are included within the Telephone and Correspondence budget activity. Even if those resources were separately identified, they would significantly understate the level of resources IRS has been allocating and plans to allocate to activities of the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office. That is because many of the staff who work PRP cases and who participate in Problem Solving Days are funded by other functions, such as Examination and Collection. In that regard, according to a January 1998 report by the Taxpayer Advocate, his resources for fiscal year 1998 are being supplemented by more than 1,000 other field employees, on either a full or part-time basis. We believe that oversight of the operations of the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s Office would be enhanced if (1) the Office were given more visibility in IRS\u2019 budget structure and (2) IRS\u2019 budget estimates provided complete information on the amount of resources being devoted to those operations.", "A more fundamental question, however, is whether the Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s independence is compromised in any way by the need to rely on other functions for needed staff.

As IRS acknowledges, there is still much work to be done in that area.", "IRS\u2019 budget estimates for fiscal year 1999 include numerous performance measures, some of which have yet to be developed. The budget estimates include a brief description of each measure and, for those that have been developed, provide such information as the source and reliability of data used to compile the measure. Tracking performance measures over time is not always possible because some are added or dropped each year and others are revised. These kinds of changes are to be expected as IRS gets input from Congress and other stakeholders and learns more about how to measure its performance. In its fiscal year 1999 budget estimates, for example, IRS lists 16 discontinued performance measures, some of which were dropped in response to congressional concern about an undue emphasis on enforcement results.", "IRS has a three-tiered system of performance measures. At the highest (mission) level, IRS has a mission effectiveness indicator intended to measure the agency\u2019s overall performance in collecting the proper amount of tax revenue at the least cost or burden to the government and the taxpayer. The second (strategic) level of indicators is intended to gauge IRS\u2019 progress in meeting its strategic objectives to improve customer service, increase taxpayer compliance, and increase productivity. According to IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 budget estimates, for example, IRS has four indicators and plans to develop two others to gauge its progress in improving customer service. The four existing indicators are (1) taxpayer burden cost for IRS to collect $100, (2) initial contact resolution rate for taxpayer inquiries, (3) toll-free telephone level of access, and (4) tax law accuracy rate for taxpayer inquiries. The two indicators IRS plans to develop are (1) customer satisfaction rates and (2) employee satisfaction rate. The third (program) level of indicators is intended to measure the accomplishments of specific IRS programs or operations. For example, IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 budget estimates include 18 program-level customer service measures, covering such things as refund timeliness, number of telephone calls answered, the quality of PRP cases, and the number of walk-in service contacts. (See app. III for a list of all of the performance measures in IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 budget estimates and a comparison of those measures for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.)", "IRS faces some difficult challenges as it strives to improve its performance measurement system. We discussed some of those challenges in a recent report to the Subcommittee on measuring customer service. As noted in that report, key challenges facing IRS include (1) developing a reliable measure of taxpayer burden, including the portion that IRS can influence; (2) developing measures that can be used to compare the effectiveness of the various customer service programs; and (3) refining or developing new measures that gauge the quality of the services provided. Measuring burden is especially difficult. IRS currently measures burden by using a model that estimates the time taxpayers spend on each tax form. As such, the measure excludes the burden taxpayers face after they file their tax returns, such as the time and costs incurred in responding to IRS notices and audits. Flaws in the burden measure also limit the usefulness of IRS\u2019 mission effectiveness indicator, because burden is a key component of that indicator. IRS recognizes the limitations of its burden measure and is looking for alternatives.", "Devising ways to measure the burden that IRS influences and overcoming the other challenges our report identified will not be easy. IRS is faced with devising reliable measures that are useful in improving agency and program performance, improving accountability, and supporting policy decisionmaking. At the same time, IRS is faced with making decisions on how to minimize the costs of collecting data and measuring results over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim Data on the 1998 Filing Season Show Continued Improvement in Two Important Areas", "paragraphs": ["it is too early to assess the results of this year\u2019s efforts, we do have some preliminary observations on two parts of the initiative."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Use of Electronic Filing Continues to Increase", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 3, as of March 13, 1998, IRS had received 23.4 percent more electronic returns than at the same time last year.
