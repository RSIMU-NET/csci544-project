Operation and maintenance (O&M) funding is considered one of the major components of funding for readiness. O&M appropriations fund the training, supply, and equipment maintenance of military units as well as the infrastructure of military bases. Over the past several years, DOD has increasingly used contractors, rather than uniformed or DOD civilian personnel, to provide O&M services in areas such as logistics, base operations support, information technology services, and administrative support. The House Appropriations Committee directed GAO to examine growing O&M costs and support services contracting. This GAO report (1) identifies the trends in O&M costs and services contracts and the reasons for the trends, (2) discusses whether increased services contracting has exacerbated the growth of O&M costs, and (3) provides perspectives on the benefits and concerns associated with increased contracting for support services. GAO analyzed DOD's O&M appropriations, budgets, and services contract costs over a 10-year period and developed case studies of outsourced O&M-related work at three installations. GAO is not making any recommendations. DOD made only technical comments on a draft of this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's O&M and services contract costs increased substantially between fiscal years 1995 and 2005, with most growth occurring since fiscal year 2001. DOD's O&M costs were almost constant between fiscal years 1995 and 2000. However, between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, DOD's O&M costs increased from $133.4 billion to $209.5 billion--an increase of $76.1 billion, or 57 percent, in constant fiscal year 2007 dollars. This growth was primarily caused by increased military operations associated with the global war on terrorism and other contingencies. In addition to increased O&M costs, DOD has increasingly relied on contractors to perform O&M-related work. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, DOD's services contract costs in O&M-related areas increased by 73 percent. According to DOD and service officials, several factors have contributed to the increased use of contractors for support services: (1) increased O&M requirements from the global war on terrorism and other contingencies, which DOD has met without an increase in active duty and civilian personnel, (2) federal government policy, which is to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services that are not inherently governmental in nature, and (3) DOD initiatives, such as its competitive sourcing and utility privatization programs. Sufficient data are not available to determine whether increased services contracting has caused DOD's costs to be higher than they would have been had the contracted activities been performed by uniformed or DOD civilian personnel. Because existing policy generally does not require a public/private competition for contractor performance of a new or expanded commercial requirement, in-house cost estimates have not been prepared for most of the work awarded to contractors as a result of increased O&M requirements from expanded military operations. Without this information, an overall determination cannot be made of the effect of increased services contracting on O&M cost growth. DOD does maintain data from its competitive sourcing, or A-76, program. GAO's analysis of the military services' reported information on 538 A-76 decisions during fiscal years 1995 through 2005 to contract out work formerly performed by uniformed and DOD civilian personnel showed that the decisions generally resulted in reducing the government's costs for the work. However, the number of A-76 public/private competition contracts is relatively small and the results from this program may not be representative of the results from all services contracts for new or expanded O&M work. Although DOD officials have cited certain benefits from increased use of contractors for support services, such as allowing more uniformed personnel to be available for combat missions, concerns have also been cited. For example, Congress recently required DOD to prescribe guidelines giving consideration to performing more work using government employees and GAO has noted concerns over DOD's approach to services acquisition."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) spent about $210 billion, or 40 percent  The Department of Defense (DOD) spent about $210 billion, or 40 percent  of the total defense budget, to operate and maintain the nation\u2019s military  of the total defense budget, to operate and maintain the nation\u2019s military  forces in fiscal year 2005.

However, the officials also stated that other factors have contributed to  the growth in O&M costs, such as the aging of military infrastructure and  equipment; increased costs for installation security, antiterrorism force  protection, communications, information technology, transportation, and  utilities; and certain changes in acquisition approaches.", "The fight against terrorism has resulted in operations and deployments  around the globe that are in addition to the usual peacetime operations.  According to DOD, the related costs have included not only the personnel  costs associated with mobilizing National Guard and reserve forces but  also the costs of supporting these forces and the increased pace of  operations. O&M-funded costs include a wide range of activities and  services supporting operations including costs related to   (1) predeployment and forward-deployed training of units and personnel;  (2) personnel support costs including travel, subsistence, reserve  component personnel activation and deactivation costs, and unit-level  morale, welfare, and recreation; (3) establishment, maintenance, and  operation of housing and dining facilities and camps in the theaters of  operation; (4) petroleum, oils and lubricants, spare parts, consumable end  items, and other items necessary to support the deployment of air, ground,  and naval units; (5) establishment, maintenance, and operation of facilities  including funds for roads, water, supply, fire protection, hazardous waste  disposal, force protection bunkers and barricades; (6) command, control,  communications, computers and intelligence within the contingency areas  of operations; (7) organization-level maintenance including repairs to  equipment and vehicles; (8) intermediate- and depot-level maintenance of  weapons and weapon system platforms requiring service after the wear  and tear of combat operations; and (9) contracts for services for logistics  and infrastructure support to deployed forces.", "The additional military costs associated with GWOT and other  contingencies have been primarily funded through supplemental  appropriations. Figure 5 shows the annual amount of supplemental O&M  funds appropriated each year from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year  2005. During this period, supplemental O&M appropriations totaled about  $210 billion and, according to the services, additional amounts were  transferred or reprogrammed from other accounts to the O&M accounts of  the military services.", "Although costs associated with the GWOT and other contingencies have  been the primary reason for increased O&M costs between fiscal years  2000 and 2005, other factors also contributed to the O&M cost growth in  the military services. To illustrate, if the services\u2019 annual O&M total  obligation authority is adjusted by removing annual supplemental O&M  appropriations and net transfers and reprogrammings into the O&M  account, the result shows that O&M costs still grew during this time  period, as illustrated in figure 6. Specifically, between fiscal years 2000 and  2005, O&M costs after the adjustment grew by about 44 percent in the  Army, 17 percent in the Navy and Marine Corps, and 2 percent in the Air  Force.", "According to service officials, baseline O&M costs have increased between  fiscal years 2000 and 2005 because of many factors, such as aging of  military infrastructure and equipment, and increased costs for installation  security, antiterrorism force protection, communications, information  technology, transportation, and utilities. Navy officials particularly cited  the implementation of DOD\u2019s utility privatization program as a factor  contributing to increased O&M costs. In a September 2006 report, we  noted that DOD\u2019s utility costs could potentially increase by another $954  million to pay costs associated with remaining utility systems that might  be privatized. Increased O&M costs are also attributable to certain  changes in DOD\u2019s acquisition approaches. For example, the Air Force  historically bought space launch vehicles, such as the Delta and Titan  rockets, as products paid for with procurement appropriations. Now,  under the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program, the Air Force  uses O&M appropriations to purchase launch services using contractor- owned launch vehicles. The projected cost of this program is $28 billion.  Further, as we noted in our September 2006 report, the Army and the Air  Force turned to service contracts for simulator training primarily because  efforts to modernize existing simulator hardware and software had lost  out in the competition for procurement funds. As a result, the simulators  were becoming increasingly obsolete. Buying training as a service meant  that O&M funds could be used instead of procurement funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Reliance on Contractors for Support Services Has Increased since Fiscal Year 2000 for Several Reasons", "paragraphs": ["To meet military requirements during a period of increased operations  without an increase in active duty and civilian personnel, DOD has relied  not only on reserve personnel activations but also on increased use of  contractor support in areas such as management and administrative  services, information technology services, medical services, and weapon  systems and base operations support. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005,  DOD\u2019s service contract costs in O&M-related areas increased over $40  billion, or 73 percent. Table 1 highlights the growth in several service  contract categories.", "DOD officials noted several factors that have contributed to DOD\u2019s  increased use of contractor support. First, the GWOT and other  contingencies have significantly increased O&M requirements and DOD  has met these requirements without an increase in active duty and civilian  personnel. To do this, DOD relied not only on reserve personnel  activations, but also on increased use of contractor support.", "Second, Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 notes that the  long-standing policy of the federal government has been to rely on the  private sector for needed commercial services and that commercial  activities should be subject to the forces of competition to ensure that the  American people receive maximum value for their tax dollars. The  circular notes that a public/private competition\u2014which can involve a  lengthy and costly process\u2014is not required for contractor performance of  a new requirement or private sector performance of a segregable  expansion of an existing commercial activity. On the other hand, the  circular states that before government personnel may perform a new  requirement or an expansion of an existing commercial activity a  public/private competition is required to determine whether government  personnel should perform the work.", "Third, DOD initiatives that have required that consideration be given to  outsourcing certain work performed by uniformed and DOD civilian  personnel have resulted in outsourcing decisions. For example, between  fiscal years 1995 and 2005, DOD\u2019s competitive sourcing, or A-76  public/private competition, program resulted in 570 decisions to contract  out work that had been performed by over 39,000 uniformed and DOD  civilian personnel. Also, in 1997, DOD decided that privatization of military  installation utility systems was the preferred method for improving utility  systems and services because privatization would allow installations to  benefit from private sector financing and efficiencies. As of March 2006,  DOD had awarded contracts to privatize 117 systems and had an  additional 904 systems in various phases of the privatization evaluation  and solicitation process.", "Fourth, service officials noted that in some instances certain personnel  issues tend to favor the use of contractor support. For example, service  officials stated that because of limitations on headquarters personnel  authorizations, the use of contractor support is often the only readily  available option to accomplish new or expanded commercial work  requirements at service headquarters. Service officials also noted that it is  generally easier to terminate or not renew a contract than to lay off  government employees in the event of reduced work requirements. For  this reason, use of contractor support is often favored when there is  uncertainty over the length of time that support services will be needed,  which is the case for some work supporting GWOT and other  contingencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Are Insufficient to Determine Whether Increased Services Contracting Has Exacerbated O&M Cost Growth", "paragraphs": ["Sufficient data are not available to determine whether increased services  contracting has caused DOD\u2019s costs to be higher than they would have  been had the contracted activities been performed by uniformed or DOD  civilian personnel.

Specifically,  DOD\u2019s A-76 program data include in-house and contract cost information  on contracts for work formerly performed by uniformed or DOD civilian  personnel that were awarded to the private sector as a result of a  public/private cost competition or, under certain conditions prior to May  2003, direct conversion to contractor performance. As shown in table 2, of  the 1,112 total A-76 public/private competition decisions that were made  between fiscal years 1995 and 2005, the military services decided to  outsource the work in 570, or 51 percent, of the cases. These decisions  resulted in contracting out the work formerly performed by over 39,000  uniformed and DOD civilian personnel.

Our analysis of these data showed that the  public/private competition decisions generally resulted in reducing the  government\u2019s costs for the work. Specifically, according to data reported  during the first contract performance period, the Army estimated savings  of about $33 million from 96 contracts, the Navy and Marine Corps  estimated savings of about $74 million from 88 contracts, and the Air  Force estimated savings of about $115 million from 354 contracts.  Figures 7, 8, and 9 show each service\u2019s reported A-76 outsourcing  information for contracts resulting from both public/private competitions  and direct conversion from government to contractor performance  between fiscal years 1995 and 2005.", "Although the services\u2019 A-76 data show that decisions to outsource work  were cost-effective, several limitations are associated with the use of this  information. First, DOD officials noted that when work performed by  uniformed personnel is outsourced, the personnel generally are assigned  to other duties. Thus, while the cost to perform the outsourced work may  be less than when it was performed in-house, the overall cost to the  government may actually increase because the uniformed personnel  continue to be paid to perform different work and a contractor is now paid  to do the work formerly performed by the uniformed personnel. Also,  outsourcing of work formerly performed by uniformed personnel may also  increase O&M costs because military personnel appropriations are used to  compensate uniformed personnel and O&M appropriations are used to pay  contractors for services work.", "Second, compared to all O&M-related contracts, the number of A-76  public/private competition contracts is small and the results from this  program may not be representative of the results from all services  contracts for new or expanded O&M work. For example, for the 538 A-76  outsourcing decisions for fiscal years 1995 through 2005 with reported  cost data, the total contract value for the first performance period was  about $1.2 billion. Yet, in fiscal year 2005 alone, the value of DOD\u2019s O&M- related services contracts exceeded $95 billion.", "Third, the available A-76 public/private competition information compares  the contract costs with the cost estimates for work using government  employees during the first contract performance period. Our review of  contract costs in subsequent performance periods showed that contractor  costs frequently grew and in many cases exceeded the government  employee cost estimate in subsequent periods. However, according to  DOD cost information, the cost growth was usually attributed to  requirements being added to the contract and contract wage increases,  which the government employee cost estimate did not reflect. As a result,  information is normally not available to determine whether the  outsourcing continued to be cost-effective for those contracts that  subsequently cost more than the estimate using government employees.", "Fourth, the reliability of the services\u2019 reported A-76 public/private  competition contract costs and savings appears questionable. The DOD  Inspector General reported in November 2005 that DOD had not  effectively implemented a system to track and assess costs of performance  under the A-76 program. The report stated that because system users did  not always maintain supporting documentation for key data elements and  entered inaccurate and unsupported costs, and the military services used  different methodologies to calculate baseline costs, DOD\u2019s A-76 database  included inaccurate and unsupported costs, and as a result, reported costs  and estimated savings may be either overstated or understated. DOD  officials noted that, while the estimated savings may be either overstated  or understated, there were still savings and that DOD was in the process of  addressing the report\u2019s recommendations for improving the tracking  system.", "During our visits to Fort Hood, Naval Air Station Pensacola, and Langley  Air Force Base, we reviewed the accuracy of reported cost information on  contracts awarded as a result of A-76 public/private competitions.  According to information provided by Fort Hood officials, we found that  actual contract costs were greater than the costs reported in the DOD A-76  database for one contract. However, the difference was less than 1  percent. At Naval Air Station Pensacola, there were no differences in the  costs reported in the A-76 database and the actual costs for eight contracts  awarded as a result of A-76 competitions. At Langley Air Force Base, we  found some differences in the reported and actual costs for four contracts  awarded as a result of A-76 competitions. For the four contracts over 4  years, the actual contract costs, according to installation officials, were  about $250,000, or 5 percent, more than reported in the database.

According to installation officials, the outsourcing of work formerly  performed in-house had not resulted in any unexpected funding or other  consequences. Officials at each installation stated that their outsourcing  efforts had resulted in reduced costs for performing the work and that  they were satisfied with contractor performance. The following examples  illustrate the outsourcing results from specific cases of work formerly  performed in-house at the three installations we visited and in general  show that the outsourcing efforts appeared to be cost-effective.", "In June 2000, as a result of an A-76 public/private competition, Fort Hood  contracted the operation and maintenance of the installation\u2019s firing range.  During the A-76 competition, the cost estimate to continue performing the  work in-house was $37.1 million over the 4-year and 7-month total  performance period. The estimate was based on using 118 civilian and 11  military personnel to do the work. The work was awarded to a contractor  who bid $30.8 million to perform the work. Fort Hood officials stated that  between the time of the contract solicitation and the time the contractor  took over range operations, changes occurred in unit training events and  range operating standards which caused the work requirement to increase  far above the level included in the solicitation\u2019s statement of work. As a  result, the officials stated that the contract was modified to provide for the  increased workload and actual contract costs totaled $38.2 million through  the end of the total performance period in December 2004. Although the  contract costs exceeded the in-house estimate by $1.1 million, or 3  percent, Fort Hood officials stated that they were confident that the  outsourcing was cost-effective because the in-house cost estimate would  have exceeded the actual contract costs if the in-house estimate had  included the cost of the workload subsequently added to the contract. The  officials also stated that they were satisfied with the contractor\u2019s  performance.", "In January 2003, Fort Hood contracted the installation\u2019s ammunition  supply work because the uniformed personnel who formerly performed  the work at Fort Hood were needed to help support the GWOT. According  to installation officials, the work, which included the receipt, storage, and  issue of training ammunition, had historically been performed by  approximately 180 uniformed personnel, who were also responsible for  completing collateral military duties. The officials stated that the work  was converted to contractor performance by modifying an existing Fort  Hood support services contract to add the ammunition supply work for  about $1.8 million annually. According to the officials, the contractor used  between 45 and 56 people to do the work, and performance metrics, such  as inventory accuracy, improved after the contractor took over the work.  Although an analysis was not performed to compare the contract cost with  the cost to perform the work with uniformed personnel, Fort Hood  officials stated that they believe that the outsourcing was cost-effective  because the contractor was performing the work with far fewer people  compared to the number of uniformed personnel who formerly did the  work. The officials stated that a new contract for the work was awarded in  June 2006 at an annual cost of about $2.3 million. The officials attributed  the increase in contract costs to new requirements that were added to the  scope of the work.", "In January 2001, as a result of an A-76 public/private competition, Naval  Air Station Pensacola contracted the installation\u2019s receipt, storage, and  distribution of petroleum, oil, and lubrication products. The work had  previously been performed by 14 civilian personnel at an estimated annual  cost of about $700,000.

Our report noted that in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks,  DOD sent numerous active-duty, U.S.-based personnel to Afghanistan,  Iraq, and other destinations to support the GWOT. These deployments  depleted the pool of military security guards at a time when DOD was  faced with increased security requirements at its U.S. installations. To ease  this imbalance, the Congress authorized DOD to waive a prohibition  against the use of contract security guards at domestic military  installations. The Army, the first service to use the authority, had awarded  contracts worth nearly $733 million for contract guards at 57 installations  as of December 2005.", "Our report also noted that the Army had relied heavily on sole-source  contracts to acquire contract security guards, despite the Army\u2019s  recognition early on that it was paying considerably more for its sole- source contracts than for those awarded competitively.

In regard to comparing  the costs of government-employed and contract security guards, DOD  reported that the contract security guards were more expensive than use  of government guards. However, the amount of the cost difference varied  widely depending on whether the contract was awarded competitively. In  cases where the contracts were awarded competitively, the contracts cost  about 5 percent more than use of government guards. However, in cases  where the contracts were not awarded competitively; the contracts cost  about 42 percent more than government guards.

In certain circumstances, the officials stated that increased  use of contractor support to help meet expanded mission support work  has certain benefits. For example, the officials noted that the use of  contractors can provide a force multiplier effect when contractor  personnel perform military support missions to allow more uniformed  personnel to be available for combat missions. Moreover, contractors can  provide support capabilities that are in short supply in the active and  reserve components, thus reducing the frequency and duration of  deployments for certain uniformed personnel. The officials also stated that  obtaining contractor support in some instances can be faster than hiring  government workers and, when there is uncertainty over the length of  time that support services will be needed, the use of contractor support  instead of government employees can be advantageous because it is  generally easier to terminate or not renew a contract than to lay off  government employees when the operations return to normal.

Further, DOD\u2019s approach did not  always take the necessary steps to ensure customer needs were translated  into well-defined contract requirements or that postcontract award  activities resulted in expected outcomes. As a result, DOD was potentially  exposed to a variety of risks, including purchasing services that did not  fully meet customer needs or that should have been provided in a different  manner or with better results. Also, in January 2007 testimony before the  Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, Senate Committee  on Armed Services, we noted that long-standing problems with contract  management continue to adversely affect service acquisition outcomes  even as DOD has become more reliant on contractors to provide services  for DOD\u2019s operations. For example, the lack of sound business  practices\u2014poorly defined requirements, inadequate competition, and  inadequate monitoring of contractor performance\u2014exposes DOD to  unnecessary risk and wastes resources. We have found cases in which the  absence of well-defined requirements and clearly understood objectives  complicates efforts to hold DOD and contractors accountable for poor  service acquisition outcomes. Likewise, obtaining reasonable prices  depends on the benefits of a competitive environment, but we have  reported on cases in which DOD sacrificed competition for the sake of  expediency.

While we believe that there may be some merit in DOD  developing more information on the cost-effectiveness of its O&M services  contracts that fall outside of the A-76 public/private competition process,  at this time we are not recommending that DOD do this for several  reasons. First, performing the analyses to determine the estimated in- house costs to perform work awarded to contractors can be expensive and  time consuming. Second, according to DOD officials, contracting with the  private sector may be the only alternative to meet certain requirements in  the short term, such as when uniformed personnel must be diverted from  performing peacetime work to supporting operational missions.
