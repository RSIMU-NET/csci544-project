GAO was asked to (1) investigate the extent to which companies that received federal contracts during fiscal year 2009 had been assessed the 50 largest monetary penalties for closed inspections of occupational safety, health, and wage regulations for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, and (2) develop case studies of federal contractors that have been assessed occupational safety, health, wage, and collective bargaining penalties. To perform this work, GAO obtained and analyzed concluded wage and health and safety inspections from the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for fiscal years 2005 to 2009. GAO also obtained labor union organization and bargaining violations from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

GAO did not evaluate whether federal agencies considered or should have considered these violations in the awarding of federal contracts, thus no conclusions on that topic can be drawn from this analysis. Of the 50 largest WHD wage assessments during fiscal years 2005 through 2009, 25 wage assessments were made against 20 companies that received federal contracts in fiscal year 2009. From GAO's analysis of OSHA data, GAO also found that 8 of the 50 largest workplace health and safety penalties assessed during the same time frame of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 were assessed against 7 other companies that received federal contracts in fiscal year 2009. Because OSHA and WHD databases do not contain Data Universal Numbering System numbers, GAO's analysis was limited to the 50 largest WHD assessments and OSHA penalties, which GAO manually searched. Because of this, the full extent of the federal government's contracts awarded to companies cited for labor violations is not known. GAO investigated 15 federal contractors cited for violating federal labor laws enforced by WHD, OSHA, and NLRB. The federal government awarded these 15 federal contractors over $6 billion in government contract obligations during fiscal year 2009. Several of these companies also had other types of violations, such as hiring undocumented workers, violating environmental standards, and fraudulently billing Medicare and Medicaid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, the federal government obligated over $500 billion on  government contracts. Some in Congress are concerned that private  companies may be awarded federal contracts even though they have  violated federal laws that are meant to ensure that employees receive  proper wages, have the right to bargain collectively, and are not subject to  work-site hazards that could result in physical injury or death.", "On the basis of your concerns regarding the federal government awarding  contracts to companies with past large labor penalties and assessments, as  requested we (1) investigated the extent to which companies that received  federal contracts during fiscal year 2009 had been assessed the 50 largest  monetary penalties for closed inspections of occupational safety, health,  and wage regulations for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, and (2) developed  case studies of federal contractors that have been assessed occupational  safety, health, wage, and collective-bargaining penalties. As part of your  request, we also determined whether these case-study firms provide health  insurance to their employees.", "To determine the number of large penalties involving citations for  violating occupational safety and health regulations that had been  assessed in fiscal years 2005 through 2009 against federal contractors that  received contracts during fiscal year 2009, we obtained from the  Department of Labor (Labor) a listing of all occupational safety and health  penalties that had been assessed and closed by the Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. We  also obtained from Labor a listing of all wage assessments made by  Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) for this same period. For each of  these listings, we identified the 50 largest monetary penalty assessments  made by OSHA and the 50 highest monetary back-wage assessments made  by WHD. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not issue fines  or assessments against companies that violate collective bargaining laws.  As such, we could not perform this analysis on the largest violations of  collective bargaining laws. To determine whether those companies with  violations received federal contracts during fiscal year 2009, we searched  the contract data using the company\u2019s name from the Federal  Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to determine  whether those companies received federal contracts. However, the name- matching process was sometimes imprecise because contractor names can  vary widely due to such factors as name combinations and  parent/subsidiary relationships. Nevertheless, this was generally the only  viable method available for identifying contractors involved in these cases  because Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers were not  available. Therefore, due to name variations, we likely did not identify all  of the contractors involved in the cases in the databases maintained by  WHD and OSHA. To ensure that the federal contracts were significant, we  excluded companies that received obligations of $100,000 or less during  fiscal year 2009.", "For our case studies, we identified 15 cases that represent the types of  labor-law violation citations that occur in various industries. To develop  case studies, we analyzed fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2009 wage,  health, and safety data from Labor and also obtained labor union  organization and bargaining violations data from NLRB. We restricted our  analysis to those cases that have been settled or adjudicated and where  the company had received over $100,000 in federal contract obligations  during fiscal year 2009. In addition, we restricted our analysis to those  WHD assessments of at least $100,000 and OSHA fines of at least $25,000.  For our nine cases that have OSHA settlement agreements, because there  was no adjudication and because these agreements generally contain  language whereby the company denies violating labor standards, there is  no adjudicated violation. For each case study, we reviewed inspections,  settlement agreements, and other relevant documents that are related to  the cited violations. We also searched public records and other sources to  determine whether there have been any other citations for potential  criminal or civil activities. We also interviewed management officials from  those companies to determine the extent to which employees receive  health insurance. We did not make inquiries with contracting officers to  determine the extent to which labor law violation citations were  considered or should have been considered in the award of federal  contracts because it was beyond the scope of this investigation.", "Our analysis and investigations did not include companies with labor  citations that had not been closed by OSHA, WHD, or NLRB through fiscal  year 2009. For example, OSHA had proposed fines of over $55 million for a  large petroleum company for cases opened between fiscal years 2005 and  2009. A large portion of the fines were assessed as a result of OSHA\u2019s  safety and health inspections in 2005 after a massive refinery explosion  where there were 15 deaths and almost 200 injuries. The firm\u2019s parent  company received over $2 billion in federal contract obligations during  fiscal year 2009. In addition, OSHA had also proposed fines of about $8.7  million as a result of inspections at a sugar refining company that were  opened in fiscal year 2008. Five million dollars of these fines are related to  a refinery factory explosion where there were 14 deaths and injuries to  dozens of other workers. The federal government obligated about $6.5  million on federal contracts with this firm during fiscal year 2009.", "We analyzed OSHA and WHD databases and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for purposes of our audit and investigative work. To  determine the reliability of the databases, we analyzed selected case-file  information to ensure that specific data elements matched those found in  the databases. We also performed electronic testing to determine the  reasonableness of specific data elements in the databases that we used to  perform our work. We also determined that the FPDS-NG was sufficiently  reliable for this review by confirming the companies had federal contracts  with selected company officials and other sources.", "We conducted the work for this investigation from April 2010 through  September 2010 in accordance with the standards prescribed by the  Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)  are responsible for enforcing many of the country\u2019s most comprehensive  federal labor laws ranging from occupational health and safety to  minimum wage, overtime pay, and the rights of employees to bargain  collectively with their employers.", "Most private sector firms\u2014regardless of whether they are federal  contractors\u2014must comply with safety and health standards issued under  the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

If  employers refuse to pay the back wages and any penalties assessed, WHD  officials, with the assistance of attorneys from Labor\u2019s Office of the  Solicitor, may pursue the cases in court. When WHD finds violations under  the Government Contract statutes, which includes the SCA, DBA, and  Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, the agency may pursue  administrative action to recover wage and benefit payments and to debar  the contractor from future federal contracts.  WHD may also request that  the federal agency withhold contract payments to protect the back wages  and benefits and may request that the federal agency terminate a contract.", "The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is the primary federal law  governing relations between labor unions and employers in the private  sector and is administered by the NLRB. Under Section 8 of the act, it is  illegal for employers to interfere with workers\u2019 right to organize or bargain  collectively or for employers to discriminate in hiring, tenure, or condition  of employment in order to discourage membership in any labor  organization, and such behavior is defined as an unfair labor practice.  After concluding that a violation has been committed, the board typically  requires firms to cease and desist the specific conduct for which an unfair  labor practice is found. The board may order a variety of remedies,  including requiring the firm to reinstate unlawfully fired workers or  restore wages and benefits to the bargaining unit. In some cases, the board  will also issue a broad cease and desist order prohibiting the firm from  engaging in a range of unlawful conduct. If an employer to whom the  federal government owes money (such as a federal contractor) has failed  to comply with an order by the board to restore wages or benefits, the  government has the option of withholding from any amount owed to that  employer (including payments under a federal contract) any equal or  lesser amount that the contractor owes under the board order.", "By statute, federal agencies are required to award contracts only to  \u201cresponsible\u201d sources.
