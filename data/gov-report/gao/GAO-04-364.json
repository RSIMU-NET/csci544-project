These uses encompassed a broad range of activities, such as converting manual records to automated formats and purchasing equipment to implement computerized systems or upgrade existing systems. All other uses of program grants, according to BJS, also had either direct or indirect relevance to building an infrastructure of nationally accessible records. Using their own funds, in addition to the program and other federal grants, states have made progress in automating criminal history records and making them accessible nationally. The percentage of the nation's criminal history records that are automated increased from 79 percent in 1993 to 89 percent in 2001, according to BJS's most recent data. Also, the number of states participating in the Interstate Identification Index--a \"pointer system\" to locate criminal history records anywhere in the country--increased from 26 at year-end 1993 to 45 by May 2003. But, progress has been more limited for some NICS-related purposes. A national system for domestic violence misdemeanor records is not available. Also, as of May 2003, only 10 states had made mental health records available to NICS, and only 3 states had provided substance abuse records. One of the most relevant factors for policymakers to consider when debating the future of the program is the extent of cumulative progress (and shortfalls) to date in creating national, automated systems. While states have made progress, more work remains. Also, the demand for background checks is growing, and technology is not static, which necessitates periodic upgrades or replacements of automated systems. Continued progress toward establishing and sustaining a national infrastructure inherently will involve long-term commitments from all governmental levels.

Typically, a criminal history record is created for  each individual offender (each \u201csubject\u201d). The record is to contain relevant  identifiers (including fingerprints) and information about all arrests and  their dispositions, such as whether the criminal charges were dropped or  resulted in an acquittal or a conviction.", "Efforts to improve criminal history records nationwide predate NCHIP by  more than 2 decades. For example, the development of computerized  criminal history systems in the states was a priority of the Law  Enforcement Assistance Administration, established by the Omnibus  Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Also, during much of the  1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s\u2014largely without specifically appropriated  funds\u2014BJS (or its predecessor, the National Criminal Justice Information  and Statistics Service) took the lead in encouraging states to computerize  criminal records and ensure conformity with evolving FBI standards.", "In the 1990s, efforts to improve the accuracy, completeness, and  accessibility of criminal history records received an impetus with passage  of various federal statutes, particularly  the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (\u201cBrady Act\u201d), which,  among other things, authorized grants for the improvement of state  criminal history records and amended the Gun Control Act of 1968;  the National Child Protection Act of 1993, which was enacted to  provide national criminal background checks for child care providers;  and  the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which,  among other things, strove to improve access to court protection  orders and records of individuals wanted for stalking and domestic  violence.", "With initial grant awards to states in 1995, NCHIP was designed by BJS to  implement these federal mandates to improve public safety by enhancing  the nation\u2019s criminal history records systems. In 1998, NCHIP\u2019s scope was  expanded in response to federal directives to develop or improve sex  offender registries and to contribute data to a national sex offender  registry.", "Also, in 1998, the \u201cpermanent\u201d provisions of the Brady Act went into effect  with the implementation of NICS\u2014the computerized system designed to  instantly (as the name indicates) conduct presale background checks of  purchasers of any firearm (both handguns and long guns). In contrast, the  \u201cinterim\u201d provisions of the Brady Act (effective from 1994 to 1998) applied  to handgun purchases only, and law enforcement officers were allowed a  maximum of 5 business days to conduct presale background checks for  evidence of felony convictions or disqualifying information. The  effectiveness of NICS depends largely on the availability of automated  records\u2014including the final dispositions of arrests, such as whether the  criminal charges resulted in convictions or acquittals. In this regard, many  criminal justice agencies, from police departments to the courts, are  generators of records relevant to NICS.", "Over the years, BJS has tried to ensure that the use of NCHIP funds was  closely coordinated with the federal Edward Byrne Memorial Grant  Program, which requires that states use at least 5 percent of their awards  for improving criminal history records. All 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and the U.S. territories have been recipients of NCHIP grant  awards, which totaled more than $438 million during fiscal years 1995  through 2003.", "Also, as mentioned previously, to ensure national compatibility and  accessibility of records, recipients\u2019 uses of NCHIP funds must conform  with the FBI\u2019s standards for national data systems\u2014including, as  applicable, NICS, NCIC, III, and IAFIS. Regarding IAFIS, for example, most  states have some type of automated fingerprint identification system  (AFIS); a state can use NCHIP funds to enhance its AFIS by purchasing  Livescan equipment, if the state has implemented (or is implementing)  procedures to ensure that the AFIS is compatible with FBI standards.

For example, the two largest  categories of spending\u2014NICS/III/criminal records improvements and  disposition reporting improvements\u2014accounted for over 75 percent of  total program awards during this period. Both categories directly affected  NICS. The NICS/III/criminal records improvements category affected NICS  by focusing on activities for improving records related to federal firearms  disqualifiers and enhancing access to these records through III.", "Similarly, the disposition reporting improvements category provided  access to information about the disposition of arrests\u2014information that is  critical for determining whether persons are legally prohibited from  purchasing firearms. Regarding this category, BJS encourages states to  focus on making systemic improvements rather than using staff to  manually research records to determine dispositions. Nonetheless,  according to BJS, states may use NCHIP funds to research arrest  dispositions in response to specific NICS-related queries, if the  information is subsequently added to the automated system. BJS officials  could not quantify the NCHIP grant amounts that all states have allocated  for staff to research arrest dispositions. Officials in 2 of the 5 case-study  states indicated that their states had used NCHIP funding to research  missing arrest dispositions and update criminal history records in  response to specific NICS-related queries.

As of May 2003 (within   6 years of implementation), 43 states and 1 territory had contributed  more than 778,000 records to this system.  In 1999, in response to mandates in the amendments to the Jacob  Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender  Registration Act, the FBI established a national sex offender database  for states to register and verify addresses of sex offenders. As of May  2003 (within 5 years of implementation), 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and 3 territories had contributed all of their then-applicable  records (over 300,000 records) to the National Sex Offender Registry.", "In 1999, the FBI implemented IAFIS\uf8e7a computerized system for  storing, comparing, and exchanging fingerprint data in a digital format.  As of April 2003 (within 4 years of implementation), 44 states, the  District of Columbia, and 3 territories had submitted some portions of  their fingerprint files electronically to the FBI for entry into IAFIS.", "BJS officials told us that NCHIP funds played a role in leading states to  these and other accomplishments. Similarly, officials in the 5 case-study  states we visited told us that the criminal history record improvements in  their states would not have been possible without NCHIP funds. According  to BJS officials, NCHIP is best viewed as being an \u201cumbrella\u201d program that  pools or coordinates various streams of monies. The officials noted that  NCHIP grants generally should not be viewed in isolation, apart from  funds that the states themselves spend for these initiatives. That is, the  NCHIP grants generally provide the seed money or the supplemental funds  that the states need to undertake major system upgrades or to implement  an overall plan for modernizing their information systems. While NCHIP  requires that states provide a 10 percent match to the federal funds  awarded, officials in the case-study states told us that their states typically  have invested much more than the required 10 percent. For example,   1 state that has received over $5 million in NCHIP funds estimated that  over $20 million of its own funds have been invested in system  improvements since 1995. Another state, receiving almost $7 million in  NCHIP grants, estimated that $35.4 million in state resources have been  spent on improving and automating its systems.", "In addition to NCHIP and state-provided funds, other federal programs  provide funds that can be used to improve criminal history records. For  example, the Bureau of Justice Assistance provides funds to states  through Byrne grants, a block grant program that requires states to set  aside 5 percent of any award for criminal justice information systems to  assist law enforcement, prosecution, courts and corrections organizations.   In addition to criminal history record improvements, Byrne grants may be  used for a variety of other system-related activities that are not related to  NCHIP. Examples include activities involving systems to collect criminal  intelligence and systems to collect driving-under-the influence data.   According to Bureau of Justice Assistance data for fiscal years 2001  through 2003, almost $73 million in Byrne grants were set-aside to improve  criminal justice information systems.", "Grants are also now available for antiterrorism purposes under the Crime  Identification Technology Act of 1998, as amended by the United  Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to  Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) of 2001.", "Besides characterizing NCHIP as an umbrella program, BJS officials also  described it as being a \u201cpartnership\u201d program\u2014among BJS, the FBI, and  the states and localities\u2014for building a national infrastructure to facilitate  the interstate exchange of information. The officials explained that such  exchanges or accessibility are needed to support a variety of both criminal  justice purposes (e.g., making decisions regarding pretrial release,  sentencing, etc.) and noncriminal justice purposes (e.g., conducting  background checks of firearms\u2019 purchasers, child-care providers, etc.).

In this regard, the Director  explained that many states adopted a \u201cday 1\u201d approach in using NCHIP  funds to improve records\u2014that is, improve new records first\u2014and left a  number of old, inactive records archived in state repositories. The  Director noted that BJS research, with FBI assistance, has indicated that  older arrest records account for much of the \u201copen arrest\u201d problem.

Since 1995, BJS has  encouraged states to contact court representatives and determine how  NCHIP funds can be used to improve disposition reporting. Further, since  2000, BJS has required that such contacts be documented in the states\u2019  application packages for NCHIP funds. For example, in the Fiscal Year  2003 Program Announcement (Mar. 2003), BJS specified that \u201call  applications will be required to demonstrate that court needs have been  considered, and if no funds for upgrading court systems capable of  providing disposition data are requested, applicants should include a letter  from the State court administrator or Chief Justice indicating that the  courts have been consulted in connection with the application.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Automated Information Not Always Available to Identify Other Prohibited Purchasers", "paragraphs": ["The Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, specifies four nonfelony or  noncriminal categories that prohibit an individual from owning or  purchasing a firearm\uf8e7that is, persons who (1) have been convicted of a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, (2) are subject to certain  outstanding court protection orders, (3) have been adjudicated as mentally  defective, or (4) are unlawful users of controlled substances.

That is,  domestic violence-related offenses can be difficult to distinguish from  misdemeanors broadly classified as assaults.

For instance, state  mental health laws, privacy laws, or doctor-patient considerations may  preclude federal law enforcement officials from routinely accessing some  of these records. According to BJS, the area of mental health records and  their shareability is a very difficult area\u2014and is an area in which BJS has  encouraged states to do more with NCHIP funds since fiscal year 1996.  The FBI\u2019s strategy\u2014which BJS encourages the states to use\u2014has been to  create a Denied Persons File in the NICS Index where the reason for  denial is not given unless the denial is appealed.", "In reference to substance abuse, BJS noted that federal law is very unclear  regarding who is a prohibited person, which makes it very difficult for  states to make records available to the FBI for NICS checks.

Such information is important for preventing or minimizing the sale of  firearms by \u201cdefault proceed.\u201d That is, by statute, if a background check is  not completed within 3 business days, the sale of the firearm is allowed to  proceed by default, sometimes to prohibited persons.", "In 2000, we reported that default proceeds occurred primarily due to a  lack of arrest dispositions in states\u2019 automated criminal history records  and that many of these transactions involved individuals\u20142,519  purchasers during a 10-month period\u2014who were later determined by the  FBI to be prohibited persons. We further reported that firearms being  transferred to prohibited persons presented public safety risks and placed  resource demands on law enforcement agencies in retrieving the firearms.  More recently, according to the FBI, over one-third (1,203) of the total  3,259 firearms retrieved in 2002 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives occurred because disposition information for  felony arrests could not be determined within 3 days.", "Another one-third (1,052) of the total retrievals in 2002 involved  background checks whereby FBI examiners were unable to timely  determine from available records that misdemeanor assault convictions  involved domestic violence.

The number of civil fingerprint submissions to the FBI has increased  substantially in recent years. As figure 2 shows, for 5 of the 7 years during  1996 to 2002, the number of civil fingerprint submissions exceeded the  number of criminal fingerprint submissions (i.e., fingerprints of criminal  suspects or arrestees). In the most recent year (2002), civil fingerprint  submissions totaled 9.1 million, whereas criminal fingerprint submissions  totaled 8.4 million.", "The growth in civil fingerprint submissions is partly attributable to   1993 federal legislation that encouraged states to have procedures  requiring fingerprint-based national searches of criminal history records of  individuals seeking paid or volunteer positions with organizations serving  children, the elderly, or the disabled. As of February 2004, according to  BJS, 47 states had enacted legislation authorizing these record checks.", "Further, in 2003, federal legislation was enacted that establishes, in  general, a pilot program in 3 states to conduct fingerprint-based  background checks on individuals seeking volunteer positions involving  interactions with children. Within 6 months of the date of the 2003 Act\u2019s  enactment, the Attorney General is to conduct a feasibility study to  determine, among other things, the number of background checks that  would be required if the pilot were implemented nationwide and the  impact these additional checks might have on the FBI and IAFIS. If this  pilot program is implemented nationally, BJS officials estimate that  millions of additional background checks would be required annually.", "Homeland security concerns are another factor that has increased the  demand for fingerprint-based background checks. Since the events of  September 11, 2001, Congress passed legislation to protect the nation from  future terrorist attacks. These laws require that individuals employed in  sensitive positions undergo background checks to qualify for employment.  FBI and BJS officials expect the number of applicant background checks  to be in the millions, as homeland defense laws are fully implemented.  Examples of federal homeland defense legislation and the number of  checks anticipated follow:    USA PATRIOT Act of 2001\u2014Requires background checks on  commercially licensed drivers who transport hazardous materials.  Officials from the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division  estimated that 800,000 to 1,000,000 individuals held commercial  licenses at the time the USA PATRIOT Act was passed.

New background checks are required for  those employees already hired at the time of the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act\u2019s passage as well as for individuals seeking  employment. This act further requires background checks of foreigners  seeking enrollment in flight schools. The Transportation Security  Administration has requested over 105,365 background checks since  passage of the act in November 2001. In addition to these checks, FBI  officials estimated that flight school checks alone could result in up to  50,000 fingerprint checks annually.", "Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response  Act of 2002\u2014Requires the Attorney General to conduct background  on persons possessing, using, or transferring various toxins and  biological agents.

Replacing outdated equipment and automating records can be expensive.  States advocate that steady or long-term funding streams are important for  implementing technological advances. In this regard, states do not rely  entirely on NCHIP grants for system improvements. That is, states view  NCHIP funding as \u201cseed\u201d or supplemental money and contribute from  their own coffers to fund these upgrades.

Expenditures in the second category include  efforts to automate disposition records and provide linkages for reporting  these records to the state\u2019s central records repository. Maryland, the only  case-study state that did not devote the majority of its funds to the first  two categories, still allocated nearly half (48 percent) of its total grant  awards for these two areas. Maryland devoted a large amount (40 percent)  of its NCHIP funding to AFIS/Livescan activities, as did Texas   (45 percent).", "For all 5 case-study states, the NCHIP funding detailed in table 6  represented \u201cseed\u201d or \u201ccatalyst\u201d money and, therefore, accounted for only  a portion of the total criminal records improvement spending. For  example, according to California officials, state resources accounted for  85 percent of records improvement funding in California during fiscal year  2002-03. The remaining 15 percent consisted of NCHIP grants (6 percent)  and other federal sources (approximately 9 percent).

For  example, officials have used program funds to improve disposition  reporting in the 28 counties that represent 70 percent of the disposition  volume for the entire state. As a result, these 28 counties report   100 percent of their dispositions to the state central repository via a  magnetic tape batch process occurring three times a week.

In addition, Maryland  is using nearly $200,000 of program funds to convert over 700,000  historical arrest records (older than October 1998) to a format compatible  with the FBI\u2019s III system. This effort will make older records accessible to  the FBI, which will improve NICS background checks.

For both types of firearms purchases (handguns and  long guns), another state agency (Maryland State Archives) provides  support (researching the disposition results of arrests) for criminal history  records generated before 1982. In fiscal year 2002, the Maryland State  Archives received $41,000 in NCHIP funds to conduct disposition research  for NICS queries from the FBI.
