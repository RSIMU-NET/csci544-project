Following the  assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in October 1981, Hosni  Mubarak assumed power in Egypt and ruled for almost 30 years until  2011. Starting on January 25, 2011, Egyptian citizens took to the streets  to protest against President Mubarak and to demand a variety of political,  economic, and social reforms. These protests followed shortly after and  were inspired in part by the successful revolution in Tunisia that began in  December 2010. The protests in Egypt culminated in President Mubarak\u2019s  resignation on February 11, 2011. Since that time, Egypt has continued to  undergo a series of turbulent political transitions.

Secretary of State Kerry  made this certification on April 22, 2014, enabling fiscal year 2014 funding  to be made available for assistance to Egypt.", "As of February 3, 2015, Secretary Kerry had not yet made other  certifications under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which  would allow certain fiscal year 2014 funds to be made available without  restriction for economic and security assistance.

As a result, the U.S.  government has significant amounts of funding that it allocated for  assistance to Egypt but has not yet obligated for a particular purpose,  including $260 million in ESF funds allocated for a cash transfer the  administration no longer intends to carry out. Given the resource  constraints the U.S. government faces, it is important that U.S. agencies  have plans for using existing resources in an effective and timely manner.  Plans for an alternative use of the $260 million in funding allocated for the  cash transfer would allow the U.S. government to support programs  designed to respond to the evolving situation in Egypt or other identified  priorities that contribute to U.S. strategic objectives, while also potentially  allowing for reductions in future budget requests.", "While the U.S. government is in the process of developing a multiyear  strategic plan to guide future U.S. assistance to Egypt, little is known  about the effectiveness of past assistance toward achieving U.S. strategic  goals. U.S. officials have acknowledged challenges in linking assistance  provided to Egypt with specific results. In particular, U.S. officials noted  that it is difficult to determine the extent to which security assistance has  contributed to strategic objectives, such as promoting regional stability,  upholding the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, countering terrorism and  extremism, and maintaining key strategic benefits. Nevertheless,  evaluations can provide useful information to the executive branch and  Congress about whether a program is meeting its goals or may be  producing unintended consequences. The absence of an evaluation of  security assistance to Egypt raises questions about how this program\u2014 supported by $1.3 billion in U.S. funding annually\u2014is contributing to  meeting strategic objectives and what levels of funding are necessary for  success. State has stated its commitment to completing such an  evaluation but has not established specific time frames for doing so.  Establishing time frames for completion of an evaluation of security  assistance to Egypt would help ensure that State successfully fulfills this  commitment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the significant unobligated balances of about $260 million in the  ESF account for Egypt previously allocated for a cash transfer that the  administration has stated it no longer intends to carry out, we recommend  that the Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator work to develop  plans for an alternate use of these funds, in consultation with the  appropriate committees of Congress.

We reviewed  the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) strategies for  Egypt, including its strategic plan for fiscal years 2000-2009, bridge  strategy for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and 2012 papers outlining  priorities for each development sector: democracy and governance,  economic growth, education, and health. We also reviewed the  Department of Defense (DOD) U.S. Central Command\u2019s fiscal years 2014  and 2015 Country Security Cooperation Plans for Egypt. Finally, we  reviewed relevant laws pertaining to U.S. assistance to Egypt and State\u2019s  and USAID\u2019s guidance for strategic planning. To determine the extent to  which levels of U.S. assistance to Egypt evolved in fiscal years 2009  through 2014, we obtained and analyzed State data on allocations for  security and economic assistance to Egypt, and we reviewed cables and  memos that described changes in assistance priorities. To address  strategic objectives and changes in assistance\u2014particularly after Egypt\u2019s  political transitions in 2011 and 2013\u2014we interviewed officials from  State\u2019s Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs; Democracy, Human Rights, and  Labor; and Political-Military Affairs; the Middle East Partnership Initiative;  and the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources; USAID\u2019s Bureau for  the Middle East; DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy, Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and U.S. Central  Command. State confirmed that the U.S. objectives for assistance to  Egypt are consistent with U.S. policy developed by the National Security  Council. We conducted audit work in Cairo, Egypt, and interviewed U.S.  officials from State, USAID, DOD, the Department of Homeland Security,  and the Department of Justice who manage assistance programs for  Egypt. We also interviewed Egyptian government officials from the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation, and Social  Solidarity\u2014the three ministries that coordinate bilateral assistance with  the United States or approve the registration of a portion of the  organizations that implement U.S.-funded assistance\u2014and the Egyptian  Armament Authority, a unit within the Egyptian Armed Forces that  oversees the procurement of U.S. military equipment using U.S.  assistance.

State provided data on bilateral  assistance managed by both State and USAID from the Economic  Support Fund (ESF); Foreign Military Financing (FMF); International  Military Education and Training (IMET); International Narcotics Control  and Law Enforcement (INCLE); and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism,  Demining, and Related Assistance (NADR) accounts. In addition, State  provided data on funding from global or regional programs that supported  assistance to Egypt from the Democracy Fund, Development Assistance,  ESF, Global Health Program, and NADR accounts. In the case of FMF,  funds are budgeted and tracked in a different way than for other foreign  assistance accounts, so State provided us data on funding that was  uncommitted or committed rather than data on unliquidated obligations  and disbursements. To assess the reliability of the data provided, we  requested and reviewed information from State regarding the agency\u2019s  underlying financial data systems and the checks, controls, and reviews  used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data provided. We  determined that the data State provided were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To gather additional information on the status of  assistance to Egypt, we interviewed State, USAID, and DOD officials and  reviewed agency documents to identify factors that contributed to any  unobligated balances and unliquidated obligations. Finally, we identified  any relevant legal authorities related to these accounts, including the  periods of availability for funds to be obligated from each of these  accounts. To guide our assessment of unobligated balances and  unliquidated obligations in Egypt, we used GAO\u2019s report Budget Issues:  Key Questions to Consider When Evaluating Balances in Federal  Accounts, which provides guidance on evaluating such balances in  federal accounts.

We cross-referenced these  evaluations with data on USAID-funded projects in Egypt that were active  in fiscal years 2009 through July 31, 2014, to determine the value of the  projects evaluated by USAID. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining the value of these  projects. To identify evaluations of State assistance, we interviewed or  obtained written responses from State officials and reviewed evaluation  reports provided by State. We also reviewed a Request for Task Order  Proposal and Statement of Work issued by State in May 2014 to  commission an evaluation of security assistance to Egypt, and we  discussed the status of the proposed evaluation with officials from State\u2019s  Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
