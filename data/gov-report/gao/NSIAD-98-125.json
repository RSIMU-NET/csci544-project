Focus groups use a small group discussion format, guided by a moderator, to gather information on a given topic. Focus groups are useful in providing an understanding of the depth and the variety of opinions, feelings, or beliefs, but are not useful for quantifying the extent to which a particular view or opinion is held. For these reasons, focus groups are a qualitative technique best used when the aim is to explore an issue or, at the other end of the research process, to assess reaction to specific proposals. As with any methodology, its value is dependent upon the extent to which it is appropriate to the objectives of the inquiry, how well the methodology is conducted, and the way in which the results are used.

The panel\u2019s mission was to make recommendations to improve the human relations environment in which soldiers live and work, with the specific goal of eradicating sexual harassment in the Army. The panel consisted of seven members, including two retired general officers recalled to active duty, two active duty general officers, a senior noncommissioned officer, and two DOD civilians. The Senior Review Panel forwarded its report and recommendations to the Secretary of the Army in July 1997. It included 40 recommendations, of which 14 dealt with training and related issues.", "In June 1997, the Secretary of Defense established the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training and Related Issues.

As part of its mission, DACOWITS members conduct annual visits to selected Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard installations, both here and overseas. These visits serve two purposes: (1) to provide the Secretary of Defense with insight into the thoughts and perceptions of servicemembers in the fleet and the field and (2) to determine what issues DACOWITS will concentrate on in the future. In November 1996, the former Secretary of Defense requested that DACOWITS visit training installations to meet with trainees and trainers in the training environment. In February 1997, the current Secretary of Defense endorsed the request. DACOWITS provided a report to the Secretary of Defense summarizing these visits.

Members of field teams conducted individual interviews with 808 military and civilian Army leaders and personnel in Army support groups. Focus groups consisted of randomly selected, single-gender groups of 8 to 12 people organized by ranks or categories. Participants totaled 7,401 soldiers and 1,007 civilians. Facilitators and note takers of the same gender as the groups conducted the sessions. All data obtained through these two activities were entered into a computer for analysis.

Data were then analyzed by rank, by gender, and by question.", "The written surveys addressed leadership, cohesion, and sexual harassment. Field teams administered the surveys to 22,952 servicemembers. Surveys were developed for trainees, trainers, and the general Army population.

However, the number of questions asked of many of the focus groups was significantly greater than the five or six questions recommended by focus group literature. For example, the set of questions for trainee focus groups consisted of 15 questions and the set for trainers consisted of 13 questions. Focus group discussions were not tape recorded because it was feared that this would inhibit the participants, but notes were taken by a note taker and were content-analyzed. The notes from each focus group session were destroyed, after the responses were entered in the database and verified for accuracy, to assure that participant confidentiality was maintained. Destroying the original documentation to assure confidentiality is considered an appropriate measure by social scientists. In addition, the completed survey forms were also destroyed to assure participant confidentiality.", "In volume two, the panel provides an extensive discussion of its methodology.

Normally, a pretest is performed to identify problem questions, problems with language interpretations, unclear instructions, or to determine if there are some questions that respondents will refuse to answer. In this instance, the survey form contained six questions that some respondents in early administrations found inflammatory, offensive, and an invasion of privacy and resulted in some refusals to complete the survey. Subsequently, those questions were eliminated and a revised form was used. The data on the six questions were not included in the database, which resulted in an accusation that the panel had eliminated important data from its analysis. The report disclosed the problem and its resolution in the methodology section.

The Committee believed that a more flexible approach to the discussions would enhance the quality of the exchange between the participants and the Committee members. However, the fact that the same questions were not asked of each similar focus group, along with the number of questions, size of the groups, and length of the sessions may have combined to limit full discussion. In addition, the focus groups\u2019 discussions were not systematically recorded. As a result, the extent to which the recommendations are supported by the Committee\u2019s work cannot be assessed.", "The Committee staff provided the Committee members with questions for the focus groups. However, according to the staff director, the Committee members were told that the questions were guidelines and that they did not have to be asked as written. Because the Committee members had the flexibility to ask any question they desired, the responses should not be compared with each other. Also, the number of questions provided to the panel members were far more than the five to six focus group literature recommends. For example, the staff provided 20 questions, some of which had several parts, for the Committee to ask Army trainees at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Fifteen trainees participated in the 1-hour focus groups at this installation. If the entire hour was spent on the questions, there would have only been 3 minutes spent on each question and only 15 seconds for each participant to respond. We do not believe that would have been enough time for a meaningful discussion of a question. Finally, even if all the questions were asked as they were written, they were not always asked in the same order each time. Social science literature suggests that the same questions asked in a different sequence may result in different responses.", "The absence of documentation of the comments made in the individual focus groups was the most serious methodological shortcoming. While the Committee members took notes during each focus group, these notes were not made part of the Committee\u2019s records nor were they summarized and included in the report. Without documentation, it is impossible to determine if the Committee\u2019s work supports its recommendations. Also, the lack of documentation prevented the Committee from analyzing the data to know what comments they heard or how often similar comments were made. Knowing how often a particular kind of comment was made and the subgroup of the person who made it are ways of putting the comments in perspective and filtering biases.", "The report of the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training and Related Issues does not include a sufficient discussion of the Committee\u2019s methodology and work process. For example, the report states that the Committee conducted discussion groups with randomly selected servicemembers, but it does not explain the random selection process. In addition, the use of terminology such as \u201crandomly selected\u201d implies a level of scientific rigor that was not achieved in this study. The report does not identify the make-up of the discussion groups, discuss what type of data analysis was done or not done, or mention any limitations with the data. Limitations that we believe should have been mentioned are that the report was based on opinions and the results cannot be generalized to the entire military training population.", "Also, the report often presents opinions in a manner that they can be misinterpreted as facts based on empirical data. For example, the report says that the Committee members observed that integrated housing is contributing to a higher rate of disciplinary problems, but, according to the Chairman, the Committee did not obtain any data to support this statement. In addition, the report contains many statements that include words like \u201cmost\u201d, \u201cmany\u201d, and \u201cmajority\u201d. These words lead a reader to believe that the Committee counted responses to particular questions or polled the focus group participants. The Chairman said that the Committee does not have quantitative data.", "The report also does not explain the process the Committee used to formulate its recommendations. Although the Committee held a public meeting in October 1997 after its installation visits had been completed, the recommendations on separate barracks for male and female recruits and on the organization of gender-segregated platoons, divisions, and flights were not made until after that meeting.

Before meeting with the Committee members, focus group participants viewed an 18-minute video that explained the mission of DACOWITS and highlighted some of the gender equality issues that DACOWITS had worked on in the past such as sexual harassment, discrimination, child care, and the combat exclusion policy.

The literature suggests that focus groups should be no larger than  12 participants. During the DACOWITS visits to the training schools, some groups were as large as 20 participants. Groups larger than 12 usually do not allow sufficient opportunity to actively participate in the discussion and are more difficult to manage. Also, the majority of the sessions were about an hour long and some ran for only 45 minutes, about half the time recommended by focus group literature.", "DACOWITS used two questions to generate discussion. However, time may still have been a problem, since the questions were very open-ended and could be taken in virtually any direction by a participant. This would likely have the effect of increasing the amount of time needed as each participant not only answered the discussion questions, but also reacted and responded to the issues raised by others.", "DACOWITS did not document the individual focus groups as recommended by focus group literature. Instead, DACOWITS members prepared installation visit reports which summarized the opinions they heard most frequently. While the installation reports document the work performed and the issues surfaced during the training installation visits, they do not capture enough information about the discussions in each focus group to be really useful. For example, they do not provide enough information on the rank or gender of the groups that raised the issue which would help put the comments into perspective.", "As we stated earlier, all of the DACOWITS members making installation training installation visits were women. Some focus group literature suggests that the gender of the moderator and the gender of the focus group should be the same, particularly when the issues being discussed are sensitive or have a direct bearing on the opposite sex. Also, some focus group literature suggests that men are more likely to tell a woman moderator what they think will impress or please her rather than what they think. The use of female moderators for male focus groups, in conjunction with the women\u2019s advocacy impression that the video is likely to have conveyed, may have made some males hesitant to raise issues or perceptions that might be construed as anti-female. Because DACOWITS did not document each of its focus groups it is impossible to determine if the use of women moderators with all-male focus groups had an effect on the responses of the male participants.", "The DACOWITS report provides some methodological information for the reader, but does not provide some key information. First, the report does not provide any details on how the Committee members documented the focus groups. Second, the report does not clearly explain the process used by DACOWITS to determine what issues would be included in the report. Third, while the report provides some detail about the make-up of the focus groups it does not describe how the focus group participants were selected. It should be noted however, as recommended by focus group literature, the report clearly states its two major limitations: (1) the opinion and perception information included in the report has not been independently validated or confirmed and ( 2) the Committee did not visit any gender-segregated training facilities.

The views expressed in focus groups are not necessarily representative of a population and statistical estimates cannot be derived from the results. Furthermore, focus groups cannot be used to determine the extent of a problem. Focus groups produce qualitative data that provide insights into attitudes, perceptions, and opinions of the participants. They are most often used before, during, or after quantitative research procedures such as surveys. For example, focus groups can be used before a survey is undertaken to help a research team learn about the target audience or determine the appropriateness of the questionnaire. Focus groups are often used with surveys to confirm findings and to obtain greater breadth and depth of information. Finally, focus groups are often used as a follow-up to surveys to help interpret responses. On occasion, focus groups are used alone when opinions and perceptions are more important than how many people hold such views.", "The size of the focus group is an important, but often overlooked, element of a successful group discussion. The literature on focus groups suggests that an appropriate size for a focus group is 6 to 12 people. A focus group with fewer than six participants sometimes has problems with productivity because the group has fewer experiences to share. Also, small groups can be more easily affected by people who know each other, by uncooperative participants, or by participants who view themselves as experts on the topic. Groups that have more than 12 people usually do not allow people sufficient opportunity to actively participate in the discussion, making the groups difficult to manage.", "The composition of the focus group is also important. Participants should share some similar characteristics but be diverse enough to allow for differences of opinions. The topic of discussion and the information to be obtained dictate the types of characteristics shared. However, generally participants should be similar in age, occupation, education, and social class. Focus groups with distinct differences among participants such as trainees and trainers or junior and senior enlisted personnel do not work well because of limited understanding of other lifestyles and situations. Furthermore, some participants may be inhibited and defer to those they believe to be better educated or more experienced or of a higher social class. Sometimes, the gender of participants can affect the outcome of a focus group and some social scientists recommend against mixing genders because men and women tend to perform for each other. When the opinions of disparate groups are needed, focus group literature recommends holding separate groups for each distinct group.", "Focus group discussions are conducted informally and guided by trained moderators who encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences. Trained, experienced moderators are critical to the success of a focus group. An unqualified moderator can easily undermine the reliability and validity of focus group findings. Successful moderators are good listeners, who can make people feel relaxed and anxious to talk. Moderators must control a group without being obvious and be aware of time. Since literature suggests that focus groups should be scheduled for 90 minutes and run no more than 120 minutes, moderators need to be able to keep the discussion on track and move the participants from one topic to the next. Moderators should be aware of the influence that they have on the type and amount of data obtained. Moderators must be aware of their own biases that might affect the validity of the data and take care not to provide cues to participants about desirable responses and answers. If dealing with sensitive subjects where views could vary according to factors such as gender or race, it is recommended that the moderator be similar in gender or race to the participants. Finally, moderators must have sufficient knowledge of the topic to put comments in perspective and followup on critical areas of concern.", "Questions are the heart of the focus group discussion. The literature on focus groups suggests five or six questions for a discussion group. The questions need to be carefully thought-out and phrased to result in the maximum amount of information in the limited time available. Questions should not suggest potential answers and yes or no questions should be avoided. Questions should be asked in the same order in every focus group and questions should be sequenced from most important to least important to ensure that the most necessary information is obtained from the participants if time runs out. The sequence is important because the questions may interact with one another to form the stimulus that generates the responses. If the questions are asked in a different order at each focus group, the stimulus is changed and the response will be different.", "The results of the focus groups\u2019 discussions should be documented on a session by session basis. Focus group literature agrees that the best way to do that is by tape recording supplemented with written notes. However, if a tape recording is not feasible or inhibiting to the participants, note taking can be sufficient provided they are complete enough to be analyzed.", "A systematic analysis of focus group data is also important. The analysis can be either qualitative or quantitative, but it must be systematic and verifiable. It must be systematic in that it follows a documented step-by-step process and verifiable to permit others to arrive at similar conclusions using available documents and the raw results. Social scientists have noted that there is a tendency for novice researchers to see selectively only those parts of the discussion that confirms their particular point of view. Often, a researcher will go into the discussion with certain hunches of how participants might feel. As a result, the researcher tends to look for evidence to support these hunches and overlook data that present different points of view. A systematic and verifiable process helps researchers in filtering out bias and assuring that they present the data as objectively as possible.", "Once data are collected and analyzed, the data should be reported and, if appropriate, conclusions and recommendations made. A report should clearly state what the purpose of the study was, what its scope was, how the data were collected and analyzed, and what, if any, significant limitations exist on the data or the use of the data. For example, studies that used focus groups as the primary method of data collection should clearly state that the data being reported is opinion or perception. If the opinions have been substantiated by other types of data, this should be clearly stated in the report. The report should also include the results of the focus groups, and the results should be clearly stated so that a reader can come to the same conclusions as the report writers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Reports", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Secretary of the Army\u2019s Senior Review Panel on Sexual Harassment", "paragraphs": ["The following is excerpted from Army press reports that accompanied the report of the Senior Review Panel\u2019s report on Sexual Harassment in the Army as well as the executive summary of the report:", "Sexual harassment exists throughout the Army, crossing gender, rank, and racial lines; gender discrimination is more common than sexual harassment.", "Army leaders are the critical factor in creating, maintaining and enforcing an environment of respect and dignity in the Army; too many leaders have failed to gain the trust of their soldiers.", "The Army lacks institutional commitment to the Equal Opportunity program and soldiers distrust the equal opportunity program.", "Trainees believe the overwhelming majority of drill sergeants and instructors perform competently and well, but \u201crespect\u201d as an Army core value is not well institutionalized in the Initial Entry training process.", "Recommendations of the panel were broad-based and covered a wide variety of Army processes including: leader development, equal opportunity policy and procedures, initial entry training soldierization, unit and institutional training, command climate, and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training and Related Issues", "paragraphs": ["\u201cThe panel studied the full training cycle including recruiting, basic training, and advanced skills training.
