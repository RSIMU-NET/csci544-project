There are over 250 reservoirs and about 150 hydroelectric projects in the basin, including 18 mainstem dams on the Columbia and its primary tributary, the Snake River. One of the most prominent features of the Columbia River Basin has been its production of salmon. Specifically, the Columbia River Basin provides habitat for five species of anadromous salmon: chinook, coho, chum, sockeye, and pink. Salmon spawn in fresh-water rivers and their tributaries. Juvenile salmon live in the fresh water for a year or two, migrate to and mature in the ocean, and return in 2 to 5 years to their place of birth as adults to spawn.", "About 150 years ago, the Columbia River Basin returned the largest adult runs of wild salmon on earth\u2014their annual populations were estimated at up to 16 million salmon. Since that time, however, total annual salmon returns have declined to only about 2.5 million in 1996. It is estimated that only about 500,000 of these returning adults are wild or naturally spawned fish. The remainder are hatchery-raised fish intended to supplement the declining wild runs.", "A number of factors have contributed to the decline of salmon stocks in the Columbia and Snake rivers. These include overharvesting in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, as well as the adverse effects on spawning habitat from farming, cattle grazing, mining, logging, road construction, and industrial pollution. A variety of ocean conditions including currents, pollution, temperature changes, and nutrient base, also affects the survival of salmon. In addition, dams have a significant impact on declining salmon stocks, particularly those dams that limit access to spawning habitat and those through which fish passage is provided but at reduced levels in comparison with natural conditions. However, most of the decline in wild salmon stocks\u2014from the estimated 16 million in the mid-1800s to about 4 million in 1938\u2014occurred before the first federal dam was completed in the Columbia River Basin in 1938."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Columbia River Power System and the Corps of Engineers\u2019 Dams", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Columbia River Power System (the Columbia power system) includes all federally owned hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin that are operated and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation. These include 21 Corps dams and 8 Bureau dams. The Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville Power) is responsible for transmitting and marketing the hydroelectric power generated by this system. Of the 21 dams operated and maintained by the Corps, eight are major, multipurpose dams located on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers that affect the habitat and migration of salmon. These are Bonneville, The Dalles, John Day, and McNary on the lower Columbia and Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite on the Snake.", "These dams are a major source of hydroelectric power in the region and also provide flood control, navigation, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits. However, the dams impede the migration of juvenile and adult fish to and from the ocean by their physical presence and by creating reservoirs. Reservoirs formed behind the dams slow water velocities, alter water temperatures, and improve the habitat of predators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Dam Modifications Have Improved Fish Passage", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has adult fish ladders at all eight of its dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers. Adult fish ladders were integrated into the design of the dams beginning with Bonneville in 1938. These ladders consist of a series of steps and water pools that provide a gradual upward climb over the dams for returning adults. To steer the adults to the ladders, \u201cattraction\u201d flows at the downstream ladder entrances simulate conditions that would be found at the base of natural waterfalls. The concept has proved effective for adult fish passage.", "Generally, juvenile fish can migrate downstream past the dams by several routes, including through the dams\u2019 turbines, through the dams\u2019 juvenile fish bypass systems, or over the dams\u2019 spillways. The Corps has juvenile fish bypass systems in place at seven of its eight dams. At The Dalles Dam, juvenile fish are bypassed through the dam\u2019s ice and trash sluiceway\u2014a waterway used to pass ice and trash around the dam. While each alternative passage has associated risks and contributes to fish mortality, passage through the bypass system or over the spillway has a lower mortality rate than through the turbines. Many juvenile fish are also collected and transported past the dams by barge and truck under the Corps\u2019 juvenile fish transportation program.", "The conventional juvenile fish bypass systems at the Corps\u2019 dams guide fish away from turbines by means of submerged screens positioned in front of the turbines. The juvenile fish are directed up into a gatewell, where they pass through orifices into collection channels that transport the fish around the dam. The fish are then routed back out to the river below the dam, which is called \u201cbypassing\u201d; at the four dams with fish transport facilities, fish can be routed to a holding area for loading on to specially equipped barges and trucks for transport downriver to below the Bonneville Dam\u2014the last dam on the lower Columbia River before the Pacific Ocean. Three of the Corps\u2019 four Snake River dams and the McNary Dam on the Columbia River have fish transportation facilities.", "The percentage of fish approaching a turbine intake that are guided by submerged screens into facilities that bypass the turbine is called fish guidance efficiency. This percentage varies from dam to dam and by type of fish. For example, according to the Corps, the current bypass systems for juvenile fish guide 60 to 70 percent of spring/summer chinook salmon away from the turbines and up through the bypass channel. However, the fish guidance efficiency for fall chinook salmon is only about 30 percent because they are smaller, swim deeper in the river, and migrate in different water conditions. Dams equipped with extended-length screens can guide up to 66 percent of fall chinook into bypass systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "River Operations Can Improve Anadromous Fish Passage", "paragraphs": ["Hydropower operations can be modified to improve in-river migration conditions for fish. During the juvenile fish migration season, from April until fall, water can be spilled at the dams and flows in the river can be augmented to aid juvenile fish migration.", "One operational measure designed to improve salmon passage at the Corps\u2019 dams is to spill water and juvenile fish over the dams\u2019 spillways, rather than putting the water through the powerhouses\u2019 turbines to produce electricity. However, spill has associated risks because when the water plunges into the spillway basins, it traps gases, such as nitrogen. Water that is supersaturated with nitrogen can be lethal to both adult and juvenile fish. Spillway deflectors have been installed at seven of the Corps\u2019 eight dams to limit the plunge depth of spilled water, thereby reducing the amount of supersaturated gases.", "Another operational method of improving in-river fish migration is flow augmentation. Upstream storage dams hold water for flood control and other uses, interrupting the river\u2019s historical seasonal flow patterns. Seasonal releases of water from upstream storage dams, called flow augmentation, can aid salmon migration. The Corps operates two upstream storage dams in the Columbia River Basin, Dworshak Dam in Idaho and Libby Dam in Montana, from which water is released to aid juvenile fish as they migrate downriver."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Improve Salmon Recovery Have Been Ongoing for Decades", "paragraphs": ["Since 1949, federal and state agencies and regional organizationsresponsible for efforts to enhance salmon have invested over $3 billion in actions to improve salmon runs throughout the Columbia River Basin. Despite the studies and actions taken to improve fish passage, salmon runs in the Columbia River Basin have continued to decline: returning adult populations totaled about 4 million in 1938, 3 million in 1980, and 2.5 million in 1996.", "Over the past several decades, various federal and state agencies, the courts, and other entities have shaped the development and management of salmon policy in the Columbia River Basin. During the early period of the construction of the Corps\u2019 eight dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers, the state fisheries agencies, universities, and the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (later called the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) conducted most fisheries research in the Columbia River Basin. In the early 1950s, the Corps\u2019 North Pacific Division (currently the Northwestern Division) organized the Fisheries Engineering Research Program, which\u2014in coordination with the directors of federal and state fisheries agencies\u2014reviewed research and discussed additional concerns and research opportunities to improve fish passage. Most early studies focused on adult migrants. By the late 1950s, the program\u2019s attention was drawn to studying the survival of juvenile fish and their diversion away from turbine intakes. In 1968, the Corps funded an experiment by the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) at Ice Harbor Dam, using trucks to transport juvenile salmon around the four completed lower Columbia River dams. Encouraging results led to the installation of juvenile fish bypass systems that enable fish collection and transportation at some of the Corps\u2019 dams. The development of screens to divert juvenile fish from the turbine intakes began in 1969, and further research provided the basis for the modification of river flows and dam operations beginning in the 1980s.", "By the mid-1980s, the Corps developed its Columbia River Fish Mitigation Project to reduce the mortality of juvenile salmon. This project is part of the Corps\u2019 larger Columbia River Salmon Program that includes river operations, fish passage operations and maintenance, fish transportation, research, hatchery operations funded through the Corps\u2019 operations and maintenance appropriation, and fish passage improvements. The Corps\u2019 Columbia River Fish Mitigation Project includes individual actions related to the design and construction of improvements to fish passage facilities as well as studies that support the Columbia power system\u2019s long-term decisions on the system\u2019s configuration and operation. Today, the Corps refers to these fish mitigation actions collectively as the Columbia River Fish Mitigation Project. However, for purposes of this report, we refer to the Corps\u2019 Columbia River Fish Mitigation Project as a program and individual fish mitigation actions as projects or studies.", "In 1980, the Congress passed the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, now called the Northwest Power Act, which envisioned salmon as an equal partner with hydropower operations for dams in the Columbia River Basin. The act called for elevating energy and fish planning to a regional level by establishing greater involvement of state and local governments, Native American tribes, and the public in power planning through an interstate Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council\u2014now called the Northwest Power Planning Council. The Council, which consists of two members from each state appointed by the governors of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, was formed in 1981. The act directed the Council to ensure an adequate long-term supply of power for the Pacific Northwest and to develop a basinwide comprehensive Fish and Wildlife Program to rebuild resources that had been harmed by hydroelectric development. While the act gave the Council the authority to plan, the primary implementors and funding source for the Fish and Wildlife Program are federal agencies. Under the act, federal agencies that manage, operate, or regulate hydroelectric facilities in the Columbia River Basin are required to take the program into account \u201c. . . at each relevant stage of decisionmaking processes to the fullest extent practicable.\u201d These obligations are intended to help integrate federal agencies\u2019 fish mitigation actions with a regionally supported fish and wildlife program. In 1982, the Council completed its first Fish and Wildlife Program. During 1982 through 1994, the program was amended several times, calling for an integrated approach to fish restoration efforts, designating \u201cprotected areas\u201d for fish and wildlife, adopting a mainstem-dam spill agreement, and concentrating on improving the survival of juvenile salmon migrating downstream.", "Other key entities in salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest are the Native American tribes. Tensions between Native Americans and other users of the Columbia River Basin have existed since before the 19th century. In the mid 1800s, the federal government negotiated treaties with the Native Americans in the Columbia River Basin which granted the Indians the right to take fish at all the usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations in common with all citizens of the Territory. Although relations improved in the 1980s, today, the Native Americans, with some support, generally argue that salmon recovery can be accomplished most efficiently by returning the Columbia and Snake rivers to \u201cnatural\u201d flow conditions and that interim expenditures that evaluate other potential remedies are unnecessary and costly. Specifically, the Native American tribes call for the removal of a portion (breach) of the Corps\u2019 four dams on the Snake River and support releases of water to increase river flows to aid salmon migration. The tribes also support the use of hatcheries to rebuild salmon runs. The tribes are opposed, however, to the Corps\u2019 programs that transport juvenile fish past the dams. Transportation of fish, some tribes argue, is unnatural."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Salmon Stocks Are Listed as Endangered or Threatened", "paragraphs": ["In March 1990, a regional Native American tribe, the Shoshone-Bannock, petitioned NMFS to list the Snake River sockeye salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Later in 1990, a coalition of environmental groups requested protection for the spring/ summer and fall runs of the Snake River chinook salmon and the lower Columbia River coho salmon. In 1991, NMFS declared the Snake River sockeye salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. In 1992, NMFS declared the spring/summer and fall runs of the Snake River chinook salmon as threatened. This Endangered Species Act listing required the Corps, Bonneville Power, and the Bureau of Reclamation to consult with NMFS to determine whether river flow improvements and planned fish mitigation measures associated with the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System would further jeopardize the existence of the listed species.", "Under the Biological Opinion, the Columbia power system encompasses those dams and reservoirs owned and operated as a coordinated system for the purpose of power production by the three action agencies (the Corps, Bonneville Power, and the Bureau of Reclamation) on behalf of the federal government. For purposes of the Biological Opinion, these dams and reservoirs are the Dworshak, Lower Granite, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, and Ice Harbor in the Snake River Basin; Hungry Horse, Libby, and Grand Coulee on the upper Columbia River; and McNary, John Day, The Dalles, and Bonneville on the lower Columbia River. The Biological Opinion takes into account the operation of these dams as a unified hydropower system and as individual projects. For example, flow augmentation, the survival of juvenile and adult salmon, and total dissolved gas issues can involve both the hydropower system as a whole or just individual dams in any given case.", "Previous Biological Opinions issued by NMFS in 1992, 1993, and 1994 (the 1994 Opinion addressed the operations of the hydropower system through 1998) stated that the proposed operations of the Columbia power system during those years would not jeopardize the continued existence of Snake River salmon. NMFS\u2019s 1993 Biological Opinion finding of \u201cno jeopardy\u201d was challenged in U.S. District Court by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the State of Oregon, and four Native American tribes. On March 28, 1994, the court ruled that NMFS\u2019 1993 Biological Opinion was inadequate because it relied too much on the status quo for improving listed stocks of salmon that continued to dwindle in numbers. The 1993 Biological Opinion dealt with the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System in 1993, a system that had been completed by the time of the court\u2019s decision. Thus, the court permitted NMFS, the Corps, and the Bureau of Reclamation to address the court\u2019s concerns by reconsidering the March 16, 1994, Biological Opinion.", "In accordance with the court\u2019s decision, on March 2, 1995, NMFS issued a Biological Opinion on the operation of the Columbia power system for 1995 and future years. The 1995 Biological Opinion concluded that the proposed operation of the hydropower system, which included planned fish mitigation actions, was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed Snake River salmon protected under the Endangered Species Act. NMFS recommended a \u201creasonable and prudent\u201d alternative that included immediate, intermediate, and long-term actions concerning the operation and configuration of the Columbia power system to avoid jeopardizing the protected salmon.

The alternatives under consideration are (1) maintaining current structures and operations as prescribed in the Biological Opinion, including juvenile fish transportation and improvements to existing bypass facilities; (2) permanently drawing down the reservoirs behind the four dams to natural river levels by removing a section of each dam; and (3) making major system improvements other than drawdown, such as construction of new surface bypass facilities, structural measures to reduce gas supersaturation, and improvements to turbines to reduce salmon mortality. The Biological Opinion provides for the Corps to make a recommendation in 1999 on which of the alternatives is preferred.", "The Corps is also considering long-term options for fish passage at dams on the lower Columbia River.

The Biological Opinion specified that improvements to the existing juvenile fish bypass system at the dam\u2019s second powerhouse should be completed by the spring of 1999. Survival studies conducted by the Corps in the late 1980s showed high juvenile fish mortality rates in the existing bypass system as well as downstream at the location of the system\u2019s juvenile fish transportation release site. Improvements to be made to the existing bypass system included (1) a variety of measures to reduce juvenile fish delay and mortality in the fish collection channel; (2) relocation of the transportation flume to an area located approximately two miles downstream from the second powerhouse, which is a habitat less conducive to predators; and (3) construction of a monitoring facility near the relocated transportation flume outfall so that juvenile fish using the bypass system can be sampled and evaluated in order to gain information on the Columbia River system\u2019s fish survival rate. According to Corps officials, completion of the juvenile fish monitoring facility will be delayed 1 year because of a shortage of funds. The Regional Forum reviewed the funding shortage and decided that the Corps should relocate the transportation flume and make improvements to the juvenile fish collection channel by March 1999 because these changes would have the most impact on improving juvenile fish survival at the second powerhouse. The Regional Forum also decided that the monitoring facility should be completed in the year 2000. According to Corps officials, the Corps constructed a temporary facility in 1997 to evaluate tracking tags placed in the migrating juvenile fish. However, the temporary facility will not provide as comprehensive a sample or evaluation of the juvenile fish as will occur once the permanent facility is in operation. Corps officials also noted that while funding limitations may adversely affect individual projects and studies, the region is attempting to provide its limited funds to those projects and studies that have the potential to provide the greatest benefit.", "An example of a delay that occurred because the Regional Forum decided to wait for additional biological information occurred at the Corps\u2019 Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River. This dam has a juvenile fish bypass system and a juvenile fish holding and loading facility that were included when the dam was completed in 1975. The Biological Opinion stated that the Corps should improve this facility by widening the collection channel, replacing the existing 1,000-foot pipe that connects the collection channel with the downstream holding and loading facility and bypass outfall, improving the system\u2019s capability to separate juvenile fish by size, and updating features at the holding and loading facility. In June 1996, the Corps\u2019 Walla Walla District issued a feature design memorandum on the project that included descriptive criteria for modifying the existing facility. The project\u2019s total cost, including design and construction, was estimated at almost $19 million. Work was to begin in 1997, and the upgraded facilities were scheduled to be fully operational by March 1999. However, after about $450,000 had been spent on this project, principally to prepare and publish the feature design memorandum, the Regional Forum recommended that no fiscal year 1998 funds should be committed to this project and that all work should be deferred, possibly until fiscal year 2000. According to the Corps, the decision to defer work was based on the pending 1999 decision on whether or not to draw down or breach the dams on the lower Snake River. Specifically, the expenditure of up to $19 million on the improvements could be negated if the drawdown option is selected for the Snake River dams. According to Corps biologists, delays in implementing the modifications to the Lower Granite juvenile fish bypass modifications forestall some interim benefits from new state-of-the-art design features; however, the existing bypass system has a less-than-1-percent direct mortality measure, and improvements over that rate are hard to quantify.", "An example of a project delay caused by the Regional Forum\u2019s desire to test new technology occurred at The Dalles Dam located on the lower Columbia River. In appropriation legislation (Public Law 100-371) for fiscal year 1989, the Congress directed the Corps to design, test, and construct a juvenile fish bypass system for improving the efficiency of juvenile fish passage at The Dalles Dam. A juvenile fish bypass system was not originally installed when The Dalles Dam was completed in 1957. The dam\u2019s turbines, spillway, and ice and trash sluiceway\u2014a waterway used to pass ice and trash around the dam\u2014have been used to bypass juvenile fish around the dam. The lack of an efficient bypass system resulted in significant mortality rates in juvenile fish. Specifically, juvenile fish that go through the turbines experience mortality rates estimated to be as great as 15 percent. In addition, preliminary results of the Corps\u2019 ongoing spillway survival study indicate that the mortality rate for juvenile fish using the spillway\u2014a rate the Corps had earlier assumed to be approximately 2 percent\u2014may actually be as high as 12 percent. Likewise, observed hydraulic conditions in the ice and trash sluiceway and observed predator densities\u2014such as excessive numbers of squawfish\u2014at the sluiceway outfall have led the Corps to conclude that utilizing the existing ice and trash sluiceway to bypass juvenile fish may be unacceptable. In March 1994, the Corps issued a feature design memorandum providing for the design, construction, and operations and maintenance of a juvenile fish bypass system consisting of an extended-length submerged bar screen at The Dalles Dam. Construction was to have begun in October 1995, and the bypass system was to have been fully operational by March 1998 at a cost of more than $123 million. However, in November 1994, with approximately $20 million already invested, the Corps indefinitely deferred the project. The new bypass system was deferred because of intense congressional and Regional Forum interest in the feasibility and benefits of a new technology\u2014a surface collection bypass system for juvenile fish. In addition, according to the Corps, it was assumed that in the interim, spilling juvenile fish over the dam\u2019s spillway would be a suitable and effective means of fish passage when used in conjunction with the ice and trash sluiceway.", "The Corps, in response to the Regional Forum, was to start testing this new technology at The Dalles Dam either in conjunction with, or in place of, the bypass system consisting of an extended-length submerged bar screen. However, a lack of funding for studies of the effectiveness of the surface collection bypass prototype has delayed the decision on whether or not to construct the extended-length submerged bar screen system. The current plan is for the Corps to test surface collection bypass prototypes at The Dalles Dam in 2001 and 2002. However, the prototype tests have already been delayed 2 years because of the low priority assigned by the Regional Forum for funding the project, and no funds have been allocated for surface collection studies at the dam in 1998. As a result of the decision to indefinitely defer construction of an extended-length submerged bar screen system pending results of the Corps\u2019 evaluation of the effectiveness of a prototype surface collection bypass system at The Dalles Dam, juvenile fish now attempting to pass the dam must still either go through the turbines, go over the spillway, or utilize the existing ice and trash sluiceway. Consequently, juvenile fish migrating down the river are still exposed to some of the same hydraulic conditions, predator densities, and mortality rates that the Corps found to be unacceptable in the mid-1980s.", "According to Corps officials, interim juvenile bypass measures, such as reducing the volume of water released over the spillway by more than 50 percent so that the mortality rate of juvenile fish going over the spillway may be reduced, are being considered for The Dalles Dam until a new bypass system is installed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concerns About the Regional Forum", "paragraphs": ["There have been ongoing concerns about the effectiveness of the Regional Forum\u2019s process.

The Corps\u2019 Seattle District contracted with Science Applications International Corporation with support from HDR Engineering, Inc., to conduct this study. In a June 13, 1997, report, the study found a number of deficiencies with the Regional Forum\u2019s process.", "First, the study found that the members of the Regional Forum do not share a common vision or goal for salmon recovery efforts. As a result, the actions required by the Biological Opinion are not uniformly supported. For example, through the Biological Opinion, NMFS has directed the implementation of structural and operational actions that may benefit listed salmon without removing dams. These actions are not uniformly supported by Regional Forum members as the most effective means of increasing fish survival. Several members of the Forum, primarily the Native American tribes with some concurrence by states, support drawdown to the natural river level as the most effective technique for listed species survival and recovery. The report states that differing goals are not conducive to implementing actions, especially when consensus is sought to make decisions. The study recommended that the Forum develop a single strategic recovery plan based on a consensus of its members. Second, the study found that the Regional Forum does not have a clearly defined process for making decisions on the implementation of fish passage projects when consensus is not possible. The report states that the net result is that minority views sometimes prevail and technical and policy decisions are not always made at the appropriate level within the Regional Forum. The study states that decisions should still be made by consensus, but not defined as a vote of 100 percent of the participants.", "The report recommends that consensus be defined as agreement that the parties can \u201call live with the decision and will not actively work to undermine it.\u201d The study further pointed out that although a new definition of consensus and the development of a common vision through a strategic plan will assist in reaching agreements, it will not always ensure the agreement of all parties. The study further recommended the establishment of a clear process to resolve disputes.", "Finally, the study found that setting priorities for projects, studies, and other fish passage activities has been repetitive and often contradictory. Fish mitigation activities, particularly those with multiple-year schedules, are brought before the appropriate Regional Forum subcommittee each year when appropriations are sought. Each time, the opponent(s) of a project has an opportunity to delay or cancel it, even if several years\u2019 investment has already occurred. The study recommended that project priorities and funding decisions be made at a specifically designated level in the Regional Forum. Furthermore, the report states that the priorities for projects should not be re-set unless new science would substantively alter an approach. The study team believes that these actions would reduce costs because projects that have started will not as likely be halted and/or have to be re-initiated.", "Responding to the criticisms directed at the overall effectiveness of the Regional Forum by many regional interests, in mid-1997, the Governors of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana called for the replacement of the federally led Regional Forum with one that would be jointly led by federal agencies, states, and Native American tribes. The proposed new panel has been referred to as the Three Sovereigns Forum.

For example, when the Corps\u2019 John Day Dam on the lower Columbia River was originally completed in 1971, it did not contain facilities for sampling and monitoring migrating juvenile fish. A sampling and monitoring facility was added to the dam in 1986. However, the Biological Opinion called for the installation of a new facility to improve the Corps\u2019 ability to monitor juvenile salmon migrating downstream. The Biological Opinion directed that the project be completed no later than 1997. In 1992, an NMFS contractor had completed a report addressing the feasibility and basic design of an updated facility. In August 1994, a Corps architect-engineer contractor began detailed design of the project using the concept presented in the NMFS feasibility report. In October 1994, the Corps, its architect-engineer, and NMFS determined that the design developed in the NMFS feasibility report was not workable because resulting hydraulic conditions could be harmful to juvenile fish. The Corps then directed its contractor to develop alternative designs for a new facility. In September 1995, the contractor completed the feature design memorandum for the alternative chosen by the Corps.", "The feature design memorandum, which presented a significant redesign of the project, estimated that the new facility would be fully operational by April 1997. However, the Corps encountered additional difficulties during the construction phase of the project. For example, after the construction of the project foundations was under way, the contractor encountered subsurface conditions different from those specified in the contract drawings. The different subsurface conditions resulted in the Corps\u2019 making changes in foundation designs, drilling procedures, and construction materials. The problems the Corps encountered during the design and construction of the new facility contributed to significant cost increases and project delays. The cost of the design contract increased from an initial award amount of about $755,000 to over $2.8 million. Work related to the redesign of the project after October 1994 accounted for about $407,000 of this increase. The cost of the construction contract increased from an initial award of about $16 million to a completion cost of over $21 million. The additional work the construction contractor performed because of differing site conditions accounts for the largest portion of the increase\u2014about $3.8 million. This work also delayed the contract completion date by almost 4 months. Reasons for the remaining cost increases include design deficiencies, project features that were changed or added after construction started, and additional services the contractors were required to perform, such as planning and performing on-site facility testing.", "In an effort to meet the March 1997 operational date, the Corps completed the design phase for the new facility on an expedited basis. However, according to Corps officials, the Corps\u2019 efforts to accelerate the normal design process contributed to cost increases and delays. For example, the Corps did not perform a formal technical review of the original NMFS feasibility report, as it would under normal procedures. Moreover, the Corps relied on geotechnical data collected in 1983 that did not accurately reflect subsurface structures and soil conditions in the project area. Finally, because the facility was not operational during the 1997 fish migration season, the Corps lost the ability to collect improved data on the juvenile fish migrating that year.", "According to Corps officials, the two projects and one study that encountered problems during unsuccessful attempts to streamline standard project management procedures were technically complex actions. They noted that problems can occur when accelerating the design of cutting-edge technology and that the main reason that procedures were bypassed or accelerated was to meet the time frames set forth in the Biological Opinion. The Corps also cited two examples of projects in which accelerating the design process was successful. Specifically, in these two projects\u2014one involving the installation of flow deflectors at Ice Harbor Dam and the other the design of a surface bypass prototype at Lower Granite Dam\u2014the Corps was able to complete the design phase on an expedited basis, thus saving substantial time. However, both of these projects were subsequently delayed for reasons unrelated to accelerating project design."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems Caused by Adverse Weather", "paragraphs": ["Weather played a significant role in delaying and/or increasing the cost of at least three projects and one study. The Corps\u2019 project to install flow deflectors at Ice Harbor Dam illustrates the impact that adverse weather can have on a project. In order to improve juvenile salmon passage, the Biological Opinion required the Corps to spill additional water over its eight dams during the fish migration season rather than passing those flows through turbines. The Corps also spills water on an involuntary basis when flows are high and exceed the powerhouse flow capacity at the dams. However, spilling river flows can cause the water below and downstream of the dams to become supersaturated with gases, such as nitrogen, normally found in the air. High levels of total dissolved gases can damage or kill salmon and are harmful to other aquatic organisms. Therefore, the Biological Opinion stated that the Corps should implement a gas abatement program at its dams. The program was to include structural modifications, such as the installation of flow deflectors at Ice Harbor Dam.", "The Corps awarded a construction contract for the Ice Harbor flow deflector project in July 1996 at a cost of over $2.7 million. It provided for the installation of deflectors on the dam\u2019s eight center spill bays by March 1997. On December 30, 1996, the control room operator at Ice Harbor Dam advised the contractor that, because of unusually high river flows, the Corps would begin releasing water over the spillway. Accordingly, the contractor was advised to remove construction equipment from the spill basin. The Corps began spilling river flows the next day at a rate of about 20,000 cubic feet per second. Discharge over the spillway reached 100,000 cubic feet per second early in the morning of January 1, 1997.", "On February 6, 1997, after having installed four deflectors, the Corps and the contractor agreed that because of high river flows, the need to continue spilling at the dam, and the upcoming juvenile fish migration season, construction activities would be discontinued until September 1997. From September to November 1997, the contractor completed the remaining four deflectors and removed equipment from the construction site. However, the delay in project completion of about 7-1/2 months led to a significant cost increase. Specifically, the Corps agreed to pay the construction contractor about $895,000 for costs associated with the delay, including the cost of one additional construction mobilization and demobilization to complete the remaining flow deflectors and standby costs associated with keeping equipment available until construction could resume. According to Corps officials, they recognized and were concerned about the risks associated with performing this work in such a tight time frame in the winter. Therefore, they asked the Regional Forum for permission to begin this work in early August. However, the Regional Forum denied this request on the basis of their need to continue spill during the entire month of August, as provided for in the Biological Opinion.", "Because the contractor installed only four instead of the eight flow deflectors planned before demobilizing because of high river flows, the Corps did not achieve the full reduction on total dissolved gas in time for the 1997 juvenile salmon migration. The Corps projected that the installation of the remaining four deflectors would provide a further reduction in total dissolved gas levels of 3 percent to 5 percent. However, the Corps did not have sufficiently refined data to determine the survival gain that will result from this increment in total dissolved gas reduction.

For example, in the 1980s, the Corps installed a juvenile fish bypass system consisting of submerged screens, collection channels, and outfall flumes on the Bonneville Dam. Subsequently, numerous Corps and NMFS fish passage studies identified significant problems with the bypass system. Among other things, the studies showed that the juvenile fish were using the bypass system less than 50 percent of the time. A goal of the Biological Opinion is to have at least 80 percent of the downriver migrating juvenile fish pass around each dam, including Bonneville Dam, either through a bypass system or over a spillway, and at least 95 percent of these bypassed juvenile fish are to survive. Recognizing that the existing Bonneville Dam bypass system could not meet this standard, Corps and NMFS fish biologists and engineers determined that the installation of a surface collection bypass system at Bonneville Dam could potentially assist in meeting the efficiency goals of juvenile fish guidance as specified in the Biological Opinion.", "In August 1995, the Corps\u2019 prototype development program for surface collection bypass systems specified that installation of the prototypes at Bonneville Dam\u2019s two powerhouses and spillway was to start in 1996. However, the start of the prototype installations at the first and second powerhouses has been delayed until 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the installation of the prototype at the spillway has been deferred indefinitely. According to the Corps, these delays and deferral occurred for a variety of reasons. Specifically: Installation of the bypass system prototype at the first powerhouse was delayed because (1) model testing had not been performed to assess the hydraulic conditions within the area, (2) a detailed biological study plan for testing the prototype had not been completed, (3) the potential location of the prototype in relationship to the turbines had not been modeled and completed, and (4) there was a lack of regional support because hydraulic conditions within the prototype had not been completely modeled. Installation of the bypass system at the second powerhouse was delayed because the Regional Forum made the recommendation to limit funds at Bonneville Dam in order to implement juvenile fish bypass projects at the Corps\u2019 seven other dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers.", "After coordinating with the Regional Forum, the Corps deferred indefinitely the bypass system prototype at the Bonneville Dam spillway because the results of recent biological tests suggested that juvenile fish approaching the spillway pass the dam with minimal delay or injury.", "Furthermore, according to the Corps, the Regional Forum\u2019s low funding priority for surface collection bypass studies in 1998 has already delayed the completion of surface collection prototype studies at the dam\u2019s first powerhouse until 2001. As a result, a major decision on which bypass concept to pursue at the first powerhouse may be based, in part, on the results of limited studies of surface collection prototypes. According to the Corps, the amount of information available on surface bypass efficiency, balanced by the cost of additional prototypes and the likelihood of success, as well as the improved guidance efficiency obtained from the extended-length screen tests, will be considered before implementation decisions are reached. In the interim, juvenile fish attempting to pass Bonneville Dam must rely on existing juvenile bypass systems that are successful less than 50 percent of the time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays Can Result in Continued High Fish Mortality Rates", "paragraphs": ["The Corps\u2019 fish passage efficiency studies showed that Ice Harbor Dam\u2019s bypass system, utilizing the dam\u2019s ice and trash sluiceway, provided for the passage of only about 35 to 50 percent of the juvenile fish migrating downriver. In an effort to improve fish passage efficiency, in December 1990, the Corps proposed to construct a high-flow juvenile fish bypass system at Ice Harbor Dam that would include submerged screens to guide juvenile fish away from the dam\u2019s turbines, a fish collection channel, and a transportation channel to pass fish around the dam and release them back into the Snake River. The proposed bypass system was approved by federal and state fish agencies (the Regional Forum did not exist yet), including NMFS, as well as by affected Native American tribes. The system was to be completed by February 1994. In June 1992, the fish agencies and tribes expressed two major concerns about the approved high-flow system. First, there was a significant area of shallow water\u2014prime predator habitat\u2014 downstream from the juvenile fish bypass release site. Second, the speed of the water in the high-flow bypass flume would not allow for the sampling of all juvenile fish bypassing the dam. As a result of these concerns, the Corps redesigned the bypass system from a high-flow to a low-flow system and extended the length of the bypass flume to the downriver side of the shallow water area. According to Corps officials, the need to redesign the bypass system resulted in a 2-year delay in the planned construction completion date. In addition, according to the Corps, the 2-year delay could have had a significant negative impact on the juvenile fish that attempted to bypass Ice Harbor Dam because they may have gone either through the dam\u2019s turbines or over the dam\u2019s spillway, where they could have experienced mortality rates of 15 percent and 2 percent, respectively. However, another Corps official pointed out that impacts associated with the delay were at least partially offset by the installation of submerged traveling screens in 1993 under a separate contract. In addition, this official said the delay resulted in a better outfall flume in terms of design and discharge location, providing juvenile fish with survival benefits that exceeded the impacts associated with the 2-year delay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays Can Result in Lost Power Generation and Related Potential Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Problems with completing fish mitigation projects can also lead to a loss of potential power generation and the associated potential revenues. Early evaluation of the juvenile fish bypass system at the Corps\u2019 dams, including the McNary Dam on the lower Columbia River, revealed the need for refinements to improve fish guidance efficiency. For example, the McNary Dam studies indicated that the existing 20-foot bar screen guidance system in front of the turbines directed only about 40 percent of the fall chinook salmon away from the dam\u2019s turbines and into the bypass collection channel. As a result, in March 1994, after years of study and testing, the Corps recommended the installation of new extended-length (40-foot) screens to optimize fish guidance. The Corps planned to install the new screens by December 1996. In addition, the Biological Opinion called for the completion of this project in time for the spring 1997 juvenile chinook salmon migration. In response to the Biological Opinion, the Corps accelerated its design and contracting process to meet the implementation date. In March 1995, the Corps entered into a contract for the construction and installation of 42 extended-length submerged bar screens (one for each of the three gatewells over each of the dam\u2019s 14 turbines); all screens were to be in place and fully operational by December 27, 1996. However, shortly after the installation of the first batch of new screens, dam operations personnel found frequent problems with the brush arm control\u2014the device used to control the extent of movement by the brush arm as it removes debris from the screen. Fixing the problem required the operators to take the turbine off line and raise the screen in the gatewell to reset the control limit switch\u2014a half-day operation. In response to the problems and increased maintenance costs, the installation of the remaining screens was delayed until the design problem was fixed. In May 1996, a new design utilizing different technology was adopted for controlling the sweep arm. Project personnel replaced the original control devices, began installing the remaining 30 screens, and completed the installation of the screens in March 1997\u20143 months later than originally planned.", "According to Corps officials, problems with the sweep control device were experienced during prototype testing and a new, untested design was proposed for the contract. However, the pressure to meet the Biological Opinion\u2019s completion date required expedited contracting procedures to finalize design drawings for the contract solicitation package which left no time for additional testing. A major impact stemming from the failure of the sweep control device was the loss of power generating capacity during the spring 1996 salmon migration season. Project personnel reported that there were 2,422 hours of forced turbine outage at McNary in 1996 directly attributable to problems with the sweep control devices. At the Bonneville Power Administration\u2019s estimated revenue of $2,000 per generating hour, the outage equates to about $5 million in potential lost power revenue in 1996. A Corps official noted, however, that this amount of potential lost revenue would only be realized if the powerhouse was operating at capacity\u2014which seldom occurs. As such, the official believed the potential lost revenue was likely to be much less than $5 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems Implementing Fish Mitigation Actions Can Increase Operations and Maintenance Costs", "paragraphs": ["The inability to complete fish mitigation projects can also result in an increase in dams\u2019 operations and maintenance costs. For example, in 1995, the Corps awarded a contract for the construction and installation of extended-length submerged bar screens at the Little Goose Dam located on the lower Snake River. As was the case at McNary Dam, the Corps encountered numerous problems with the new screens, and completion of the project was delayed about 11 months. One of the major problems with the Little Goose extended-length screens was that steel plates, perforated with holes to ensure uniform water flow through each screen, failed because of broken high-tension bolts. The broken bolts, which allowed perforated plates to fall off some of the screens, forced the Corps to remove each of the 18 screens from the river for repair. Consequently, the Corps\u2019 operations and maintenance costs were increased by about $24,000. In addition, according to Bonneville Power, hydroelectric power production at Little Goose Dam was reduced because the turbines behind the removed screens had to be taken out of operation until the screens were repaired and replaced. This resulted in lost power revenues of about $745,000 to Bonneville Power. The extended-length screen bolt problem is being investigated by the Corps, and the results of the analysis should be available by December 1998. In the interim, the Corps is monitoring the screens and periodically removing them from the river to ensure that the perforated plates remain in place and to replace bolts that break. This monitoring effort, however, continues to reduce hydroelectric power production and power revenues at the dam and increases the Corps\u2019 operations and maintenance costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Increases Can Result in Project Changes and Lost Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["Of the 19 fish mitigation actions we reviewed, 9 had cost increases that totaled over $20 million. Since the Corps\u2019 fish mitigation program receives an annual appropriation, when one fish mitigation action incurs a cost increase, the opportunity to use those funds on other projects may be lost. In addition, the Corps may have to revise the scope or implementation schedules for certain projects or studies. For example, the Biological Opinion requires the Corps to conduct a feasibility study of ways to improve the migration of juvenile salmon through its lower Snake River dams. The study focuses on three alternatives: existing condition, drawdown of the dams, and system improvements that could be accomplished without a drawdown. Because of changes in the scope of this study, primarily expanding the analysis of the social and economic impacts of the alternatives being considered, the Corps incurred a cost increase of about $4 million. As a result, the Corps reduced the scope of other study components such as water quality analyses. Moreover, since the overall study will now consume a larger portion of the total funding available to the fish mitigation program, the Corps, in conjunction with the Regional Forum, made adjustments in the funding of other lower priority fish mitigation actions. For example, funding for the Corps\u2019 study of potential improvements to auxiliary water supply systems for adult fish ladders at Snake River dams was reduced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["While the majority of the Corps\u2019 fish mitigation actions have been or are expected to be on schedule and within budget, the Corps has encountered difficulties implementing many of its fish mitigation projects.

Furthermore, the Corps\u2019 agreement to work cooperatively with regional interests through the Regional Forum has, on occasion, subjected it to changing fish mitigation priorities, including which projects or studies are to be funded, when they are to be funded, and at what funding level. However, the effectiveness of the Regional Forum has been questioned because, among other things, members do not agree on how to pursue salmon recovery efforts and do not uniformly support the actions required by the Biological Opinion. Differing goals are not conducive to implementing fish mitigation actions, especially when consensus is sought to make decisions.", "In addition, some delays and cost increases have been caused by the Corps\u2019 unsuccessful attempts to streamline its project management process in order to meet deadlines imposed by the Biological Opinion. In these cases, there appears to be a trade-off. According to the Corps, by accelerating the design phase of some projects, it completed this phase expeditiously.
