As currently structured, the programs are at risk of not delivering intended capabilities for the first spiral of FCS, slated to start in fiscal year 2008. The JTRS Cluster 1 program--a program to develop radios for ground vehicles and helicopters--began development with an aggressive schedule, immature technologies, and a lack of clearly defined and stable requirements. As currently designed, the radio will only have a transmission range of only 3 kilometers--well short of the required 10 kilometers--and will not meet security requirements for operating in an open networked environment. The program's struggle to mature and integrate key technologies has contributed to significant cost and schedule growth. A recent review of the program concluded that the current program structure is not executable, and in April 2005, DOD directed the Army to stop work and notify the contractor that it was considering terminating the contract. Meeting requirements for JTRS Cluster 5 radios--miniaturized radios, including those that soldiers carry--is even more technically challenging given their smaller size, weight, and power needs. The smallest of these radios weighs only about 1 pound, compared with 84 pounds for Cluster 1 radios. Several programmatic changes and a contract award bid protest have further slowed program progress. The Army is considering options for restructuring the program to meet the needs of FCS and address the technical issues encountered in the Cluster 1 program. The Army does not expect to fully mature the technologies for WIN-T--communications equipment that supports an expanded area of battlefield operations and interfaces with JTRS radios--when production begins in March 2006. Moreover, the compressed schedule assumes nearly flawless execution and does not allow sufficient time for correcting problems. Significant interdependencies among the critical technologies further increase overall program risk. The program was directed to deliver networking and communications capabilities sooner to meet near-term warfighting needs and synchronize with the restructured FCS program. A plan for how to develop and field WIN-T capabilities sooner to address FCS needs remains undetermined. According to Army network system integration officials, SOSCOE--the operating software to integrate the communications network--may not reach the necessary technical maturity level required to meet program milestones. In addition, top-level FCS requirements are still evolving and have not been translated into more detailed specifications necessary for writing SOSCOE software."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To counter the complex set of battlefield threats that have emerged since  the Cold War, the Army has embarked on a major transformation of its  force.

FCS will  depend on this network to provide Army warfighters and commanders  with the high-quality data and real-time communications needed to  identify and respond to threats with speed, precision, and lethality.

Through this transformation, the Army  expects to establish a force that provides both the lethality and  survivability of today\u2019s heavily armored units and the deployability and  responsiveness of today\u2019s lighter combat units. As envisioned, the future  force will operate very differently than forces have in the past. It will  function in smaller, more agile and deployable modular brigade combat  teams (composed of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 personnel) that can react  quickly to changing missions and circumstances. To be effective, force  components\u2014soldiers, platforms, weapons, and sensors\u2014must be \u201cnet- centric,\u201d that is, closely linked and able to operate seamlessly together.", "The transformation involves two major, interrelated acquisitions: (1)  development of new advanced communications and networking systems\u2014 computers, software, and a wireless tactical internet\u2014to acquire,  exchange, and employ timely information throughout the battlespace and  (2) development of a new generation of battlefield vehicles, weapons, and  sensors. The Army has taken initial steps toward transformation through  its Digitization and Stryker programs. Under the Digitization program, the  Army installed computers, software, and interfaces to communications  systems on Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and other vehicles in  selected units that enable both in-theater and higher commands to share  battlefield data with lower-level units. The Stryker program introduced a  new family of vehicles expected to make units more lethal, mobile, and  survivable than today\u2019s light forces.

Even though the restructuring provided additional time to the  program, it also emphasized developing FCS capabilities in spirals and  accelerating the development of the network into the current force. The  Army now plans to test and field its FCS capabilities incrementally  between 2008 and 2014 through four spirals. A 2-year period of testing will  precede the actual fielding of capabilities in each spiral.

Although many of the technologies  had been used in other radio applications, significant technical advances  were nonetheless required for developing key components of the radio.  The program\u2019s acquisition strategy, for example, highlighted technology  risks associated with the following requirements:    Wideband Networking Waveform: As the core of the JTRS networking  capability, the Wideband Networking Waveform is to operate across a  wide range of radio frequency spectrum, 2 megahertz (MHz) to 2  gigahertz (GHz), and provide increased routing and networking  capabilities. The Wideband Networking Waveform must also be  compliant with the Software Communications Architecture, which  demands a modular approach to waveform design, imposing much  greater processing and memory requirements.  This is especially  critical for FCS, as the waveform is to provide what has been called the  backbone or main conduit of the FCS network.", "Security: The JTRS radio set is intended to operate applications at  multiple levels of security. For it to do so, developers not only have to  be concerned with traditional radio security issues but also must be  prepared to implement the features required for network and computer  security. This will require development of new technologies, obtaining  certification through a rigorous process by the National Security  Agency, and accommodating an expected growth in security  requirements.", "Interference mitigation: Prior to JTRS, tactical radios were largely  designed for single channel and single band operations. Because JTRS  radio sets will operate multiple channels\u2014-as many as eight  channels\u2014-simultaneously within the same radio set, developers must  ensure that communications over one channel do not interfere with  communications over another, because such interference would  degrade the quality of service and limit the radio\u2019s high data rate  capability.", "The accelerated acquisition strategy compressed the development cycle  and allowed little time for testing prior to key development decisions. For  example, the schedule called for making the initial production decision for  selected platforms immediately following an early operational assessment  of a partially functioning prototype of the JTRS radio in surrogate vehicles  (see fig. 3). This is in contrast to the knowledge-based approach captured  in best practices, which advocates making production decisions based on  an assessment of production-representative prototypes in a realistic  environment. Historically, programs that must define requirements,  develop technology, and design products concurrently have experienced  cost increases and schedule delays. While the Army recognized the risk of  moving forward with immature technologies, it expected that emerging  technologies in radio software technology would enable it to develop the  critical technologies and integrate them into the product quickly.", "Despite the Army\u2019s expectations to leverage current and emerging radio  technologies, the critical technologies for the JTRS Cluster 1 radio have  generally not matured. The program is also struggling to derive detailed  specifications for Cluster 1 requirements. Despite the lack of mature  technologies and detailed specifications, the Army held the program\u2019s  critical design review\u2014the point at which design stability is to be achieved  and demonstrated\u2014in December 2003. However, with the requirements  still evolving, the program expects to make several costly hardware and  software design modifications. For example:    The current processing and memory capacity of the Network INFOSEC  Unit, which contains the operating software, is insufficient to support  full systems operation, including waveform processing, enhanced  security, and power management. The program plans to double the  Network INFOSEC Unit\u2019s capacity from 256 megabytes of memory to  512 megabytes, which will require changes to the hardware design.", "The National Security Agency has recently determined that the current  design is not sufficient to meet security requirements to operate in an  open networked environment. Specifically, particular versions of JTRS  radios will be used by allied and coalition forces, requiring the Army to  release specific source code of the software architecture to these  forces. To address the release, the National Security Agency has  required changes to the security architecture.

To realize the full capabilities of the Wideband Networking Waveform,  including transmission range, the Cluster 1 radio requires significant  amounts of memory and processing power, which add to the size, weight,  and power consumption of the radio. The added size and weight are the  result of efforts to ensure electronic parts in the radio are not overheated  by the electricity needed to power the additional memory and processing.  Thus far, the program has not been able to develop radios that meet size,  weight, and power requirements, and the current projected transmission  range is only 3 kilometers\u2014well short of the 10-kilometer range required  for the Wideband Networking Waveform. As a consequence, more  unmanned aerial vehicles may be needed to relay information. Intended  ground vehicle users have accepted a deviation in the design\u2014to have  some of the radio\u2019s hardware mounted separately outside the vehicle\u2014 with the expectation that the contractor will develop a better solution later  on. However, deviations were not accepted for the helicopters because it  would necessitate major design changes to the aircraft and adversely  affect the aircraft modernization schedules. Unlike ground vehicles,  aviation platforms are limited in their ability to compromise on size,  weight, and power issues because of the difficulty in maintaining  equilibrium while airborne.

Power management  refers to the set of technologies that facilitate a reduction in energy  consumption or an increase in battery capacity with the goal of  obtaining longer operating time and a reduced battery size and weight.", "Multichannel architecture: Multichannel JTRS radios are required to  provide multiple, independent channels to simultaneously transmit and  receive information using different waveforms. The compact size of the  Cluster 5 radios and requirement for simultaneous multichannel  operation present a co-site interference mitigation challenge.", "Antennas: Cluster 5 JTRS radios are required to transmit and receive  multiple waveforms over the large frequency range 2 MHz to 2.5 GHz  and are further required to transmit and receive two separate  waveforms simultaneously with a maximum of three antennas.  The  requirements impose unique technical challenges for both antenna and  radio designs.", "Security: Cluster 5 security framework must support Multiple Single  Levels of Security to allow the processing of information with different  classifications and categories. It also must support an over-the-air  download capability of waveforms, which will entail large software  files. It has yet to be demonstrated in a relevant environment.", "The Cluster 5 radios are required to store and operate the Wideband  Networking Waveform. This will provide high data rates and networking  capabilities for mobile forces. The full Wideband Networking Waveform  requires significant amounts of memory and processing power, which may  not be available for the Cluster 5 radios. According to the program office,  the principal challenge in operating the Wideband Networking Waveform  on Cluster 5 radios stems from the significantly smaller size, weight, and  power requirements when compared with those for Cluster 1, as well as  safety and heat considerations for the soldier. Because of the difficulties in  overcoming these challenges, the Cluster 5 program is seeking to ease the  waveform\u2019s requirements and reduce the power demands of the software.", "The Cluster 5 program is also developing another new, wideband  waveform called the Soldier Radio Waveform. Although less powerful than  the Wideband Networking Waveform, it is expected to provide the needed  network services for battery-powered radios with limited power and  antenna size such as the handheld and the small form varieties. Cluster 5  radios with the Soldier Radio Waveform will enable squad-level  communications and interoperability with other radios and work on a  network based on the Wideband Networking Waveform. The Soldier Radio  Waveform is expected to be available in 2008. However, the development  of this waveform is being managed as a science and technology effort by  the Army\u2019s Communications-Electronics Research Development and  Engineering Center until it is matured and can be transitioned into the  JTRS program. To support the first FCS spiral in the 2008-2010 timeframe,  the Army has acknowledged that it may have to use an early version of the  Soldier Radio Waveform and a surrogate radio to operate the waveform.  Compounding the challenges in developing the waveform is the Army\u2019s  assessment that developing the Soldier Radio Waveform\u2019s network  manager is high risk and has yet to be funded.

However, the  program office noted that, since contract award, the prime contractor has  not demonstrated strong cost estimating and cost management techniques.", "Cluster 1 has also experienced unfavorable schedule variance. Figure 9  indicates that the contractor increasingly fell behind schedule during the  period August 2003-January 2005. If a program is not only overrun in costs,  but is also behind schedule, additional costs can be expected because of  potential schedule slippage or from acceleration of the effort to finish on  time. The schedule variance stabilized briefly after the program  rebaselined in January 2004, but then it continued to increase again.  By  January 2005, the value of planned work that the contractor was behind  schedule was about $25 million. Delays in software build completions,  software/hardware integration, and the delivery of key technologies to the  waveform developers have contributed to schedule problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
