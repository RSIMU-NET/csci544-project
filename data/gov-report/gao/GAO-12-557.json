An other transaction  agreement is a special vehicle used for obtaining or advancing research  and development or prototypes. This authority provides the DHS Science  and Technology Directorate the flexibility to reach nontraditional  contractors, that is, those that traditionally have not done business with  the government. However, other transaction agreements carry the risk of  reduced accountability and transparency, in part because they are  exempt from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the  government\u2019s cost accounting standards. Congress recently authorized  the use of this authority through September 2012. Congress required  that we report on DHS\u2019s use of this authority to help determine if its use  attracts nontraditional contractors, results in the acquisition of needed  technologies, and whether additional safeguards are needed if the  authority were to be made permanent.", "In 2004, we reported on the Science and Technology Directorate\u2019s use of  other transaction authority and made recommendations to improve its  use. In 2008, we reported that nontraditional contractor involvement in  DHS other transaction agreements provided a variety of technologies and  services described by DHS as critical, and that DHS continued to develop  policies and procedures for other transaction agreements. We also found  that DHS faced challenges in systematically assessing its use of these  agreements and maintaining a skilled contracting workforce and made  recommendations to address these and other challenges.we reviewed (1) the Science and Technology Directorate\u2019s use of other  transaction authority, (2) the extent to which DHS has addressed  challenges we previously identified with its use of the authority, and   (3) the information DHS collects and reports on the use of other  transaction authority.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed other transaction agreement data  provided by DHS and interviewed program and acquisition officials  regarding any trends in use from fiscal years 2004 through 2011. We  drew upon our prior reports on other transactions, annual reports to  Congress by DHS, and relevant statutes, directives, and guidance. We  also reviewed the files for 27 of the 28 other transaction agreements that  were active on or after April 2008 through September 2011 and  interviewed DHS representatives as needed.

Other transaction authority provides the ability to  acquire cutting-edge science and technology, in part through attracting  entities that typically have not pursued government contracts because of  the cost and impact of complying with government procurement  requirements. This authority, when used selectively, is a tool intended to  help the Science and Technology Directorate leverage commercial  technology to reduce the cost of homeland security items and systems.  Other transaction agreements are distinct from procurement contracts,  grants, or cooperative agreements because of the flexibilities that they  offer to both awardees and the government. For example, they allow the  federal government and awardees flexibility in negotiating intellectual  property and data rights, which stipulate each party\u2019s rights to technology  developed under the agreements. The flexibility of other transaction  agreements is an important characteristic to attract nontraditional  contractors. We previously reported, however, that because these  agreements do not have a standard structure based on regulatory  guidelines, they can be challenging to create and administer.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 originally authorized DHS to carry out  a 5-year pilot program to exercise other transaction authority. in 2007, other transaction authority has been extended annually through  appropriations legislation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes  DHS to enter into an other transaction agreement that advances the development, testing, and evaluation of critical  supports basic, applied, and advanced research and development;  technologies; and  carries out prototype projects.", "Pub.

This \u201cdetect-to- protect\u201d system would monitor a facility and detect the presence of  biological agents in time to provide sufficient warning to facility occupants  to limit their exposure (see left image in fig. 1). A different Science and  Technology Directorate program used an other transaction agreement to  develop and test a new high-voltage transformer that helps provide power  during the recovery time following blackouts or outages resulting from  severe natural disasters or terrorist attacks (see right image in fig. 1).", "The period of performance for other transaction agreements varies and  may last longer than a traditional FAR contract. Other transaction  agreements are generally structured in successive phases, so each  project may have several phases. At the end of a phase, the awardees  submit a statement of work and technical and cost proposals for the next  phase. Continuation between phases may be based on an independent  technical evaluation and is not guaranteed. Unlike FAR contracts, which  are generally limited to a length of 5 years, an other transaction  agreement may continue as long as funding is available and work is  required under a phase. As a result, other transaction agreements can  vary in length, from 3 months to over 7 years, as shown in figure 2.", "Further, the funding for other transaction agreements may grow over  time. For example, in one other transaction agreement, the Science and  Technology Directorate obligated $200,000 in the first phase with an 8- month period of performance. This agreement has been in existence for  almost 7 years with at least $5.3 million obligated on it.

From fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2011, the Science and  Technology Directorate entered into 58 other transaction agreements,  totaling $583 million in obligations. Fourteen agreements remained active  in fiscal year 2011 and the directorate has not entered into a new other  transaction agreement since fiscal year 2010. The Science and  Technology Directorate\u2019s use of other transaction authority has declined  since 2005 when it entered into 28 new agreements. Total obligations  also have declined since peaking at $151 million in 2006 (see fig. 3).", "DHS officials offered reasons for the decline in use of other transaction  authority. DHS acquisition officials told us that recently they have noted a  decrease in the number of nontraditional contractors submitting proposals  to use other transaction agreements while the use of FAR contracts has  increased. Further, one official explained that as DHS\u2019s requirements  have changed over time, the requirements have targeted different  industries. Finally, DHS officials have been uncertain about renewal of  other transaction authority. For example, in fiscal year 2011, there was a  gap in DHS\u2019s other transaction authority because the continuing  resolution did not extend the authority until April 2011. DHS officials  explained that they were unsure if DHS had the authority to enter into  new agreements or modify existing agreements under continuing  resolutions. However, while use has declined, DHS officials said the  flexibility provided by other transaction authority to conduct business with  nontraditional contractors is still important to the directorate\u2019s research  needs. For example, one program manager explained that without other  transaction authority, DHS would be required to go through a traditional  contractor to reach a nontraditional contractor, and this could affect the  Science and Technology Directorate\u2019s ability to directly obtain the  necessary technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Steps to Address Challenges, but Actions Are Not Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made some progress in addressing challenges and the related  recommendations we previously made regarding its use of other  transaction agreements (see fig. 4).

Involving nontraditional contractors is one of the benefits of  having other transaction authority, yet without knowing how many are  involved or for how long, DHS is not in a position to measure the benefits  of using the special acquisition authority.", "While DHS\u2019s guidance requires it to document the rationale for using  other transaction authority, DHS does not do this consistently. One of the  following three conditions must be met to use an other transaction  agreement for prototypes: (1) there is at least one nontraditional  government contractor participating to a significant extent, (2) at least  one-third of the total cost of a prototype project is to be paid out of funds  provided by parties to the transaction other than the federal government,  or (3) the DHS Chief Procurement Officer determines, in writing, that  exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for  innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible  or appropriate under a procurement contract. Since 2005, DHS other  transaction guidance requires that this rationale be documented in an  agreement analysis that should be maintained in the other transaction  agreement file. We found that the agreement analysis is not consistently  documented in the files. In our review of 11 other transaction for prototype  agreement files, we found inconsistent documentation of the agreement  analysis\u20147 other transaction agreement files contained an agreement  analysis document for the initial award and 4 did not contain an  agreement analysis document. These 4 other transaction agreement  files that do not contain any agreement analysis documentation were  awarded recently, from 2007 to 2009. DHS other transaction agreement  officers said they rely on the agreement analysis to learn the background  on agreements they have inherited from previous other transaction  agreement officers. Given the high turnover of acquisition staff, the  agreement analysis document is an important tool to capture information  about the rationale for use of other transaction authority.", "Recent annual reports to Congress on other transaction activity have  been incomplete. DHS is required to provide an annual report to  Congress detailing the projects for which other transaction authority was  used, the rationale for its use, the funds spent using the authority, the    outcome of each project, and the results of any audits of such projects. We previously reported that DHS\u2019s June 30, 2008 report to Congress did  not include 14 agreements from the reporting period.current analysis of DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 congressional report and other  transaction agreement files, we found that DHS did not report three  agreements that received funding totaling over $3.2 million in obligations,   Based on our  or 22 percent of other transaction obligations for the year. In addition,  DHS does not include information on open agreements that did not  involve the exercise of an option or the award of a new phase during the  reporting period. While this information is not expressly required by the  legislation, without it DHS is not providing a complete picture of the use of  its authority. Based on our file review, we found the following other  transaction agreements which were not reported in DHS\u2019s 2009 and 2010  annual congressional reports (see fig. 5).", "For example, one open other transaction agreement, which was not  reported in the fiscal year 2009 annual report, included a payment  schedule with four dates during fiscal year 2009 totaling about   $10 million. Without accurate information about the universe of other  transaction agreements, Congress may be unable to oversee DHS\u2019s use  of its other transaction authority.", "Further, we found that DHS does not track information to measure the  benefits of other transaction authority, which include reaching  nontraditional contractors. DHS\u2019s guidance states that the government  team, which includes acquisition and program officials, should establish  and track metrics that measure the value or benefits directly attributable  to the use of other transaction authority. But DHS officials told us they  have not established metrics.", "In addition, DHS does not collect information at each phase of an other  transaction agreement to determine if the original circumstances  permitting the use of other transaction authority still exist. Specifically,  DHS does not track the involvement of a nontraditional contractor  throughout the various phases of the other transaction agreement. Based  on our file review, we identified 11 other transaction agreements that cited  the significant contribution of a subawardee nontraditional contractor as  the circumstance permitting the use of other transaction authority.  However, we found that six of these agreement files did not include  documentation to demonstrate that the subawardee nontraditional  contractor was involved during one or more phases of the agreement. For  example, one nontraditional contractor was involved as a subawardee for  14 months, but the other transaction agreement lasted 40 months. While  circumstances frequently change when conducting research or prototype  development, the Science and Technology Directorate does not have  visibility into the impact of these changes over time.", "In contrast, the Department of Defense (DOD) has determined that  tracking information about participants, which includes nontraditional  contractors, is important to managing its other transaction authority. In  its guidance, DOD requires defense agencies and military departments to  report significant changes to key participants involved in the agreement.  This information is used to track the number of nontraditional contractors  involved in other transaction agreements, which DOD officials use to  measure the benefit of its other transaction authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Even with the recently reduced use of other transaction authority, the  Science and Technology Directorate continues to identify this as an  important tool that provides the flexibilities needed to develop critical  technologies.

While DHS has responded to our prior  recommendations, it still faces challenges addressing our  recommendation to develop a mechanism to collect and track relevant  data. Without consistent information on the universe of other transaction  agreements, DHS continues to report inaccurate or incomplete  information on the use of its other transaction authority in its annual report  to Congress. This may undermine Congress\u2019s ability to obtain a full  picture on the use of this special acquisition authority. DHS has taken  steps by updating its guidance to require documentation of lessons  learned; however, the guidance is not being implemented. In particular,  we found that DHS does not document lessons learned from completed  other transaction agreements nor has it consistently documented the  agreement analysis, as required by guidance. Other transaction  agreements may be in place for an extended time period and obligate a  significant amount of funds, yet DHS does not have full information on  other transaction activity at each phase of the award. Involving  nontraditional contractors is one of the circumstances permitting the use  of other transaction authority, yet without knowing how many are involved  or for how long, DHS is not in a position to determine whether the  continued use of the other transaction authority is still the best approach  through the life of the agreement.
