The smallest of these communities typically lack the population base and level of economic activity that would generate sufficient passenger demand to make them profitable to air carriers. While larger communities in this group may have less difficulty in sustaining a base level of service, they may not be able to attract additional carriers to provide greater choice and lower fares. Smaller communities located near larger airports may also face reduced demand because passengers choose to use the larger airport with lower fares or more choices for flights. These communities also have difficulty because the airline industry is in turmoil, making less profitable operations increasingly vulnerable. Communities have taken a variety of steps to try to obtain or improve air service, such as marketing to increase passengers' demand for local service or offering financial incentives to airlines to attract new or enhanced service. At communities GAO studied in depth, financial incentives were most effective in attracting new service. However, the additional service often ceased when incentives ended. Longer-term sustainability may rest on a community's commitment to making air service a priority."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The airline industry has undergone profound change since 2000. The change was set in motion partly by the economic downturn that began during early 2001, and the terrorist attacks further reduced passenger levels and sent many airlines\u2019 revenues into a tailspin from which they have yet to recover. Many small communities, which already had relatively few flights to few destinations prior to those changes, lost additional service as airlines reduced capacity, streamlined fleets, and restructured networks.", "In March 2002, we reported that airlines reduced the total number of daily departures from small communities by almost 20 percent between October 2000 and October 2001. You asked us to follow up on that work by examining the problems these communities were facing and the steps that communities were taking to attract and keep the air service they desired. We focused our efforts on the following questions:   What challenges do small communities face in obtaining or retaining commercial passenger air service?", "What actions have state or local governmental units or small communities taken to enhance air service, and how successful have certain ones been?", "What factors, if any, affect the likelihood of success?   What implications does this analysis have for federal efforts to assist small community airports?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed Department of Transportation (DOT) information and contacted numerous state, airport, community, airline and industry trade group officials. We defined small communities as those served by small hub or nonhub airports. This encompassed a wide variation in communities, from isolated areas with populations of a few thousand and no scheduled air service to urban areas with populations of several hundred thousand and service from multiple airlines. Using federal grant applications and interviews with officials throughout the aviation community, we identified 292 small communities that had taken some steps (many as part of state-commissioned air service studies) to try to increase passenger demand or increase or enhance the supply of air service. To determine what challenges they faced, what actions they had taken to improve air service, and how successful some of these communities have been, we interviewed officials at 98 airports where efforts appeared to be more extensive. To develop further information on the factors that may increase the likelihood of success, we studied 12 of these communities in more detail. We selected these communities principally because they had used a variety of programs to improve their air service. We also selected them because they varied in population, level of economic activity and geographic location. We conducted our work from March 2002 to December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Additional information on our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1978 the Congress deregulated the airline industry, phasing out the federal government\u2019s control over domestic fares and routes served and allowing market forces to determine the price, quantity, and quality of service. Most major \u201cnetwork\u201d carriers, free to determine their own routes, developed \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d networks. These carriers provide nonstop service to many spoke cities from their hubs. The airports in the small spoke communities include the smallest airports in the nation\u2019s commercial air system. Depending on the size of those markets (i.e., the number of passengers flying nonstop between the hub and the spoke community), the network airlines may operate their own large jets or use regional affiliate carriers to provide service, usually with regional jet or turboprop aircraft. However, low-fare carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, use a different model, flying point-to-point generally to and from secondary airports in or near major metropolitan areas, such as Ontario International near Los Angeles and Chicago Midway. If passengers at many small communities wish to use the service of low-fare carriers, they have to drive to those airports.", "The nation\u2019s commercial airports are categorized into four main groups based on the annual number of passenger enplanements\u2014large hubs, medium hubs, small hubs, and nonhubs. The 31 large hubs and 35 medium hub airports together enplaned the vast majority\u201489 percent\u2014of the more than 709 million U.S. passengers in 2000. In contrast, the 71 small hubs enplaned about 8 percent, and the 409 nonhub airports enplaned only 3 percent of U.S. passengers.", "While airline deregulation has allowed increased competition and led to lower fares and better service for most air travelers, some small communities have suffered from relatively limited service and high airfares. The Congress, concerned about air service to small communities, established two programs\u2014the EAS program and the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program\u2014targeted at those communities\u2019 air service needs.", "The Congress established the EAS program as part of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. In general, the program guarantees that communities that received air service prior to deregulation will continue to receive air service. If an air carrier could not continue service to a community without incurring a loss, DOT (and before its sunset, the Civil Aeronautics Board) could then use EAS funds to award a subsidy to that carrier or another carrier willing to provide service. These subsidies are intended to cover the difference between a carrier\u2019s projected revenues and expenses and provide a 5 percent profit margin. As of July 1, 2002, the EAS program provided subsidies to air carriers to serve 114 communities, 79 of these in the continental United States. We reported in August 2002 that this number is expected to increase. Appropriations for the EAS program for fiscal year 2002 totaled $113 million.", "More recently, the Congress authorized the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program as part of AIR-21 (P.L. 106-181) to help small communities enhance their air service. Under this program DOT is authorized to award grants to 40 communities served by small hub or nonhub airports that have demonstrated air service deficiencies or higher than average airfares. Priority is given to communities that provide local matching funds. Congress appropriated $20 million for fiscal year 2002 for this program. The legislation contained provisions to allow DOT to work with and coordinate efforts with other federal, state, and local agencies to increase the viability of service to small communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Communities Face Challenges in Sustaining Desired Levels of Air Service", "paragraphs": ["The challenges now faced by small communities in obtaining or enhancing air service center on two main issues\u2014(1) limitations created by having a small population base from which to draw passengers and (2) an airline industry that, for the most part, is losing money and seeking ways to return to profitability. In economic terms, these challenges can be understood in terms of demand (the number of passengers, the level of service they desire, and the price they are willing to pay to obtain it) and supply (the potential providers and their costs in providing the service). A small population base may not generate sufficient demand to attract or retain competitive air service because the demand may be too low to generate a profit for airlines. As a result, the service that small communities obtain often does little to stimulate demand. Instead, if the community is located within driving distance of a larger airport, residents may forgo the local service and drive to a larger airport, where they have more choices and often pay lower fares. While small communities have reported that limited service is a long-standing problem, it has been exacerbated by the second main issue\u2014the current financial condition of most major U.S. airlines. Hit with declining revenues brought on by the economic downturn and events of September 11, most carriers have taken steps to minimize losses and cut costs. The airlines use sophisticated computer models to help them identify whether certain markets can be served profitably. These proprietary models take into account such considerations as the carrier\u2019s operating costs, estimated passenger traffic, and competition in the market (including the type of aircraft competitors used, the number of daily flights they scheduled, and the fares they charged). Small markets, which may offer little opportunity for profit, are prime candidates for cost-cutting considerations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges Created by Limited Demand", "paragraphs": ["The demand-related challenges that small communities face are linked to their limited populations, relatively low levels of economic activity, and (for those communities located relatively close to larger airports) the tendency of residents to use other airports with better service and lower fares. Population is a critical factor because it partly determines the level of demand that carriers can expect in considering whether to provide service. The smallest of the communities in our review had such a limited population base as to make it difficult to attract and retain service from even one carrier. In those communities that had larger populations\u2014such as those with small hub airports\u2014passengers may have relatively limited air service; that is, service from a limited choice of carriers to relatively few nonstop destinations, often at comparatively high fares.", "Relative to larger communities, small communities also tend to have lower levels of economic activity, as measured by such things as jobs or per capita income. In general, the level of economic activity present in small communities is positively correlated with the amount of air service those small communities received. We reported in March 2002, for example, that for every additional 25,000 jobs in a county, jet departures increased by 4.3 departures per week, and turboprop departures increased by 4.8 per week. Similarly, for every additional $5,000 in per capita income, jet departures increased by 3.3 per week and turboprop departures increased by 12.7. In other words, if two small communities were similar except that community A had $5,000 more in income per capita than community B, community A can be expected to have 16 more departures per week than community B. Changes in these same factors will also cause changes in demand and service within a community over time.", "Ironwood, Michigan, illustrates the effect of declining population and lowered economic activity on a community\u2019s passenger enplanements. Ironwood is located in the western portion of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. After the community\u2019s various iron and copper mines closed in the 1980s and 1990s, its population decreased from about 14,000 in the 1980s to about 6,800 today. Annual enplanements dropped from about 14,000 annually in the 1980s to 1,800 in 2001. Ironwood now receives subsidized air service through the EAS program. However, according to the manager of Ironwood\u2019s airport, many passengers choose to use an airport 90 miles away in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, because it offers better service and lower fares.", "The relationship between population and economic activity can also be seen in the levels of air service at the 12 small communities we studied in detail. These communities varied substantially in size and economic activity (see table 1). The larger communities tended to have higher levels of per capita income, larger manufacturing earnings, and more air service.", "Small communities may also experience passenger \u201cleakage\u201d\u2014that is, passengers seeking more choices, better schedules, or lower fares choose to drive to a larger airport instead. Leakage is a widespread challenge to air service at small communities. Of the 98 airport officials we interviewed, 83\u2014including all 12 of the communities we studied in detail\u2014cited leakage as a problem. Some small communities\u2019 airports are relatively close to a major airport, making it easy for a small community\u2019s passengers to use the larger airport. For example, a Maryland aviation official reported that many passengers drive 75 miles to the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. But even airport officials in Tallahassee, Florida, reported that passengers drove to such airports as Jacksonville (160 miles) in search of lower fares. In earlier work on air service to small communities, we also found leakage to be widely reported as a challenge for small community airports.", "To the extent that airline passengers make their decisions on the basis of price, leakage away from small community airports to larger airports may increase as low-fare carriers expand their operations. Southwest Airlines added more than 20 cities to its system between 1990 and November 2002 for a total of 58 cities served, and JetBlue Airways, which began service in February 2000, now serves 20 cities. DOT data indicates that low-fare carriers\u2019 share of U.S. domestic passengers has also grown from 5.5 percent in 1990 to 18 percent in 2001. According to the DOT Inspector General in an October 2002 report, low-fare carriers have continued to expand between September 2000 and September 2002. They offered 11 percent more seats, and their share of domestic air service (as measured in available seats) increased from 16 to 19 percent. Their expansion to additional cities may shift even more demand away from small community airports as passengers choose to drive to airports served by low-fare carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Communities Are Vulnerable to Carrier Cost- Cutting", "paragraphs": ["Against the backdrop of relatively limited demand, small communities face an additional set of challenges in that the nation\u2019s air carriers\u2014the suppliers of the service\u2014are facing considerable problems in operating profitably. Carriers are for-profit entities that need to recoup their costs and earn a profit. But in 2001 and 2002, the major airlines generally did not do so. Losses were in excess of $6 billion in 2001, and Wall Street analysts expected losses to exceed $8 billion in 2002. Just 2 years ago, most major U.S. carriers were earning profits.", "One reason for the lack of profitability is a downturn in passenger revenues. Between June 2001 and June 2002, six major U.S. network airlines experienced drops in revenue passenger miles of between 8 and 20 percent. The drop in passengers included high-yield business travelers, according to the Air Transport Association (ATA). This group of flyers has become more price sensitive in the current economic climate. That is, they began to behave more like leisure travelers, who forgo the flexibility of refundable, often last-minute tickets, in exchange for the lower prices of seats booked well in advance. ATA also reported that average domestic fares in September 2002 were almost 18 percent below September 2000 fares.", "A second reason for the lack of profitability is that air service is expensive to provide, partly because of carriers\u2019 high operating costs, which are incurred whether an aircraft is flown empty or full. These costs include labor, fuel, and maintenance. ATA data show that labor, fuel, and fleet costs make up almost 60 percent of carriers\u2019 total operating expenses and that increases in airline labor costs and aviation taxes have outpaced inflation. Carriers have taken many actions to lower their costs and restructure their operations since September 2001. However, they have not yet returned to profitability. Another major part of the expense of providing air service is \u201cstation\u201d costs, according to airline officials. These stations require staff to handle passengers, bags, and cargo. One airline official estimated that it can cost as much as $200,000 to set up a station for new service, and annual station operating costs can range from $370,000 to $550,000.", "Small communities may become cost-cutting targets because they are often a carrier\u2019s least profitable operation. To a degree, small communities shared in the overall service reductions that most carriers made in response to the economic slowdown and the events of September 11. We earlier reported that daily departures from 202 small communities had decreased by 19 percent between October 2000 and October 2001, with more of the reductions occurring after September 11. The DOT Inspector General reported recently that nonhub airports experienced a greater loss of direct service to and from 31 large airports than other airports, losing 17 percent of scheduled flights between September 2000 and September 2002.", "By comparison, small, medium, and large hub airports\u2019 reductions ranged from 5 to 10 percent.", "Even if the reductions in service to small communities were, in the aggregate, no greater than the reductions in larger communities, the effect on those small communities can be greater. In small communities, a service reduction can often mean not fewer flights, but a loss of service altogether, either from a competing carrier or from the only carrier providing service. For example, of the 202 communities included in our March 2002 study, the number of small communities served by only one airline increased from 83 in October 2000 to 95 in October 2001. Further, between September 2001 and September 2002, carriers notified DOT that they planned to eliminate service to 30 communities, 15 of which had service from only one carrier. Also, the remaining service might be so limited that it creates additional incentive for potential passengers to drive to larger airports. One state aviation official termed this cycle of reduced service and subsequently increased leakage as the \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Air Service Improvement Efforts Fall into Three Main Categories, but Financial Assistance Has Proven Most Effective", "paragraphs": ["Among the 98 communities we contacted that had taken steps to develop an air service improvement program, efforts tended to fall into three main categories. Over 75 percent of communities undertook some sort of study, such as examining the potential demand for new or enhanced air service. In addition, 78 percent conducted some sort of marketing activity to educate the public about the air service available or to inform carriers about potential for new or expanded service opportunities. Finally, 45 percent of the communities offered some sort of financial incentive to encourage carriers to provide the new or additional service. Small hub airports were slightly more likely than nonhub airports to implement these three types of efforts (see table 2). To assist readers\u2019 understanding of the economic effect of various programmatic or policy mechanisms to attract additional air service, appendix II discusses in more detail the general economic principles that underlie the level and type of air service at small communities.", "On the basis of our in-depth review at 12 of these communities, it appears that some sort of financial incentive is particularly important in translating a desire for new or enhanced service into an actual program that puts this service in place. However, even this level of effort may not be sufficient to sustain the service over the long term. Four of the five communities that had completed their service improvement efforts were unable to sustain the enhanced level of service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Studies Aid in Determining Communities\u2019 Air Service Needs", "paragraphs": ["Of the 98 airports we contacted, 75 reported conducting a study of their air service or participating in a multi-airport study. Studies covered such topics as potential demand for air service, types and levels of service desired by the community, extent of leakage to other airports, and barriers the community may need to overcome. These studies emanated from a variety of sources:   Airports with enough staff and expertise often developed and conducted studies themselves. For example, staff of the Mobile (Alabama) Regional Airport developed numerous service and leakage analyses in-house.", "Some airports worked with aviation consultants to develop studies. Chico (California) Municipal Airport, for example, worked with a consulting group to analyze tickets purchased through travel agents, review air service profiles, and create marketing materials.", "Some studies were done at the state level. Among the states we contacted, for example, Arizona, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania had commissioned statewide studies evaluating levels of air service and fares and developing recommendations for ways to improve scheduled commercial air service.", "By themselves, studies have no direct effect on the demand for, or supply of, air service. However, while studies do not directly result in improved air service, they can play a key role in helping communities determine if there is adequate potential passenger demand to support new or improved air service. If adequate potential demand does not exist, then communities can avoid using scarce resources to pursue scheduled air service that the community cannot adequately support. If adequate potential demand does exist, studies can provide more specific information about the size of aircraft and level of service that could be supported and any marketing or financial incentives that might be needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marketing Efforts Help to Inform the Community of Air Service", "paragraphs": ["Of the 98 airports we contacted, 76 reported using some form of marketing to try to increase potential passengers\u2019 awareness of the air service or to try to inform carriers about the airport in an effort to attract new air service. The amount spent annually on these activities varied from a few thousand dollars to several hundred thousand dollars at some of the small hub airports. These efforts took different forms, such as the following:   Some communities developed basic advertising campaigns. For example, the Chamber of Commerce in Paducah, Kentucky, implemented a \u201cBuy Local, Fly Local\u201d advertising campaign, which included newspaper, radio, and television ads along with a billboard campaign.", "Chattanooga, Tennessee, implemented a marketing incentive program. It dedicated funds to marketing a carrier\u2019s new or enhanced service. The Chattanooga airport provides funds to carriers designated specifically for marketing. For each new destination, new entrant carriers receive $50,000, and incumbent carriers receive $30,000.", "Some communities made presentations to airlines to try to obtain new or additional service. For example, the Olympia (Washington) Regional Airport hired a consultant to prepare a presentation to attract service from Big Sky Airlines. The package included a proposed schedule, travel agent survey, estimated traffic, and a pro forma model of service. Big Sky initiated service between Olympia and Spokane on November 13, 2002. This was Olympia\u2019s first scheduled service since 1995.", "Unlike studies, marketing efforts can have a direct effect on increasing demand for air service, if these efforts succeed in increasing the passenger base or reducing the amount of leakage to other airports. Marketing directed at airlines can have a direct effect on the supply of air service if the marketing efforts succeed in attracting new carriers or more service from existing carriers. The effect of marketing efforts is more difficult to ascertain, but many airport managers said educating passengers about available air service was an important step to increasing demand for air service. For example, an official from Shenandoah Valley (Virginia) Regional Airport said he believed marketing was a useful tool for airports to increase demand. He pointed to the fact that the airport\u2019s annual enplanements more than doubled\u2014from 8,000 to 20,000\u2014since the airport began its marketing and public relations campaign in 1996.", "The Michigan Air Service Program is another example of how marketing efforts can help to enhance air service to small communities. Michigan provides airports with under 150,000 annual enplanements with grants that can be used for marketing, air carrier recruitment, or capital improvements. Pellston Regional Airport, one of the 12 airports we studied in detail, has received such funding and used it for marketing. Pellston has received over $100,000 since fiscal year 1998, which the community has used for promotional materials; newspaper, radio, and televisions ads; and a newsletter. The airport has used the \u201cFly From Nearby\u201d theme to communicate to the community the importance of using their local airport. While Pellston\u2019s enplanements declined from 1998 to 2001, they appear to have stabilized and as of August 2002, officials reported enplanements were up 11 percent from 2001. In addition, Pinnacle Airlines (operating as Northwest Airlink) provided regional jet service between Pellston and Detroit from June to September 2002. Though airport officials could not directly link the marketing program to the increasing enplanements, they said it had helped maintain passenger demand for air service at Pellston."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives Provide Carriers With Greater Assurance for Making a Profit", "paragraphs": ["Forty-four of the airports we contacted had created a financial incentive for a carrier to enter a market or to enhance the level of service already provided. Financial incentives all share the same basic characteristic\u2014 they mitigate some of the financial risk by providing a carrier with greater assurance about the financial viability of the service being provided. In practice, the incentives take a number of different forms with varying levels of complexity (see table 3). For example, in 2002, the community of Lancaster, Pennsylvania paid a subsidy of $195,000 to Colgan Air to offset some of the airline\u2019s costs to begin providing service to the community. Ski communities in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming provided airlines with revenue guarantees\u2014payments to the airlines if revenues fell short of targets\u2014in exchange for additional flights during the ski or summer tourist season. Stockton, California set up a travel bank\u2014funds businesses pledged to use in the future to purchase tickets on the new service. Participating businesses will have 3 years to use these funds for travel; and at the end of the period, any unused funds will be given to the airline. The complexity of these programs varies in part due to the number of participants. For example, while airport officials can take action to reduce airport fees, subsidy or revenue guarantee programs may require government assistance, and travel banks require cooperation from many community businesses. See appendix III for information on the type of programs used at the 98 airports we contacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of 12 Projects Indicates Financial Incentives Are Key to Increasing Service, but No Guarantee of Success", "paragraphs": ["We studied 12 communities that had taken a variety of actions to improve air service; all but 1of the 12 communities instituted some form of financial incentive program for the carrier to attract additional service.All of these communities had undertaken some combination of studies or marketing in the past. However, the officials at many of these airports pointed out that while studies provided useful information about passengers\u2019 demand for service and marketing is useful for informing passengers about the air service, financial incentives were the most effective tool to attract new air service. According to an official with the airport in Eugene, Oregon, for example, the airport conducted studies and marketing, but it did not attract additional air service until the community eventually implemented a travel bank program. As figure 1 shows, the four small hub communities implemented varying financial incentives: travel banks, a revenue guarantee, and a model in which the airport provided the ground crew for a carrier\u2019s operation.", "Officials in Mobile also used studies and marketing but developed a new staffing model after two airlines announced that they planned to cease service there. United Express indicated that it dropped service as a result of the effects of September 11. US Airways subsequently announced that it would be forced to discontinue service because United Express supplied their ground staff (i.e., ticket agents and baggage handlers). Officials decided that they needed to develop a new strategy to attract and retain carriers. Airport officials adopted a model under which the airport supplies the ground crew and equipment and charges participating carriers a fee for the service. With this new business model in place, US Airways decided to continue serving Mobile. Officials said they believe that this new way of conducting business may help encourage other carriers to serve Mobile because there will be fewer barriers for airlines wishing to begin new service since the airport will supply staff and equipment.", "Of the seven nonhub communities that implemented some form of financial incentives, each used subsidies to air carriers. Some of these subsidies were provided by the state, while cities, counties, or some combination of these sources funded the others. Our conversations with community and carrier officials indicated that these financial incentives were key to attracting carriers and actually putting the service in place.", "The experience to date in these communities shows that the long-term sustainability of the service after incentives end is uncertain. Financial incentives helped attract new or better service, leading officials in all 11 communities to rate their programs as successful in the short term. At 6 of the 11 communities, the programs were ongoing as of November 1, 2002. The remaining five communities had completed their programs\u2014that is, they had moved beyond the initial period in which they were able to offer some form of financial incentive. Of these five communities, only one\u2014 Eugene, a small hub airport\u2014retained the additional air service after the incentives had ended. The four others\u2014all nonhub airports with low demand for air service\u2014lost the additional service when the incentives ended. Figure 2 shows the status of each program.", "While each community confronts unique challenges and has adopted various programs to try to address these challenges, we believe that the performance to date of the six ongoing programs provides some indication of the likelihood of sustainability of the air service after the incentives end. Following are descriptions of the six ongoing programs:   Mobile. The Mobile program\u2014where the airport authority, rather than the airline, provides ground crew and equipment and charges participating airlines a fee for this service\u2014differs from many of the other financial incentive programs because there is not a specific time period or set amount of funding for the program. Rather, airport officials said they will consider their staffing initiative successful in the short-term if US Airways continues to provide air service to Mobile. Longer-term success will be measured by whether additional airlines choose to participate. To date, no airline other than US Airways, the initial participant, has done so.", "Pensacola and Tallahassee. Pensacola appears to be on track to reach sustainable service in 2003, and Tallahassee is renewing its revenue guarantee in order to retain the current levels of air service. While both airports used financial incentives to obtain AirTran service, Pensacola used a travel bank (businesses pledged future travel funds) and Tallahassee used a revenue guarantee program (the city guaranteed to pay AirTran if their revenues from the new service did not meet agreed-upon targets). An AirTran official said that they chose to serve both cities because they believed that these cities were capable of supporting service. In the short term, both programs have been successful because passengers have received lower average airfares. However, both agreements were reached before September 11, after which overall passenger loads throughout the country dropped dramatically. Further, airport and air carrier officials said that Delta, a major carrier serving these cities, has adopted a pricing strategy of matching AirTran\u2019s low fares as well as adding flights and capacity to counterbalance AirTran\u2019s entry into the Tallahassee market. Tallahassee airport officials said depressed demand and low airfares have resulted in lower-than-anticipated revenue and slower progress toward profitability. The Pensacola airport manager said that his airport\u2019s load factors (percent of occupied seats on flights) are now approaching the goal of 70 percent, and he believes that when the travel bank ends in September 2003, the service will be self-sustaining. Tallahassee officials said that profitability for AirTran\u2019s operation, initially projected for the end of the revenue guarantee (September 30, 2002), will probably not materialize until the third quarter of 2003. As of November 2002, officials stated that AirTran had requested an extension of the program and an additional $1.5 million revenue guarantee in order to continue service. Tallahassee agreed to renew the $1.5 million revenue guarantee for another year beginning in November 2002.", "Cumberland and Hagerstown. Neither of these airports with state- subsidized air service appears likely to sustain service when incentives end, based on the low level of passenger demand. While a Maryland official said they set a load factor target of 60 percent for the service, actual load factors in September 2002 (after 9 months of operation) were 12 percent.", "Taos. Taos, which has received state and local subsidies since 2000, also continues to struggle to generate enough passenger demand. Though the state renewed the original 1-year state grant twice for a total of $570,000 (in addition to local matching funds), monthly enplanements have not exceeded 295 (March 2000). According to an airline official, the service is still not profitable.", "Available studies presaged some communities\u2019 inability to develop sustainable service. A consulting study of potential service for Hobbs and Ruidoso concluded that these communities would be unable to support additional service without some form of subsidy. As predicted, when the state-supplied subsidy ended, the communities were unable to sustain the service, and the carrier quickly discontinued service. Similarly, a consultant studying Cumberland and Hagerstown suggested that these markets would only support service with a small aircraft, such as one with eight seats. Further, the consultant concluded that Hagerstown showed the least promise because of existing service to the hub in Pittsburgh.

We identified two other factors, more directly within a community\u2019s control, that were important for success.

The catalyst\u2014normally state, community, or airport officials\u2014provides the critical impetus to recognize air service deficiencies and begin a program for change. However, the long-term sustainability of any air service appears related more to a second factor\u2014a community consensus that air service is a priority. This second factor involves recognizing that enhanced air service is likely to come at a price and developing a way in which the community agrees to participate. We did not find indicators that communities broadly supported air service development in a number of the communities we studied (see fig. 3)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Communities Had a Catalyst for Change", "paragraphs": ["All of the communities we studied had a catalyst or driving force behind their air service improvement efforts.

Some said that they had no local funds for air service development, and some did not know what steps they should take to help improve demand for or supply of air service.", "Some of the catalysts were state aviation or economic development officials spearheading air service improvement efforts on a broad scale through statewide studies, grant programs to fund airports\u2019 air service improvement efforts, or statewide meetings or other methods to disseminate information on successful practices. This was the case for the program we reviewed in Michigan. Since 1998, Michigan\u2019s Aviation Services Division has spent $1.5 million to improve air service by performing studies assessing local air service and providing grants to 16 small community airports to aid them in attracting carriers and educating the public about the importance of air service. Officials at several small community airports in Michigan said that the state program is helpful because they lack local resources for these efforts.", "At individual airports, the catalyst was generally some combination of airport officials and local government or community leaders. At Taos, New Mexico, the mayor led efforts to work with airline officials to attract new air service to the area, and in Eugene, Oregon, and Pensacola, Florida, airport officials worked with the local Chambers of Commerce and business leaders to develop travel banks. Having community leaders involved can provide important perspective for airport and airline officials on the type of air service the community desires and is useful for enlisting community support to increase local demand. For example, the Pensacola Airport manager said that involving key community leaders in air service development efforts helped convince other business leaders to lend their support to the program. Sometimes the impetus came largely from one source. In Mobile, Alabama, for example, airport officials came up with a new business model designed to attract or retain carriers by eliminating the need for the airline to find and retain local staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Consensus on the Priority of Service Underscores Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Communities must be committed to supporting any new or enhanced air service.

Eugene airport and community officials said that broad-based community support for the air service is more important than the total funds collected for the travel bank. Eugene\u2019s airport has used travel banks to attract service to two new destinations and in both cases, kept the additional service after the travel banks were completed. In each instance, more than 50 businesses contributed to each travel bank, indicating widespread support for the additional service although total funds pledged to each travel bank were less than $500,000. In Pensacola over 300 businesses and individuals pledged $2.1 million to its airport travel bank.", "Conversely, the inability or unwillingness of a community to contribute funds for new air service may indicate that the community did not view air service as a priority.

A Roswell official said that she eventually agreed to the proposed destinations and structure so the program would not be delayed.

Both programs face heavy demand for funds. Our work on this report and recent work on air service to small communities indicates that there may be significant differences in the barriers faced by small hub and nonhub communities in developing sustainable commercial air service and that the approaches to addressing the communities\u2019 barriers vary accordingly. Some communities with small hub airports were able to marshal local resources to develop air service improvement efforts. For these communities, a one-time grant may be sufficient to develop sustainable air service. In contrast, at four communities we studied with nonhub airports, when the financial incentives ended, the air service ended. These communities may not have the resources available locally to develop such a program.

In fiscal year 1997, the amount appropriated for the EAS program was $26 million; by fiscal year 2002, it was $113 million together with another $20 million for the newly created Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program. Indications are that these sums only partially address the air service development desires of the nation\u2019s small communities. More specifically:   As we reported earlier this year, the amount of money needed to fully fund the EAS program as currently authorized is likely to increase further in the near future. As of July 2002, DOT subsidized service to 114 communities, 79 of them in the continental United States. Between September 2001 and September 2002, carriers had notified DOT of their intent to discontinue service to 15 subsidy-eligible communities.

The grants, which ranged in size from $44,000 to $1,557,500, were applied to such purposes as studies, marketing programs, financial incentives, and other transportation options. The expectation in awarding such grants is that the communities that receive them will be able to parlay the grant into an ongoing program that can be self-sustaining. For example, in a community that is trying to enhance its existing service, the grant might help provide a revenue guarantee to the airline for the first months of the expanded operation, with the expectation that the expanded service will stimulate the market, creating a sustainable base of passengers.

Under current regulations for the pilot program, communities served by small hub or smaller airports are eligible to apply for a grant. However, based on our review of the programs launched by the 12 communities we studied in detail, the communities served by nonhub airports have been less able to successfully develop air service over the longer term. In such communities, the smaller populations and lower level of economic activity meant that when the financial incentives provided through some outside funding source ceased, the additional or enhanced air service also ceased. For example, additional service to four small communities in New Mexico ceased when the funds were depleted.", "Our findings suggest that the communities that may be best able to use a \u201cseed money\u201d approach are those with a larger population and economic activity base\u2014generally communities with small hub airports. For example, the experience of Eugene, Oregon, with a population of over 200,000 and a financial commitment from the community demonstrated that a limited financial incentive program can yield sustainable enhanced air service. For communities with adequate size and resources, such a strategy can continue to challenge them to use the one-time infusion of money to jump-start the potential market into a sustainable program. For communities with smaller, nonhub airports, ongoing financial assistance may be necessary. We believe that our earlier work on the EAS program provides insights on strategies that may be more effective for developing air service to nonhub communities. The EAS program essentially provides one type of ongoing federal financial assistance to those communities\u2014a direct grant to air carriers that operate to and from those communities. However, we found that providing funds to the carrier, rather than the community, has often not produced the type of air service that meets the travel desires of the communities\u2019 residents. Faced with relatively high airfares and limited service options, travelers to or from most EAS- subsidized communities \u201cleak\u201d to other airports. As a result, federally- subsidized air service tends to serve only a small portion of the potential passenger traffic at these communities. On average, each flight to or from an EAS-subsidized community carries only three passengers. In our earlier report, we suggested a number of options that could be examined to enhance the long-term viability of the EAS program. These options include eliminating subsidized service to certain communities that were relatively nearby other larger airports (where most local travelers had demonstrated a clear preference for using the competing large airport), providing eligible communities with direct grants to allow them to tailor air service to unique local needs, and allowing communities to use air carriers that operated aircraft smaller than those currently permitted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to Scheduled Commercial Air Service Are Developing, but Passenger Acceptance Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Some small communities may find it difficult to generate the level of demand needed to support scheduled, commercial air service even with a substantial subsidy.

Such an alternative may be appropriate since a community like Taos, with a population of 6,200,generated only a limited level of demand. Taos received service to Albuquerque from a carrier flying 19-seat turboprop aircraft in the past. According to a state aviation official, the carrier ceased service because it was not profitable; the aircraft were too large and costly. Rio Grande\u2019s smaller, less costly aircraft better match seating capacity to Taos\u2019 demand. Whether that service can become self-sustaining depends on many factors, including the carrier\u2019s ability to offer more economical airfares or its ability to connect to the larger network through codesharing.

However, some state officials and airport managers have noted that many passengers do not like to fly on these smaller aircraft, and this may depress demand for the service.", "Another potential approach combines the idea of smaller aircraft with a more flexible \u201ctaxi\u201d approach to scheduling flights. In Oregon, communities lacking air service are testing a new air taxi business. SkyTaxi, which had its inaugural flight in April 2002, is a blend of an airline and a charter company that primarily serves communities in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California. According to company officials, SkyTaxi franchises use 6-seat (4-passenger) Cessna 414 aircraft (see fig. 5) and have a comparable seat price to regional carriers that serve spoke airports, but also provide the on-demand service of a charter. Individuals, private entities, or local governments can invest in a SkyTaxi franchise that includes a franchise license fee, purchase of aircraft, and other ongoing fees such as operations and marketing. Using a dispatch system similar to a ground taxicab service, passengers call for an aircraft to pick them up at a given location and fly them to another community.

However, we found that many communities are not interested in either of these concepts. Communities have a strong sense that air service is important not only for transportation needs but also for economic development. For example, Salem, Oregon officials believe that despite its proximity to Portland, Salem can attract and support new air service from their community. Though Salem appears to have an adequate population base to support air service (139,320 in 2001), the airport is located just 47 miles from the Portland International Airport, a medium hub.

Communities that want to increase the demand for or supply of air service may need to consider some combination of available tools, including marketing or financial incentives. However, the effectiveness of the methods chosen, especially financial incentives, will likely depend to a large extent on the community size. Of those small hub airports we visited, one was able to use a seed money approach to attract new air service and sustain it after the grants ended. The evidence suggests, however, that small communities served by nonhub airports may need continuing assistance to sustain air service improvements.

Without adequate demand for air service, long-term financially viable service is unlikely. Our EAS work demonstrated, for example, that small communities with an average of only three passengers per flight required substantial EAS subsidies to maintain their service. Furthermore, low-fare carriers are expanding the number of destinations they serve, and many travelers are choosing to bypass flights from local airports and use other larger nearby airports to obtain lower fares or more air service.

The example discussed above of the low-demand community that does not receive market-provided air service, is revisited in figure 8. The government subsidy effectively lowers the carrier\u2019s costs, creating an environment in which it can afford to provide service to the community. The amount of air service provided to the community is illustrated by QSUB. The effect of the subsidy is illustrated graphically by shifting the supply curve outward from S to SSUB. For the same amount of service (QSUB), the average fare passengers face with the subsidized service, FSUB, is less than the minimum that the carrier would have been willing to accept in a situation with no subsidy, FNS. The end result of the program is government-subsidized air service in a community that otherwise would not receive commercial air service. Without the subsidy, the carrier would not provide service because passengers would not be willing to pay any price that carriers would be willing to accept for providing service (the supply and demand curves do not intersect).", "The DOT Essential Air Service (EAS) program provides an example of how government intervention can enable a small community to receive air service that commercial carriers would otherwise not serve. In general, the EAS program provides a subsidy to carriers that serve certain communities. The subsidy is calculated to cover the difference between a carrier\u2019s projected revenues and expenses and provide a minimum amount of profit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hypothetical Example of Efforts to Improve Air Service", "paragraphs": ["In the short term, a number of different programs may be successful at providing or enhancing a community\u2019s air service. However, to be successful at sustaining air service in a community in the long run without prolonged government intervention, a program will need to target factors that ultimately influence consumers\u2019 decisions and increase passenger demand in the market. The following hypothetical scenario provides a general example of how a policy can potentially increase the level of air service in a community.", "The local small community market: Consider a community that receives air service but at levels that the community deems inadequate (i.e., a single carrier, with poor on-time performance, that operates only a few daily flights to one destination on small aircraft at relatively expensive airfares). Because of the relatively poor service at the local airport and increased availability of service elsewhere, many or most potential local passengers drive to other nearby airports for better service and lower fares. As a result of the high level of passenger leakage, demand in the local community has been declining, and the carrier is considering dropping the market.", "The policy and objectives: The local airport and community-planning bodies initiate a program that provides (for a fee) the ground and terminal labor and capital necessary for airport operations (i.e., similar to the Mobile, Alabama business model). The short-term objective of the initiative is to encourage the carrier to remain in the community and improve service (i.e., frequency of flights, number of destinations, on-time performance) by lowering its local operational costs. The long-term goal of policymakers is also to improve service, but by increasing demand through reduced passenger leakage.", "The potential market response following program implementation: Following the program\u2019s introduction, the reduced costs create an incentive for the carrier to improve service by offering a greater frequency of daily flights, adding an additional destination, and enhancing on-time performance. The improved service at the local airport may alter the choices and travel decisions of potential passengers in the community. As a result, more passengers may choose to use this service rather than driving elsewhere, so demand increases due to a reduction in passenger leakage. The increase in demand increases load factors, thus potentially improving the market\u2019s profitability, which in turn may attract new carriers into the community offering additional flight destinations and frequencies. The introduction of a competitor at the airport further increases supply and creates competition between the carriers for passenger traffic. At the then-current level of demand, average airfares drop and the total amount of seats demanded at that new lower fare level increases. The addition of other carriers also may increase flight frequency and destinations and thus may increase demand as passengers reconsider their mode and trip choices. The cycle continues to evolve over time as changes in the local, regional, and national marketplace occur.", "The above example may paint too rosy a picture for what policymakers in smaller communities could expect from initiatives aiming to attract or improve service. This may be especially true at this time, because the current climate in the aviation marketplace consists of the exact opposite story: the downward spiral of declining demand and increasing costs, resulting in service being reduced or eliminated in certain markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Service Improvement Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The EAS program and the hypothetical scenario presented above are examples of policies with a supply-side orientation\u2014the direct impact of an initiative is aimed at the supplier of the service, the carriers.

For instance, a marketing proposal aimed at educating potential travelers in a region about air service from a local airport is a demand-oriented program. Regardless of orientation, the goal of policymakers developing short-term initiatives such as travel banks, revenue guarantees, cost-sharing agreements, direct subsidization, and consumer education (marketing) is to attract, maintain, or improve air service in their community. Ultimately, a sustainable level of service will result from the effectiveness of various policies to change travelers\u2019 decisions and increase demand within a community. In the long run, some communities simply do not have the size and level of economic activity necessary to maintain commercial service without a government subsidy.

One major problem was that Rio Grande Air service did not have visibility in the reservation system used by many individuals and travel agents.

In addition, the carrier confronted other marketing barriers for Taos passengers traveling to or from a location \u201cbeyond\u201d Albuquerque (i.e., a city for which a Taos passenger would need to connect at Albuquerque).

Even with these improvements, enplanements have not been increasing overall, as shown in figure 18."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carlsbad, Hobbs, and Roswell", "paragraphs": ["The second consortium consisted of Carlsbad, Hobbs (Lea County), and Roswell, all located in the southeastern part of the state. In 2000, Mesa Air provided all three communities with service to Albuquerque using 19-seat turboprop aircraft. In addition, Mesa provided Roswell with service to Dallas. Community officials said that they desired service to one or more additional hub airports within a 500-mile radius of the communities, such as Phoenix or Dallas. The three formed a consortium to work with New Mexico state aviation officials to obtain a state grant to fund additional service to their communities. Consortium officials said they sent an RFP to 11 airlines but only 1\u2014Big Sky Airlines\u2014responded.", "Big Sky began service from the three communities to Denver and Dallas with 19-seat Metro turboprop aircraft beginning in October 2000, using $200,000 of state funds and $300,000 in local matching funds. By January 2001, the carrier had exhausted all $500,000 in state and local funds. Roswell and Carlsbad officials said that when the carrier requested additional funding, they declined to provide any. Local officials said the service had been unreliable with up to one-third of the flights cancelled due to weather or mechanical problems. Big Sky discontinued service to these communities in March 2001. Hobbs (Lea County) agreed to provide $35,000 per month in additional funding to the carrier, according to the airport supervisor. However, in January 2002, the carrier discontinued service to Hobbs when Lea County officials also declined to provide any further financial assistance. The airport official said that the carrier had difficulty establishing sufficient passenger demand, in large part because weather and mechanical problems forced the cancellation of many flights.", "While the state program had both state and local stakeholders committed to the goal of improving air service, there were key steps and underlying elements missing from the program, which ultimately resulted in the relative lack of success. For example, there were few steps taken to educate potential passengers about the new service. Officials said that they believed marketing would have helped develop demand for the service. Also, key local stakeholders in the consortium did not all agree on their goal for air service (e.g., destinations to be served). However, the most important element was the relatively small size of the communities and their lack of potential demand for air service. For example, an August 2000 consultant study found that of these three communities, only Roswell had adequate potential demand to support unsubsidized air service. Carlsbad and Hobbs would require some form of subsidies or financial incentives.", "A state aviation official said that there are very few carriers willing to supply air service to the small communities in New Mexico. He cited the fact that only one carrier responded to the Roswell consortium and said that they have continued to renew the grants to Rio Grande Air because no other carriers have come forward to serve those communities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Eugene, Oregon\u2019s Travel Banks", "paragraphs": ["Eugene Airport/Mahlon Sweet Field is a small hub airport located 120 miles south of Portland in Eugene, Oregon. The airport has an estimated catchment area population of over 700,000. Before implementation of the travel banks, Eugene had service from three airlines (United, United Express, and Horizon) to four destinations (Portland, Seattle, Denver, and San Francisco). Community and airport officials believed that additional carriers and destinations would increase competition for the dominant carrier (United), lower fares, and help stem passenger leakage to Portland International Airport.", "The airport manager and president of the local Chamber of Commerce developed the idea of obtaining financial pledges from local businesses to set up a \u201ctravel bank\u201d to secure service to Phoenix from America West Airlines. The Chamber of Commerce and airline negotiated the amount of funds needed in the travel bank as well as the exact service to be provided (e.g., number of daily flights and the type of aircraft). Interested businesses in the community were then asked to commit future travel dollars to the carrier and sign an agreement that guaranteed business flyers would use the new service. The agreement also included various protections for participants\u2019 investments. The funds were held by the airline, which issued corporate accounts to participating businesses. The participating companies had 24 months to use the funds, after which any remaining funds reverted to the airline and were available as ticket vouchers for another 12 months. After that point, any funds remaining in the bank would go to the airline. Eugene\u2019s airport also committed $300,000 over 2 years for marketing to promote the new service.", "With the success of the first travel bank, Eugene officials looked into the possibility of a second travel bank for Los Angeles service. After negotiating an agreement with Horizon Air, the Chamber of Commerce again successfully sought pledges from area businesses. This bank became operational 1 year after the first travel bank, and participating businesses had used 81 percent of the funds within the first 18 months. Table 4 provides more detail about the America West and Horizon Air travel banks.", "One Eugene Airport official said that travel banks offer a number of advantages over other types of financial incentives. The travel banks\u2019 advantages include:   providing airlines a guarantee of sustained support over the initial periods, when risks are typically higher and   helping the new carrier overcome frequent flyer programs of incumbent airlines, existing travel habits, incentives provided to travel agents who book on the incumbent carriers, and corporate purchase agreements.", "As of October 2002, the two travel banks had added five flights and 290 seats daily to the Eugene market. They also brought more jet service to Eugene. The airport manager believes the travel banks were successful in adding competition to the market, alleviating high fares, and stemming some of the passenger leakage to Portland.", "Our analysis of Eugene enplanement data shows that the travel banks played a role in the shift in market share between the dominant carrier\u2014 United\u2014and the other carriers at Eugene from 1998 to 2001. Over that period, United\u2019s market share decreased from 71 percent of the market to 58 percent. (See fig. 20.) Additionally, since both America West and Horizon have maintained their Phoenix and Los Angeles service after the end of each travel bank, we concluded that the travel banks have generated long-term success in Eugene. The Eugene airport manager said the community is exploring the possibility of additional travel banks with other carriers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program Grants and Local Matching Funds (Fiscal Year 2002)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix V: Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program Grants and Local Matching Funds (Fiscal Year 2002)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "City King Cove, Sand Point, Akutan, Cold Bay, False Pass, Nelson Lagoon Mobile Fort Smith Lake Havasu City Chico Santa Maria Lamar Telluride Daytona Beach Augusta/Aiken Mason City Hailey Marion Fort Wayne Manhattan Somerset Paducah Lake Charles Presque Isle Brainerd, St. Cloud Cape Girardeau Meridian Asheville Bismarck Scottsbluff Taos Binghamton Akron/Canton Baker City Reading Rapid City Johnson/Kingsport/Bristol Abilene Beaumont/Port Arthur Moab Lynchburg Bellingham Rhinelander Charleston Casper Total", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Air Service Improvement Efforts Planned at Nonhub and Small Hub Airports Using DOT Grants", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Janet Frisch, David Hooper, Joseph Kile, Sara Ann Moessbauer, Ryan Petitte, Sharon Silas, Stan Stenersen, and Pamela Vines made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Commercial Aviation: Financial Condition and Industry Responses Affect Competition.
