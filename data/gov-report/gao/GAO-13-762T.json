IP-related industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries and contribute to a higher standard of living in the United States. Ensuring the protection of IP rights encourages the introduction of innovative products and creative works to the public. According to experts and literature GAO reviewed, counterfeiting and piracy have produced a wide range of effects on consumers, industry, government, and the economy as a whole. The U.S. economy as a whole may grow more slowly because of reduced innovation and loss of trade revenue. To the extent that counterfeiting and piracy reduce investments in research and development, companies may hire fewer workers and may contribute less to U.S. economic growth, overall. Furthermore, as GAO reported in June 2012, private sector organizations have experienced data loss or theft, economic loss, computer intrusions, and privacy breaches. For example, in February 2011, media reports stated that computer hackers had broken into and stolen proprietary information worth millions of dollars from the networks of six U.S. and European energy companies.", "Generally, as GAO reported in April 2010, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of IP infringements extremely difficult. Nonetheless, research in specific industries suggests that the problem is sizeable, which is of particular concern as many U.S. industries are leaders in the creation of intellectual property. Because of the difficulty in estimating the economic impact of IP infringements, assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on cyber  espionage and the theft of U.S. intellectual property and technology.", "Intellectual property (IP) plays a significant role in the U.S. economy, and  the United States is an acknowledged leader in its creation.

For our April 2010 report assessing the  economic impacts of theft of intellectual property on the U.S. economy,  we interviewed officials and representatives from U.S. government  agencies, industry associations, nongovernmental organizations,  academic institutions, and a multilateral organization, and we reviewed  documents and studies quantifying or discussing the impacts of  counterfeiting and piracy on the U.S. economy, industry, government, and  consumers. We conducted a literature search of studies and estimates of  the economic impact of IP infringements published since 1999 to examine  various aspects of the economic impacts of counterfeiting and piracy, and  to identify other insights about the role IP plays in the U.S. economy. We  also interviewed subject matter experts from a range of governmental,  nongovernmental, academic, and industry sources, and Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) officials to discuss  efforts to quantify the economic impacts of counterfeiting and piracy and  to obtain their views on the range of impacts of counterfeits and piracy,  insights on counterfeiting activities and markets, and the role of IP in the  U.S. economy.

In addition,  the rapid growth of Internet use has significantly contributed to the  development of technologies that enable the unauthorized distribution of  copyrighted works and is widely recognized as leading to an increase in  piracy. Digital products are not physical or tangible, can be reproduced at  very low cost, and have the potential for immediate delivery through the  Internet across virtually unlimited geographic markets. Sectors facing  threats from digital piracy include the music, motion picture, television,  publishing, and software industries.

According to the United States Trade Representative, \u201cAmericans are the  world\u2019s leading innovators, and our ideas and intellectual property are a  key ingredient to our competitiveness and prosperity.\u201d The United States  has generally been very active in advocating strong IP protection and  encouraging other nations to improve these systems for two key reasons.  First, the U.S. has been the source of a large share of technological  improvements for many years and, therefore, stands to lose if the  associated IP rights are not respected in other nations. Secondly, a  prominent economist noted that IP protection appears to be one of the  factors that has helped to generate the enormous growth in the world  economy and in the standard of living that has occurred in the last 150  years. This economist pointed out that the last two centuries have created  an unprecedented surge in growth compared to prior periods.

As we reported in April 2010,  according to officials we interviewed and a 2008 OECD study, to the  extent that companies experience a loss of revenues or incentives to  invest in research and development for new products, slower economic  growth could occur. IP-related industries play an important role in the  growth of the U.S. economy and contribute a significant percentage to the  U.S. gross domestic product. IP-related industries also pay significantly  higher wages than other industries and contribute to a higher standard of  living in the United States. To the extent that counterfeiting and piracy  reduce investments in research and development, these companies may  hire fewer workers and may contribute less to U.S. economic growth,  overall. The U.S. economy may also experience slower growth due to a  decline in trade with countries where widespread counterfeiting hinders  the activities of U.S. companies operating overseas.", "The U.S. economy, as a whole, also may experience effects of losses by  consumers and government. An economy\u2019s gross domestic product could  be measured as either the total expenditures by households (consumers),  or as the total wages paid by the private sector (industry). Hence, the  effect of counterfeiting and piracy on industry would affect consumers by  reducing their wages, which could reduce consumption of goods and  services and the gross domestic product. Finally, the government is also  affected by the reduction of economic activity, since fewer taxes are  collected.", "In addition to the U.S. economy-wide effects, as we reported in April  2010, counterfeit or pirated products that act as substitutes for genuine  goods can have a wide range of negative effects on industries, according  to experts we spoke with and literature we reviewed. These sources  further noted that the economic effects vary widely among industries and  among companies within an industry. The most commonly identified  effect cited was lost sales, which leads to decreased revenues and/or  market share.", "Lost revenues can also occur when lower-priced counterfeit and pirated  goods pressure producers or IP owners to reduce prices of genuine  goods. In some industries, such as the audiovisual sector, marketing  strategies must be adjusted to minimize the impact of counterfeiting on  lost revenues. Movie studios that use time-related marketing strategies\u2014 introducing different formats of a movie after certain periods of time\u2014  have reduced the time periods or \u201cwindows\u201d for each format as a  countermeasure, reducing the overall revenue acquired in each window.  Experts stated that companies may also experience losses due to the  dilution of brand value or damage to reputation and public image, as  counterfeiting and piracy may reduce consumers\u2019 confidence in the  brand\u2019s quality.", "Companies are affected in additional ways. For example, to avoid losing  sales and liability issues, companies may increase spending on IP  protection efforts. In addition, experts we spoke with stated that  companies could experience a decline in innovation and production of  new goods if counterfeiting leads to reductions in corporate investments  in research and development. Another variation in the nature of the  effects of counterfeiting and piracy is that some effects are experienced  immediately, while others are more long-term, according to the OECD.  The OECD\u2019s 2008 report cited loss of sales volume and lower prices as  short-term effects, while the medium- and long-term effects include loss  of brand value and reputation, lost investment, increased costs of  countermeasures, potentially reduced scope of operations, and reduced  innovation. Finally, one expert emphasized to us that the loss of IP rights  is much more important than the loss of revenue.

In discussing their own  effort to develop a global estimate on the scale of counterfeit trade,  OECD officials told us that obtaining reliable data is the most important  and difficult part of any attempt to quantify the economic impact of  counterfeiting and piracy.

Transparency in how these estimates are developed is  essential for assessing the usefulness of an estimate. However,  according to experts and government officials, industry associations do  not always disclose their proprietary data sources and methods, making it  difficult to verify their estimates. Industries collect this information to  address counterfeiting problems associated with their products and may  be reluctant to discuss instances of counterfeiting because consumers  might lose confidence.

Economic multipliers  show how capital changes in one industry affect output and employment  of associated industries.

It must be noted that RIMS II multipliers assume no job  immigration or substitution effect. That is, if new jobs are created as a  result of investing more capital, those jobs would not be filled by the labor  force from another industry. Most of the experts we interviewed were  reluctant to use economic multipliers to calculate losses from  counterfeiting because this methodology was developed to look at a one- time change in output and employment. Nonetheless, the use of this  methodology corroborates that the effect of counterfeiting and piracy goes  beyond the infringed industry.
