As shown in figure 2, SBDCs did not  receive the notice of award for their full fiscal year 2019 appropriation  until April 2019. One SBDC noted the extreme pressure in the first  half of the year to operate on a lean budget and then having to switch  to increased activity in the second half of the year once the final,  higher amount was awarded. Another SBDC required its service  centers to propose special projects but did not fund them at the  beginning of the year because it did not know what the funding level  would be.", "Having to carry over funding to the next year. Some SBDCs said it  has become common for them to have unexpended funding left at the  end of the fiscal or calendar year. In these instances, they carry over  their funding to the next year. For example, one SBDC said that the  late-in-year increases in funding prevented certain activities from  being completed within appropriate project dates and led them to  carry over funds. While the ability to carry over funding for one  additional fiscal year was considered helpful, some expressed  concern that this was not the best use of federal dollars over the  course of the year. For example, one SBDC said it was forced to  carry over unspent funds partly as a result of difficulties in forecasting  monthly spend rates and adjusting the rates midyear.", "A few survey respondents noted that operating under a continuing  resolution at the beginning of the year made spending grant funds more  difficult. For example, one SBDC stated that multiple continuing  resolutions in one year meant that by the time its host rebudgeted, it had  less than 3 months to spend the increase. Another noted that because  the initial funding amount varied so greatly from the final amount, the  shortened time frame for deploying funds can make it difficult to maximize  use of grant funds.", "Two SBDCs that operate on a calendar-year budget cycle told us that  they had not experienced the same challenges as SBDCs that operate on  a fiscal-year budget cycle because there is either a continuing resolution  or final award by January. A smaller proportion of calendar-year SBDCs  responded that using the initial funding amount somewhat or greatly  hindered their ability to spend grant funds compared to fiscal-year  SBDCs.

Thus, when consultants and staff retire  or leave the program, there is a staffing gap, which results in less  service to clients.", "Reliance on short-term or contractor positions. Some SBDCs told  us that using the funding estimate already had forced them to rely on  or might force them to rely on part-time staff, short-term contracts, or  contractors to provide services. For example, one SBDC stated the  initial funding estimate restricted its ability to hire full-time personnel  and instead required it to hire part-time individuals. This SBDC also  noted it had a difficult time finding qualified individuals, since it could  not guarantee funding for the new position in 6 months. Another  SBDC said it was forced to put all personnel on short-term contracts.

For example, programs that previously  received a specific or additional amount of funding under a continuing  resolution have included wildfire management, veterans healthcare and  benefits, and disaster relief. In addition, agencies can take actions to  mitigate challenges associated with continuing resolutions and  shutdowns. For example, agencies may have the ability to shift grant  cycles to later in the fiscal year when they are less likely to be under a  continuing resolution. Shifting these cycles can help minimize disruption  of services.", "In response to an open-ended survey question on how SBA could help  mitigate any of the challenges posed by the funding application  procedure, SBDCs offered a number of suggestions.

This in turn affected their ability to meet their performance  goals and program objectives of serving small businesses.", "The use of continuing resolutions in recent years also has put strains on  SBDCs\u2019 ability to effectively plan, budget, and operate throughout a year.

For example, the agency could reconsider the amount it  uses as the basis for the funding estimate. While SBA previously cited a  desire to improve operational efficiencies as a reason for changing the  funding estimate methodology, most SBDCs told us their operational  efficiencies have decreased. SBA also cited a need to align with federal  financial management standards, but OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance permits  the use of other estimates, such as the prior year\u2019s appropriation.
