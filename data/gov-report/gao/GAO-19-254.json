For example, REAC has not conducted a comprehensive review of its inspection process since 2001, even though new risks to its process have emerged, such as property owners misrepresenting the conditions of their properties. A comprehensive review could help REAC identify risks and ensure it is meeting the goal of producing inspections that are reliable, replicable, and reasonable. In addition, REAC does not track its progress toward meeting its inspection schedule for certain properties, which could hinder HUD's ability to take enforcement actions. Finally, in the wake of concerns that inspections were not always identifying troubled properties, REAC and other HUD units, including the Office of Multifamily Housing, made eight recommendations in January 2017 to enhance the inspection process, but HUD had only approved three of these recommendations and had not implemented any of them as of December 2018.", "REAC uses contractors to inspect properties; these contract inspectors are trained and overseen by quality assurance inspectors hired directly by REAC. However, REAC's processes to select, train, and monitor both contract inspectors and quality assurance inspectors have weaknesses.", "Selection. REAC does not verify the qualifications of contract inspector candidates before they are selected to begin training to become certified inspectors. Formal processes to verify qualifications may help REAC identify unqualified candidates before they begin training and avoid expending resources on training these candidates.", "Training. REAC lacks formal mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of its training program for contract and quality assurance inspectors. In addition, unlike other professional inspection organizations, REAC does not have continuing education requirements. Formal mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of its training program could help REAC ensure that its program supports the development needs of inspectors. Further, requiring continuing education could help REAC ensure that inspectors are current on any changes in REAC's policies or industry standards.", "Monitoring. REAC has not met management targets for the number and timeliness of its inspection oversight reviews of contract inspectors. For example, REAC has not met its target of conducting three quality assurance reviews of poor-performing contractors per quarter. As a result, if deficiencies are not identified and recorded by contract inspectors, they may not be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, REAC's performance standards for its quality assurance inspectors have not been updated to reflect their broader job duties, such as conducting inspector oversight reviews and coaching and mentoring contract inspectors. Performance standards that are directly linked to these job duties would help ensure that inspectors are assessed on all of their key responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 14 recommendations to HUD to improve REAC's physical inspection process and its selection, training, and monitoring of contract and quality assurance inspectors, among other things.

HUD\u2019s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) is  responsible for conducting physical inspections of multifamily and public  housing properties and assigning them an inspection score from 0 to 100.  However, despite longstanding processes to inspect properties and take  action against owners who do not address physical deficiencies, HUD  continues to find some properties that are in poor physical condition and  have life-threatening health and safety issues. Additionally, Congress and  the media have raised concerns about properties that may have received  inspection scores not consistent with their physical condition.

For  example, the Inspector General found that REAC did not always ensure  that contract inspectors met program requirements prior to conducting  inspections. The Inspector General made six recommendations to the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for REAC, which included (1) developing and  implementing written policies and procedures to help ensure that  inspectors meet program requirements (e.g., conducting a minimum of  250 inspections and having appropriate liability insurance) and (2)  establishing and implementing written processes and procedures to verify  the accuracy of the unit numbers sampled and entered for inspection by  the inspector.

REAC generally inspects properties every 1 to 3 years, using a risk-based  schedule (discussed in detail below). REAC developed a standardized  protocol to inspect properties, referred to as the Uniform Physical  Condition Standards. As part of the protocol, REAC also inspects  properties to identify health and safety deficiencies, including exigent  health and safety deficiencies, which are life-threatening and require  immediate action or remedy (such as exposed electrical wires or blocked  access to windows or doors in case of a fire). REAC\u2019s data system  automatically generates an overall inspection score for the property from  0 to 100 based on the information an inspector records. At the end of  each day of an inspection, an inspector is required to inform a property  manager or other representative if the inspection identified exigent health  and safety issues. Before releasing the inspection score, REAC reviews  the inspection through a quality assurance process to ensure it is  accurate. Following verification of the inspection score, REAC releases  an inspection report to the property owner or PHA and the relevant HUD  program office. The inspection report contains the overall inspection  score, as well as more detailed information on physical deficiencies  identified during the inspection.", "REAC primarily uses contractors\u2014who are trained and certified in  REAC\u2019s Uniform Physical Condition Standards protocol\u2014to conduct  inspections of multifamily and public housing properties.

This  process, called a reverse auction program, occurs at least once a quarter.  Contract inspectors or companies bid to inspect properties across the  United States and its territories in a web-based auction. At the close of the auction, REAC awards the inspection to whoever bids the lowest price  and is eligible to conduct inspections. The contract inspector then  schedules and performs the property inspections in accordance with  Uniform Physical Condition Standards protocol.

Public housing consists of reduced-rent developments owned and  operated by local PHAs and subsidized by the federal government. About  3,300 PHAs own and manage public housing properties. These  properties can include high-rise and low-rise buildings and scattered  single-family properties, or they can be part of mixed-income housing  developments, and they can range in size from fewer than 100 units to  more than 30,000 units. PHAs typically have an executive director to  manage their operations, as well as a governing board\u2014called a Board of  Commissioners\u2014to approve policy, clarify goals, and ensure compliance  with federal regulations.

The software helps to ensure  consistency between inspectors and consistency with the protocol,  according to REAC staff. The software includes a decision-tree model to  guide the inspectors on recording and classifying the severity of  deficiencies they identify. For example, if an inspector identifies a  deficiency with a door in a dwelling unit, the software will ask the  inspector to identify which door has the deficiency and the nature of the  deficiency (e.g., door lock does not work).

Likewise, representatives from one property  owner association we met with said that the inspection process was more  standardized and less subjective than in the past. Representatives from  another association said that the inspection process effectively identified  deficiencies. However, participants in three of the same five discussion  groups with contract and quality assurance inspectors noted inconsistent  application of protocols and standards, noting that some cases were  unclear and required judgment in identifying deficiencies.", "REAC\u2019s inspection process has features similar to those of home  inspection organizations such as the American Society of Home  Inspectors (ASHI) and the International Association of Certified Home  Inspectors (InterNACHI). For example, ASHI and InterNACHI have  developed standards of practice that guide their inspectors on conducting  inspections, similar to the role of REAC\u2019s Uniform Physical Condition  Standards inspection protocol. In addition, ASHI and InterNACHI require  their inspectors to inspect the same five areas of a property that REAC  does. Finally, ASHI and InterNACHI have codes of conduct that specify  what constitutes ethical conduct for their inspectors; similarly, REAC has  developed business rules that define ethical conduct for contract  inspectors.", "REAC has made two major changes to the inspection process over the  past 6 years. First, in 2012, REAC updated its inspection software to  include the decision-tree model previously discussed and established a  point-loss cap to limit the amount by which a single deficiency in an  inspectable area could reduce the overall property score. For example,  if an inspector found numerous tripping hazards within the same  inspectable area, the inspector would record all instances of this hazard,  but the software would only deduct from the inspection score once rather  than multiple times, according to REAC staff.", "Second, in 2017, REAC updated its compilation bulletin to address  concerns that property owners were making cheap, non-industry-standard  repairs to disguise deficiencies during a REAC physical inspection.  REAC now requires its inspectors to determine if deficiencies have been  corrected consistent with industry standards. For example, property  owners cannot use materials such as asphalt, caulking, spray foam, or  screws to cover or fill a crack or opening in an electrical panel because  that repair would not be consistent with industry standards (see fig. 3).", "As shown in table 1, from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the median  inspection scores for multifamily and public housing properties were in the  mid- to high-80s, with scores trending downward toward the end of that  time frame.

Additionally, some property owners attempt to cover up, rather  than address, deficiencies\u2014such as by using mulch on a building exterior  to hide erosion. REAC staff have also raised concerns about property  owners employing current or former REAC contract inspectors to help  prepare for an inspection, sometimes by guiding owners to repair just  enough to pass inspection rather than comprehensively addressing  deficiencies. REAC also continues to find that some contract inspectors  are conducting inspections that do not meet REAC\u2019s quality standards  (discussed later in the report).", "Property owner associations we met with also raised concerns about the  fairness of the inspection process. Specifically, representatives of two  property owner associations said that REAC\u2019s inspection process  penalizes properties for items that do not affect the livability of a unit (e.g.,  property receives severe deficiency for chips on exterior bricks even  though the dwelling units are in good condition).

In 1998, REAC employed a few large inspection companies  to conduct the inspections.

For example, REAC staff worked on an intra- agency team to develop recommendations to address weaknesses in the  inspection process that were identified as part of the assessment of  Eureka Gardens.

For these  properties, the inspection process provides for inspecting statistical  samples of units and buildings. The results for the sample are then used  to estimate a score that represents the condition of the entire property.  Sampling introduces a degree of uncertainty, called sampling error, which  statisticians commonly express as a range associated with numerical  results. For example, for a property that scored 62 on its physical  inspection, REAC would consider this a passing score that requires an  annual inspection and no enforcement action. However, due to sampling  error, the range associated with this score could be between 56 on the  lower bound and 68 on the upper bound.

REAC\u2019s property  inspection scores are currently presented as numerical results without  any information on the range associated with the score. REAC\u2019s prior  version of its scoring software automatically calculated the sampling  errors in the inspection scores, and this information was available for  inspection scores from fiscal years 2002 through 2013. However,  according to REAC staff, the current version of its scoring software does  not automatically calculate the sampling errors, in part because of a lack  of resources and also because they believe there is no need to calculate  them. Yet, in a review we conducted of REAC in 2000, officials told us  that they planned to adjust the score downward and take appropriate  actions for inspection scores with a lower bound that fell under an  administrative cutoff, such as 60 points. During our current review,  REAC staff told us that they did not implement this plan because they  would need to coordinate with other HUD offices, such as the Office of  Housing, and issue a notice in the Federal Register for public comment.", "Based on our analysis of REAC inspection data, HUD potentially could  have taken enforcement actions against more properties if REAC had  taken sampling errors in inspection scores into account.

Consistent with our report, HUD recognized that after  20 years, its physical inspection process has become susceptible to  manipulation. HUD said it plans to pilot a new physical inspection process  in one of HUD\u2019s administrative regions later this year.  HUD stated that  given its limited resources, it will be unable to simultaneously develop the  new process and implement all of the recommendations to its current  process.  We maintain that implementing the recommendations will help  REAC to ensure that properties are decent, safe, sanitary, and in good  repair.", "HUD agreed with 11 recommendations and provided specific information  about planned steps to implement them. For example, for our first  recommendation on conducting a comprehensive review of REAC\u2019s  physical inspection process, HUD noted in its written comments that it  plans to develop new standards, protocols, scoring approaches, and  software to be validated through a demonstration. In addition, if resources  are available, HUD plans to contract with an external vendor to assess  the accuracy and effectiveness of the new inspection process and the  statistical validity of scoring. For our eighth and ninth recommendations  on evaluating and revising training for contract and quality assurance  inspectors, HUD noted that it would evaluate its internal training program  for contract inspectors as it pilots its new inspection process and compare  the results with its evaluation of an outsourced training approach. In  addition, HUD noted that it would identify the subject matter expertise  needed for quality assurance inspectors and provide training to address  any skills gaps among these inspectors.", "HUD partially agreed with our fourth and sixth recommendations and  noted some considerations for addressing them. HUD partially agreed  with our fourth recommendation regarding tracking its progress on  conducting inspections of multifamily properties in accordance with  federal guidelines, but did not identify the reason for its partial agreement.  In written comments, HUD described actions it plans to take that we  consider consistent with the intent of the recommendation. We maintain  that this recommendation should be implemented to achieve benefits,  including better understanding of the factors that contribute to inspection  delays. HUD also partially agreed with our sixth recommendation  regarding expedited implementation of recommendations from the Rapid  Response and Resolution Team. In written comments, HUD noted that in  order to balance resources invested in the current approach with those  needed to design future operations, it would consider whether the  remaining recommendations from the Rapid Response and Resolution  Team fit with the new inspection model that it plans to pilot. Whether in  the current inspection model or a future one, we maintain that expediting  implementation of the recommendations from the Rapid Response and  Resolution Team will support that team\u2019s intention to address conditions  at troubled multifamily properties.", "HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with our second recommendation to  resume calculating the sampling error associated with the physical  inspection for each property, identify the changes that may be needed for  HUD to use sampling error results, and consider those results when  determining whether more frequent inspections or enforcement actions  are needed.

Specifically,  we reviewed the final notice on REAC\u2019s physical inspection scores and  the 2017 update to REAC\u2019s compilation bulletin, which is the guidance  document for inspectors conducting physical inspections. We also  reviewed REAC\u2019s user guide, which explains how REAC\u2019s inspection  software and handheld data collection devices are used to conduct the  inspection and record deficiencies. To describe the quality assurance  processes for physical inspections, we reviewed REAC\u2019s quality  assurance standard operating procedures, which provide instructions to  REAC\u2019s quality assurance inspectors on how they are to conduct various  monitoring activities over contract inspectors to assess the quality of  inspections. We also reviewed REAC\u2019s standard operating procedures for  post-inspection reviews.", "As part of our assessment of the physical inspection process, we  reviewed the statistical methodology used by REAC to determine the  sample size for dwelling units and buildings. We reviewed REAC\u2019s  documentation describing the sample-size calculations for units and  buildings and interviewed a REAC statistician to obtain information on the  statistical approach and assumptions used in the sample size  calculations. With this information, we were able to conduct our own  calculations on the sample-size and compare our results to REAC\u2019s.", "To report on the number of physical inspections conducted from fiscal  years 2013 through 2017, as well as other data on inspections over this  period, we accessed REAC\u2019s Record and Process Inspection Data  database. This database contains information related to physical  inspections, such as the types and locations of properties inspected,  dates of inspection, and inspection scores. To assess the reliability of the  database, we first identified the various tables in the database that held  the relevant data we needed for our analysis. We also identified the  common identifier in each of these tables to construct records of  inspections with the relevant data. We met with REAC\u2019s staff to confirm  that our selection of the tables and our construction of records was  correct. We then performed our analysis and developed various  descriptive statistics, such as the number of inspections per year by  property type from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the number of  multifamily properties that failed their REAC inspection (scored below 60)  for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the percentage of multifamily property  inspections that occurred on time given their inspection score, and  various inspection score ranges by state. We compared our statistics on  the number of inspections per year with comparable statistics developed  by REAC. In cases where we had differences, we obtained explanations  from REAC for these differences and revised our analysis where  appropriate. Based on our overall assessment of the REAC data we  used, we found them to be sufficiently reliable for analyzing the number  and timing of inspections and trends in scoring.", "To obtain the views of various stakeholders on the inspection process, we  held discussion groups with contract inspectors and REAC\u2019s quality  assurance inspectors and supervisors. Each discussion group had  between 6 and 13 participants and was facilitated by a GAO staff  member. We covered a number of topics in these discussion groups,  including the inspection and quality assurance processes. We held one  discussion group with contract inspectors, three with REAC quality  assurance inspectors, and one with REAC quality assurance supervisors:", "Contract inspectors. For the discussion group with the contract  inspectors, we invited all of the contract inspectors who were  attending a conference at REAC\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C.

For the last discussion group, we  reached out to all quality assurance supervisors and met with 6 of  them.", "We recorded all of the discussion groups to help transcribe the  conversations. In order to analyze the discussion group transcripts, we  identified phrases that represented key themes across the groups. One  GAO analyst reviewed one of the transcripts to identify any additional  phrases we should add to our analysis. Once we arrived at our final set of  key themes, one GAO analyst reviewed all of the transcripts and matched  responses in the transcripts to the key themes. A second GAO analyst  then checked the work to determine if he agreed with the coding of the  first analyst. If there were any disagreements on the coding, the two  analysts met to reach consensus on the appropriate coding.", "Finally, to obtain the perspectives of property owners on REAC\u2019s  inspection process, we met with four organizations representing  multifamily or public housing property owners. These organizations were  the Council for Large Public Housing Authorities, the National Affordable  Housing Management Association, the National Leased Housing  Association, and the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association.  Also, to understand how private home inspection associations developed  their inspection processes, we interviewed staff from the American  Society of Home Inspectors and the International Association of Certified  Home Inspectors.", "To address the second and third objectives, we reviewed REAC\u2019s policies  and procedures for selecting, training, developing, and monitoring  contract and quality assurance inspectors. We reviewed the contract  inspector candidate assessment questionnaire and construction analyst  job announcement, which describe the requirements to become a  contract and quality assurance inspector, respectively. We also reviewed  documents describing the online (Phase Ia), classroom (Phase Ib), and  field (Phase II) training courses. We also reviewed an assessment that  Deloitte, a management consultant firm, conducted of REAC\u2019s training,  quality assurance, and inspector oversight processes. We compared  REAC\u2019s training processes for inspectors with key attributes of effective  training and development programs. In our discussion groups with  contract and quality assurance inspectors, we also asked their views on  REAC\u2019s selection, training, and monitoring processes. In addition, we  interviewed REAC management officials to discuss their processes for  the selection, training, monitoring, and oversight of contract and quality  assurance inspectors. We spoke with staff from the American Society of  Home Inspectors and the International Association of Certified Home  Inspectors to understand how their selection and training requirements for  inspectors who are members of home inspection associations compared  with REAC\u2019s.", "To examine REAC\u2019s processes for monitoring contract inspector  performance, we reviewed REAC\u2019s quality assurance standard operating  procedures, REAC\u2019s strategic plan, and various tools REAC has  developed to assess how contract and quality assurance inspectors  perform relative to their peers. We obtained data on collaborative quality  assurance reviews for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 and data on quality  control inspections for January 2017 through June 2018. We analyzed the  data to determine, for example, how often contract inspectors were  conducting inspections in accordance with REAC\u2019s Uniform Physical  Conditions Standards protocol and its quality assurance standard  operating procedures, and how often REAC was meeting its goals for  timeliness and frequency of reviews. We assessed the reliability of the  data by interviewing knowledgeable officials and conducting manual  testing on relevant data fields for obvious errors. Based on these steps,  we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  analyses.", "To examine REAC\u2019s processes for monitoring and overseeing quality  assurance inspector performance, we reviewed the performance  standards and performance elements REAC uses to evaluate quality  assurance inspectors. We interviewed staff from REAC\u2019s Quality Control  department, which conducts inspection reviews on quality assurance  inspectors. We compared REAC\u2019s performance management processes  to key practices we have identified for effective performance  management. We also compared REAC\u2019s policies for oversight and  monitoring of quality assurance inspectors to criteria in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To address the fourth objective, we reviewed documentation related to  monitoring and enforcement processes for HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily  Housing (Multifamily Housing), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH),  and the Departmental Enforcement Center. For example, we reviewed  relevant protocols and guidance documents on PIH\u2019s and Multifamily  Housing\u2019s processes to address physical risk, among other risks. We also  reviewed the relevant legal authorities in the 2014 through 2018  Consolidated Appropriations Acts and federal regulations for these HUD  program offices to take enforcement actions for properties with physical  deficiencies. We interviewed officials from Multifamily Housing, PIH, and  the Departmental Enforcement Center on their processes to monitor the  physical condition of properties and take enforcement actions. We further  selected two Multifamily Housing and four PIH field offices throughout the  United States to understand actions they take to monitor properties and  ensure that physical deficiencies are corrected. We developed a two- stage process to select field offices with a higher percentage of  inspections with scores 70 and below. We first selected HUD regions  based on our score criteria and then selected specific field offices within  those regions using similar score criteria. Because we selected a  nonprobability sample of field offices, the information we obtained cannot  be generalized more broadly to all field offices. However, the information  provides important context and insight into how the enforcement process  for physical deficiencies works across the country. In addition, we  obtained data on performance designations for public housing agencies  within PIH, actions taken by Multifamily Housing for properties scoring  below 60 on the REAC inspection, and actions taken by the Departmental  Enforcement Center for Multifamily Housing properties. We assessed the  reliability of the data by reviewing relevant HUD guidance and obtaining  written responses from agency officials on how the data were collected,  maintained, analyzed, and presented. Based on these steps, we found  the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analyses.  Finally, we reviewed prior reports from GAO and from the HUD Office of  Inspector General that discussed efforts to monitor the physical condition  of properties, among other conditions.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
