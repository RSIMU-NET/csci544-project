Although impairments affect exits, other factors, including family support and personal motivation, as well as local TANF policies, may also affect whether recipients exit TANF. After leaving TANF, people with impairments were one-third as likely as people without impairments to be employed, according to a statistical model that controlled for demographic differences, and they were more likely to receive federal supports. Forty percent of leavers with impairments reported receiving cash assistance from Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a federal program designed to assist low-income individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. Leavers with impairments were also more likely to receive non cash support in the form of Food Stamps and Medicaid than their counterparts without impairments.

Under TANF, states are to impose work requirements on most adults receiving TANF cash assistance and place a lifetime limit of 60 months on the receipt of federal cash assistance. Some policymakers have expressed concerns about the ability of TANF recipients with physical or mental impairments to comply with program requirements, which has contributed to a heightened interest in what happens to people with impairments after they exit TANF. Although the TANF block grant program was due to expire on September 30, 2002, the Congress provided for an extension of the program until January 11, 2003. By that time, the Congress must either reauthorize the program or provide for an additional extension. As of September 30, 2002, the House of Representatives had passed reauthorization legislation and the Senate Committee on Finance had passed a reauthorization bill, although the full Senate had not yet voted on this bill.", "To provide you with information on how people with impairments are faring in the current welfare environment and what issues may need attention as welfare reform evolves, you asked us to determine (1) how prevalent impairments are among TANF recipients; (2) whether recipients with impairments are as likely to exit TANF as recipients without impairments; and (3) what sources of income people with impairments have after leaving TANF, compared with people without impairments.", "To address all three questions, we analyzed self-reported data for the most recent years available from the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)\u2014a survey of households nationwide that asks respondents questions about their TANF status and functional impairments and uses categories of impairments comparable to those covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Because these data are self-reported, they may not accurately reflect the size of the population with impairments. We used a cross section of responses given between July 1997 and July 1999 and relied on a definition of impairments developed by Census that includes both severe and nonsevere physical and mental impairments. Our analyses included both descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses. We used appropriate techniques to weight the data to make population estimates. The sampling error for these estimates varied but did not exceed plus or minus 8 percentage points. For more information, see appendix I.

HHS administers the TANF block grant program, which provided grants to states totaling up to $16.5 billion each year through September 2002. To receive its grant, each state must also spend at least a specified amount of its own funds, referred to as state maintenance of effort (MOE) funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Flexibility on TANF Work Requirements and Time Limits", "paragraphs": ["While states have had flexibility to design programs that meet their own goals and needs, they also have been required to implement federal work requirements and time limits designed to promote employment among those able to work. First, TANF established stronger work requirements for those receiving aid than did the AFDC program. Specifically, to avoid financial penalties, states had to meet federal participation rate requirements, under which states were to ensure that an increasing percentage of adult recipients were participating in federally defined activities each year through fiscal year 2002. Second, states have been required to reduce the cash assistance benefit of an adult who did not participate as required by the state, referred to as a sanction, and could opt to terminate cash aid for the entire family. Third, states also have had to enforce a 60-month limit (or less at state option) on the length of time a family may receive federal TANF assistance.", "However, the law also provided states considerable flexibility in how they implemented work requirements and time limits, and some states and localities have used this flexibility to exempt recipients with disabilities from these requirements. For example, in our 2002 report on states\u2019 implementation of work requirements and time limits, we noted that states have generally faced greatly reduced federal participation rate requirements. This resulted from the law\u2019s \u201ccaseload reduction credit\u201d which adjusted downward the federally required rate if a state\u2019s caseload declined, which is exactly what occurred in most states\u2014dramatic caseload declines from 1996 through at least mid-2001. In fiscal year 2000, these caseload reduction credits reduced required rates from 40 percent (the required rate) to 0 in 31 states. These lower participation rate requirements gave states more flexibility in exempting TANF recipients considered hard to employ from meeting work requirements. We found that while almost all states met or exceeded their adjusted required rate in that year, the federal participation rates that states actually achieved before adjustment ranged from about 6 percent to more than 70 percent.", "Regarding time limits, we found that states generally excluded from time limits families with a parent or caretaker with a disability or caring for a family member with a disability. States could do this by using the 20-percent federal time limit extension established in the law or by using state maintenance of effort funds, as also allowed by the law. Our work also showed that most families had not yet reached their federal or state- imposed cash assistance time limit as of fall 2001.", "While recipients with impairments may sometimes be exempted from work requirements and time limits, they may be at risk of having their benefits reduced or terminated through sanctions. A study in four urban areas conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) found that recipients with a greater number of health problems were more likely to be sanctioned for noncompliance with program requirements than their healthier counterparts. Over 50 percent of former recipients with at least one health problem left welfare due to sanctions compared with 39 percent of recipients without health problems. Our earlier report on sanctions under the TANF program found that families who left welfare due to sanctions relied on support from family and friends after TANF payments stopped, rather than on income from employment, to a greater extent than families who left the program for other reasons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Relationship between TANF and SSI", "paragraphs": ["TANF often serves, as did AFDC, as a temporary stopping point for low- income individuals with physical or mental impairments that may be considered severe enough to make them eligible for the federal SSI program. SSI, administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), provides cash assistance to low-income individuals who are aged or who are unable to work because of a severe long-term impairment and who do not have sufficient work history to qualify for SSA\u2019s Disability Insurance (DI) program. To qualify for SSI, an applicant\u2019s impairment must be of such severity that the person is not only unable to do the kind of work that he or she engaged in previously, but is also unable to do any other kind of substantial gainful activity that exists in the national economy. In most states, SSI eligibility also entitles individuals to Medicaid benefits. As distinct from TANF, SSI for adults has federally established eligibility requirements and benefit levels and a nationwide disability determination process.", "Some individuals who apply for TANF may have impairments severe enough to make them eligible to receive SSI. Even before welfare reform, states had been actively identifying and referring potential SSI-eligible welfare recipients to SSI. In these cases, individuals may be on TANF while they are waiting for their SSI eligibility to be determined. In recent years, receiving an initial disability determination took an average of about 4 months from the date of SSI application. For claims that are denied and appealed, it may take over a year to reach a final decision. Generally, except for more temporary conditions, TANF recipients who have impairments but are not eligible for SSI or DI may be expected to work, as their impairments have been deemed not severe enough to preclude substantial employment.", "Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination against such persons who have impairments but who are nonetheless able to perform the essential functions of the job they seek or hold. Under Title II of the ADA, no qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from participation or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such entity.

Census believes the extensive set of disability questions contained in the SIPP make it a preferred source to examine most impairment-related issues. Nevertheless, SIPP data should be interpreted with care. For instance, the SIPP relies on self-reports of impairments and, therefore, may not accurately reflect the size of the general or TANF population with impairments. This can result in the overreporting or underreporting of impairments. For example, although some impairments, such as the inability to walk, missing or impaired limbs, or severely impaired vision, are easy to identify, many impairments are not. Individuals may not report less obvious impairments because of certain stigmas surrounding them or because they may not know of their existence. Some examples of these impairments include learning disabilities, depression, and mental illness. Other surveys use different approaches to measure impairments. The National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the University of Michigan\u2019s Women\u2019s Employment Survey, for example, use nonclinical in-depth diagnostic questioning to identify certain psychiatric disorders that may be overlooked by other survey techniques."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impairments Were Relatively Common Among TANF Recipients", "paragraphs": ["Physical and mental impairments were reported to be relatively common among TANF recipients and, to a lesser degree, their children, compared with their prevalence among the non-TANF population.

Specifically, in 29 percent of the TANF cases, only the adult recipient was reported to have impairments; in 7 percent of the cases, only the child was reported to have impairments; and in 8 percent of the cases both the adult and child were reported to have impairments. The prevalence of impairments among TANF recipients is greater than among the U.S. non-TANF population, among whom a total of 15 percent of individuals reported that they or their children had impairments.

Two-thirds of adult recipients with impairments were over 35 years old, while fewer than a quarter of adult recipients without impairments were older than 35. Age differences between individuals with and without impairments exist not only among TANF recipients, but among the non-TANF population as well. Among the non-TANF population with impairments, 81 percent were aged 36 to 62 compared with 54 percent of those without impairments. Figure 2 also shows that TANF recipients with and without impairments differed by race. Forty-three percent of adult recipients with impairments were white compared with 28 percent of adult recipients without impairments. Among the non-TANF population, roughly equal percentages of people with and without impairments were white. Finally, as shown in figure 2, we found that SIPP data indicated no significant differences between recipients with and without impairments in the percentage who were married or the percentage who had no more than a high school education.

This was true both of individuals with impairments and those without impairments. Other studies of TANF leavers that have included various time periods, populations, and methodologies have found similar results.For example, a recent study using data from the National Survey of America\u2019s Families found that 21.9 percent of families leaving welfare in 1997 returned within 2 years.

A variety of complicating factors related to their children\u2019s impairments may contribute to the decreased likelihood that this population of TANF recipients will pursue and maintain employment. For instance, parents of children with impairments may face demands on their time related to their children\u2019s impairments in the form of special therapies, the administering of medications, regular medical appointments, and hospitalizations. Furthermore, the chronic and unpredictable nature of many impairments, such as severe asthma and seizures, may cause parents to be absent from work frequently and with little or no advance notice to their employers. This may be particularly problematic for TANF leavers, many of whom enter into low- or unskilled entry-level jobs that offer limited flexibility and benefits, such as vacation time, sick leave, and health insurance.", "Finding child care and maintaining adequate health insurance coverage can be particularly challenging for parents caring for children with impairments. Children with impairments may need child care providers with the specialized training and equipment to accommodate their needs. In earlier work, we found that child care providers for children with special needs are sometimes in limited supply, especially in low-income neighborhoods. In addition to the difficulty in obtaining child care, families may be less likely to leave TANF if they are concerned about losing health care coverage. While the Congress established provisions to ensure that adults and children would continue to be eligible for Medicaid after leaving TANF, in our 1999 report we found some evidence to suggest that the reforms of 1996 initially contributed to confusion on the part of both beneficiaries and caseworkers about the criteria for maintaining Medicaid coverage after TANF benefits have been discontinued.

However, it is possible that these factors might affect whether individuals exit TANF, as evidenced in a study of SIPP data from the early 1990\u2019s that suggested that respondents with more severe disabilities were less likely to exit welfare than respondents with less severe limitations.Furthermore, intangible factors such as family support and personal motivation might also lead to very different experiences with TANF for otherwise similar individuals. In our 1997 survey of individuals receiving Social Security Disability Insurance, encouragement from family and friends and high self-motivation were identified to be among a range of factors that enabled these individuals with impairments to return to work.", "In addition, local TANF policies, which are not measured by the SIPP questionnaire, may affect whether recipients with impairments exit TANF. For example, local TANF policies regarding screening, assessment, and work requirements may affect whether recipients with impairments receive assistance that could help them move toward employment. In a national survey of county TANF agencies conducted for our October 2001 report, almost all the counties reported that they screened and assessed TANF recipients for impairments, but many used methods that may not accurately identify all impairments. In some cases, this may not be a problem because recipients may find jobs and leave welfare without special assistance. In other cases, recipients may need assistance targeted to their special needs to help them take steps toward employment or to transition to SSI.", "We also found that many counties reported exempting from state work requirements TANF recipients who had impairments or were caring for a child with an impairment. While exemptions from work requirements may be appropriate in some cases, in other cases it may mean recipients may not be getting the help, direction, or encouragement they need to take steps toward employment and increase their chances of exiting TANF. Exemptions from work requirements could also leave them more at risk of reaching a time limit without getting the assistance they need to find employment or alternative means of support such as SSI. Our previous work and other research makes clear that recipients exit TANF for a variety of reasons\u2014increased income, time limits, sanctions, and voluntary exits\u2014and that the reason that a family exits TANF could have an effect on the family\u2019s outcomes or circumstances.

The SIPP is a national household survey conducted by the U. S. Census Bureau in which panels of individuals representative of the nation, including those receiving TANF, are interviewed over a period of 2 years or more. At 4-month intervals, panel participants are asked a set of \u201ccore\u201d questions involving such subjects as their labor force activity, welfare program participation, and demographic characteristics. Periodically, the survey also asks a detailed set of questions called \u201ctopical modules\u201d on a variety of topics not covered in the core section, such as disabilities. For our purposes, we selected panels starting in 1996 and sampled TANF and non-TANF adults between the ages of 18 and 62. Data from the topical modules on disability that we analyzed were from interviews conducted from August 1997 to November 1997, and August 1999 to November 1999, in which respondents were asked about their status in recent months, including July of that year.

That is, they must meet any of the following criteria: 1.  Had difficulty performing one or more functional activities, including seeing, hearing, speaking, lifting, and carrying, using stairs, and walking. 2.  Had difficulty with one or more activities of daily living, such as getting around inside the home, getting in or out of a bed or chair, bathing, dressing, and eating. 3.  Had difficulty with one or more instrumental activities of daily living, including going outside the home, keeping track of money or bills, preparing meals, doing light housework, and using the telephone. 4.

Had an other mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday activities, including frequently depressed or anxious, trouble getting along with others, trouble concentrating, or trouble coping with day-to-day stress. 6.  Had a condition that limited the ability to work, including around the house. 7.  Had a condition that made it difficult to work at a job or business. 8.

Used a wheelchair, a cane, crutches, or a walker.", "For our purposes, we considered individuals to have impairments if their survey responses indicated they had impairments at both times that the disability topical module was administered (i.e., in both 1997 and 1999). We considered individuals to not have impairments if their survey responses indicated they did not have impairments at both times that the disability topical module was administered. Individuals whose impairment status differed between the first and second modules were excluded from the analyses. (We excluded 12.5 percent of respondents for this reason). We used appropriate techniques to weight the data to make population estimates for 1999 as well as to take into account the complex sampling design when estimating variances.

Therefore, the chances are 95 out of 100 that the actual population percentages are within no more than plus or minus 8 percentage points of our estimates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Logistic Regression Analyses", "paragraphs": ["In addition to descriptive statistics, we used logistic regression models to examine the effects of recipients\u2019 having impairments, and of recipients\u2019 caring for children with impairments on the likelihood of leaving TANF and of being employed after leaving TANF, after controlling for age, gender, marital status, race, and educational attainment. Recognizing that TANF policies may vary across states, we controlled for state in the models as well. The models of post-TANF employment also controlled for receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI).", "The results from the models we used are odds ratios that estimate, in table 1, the relative likelihood of leaving TANF for each factor and, in table 2, the effect of each factor on the likelihood of being employed after leaving TANF. If there were no significant differences between two groups, their odds would be equal, and the ratio of their odds would be 1.00. The more the odds ratio differs from 1.00 in either direction, the larger the effect it represents.", "The odds ratios in each table were computed in relation to a defined reference group. In table 1 an odds ratio that is greater than 1.00 indicates a greater likelihood of leaving TANF than the reference group while a ratio under 1.00 indicates a lesser likelihood of leaving than the reference group. In table 2 an odds ratio that is greater than 1.00 indicates a greater likelihood of being employed after leaving TANF than the reference group while a ratio under 1.00 indicates a lesser likelihood of being employed after leaving TANF than the reference group. Both tables also show the 95-percent confidence intervals around the odds ratios.
