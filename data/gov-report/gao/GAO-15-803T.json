The number of environmental litigation cases brought against EPA each year for fiscal years 1995 through 2010 varied with no discernible trend. Data available from the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and EPA show that the costs associated with such cases against EPA have also varied from year to year with no discernible trend. Specifically,", "Justice staff defended EPA on an average of about 155 such cases each year from fiscal years 1995 through 2010, for a total of about 2,500 cases during that time.

In addition, owing to statutory requirements to pay certain successful plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs, the Treasury paid about $15.5 million from fiscal years 2003 through 2010\u2014averaging about $2 million per fiscal year\u2014to plaintiffs in environmental cases. EPA paid approximately $1.5 million from fiscal years 2006 through 2010\u2014averaging about $305,000 per fiscal year\u2014to plaintiffs for environmental litigation claims.

In April 2012, GAO reported that FWS did not use a data system to track cases and associated fees and costs it paid.

The terms of the settlements in these deadline suits established a schedule to issue a statutorily required rule(s) or to issue a rule(s) unless EPA determined that doing so was not appropriate or necessary pursuant to the relevant statutory provision. None of the seven settlements included terms that finalized the substantive outcome of a rule. The impact of settlements in deadline suits on EPA's rulemaking priorities was limited primarily to one office within EPA\u2014the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)\u2014because most deadline suits are based on provisions of the Clean Air Act for which that office is responsible.

As the primary federal agency charged with implementing  many of the nation\u2019s environmental laws, EPA often faces the prospect of  litigation over its regulations and other actions. For example, several  environmental statutes have provisions that allow citizens\u2014including  individuals, states, companies, and associations\u2014to file suit against EPA  challenging certain agency actions, such as making regulations or  permitting decisions. In addition, some laws have provisions that allow  citizens to file lawsuits to compel EPA to take statutorily required actions,  such as issuing a rule, if it has not already done so with the statutorily  required time frames. These are often called deadline suits. Where EPA  is named as the defendant in lawsuits, the Department of Justice  (Justice), which is generally responsible for defending federal agencies in  court, provides EPA\u2019s legal defense, and EPA provides technical  expertise. Within Justice, the Environment and Natural Resources  Division handles most of the defense work on EPA environmental  litigation cases from its Washington, D.C., office, but some of the 94 U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices, particularly those in the New York City area, also  handle a small number of cases and may work on some cases managed  by the Environment and Natural Resources Division.", "As one of the primary federal agencies responsible for implementing the  Endangered Species Act, FWS also faces litigation over its regulations  and actions to carry out provisions of the act.

To  conduct our work, we obtained and analyzed historical data from two  components within Justice\u2014the Environment and Natural Resources  Division and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys. We gathered data  from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Case  Management System database that tracks basic information on cases,  including lead plaintiffs\u2019 names, filing and disposition dates, and relevant  statutes. To examine the extent to which settlements in deadline suits  have impacted EPA\u2019s rulemaking priorities, we obtained from EPA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel data on deadline suits it had settled from  January 2001 through July 2014 and the EPA office(s) responsible for  implementing the terms of the settlements.

These suits  include deadline suits. Second, the major environmental statutes typically  include judicial review provisions authorizing citizens to challenge certain  EPA actions, such as promulgating regulations or issuing permits. Third,  the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes challenges to certain  agency actions that are considered final actions, such as rulemakings and  decisions on permit applications.

Before EPA takes final action, the public or affected parties generally  have opportunities to provide comments and information to the agency. In  addition, administrative appeals procedures are available\u2014and in many  cases required\u2014to challenge EPA\u2019s final action without filing a lawsuit  in a court. For example, citizens can appeal an EPA air emission permit  to the agency\u2019s Environmental Appeals Board.

According to EPA and Justice officials,  when a deadline suit is filed, the agencies work together to determine  how to respond to the lawsuit, including whether or not to negotiate a  settlement with the plaintiff to issue a rule by an agreed upon deadline or  allow the lawsuit to proceed. In making this decision, EPA and Justice  consider several factors to determine which course of action is in the best  interest of the government. According to EPA and Justice officials, these  factors include (1) the cost of litigation, (2) the likelihood that EPA will win  the case if it goes to trial, and (3) whether EPA and Justice believe they  can negotiate a settlement that will provide EPA with sufficient time to  complete a final rule if required to do so.", "EPA and Justice officials have often chosen to settle deadline suits when  EPA has failed to fulfill a mandatory duty because it is very unlikely that  the government will win the lawsuit. In many such cases, the only dispute  is over the appropriate remedy (i.e., fixing a new date by which EPA  should act). Additionally, in such cases, officials may believe that  negotiating a settlement is the course of action most likely to create  sufficient time for EPA to complete the rulemaking if it is required to issue  a rule.

In all, Justice defended  EPA in nearly 2,500 cases from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2010.  The greatest number of cases was filed in fiscal year 1997, which,  according to a Justice official, may be explained by the fact that EPA  revised its national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate  matter in 1997, which may have caused some groups to sue. In addition,  according to the same official, in 1997 EPA implemented a \u201ccredible  evidence\u201d rule, which also was the subject of additional lawsuits. The fewest cases against EPA (102) were filed in fiscal year 2008, and Justice  officials were unable to pinpoint any specific reasons for the decline. In  fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the caseload increased.

Stakeholders did not identify any single factor  driving litigation, but instead, attributed litigation to a combination of  different factors. According to most of the stakeholders we interviewed, a  new presidential administration is an important factor in groups\u2019 decisions  to bring suits against EPA. Some stakeholders suggested that a new  administration viewed as favoring less enforcement could spur lawsuits  from environmental groups in response, or industry groups could sue to  delay or prevent the outgoing administration\u2019s actions. Other stakeholders  suggested that if an administration is viewed as favoring greater  enforcement of rules, industry may respond to increased activity by  bringing suit against EPA to delay or prevent the administration\u2019s actions,  and certain environmental groups may bring suit with the aim of ensuring  that required agency actions are completed during an administration they  perceive as having views similar to the groups\u2019 own. Most of the  stakeholders interviewed also said that the development of new EPA  regulations or the passage of amendments to environmental statutes may  lead parties to file suit against the new regulations or against EPA\u2019s  implementation of those amendments.
