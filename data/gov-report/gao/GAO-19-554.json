According to these officials, PM is in the initial phase of  developing M&E of its security assistance programs, including IMET.  They stated that for this reason PM is not currently planning to evaluate  human rights training provided under IMET. Although DOD implements  IMET, PM has overall responsibility for the program.", "According to State\u2019s January 2018 Guidance for the Design, Monitoring  and Evaluation Policy at the Department of State, it is essential that  bureaus and independent offices have comprehensive plans for  monitoring and evaluating all their programs and projects, and the plans  should include, among other things, an implementation schedule. An  M&E plan with a clear timeline for human rights training provided under  IMET will better position State and DOD to determine the effectiveness of  a significant component of U.S. human rights training for foreign militaries  and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, an evaluation of the  effectiveness of the human rights training would provide other important  stakeholders, including Congress, with evidence to better inform  decisions about U.S.\u2013funded human rights training provided under IMET.  Such an evaluation could be done as part of State\u2019s broader effort to  evaluate IMET."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and State Officials and Experts Identified Challenges to Achieving Human Rights Objectives through Training", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD and State officials and outside experts we interviewed,  there are several challenges to achieving human rights objectives\u2014such  as a decrease in human rights violations or promoting greater respect for  human rights\u2014through training alone. Such challenges include tailoring  training to the partner nation, integrating it into operational training, and a  lack of capabilities and accountability systems on the part of partner  nations.", "Agency officials and outside experts we spoke with stated that it can be  challenging to tailor human rights training to the partner nation, the unit  receiving assistance, and, when appropriate, the type of equipment being  provided. DIILS has developed a three\u2013tiered training model to meet the  requirements of Section 333, as discussed above, and DIILS officials  stated that they work to tailor trainings to the extent possible, including by  selecting trainers with experience relevant to the equipment that the U.S.  government provides and adding additional training when needed.  However, agency officials and experts stated that DIILS, as a small entity,  has limited capacity to tailor human rights trainings for specific situations,  especially since DIILS must cover certain material to meet the Section  333 requirements.", "In addition, DIILS\u2019 ability to tailor training is limited because, according to  agency officials, mandated human rights training\u2014typically a classroom  course\u2014is generally added to a security assistance package for a partner  nation once the planning process has been completed. Since the human  rights training is not integrated when the security assistance is planned, it  is not generally feasible to adjust the training after the fact to address a  specific situation in a given partner country, according to DOD officials.  DSCA officials acknowledged that most human rights training is not  sufficiently tailored to the needs of the recipient countries and that they  have not yet fully incorporated human rights training considerations into  security assistance planning. These officials said more work remains to  be done to ensure that assistance under the Section 333 authority include  comprehensive human rights training designed to meet specific partner  nation needs.", "Agency officials and outside experts we interviewed stated that it can be  challenging to achieve human rights objectives through human rights  training as currently delivered because mandated human rights training is  typically delivered as a stand\u2013alone course in a classroom setting, rather  than integrated into operational training. Agency officials stated that  integrated training can be more effective because it would expose  participants to practical skills that could help them comply with human  rights concepts and avoid human rights violations during military or law  enforcement operations. For example, State officials said that operational  training on how to run a checkpoint while respecting human rights  principles is likely to be more effective than training slides that outline  international treaties on human rights.", "Agency officials and outside experts also stated that partner nations may  lack capabilities and accountability systems. A military justice system  might not hold responsible soldiers who commit human rights violations.  A partner nation may lack equipment, experienced personnel, and  planning for precision targeting to avoid civilian casualties. Further,  partner nations may lack the political will to focus on human rights, and  poorly\u2013resourced security forces might see human rights as a low priority.  Agency officials and outside experts said that without defense institution  building that would address some of these broader systemic issues,  human rights training may be less likely to have an effect in some  countries. Finally, agency officials noted that in some instances,  competing priorities necessitate prioritizing U.S. national security interests  when providing security assistance, with human rights receiving less  emphasis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Instilling respect for human rights in our foreign partners is important to  achieving U.S. foreign policy goals. Human rights training that DOD and  State provide is one means to do so, but DOD and State are unable to  provide a comprehensive accounting of the full array of human rights  training they support. With the demand for human rights training  increasing as a result of Section 333, a process to ensure training  information is systematically tracked would provide DOD greater  assurance that it is complying with the statutory requirement to provide  human rights training as a component of Section 333 assistance.  Furthermore, DOD and State are not able to provide stakeholders,  including Congress, with an evaluation of the effectiveness of human  rights training the agencies support. Without monitoring and evaluation,  decision\u2013makers may be unable to identify whether human rights training  provided through Section 333, IMET, and other authorities is achieving  objectives and whether it could be adjusted for greater effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of three recommendations, including two to DOD  and one to State.
