For example, the Federal Network  Resilience division is responsible for managing the Continuous  Diagnostics and Mitigation program. The vulnerability information  garnered from this program could be used to develop signatures that  would target exploits that are affecting many federal agencies. US-CERT  officials stated that they plan to use this information to influence NCPS,  but could not provide specific details as how they plan to accomplish this  due to the relative immaturity of the Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation program.", "One reason that the signatures did not cover all identified vulnerabilities is  that the current tool DHS uses to manage and track the status of intrusion  detection signatures deployed within NCPS does not have the ability to  capture CVE information. US-CERT officials stated that when they  developed the Signature Management System tool, they were not  required to create a link between a signature and a published CVE data.  However, US-CERT has acknowledged this deficiency and stated this is  something it plans to address in the future.", "In addition, US-CERT officials agreed with the results of our analysis of  client vulnerabilities, but reiterated that the goal of NCPS was not to  protect against all vulnerabilities. US-CERT officials stated that agencies  with their own internal intrusion detection systems would likely be able to  comprehensively address the common client vulnerabilities we selected.  US-CERT officials stated that the overall intent of the system was to  protect against nation-state level threat actors who often leverage \u201czero- day\u201d exploits which may not have had a known mitigation or specific CVE  assigned.

However, NCPS did not possess intrusion detection signatures that fully  addressed all the advanced persistent threats we reviewed, which are  often a type of exploit leveraged by nation-state actors.", "US-CERT officials added that they must consider a variety of factors  when deciding which specific signatures to deploy and the length of time  they keep the signatures active. For example, the current version of the  software managing the intrusion detection function does not allow for  custom rules at each sensor. As a result, the signatures deployed must  be uniform across all sensors and cannot be tailored to a specific agency.  This adds an additional layer of complexity when deciding how long to  deploy signatures. For example, a smaller agency may be unaware of a  particular threat or associated signature, and thus could benefit from  having that signature deployed longer than a larger agency, which may  view it as potentially duplicative of signatures employed by its own  internal intrusion detection tool. Officials stated that they expect this issue  to be addressed when they upgrade to the next version of the software  that manages the intrusion detection function.", "We acknowledge that NCPS\u2019s intrusion detection capabilities draw on  many sources of vulnerability information and it should not necessarily  duplicate capabilities that agencies already possess. However, updating  the tool used to manage NCPS signatures to draw on and more clearly  link to publicly available, open-source repositories of vulnerability  information, such as the NVD, and using data from the Continuous  Diagnostic and Mitigation program as they become available as an input  into the development and management of signatures could add value by  minimizing the risk that known vulnerabilities will be exploited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NCPS Intrusion Prevention Capability Is Limited, but Further Enhancements Are Planned", "paragraphs": ["NCPS\u2019s ability to provide intrusion prevention is another key objective of  the system.

This is important because  malicious actors can propagate threats across multiple vectors and types  of network traffic.", "NCPS\u2019s intrusion prevention capability provides DHS with the ability to  proactively address network-based threats before they can potentially  cause harm to federal networks. This is accomplished by monitoring  network traffic to and from a customer agency\u2019s network and taking some  action to stop traffic (e.g., blocking an e-mail) that has characteristics  matching pre-defined indicators of malicious traffic.", "NCPS has the ability to prevent intrusions in near real time, but is  currently only able to proactively mitigate threats across a limited subset  of network traffic (i.e., Domain Name System, or DNS, blocking and e- mail filtering) at a selected group of customer agencies. Consequently,  there are other types of network traffic (e.g., web content), which are  common vectors of attack not currently being analyzed for potentially  malicious content.", "NSD officials noted that initial capabilities for intrusion prevention were  intended to be more robust, but were scaled back due to a change in the  program\u2019s approach. Specifically, these officials stated that the original  intent of the intrusion prevention deployment was to protect all types of  network traffic with classified indicators. Further, the solution was  supposed to provide government-furnished equipment to Internet service  provider networks as the backbone of the intrusion prevention function of  NCPS. However, NSD officials stated that, due to the excessive costs of  operating and maintaining the original solution, the agency decided in  May 2012 to change approaches. The new approach follows a managed  service model, where the Internet service providers would receive  classified indicators within their appropriate facilities and manage the  prevention for their particular customer agencies. Because of this  managed service model approach, NSD officials stated that the first set of  prevention capabilities was based in part on the existing solutions  provided by commercial service providers under the Defense Industrial  Base Opt-In pilot (later renamed the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services).  Officials also added that another motivation for the new approach was to  create a cybersecurity marketplace where the various Internet service  providers would compete with each other to provide better cybersecurity  solutions for federal customers.", "DHS officials stated that they are developing prevention capabilities for  other types of network traffic. Specifically, NSD officials stated that they  plan to introduce the ability to filter web content by January 1, 2016.

For  example, the security information and event management solution, which  has been operational since February 2012, simplifies cyber analysis by  providing a centralized platform in which the log data from similar events  can be aggregated, thereby reducing duplication. The tool also facilitates  analysts\u2019 ability to correlate related events that might otherwise go  unnoticed and provides visualization capabilities, making it easier to see  relationships. Additionally, NSD has established functionality that enables  the analysis of the characteristics of malicious code.

For example, one agency stated that  due to its federated nature, getting a response from the impacted entity  within their agency was a challenge and could only be rectified by  reaching out to site owners for every incident notification they receive.  Consequently, officials stated, they typically only reached out when the  notification had met the threshold of a security event. Officials from this  agency stated that they had instituted a new standard operating  procedure that requires the analyst processing the incident notification to  reach out to DHS prior to closing it out.

Additionally, we conducted a similar evaluation for  the signatures associated with a selection of 12 common advanced  persistent threats from 2014. Further we evaluated the number of  intrusion detection signatures DHS had issued for each client vulnerability  during fiscal year 2014 and compared them to the number of signatures  from publicly available repositories, such as common vulnerabilities and  exposures (CVE) published for each corresponding category of  vulnerability during the same period.
