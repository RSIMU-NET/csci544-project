GAO was asked to determine the basis of EPA's conclusions that (1) the rule's economic impacts would not be significant enough to merit a detailed analysis and (2) the NSR program, prior to the rule, discouraged some energy efficiency projects. GAO, among other things, reviewed EPA's analysis of the rule and its impacts, as well as guidance from EPA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on analyzing such impacts. GAO also met with industry and environmental stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with agency guidance, EPA used a limited screening analysis that relied on staff's professional judgment and public comments from earlier reform proposals to conclude that the final rule would decrease emissions and health risks and not impose significant costs. EPA determined that neither the rule's benefits nor its costs would exceed a $100 million threshold that triggers requirements to conduct a more comprehensive assessment. EPA issued the rule to streamline the NSR permitting process and provide flexibility to industry. For example, the rule provides a mechanism for companies to develop plantwide emissions limits, which would allow them to make changes in one part of a facility's operations as long as they offset emissions increases with decreases elsewhere within the facility. While OMB agreed with EPA's conclusion that the rule would not have significant economic effects, it determined that the rule was significant for policy reasons. Therefore, OMB asked EPA if it could better quantify the rule's potential impacts, but the agency lacked the necessary data to do so. EPA lacked comprehensive data on the program's economic impacts, and could not predict how many facilities would use the rule's optional provisions. Several states and environmental groups disagree with EPA's conclusions, claiming that it will enable facilities to increase their emissions. These parties have filed suit against EPA challenging the rule and also have petitioned EPA to reconsider the rule. We did not identify any comprehensive assessments that contradicted or supported EPA's conclusions or the assertions of those who oppose the rule. Because of the data limitations, it was not possible to verify EPA's conclusions about the rule's effects. Because it lacked comprehensive data, EPA relied on anecdotes from the four industries it believes are most affected by NSR to conclude that the NSR program (prior to the rule) discouraged some energy efficiency projects, such as upgrades to industrial boilers, including some that would have decreased emissions. Because the information is anecdotal, EPA's findings do not necessarily represent the program's effects across the industries subject to the program. Several environmental groups disputed EPA's findings. One such group said that factors other than NSR, such as economic downturns, discouraged the projects. Furthermore, EPA's conclusion that some projects would have decreased emissions assumed that facilities would not increase production after performing the projects. However, according to EPA and the executive director of an industry group, companies often expand production after implementing energy efficiency projects because it is advantageous to maximize production at the most efficient facilities. Such expansions could increase emissions and related health risks, although EPA asserts that this would be offset by decreased production and emissions at less efficient facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent changes to the Clean Air Act\u2019s New Source Review (NSR)  program\u2014one of the act\u2019s key mechanisms for maintaining air quality to  protect public health\u2014have been the subject of congressional debate and  have drawn scrutiny from numerous stakeholders, including  representatives of industry, environmental groups, and state and local air  pollution control authorities. While some industry officials describe the  existing program as costly and characterized by uncertainty,  environmental groups and a coalition of state attorneys general assert that  it is, and has been, an important component of the Clean Air Act. In recent  years, the program has become increasingly controversial, as the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken enforcement action  against companies in several industries, including some electricity  producers, forest products manufacturers, and petroleum refineries,  alleging noncompliance with the program. Some of the affected companies  have agreed to settlements that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars  and require emissions reductions, while others are in various stages of  litigation.", "The NSR program, which seeks to protect public health, maintain  compliance with air quality standards, and preserve and enhance air  quality in national parks and scenic areas, requires companies that are  major sources of air pollution to install pollution controls in their facilities  when constructed. The program also requires companies to install such  controls in existing facilities when making physical or operational  changes\u2014such as the addition of new production equipment\u2014that cause a  significant increase in air emissions. Such changes are called \u201cmajor  modifications.\u201d Congress believed that incorporating pollution controls  into the design and construction of new and modified air pollution sources  was generally an efficient way of controlling air pollution from large  industrial sources. Congress also excluded existing facilities from NSR  requirements until they made changes that increased their emissions.  Companies that want to make major modifications in existing facilities  must apply to state or local agencies for an NSR permit and then install the  controls. The cost of installing controls varies but can reach hundreds of  millions of dollars for some facilities, according to an EPA program  manager. However, companies can qualify for exemptions from these  requirements if, for example, (1) a modification is considered \u201croutine  maintenance and repair,\u201d (2) the company agrees not to significantly  increase its emissions after making a physical or operational change to its  facility, or (3) the company offsets any emissions increases resulting from  a change in a facility with emissions reductions achieved elsewhere within  that facility.", "EPA has long recognized a need to revise the NSR program and began a  reform process in 1992 that resulted in proposed changes to the program  in 1996 and 1998. The agency received wide-ranging comments from the  public on how the program should be revised and held meetings with the  public and other stakeholders, but did not develop final rules by the time  the new administration took office in 2001. In May 2001, as part of its  proposed national energy policy, the Vice President\u2019s National Energy  Policy Development Group recommended that EPA report to the President  on the NSR program\u2019s impact on energy efficiency investments, among  other things. In response to this recommendation, EPA concluded in its  June 2002 NSR Report to the President, that NSR had discouraged some  energy efficiency investments at existing industrial facilities.", "After completing this report, EPA modified certain of the proposed 1996  NSR revisions and finalized them as a rule in December 2002 (hereafter  referred to as the NSR final rule). According to EPA, the rule will, among  other things, provide greater certainty for facilities regulated under the  program and streamline the NSR permitting process while ensuring the  current level of environmental protection. As part of this process, EPA  analyzed the rule\u2019s anticipated economic effects, such as its impacts on  emissions, health risks, the costs of installing and maintaining pollution  control equipment, and administrative costs incurred by government  agencies. Under Executive Order 12866 and the Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act of 1995, agencies must perform detailed assessments of  economically significant rules\u2014those rules that may have an annual effect  on the economy of $100 million or more. If a rule\u2019s impacts are not  expected to exceed this threshold, a more detailed economic analysis is  generally not required. According to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), the agency responsible for overseeing agency compliance with  Executive Order 12866, agencies may use their discretion when  conducting a screening analysis to determine whether a rule\u2019s economic  impacts may reach the $100 million threshold and require a more detailed  assessment. EPA\u2019s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards has  developed a guidance document that the agency uses to analyze the  impacts of air quality rules, which discusses how to conduct a screening  analysis.", "You asked us to determine the basis of (1) EPA\u2019s analysis of the economic  impacts of the final rule and its conclusion that the rule would not create  significant enough benefits or costs to require a more detailed analysis and  (2) EPA\u2019s conclusions that the NSR program (prior to the final rule)  discouraged some energy efficiency projects.

For example, ozone can inflame lung tissue and increase  susceptibility to bronchitis and pneumonia. In addition, nitrogen oxides  and sulfur dioxide contribute to the formation of fine particles that have  been linked to aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, and premature  death. In 2001 (the most recent year for which data were available), 133  million Americans lived in areas with air pollution levels above at least one  of the health-based air quality standards, according to EPA.", "The New Source Review program was established in 1977 and is intended  to protect public health, as well as national parks and wilderness areas,  from additional air pollution when new industrial facilities are built and  existing ones expand. The fundamental logic of the program, according to  EPA, is that industrial facilities should install modern pollution controls at  the time of construction or when making physical or operational changes,  such as adding new production equipment, that cause a significant  increase in air emissions. Subject to EPA\u2019s oversight, state and local air  quality agencies generally administer air quality programs, including the  NSR program. In recent years, EPA has taken enforcement action against  companies in several industries, including some electricity producers,  forest products manufacturers, and petroleum refineries, alleging  noncompliance with the program. Some of these parties settled these  cases soon after the enforcement actions were filed, although electricity  producers assert that the actions are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act,  according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In January 2002,  however, DOJ concluded that the enforcement actions are consistent with  the act.", "Recognizing the need for revisions to the NSR program, EPA began a  reform effort in 1992 and 1993 when it held workshops with stakeholders  and established a federal advisory committee in 1993. Largely on the basis  of this committee\u2019s recommendations, EPA issued proposed NSR revisions  in 1996 that were intended to reduce costs imposed on companies that  undergo NSR permitting without interfering with efforts to attain air  quality goals. EPA solicited public comment on the proposals at that time  and again in 1998, when it sought additional information on an alternative  method for determining whether a facility modification should be subject  to NSR. The agency received numerous comments that provided wide- ranging views on how the program should be revised.

In response to this  recommendation, and given that EPA does not maintain such information,  the agency solicited public input on how the NSR program had affected  the ability of companies to undertake energy efficiency projects in their  existing facilities. EPA defined energy efficiency projects as those that  would have produced greater output per unit of fuel input (e.g., more  electricity per ton of coal burned), regardless of the effect on emissions. In  its June 2002 NSR Report to the President, EPA concluded, among other  things, that NSR had not affected investments in new power plants and  refineries but had discouraged some energy efficiency projects at existing  facilities, including some that would have reduced air emissions.", "After completing this report, EPA modified the 1996 proposed NSR  revisions to provide regulatory flexibility to industrial facilities so that  they could pursue energy efficiency projects, among other things.

For example,  EPA forecasted that the rule would encourage companies to implement  energy efficiency projects that would reduce emissions, such as upgrades  to boilers used to generate power.", "In its screening analysis, EPA assumed that the final rule would not  impose significant economic costs on companies because the rule created  voluntary options and companies would most likely only elect to use them  if they thought the provisions would achieve an overall economic benefit.  Therefore, the agency assumed that any time a company opted to use one  of the provisions, the benefits to the company would outweigh any costs  incurred. In addition, because EPA concluded that the rule would  decrease emissions, it did not forecast any increases in public health costs  resulting from the final rule, such as increased incidence of asthma or  other respiratory problems.

Regarding the benefits of the program, EPA  does not maintain comprehensive data on the number and type of facilities  that obtain NSR permits, or the reduced air emissions achieved after  facilities install pollution controls, according to a senior agency  economist. In 2001, EPA attempted to estimate the emissions reductions at  facilities that obtained NSR permits; however, senior agency officials  responsible for the analysis acknowledged that it had several limitations.  For example, these officials said the analysis included only facilities that  were located in areas that met federal air quality standards, thereby  excluding a large portion of the universe of affected facilities. In addition,  EPA had incomplete data on facilities located in EPA region 6, which  includes Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.  Furthermore, the analysis did not distinguish between benefits that  resulted from the installation of pollution controls at new facilities and  those at existing facilities, which are the focus of the final rule.

For example,  the economist said that the final rule allows companies to develop a  plantwide emissions limit as an alternative to NSR, but only those  companies that find this provision advantageous are likely to use it and  EPA could not accurately determine how many companies this might  include. According to EPA, companies\u2019 decisions about whether to pursue  voluntary options are case-specific and dependent on a number of factors.  Therefore, the agency was unable to model how often and when the final  rule\u2019s options would be used. In contrast, most of the other rules EPA  develops generally impose new requirements on a known universe of  companies, according to a NSR program manager. In these cases, it is  much easier to determine the costs and benefits of a rule because the  agency can gather information from the affected companies. For example,  if EPA required all companies within a particular industry to install certain  pollution controls, it could gather information on the average costs of such  equipment and the anticipated reductions in air emissions.

According to EPA, this analysis was not intended as  a comprehensive economic analysis of the rule\u2019s benefits and costs and  was not used to make decisions about the rule. Like the screening  analysis, it relied primarily on qualitative information and arrived at  similar conclusions. For example, EPA asserted that the exemption for  companies that use state-of-the-art pollution controls would save  companies NSR permitting costs. EPA also asserted that this provision  would induce facilities to voluntarily install controls to avoid NSR, thereby  reducing emissions.", "While the supplemental analysis was qualitative, it used some data from a  limited number of facilities to estimate the effects of some of the rule\u2019s  provisions on a wider universe of facilities. Specifically, the analysis  considered the experiences of six companies that had used regulatory  options similar to those provided for in the final rule to determine that  such limits would lead to emissions reductions. For example, on the basis  of these six case studies, EPA stated that if 75 percent of facilities in three  industry sectors opted to use plantwide emissions limits, emissions of  volatile organic compounds could be cut by up to 17,000 tons annually  (less than 1 percent of the total volatile organic compounds emitted in  2001, the most recent year for which data were available). EPA also said  that the emissions reductions would be greater if the analysis was  extended to other industry sectors and pollutants.", "However, EPA did not use statistically valid methods to identify the six  companies on which it based this portion of its analysis.

However, EPA was required under the  Paperwork Reduction Act to assess some of the costs and benefits that  would accrue to companies and government agencies under the final rule.  Specifically, the act requires agencies to estimate the record keeping  burden associated with a rule and report this information to OMB.  Therefore, EPA relied on limited available data and its professional  judgment to make estimates necessary to satisfy this requirement. In  February 2003, after issuing the final rule, EPA estimated that it would  impose about $6.5 million in annual burden on state and local air quality  agencies, which include legal and other costs associated with  incorporating the final rule into the state\u2019s air pollution control plan,  collecting public comment on the changes, and obtaining state  legislatures\u2019 approval of the changes. This analysis also estimated that 14  facilities would use the final rule\u2019s provisions during each of the first 3  years of implementation, reducing the previous annual burden by  $650,000. This analysis, like the screening analysis, found that the rule  would impose less than $100 million in annual costs on companies and  government agencies.

We determined that these  anecdotes generally went through two rounds of review. First, trade  associations said that their members reviewed and discussed the  anecdotes before submitting them to EPA. After receiving the  submissions, EPA program managers said they used their expertise and  judgment to evaluate the credibility and reliability of the anecdotes.  According to these managers, they paid specific attention to whether (1)  the project described in an anecdote was technically feasible; (2) an  anecdote\u2019s conclusions about how NSR discouraged a project were  consistent with EPA\u2019s understanding of how the NSR provisions would  apply to that project; and (3) the conclusions were based on \u201creal-life,\u201d  rather than hypothetical, situations. EPA program managers found the  anecdotes to be generally credible. While some may have been more  relevant than others (e.g., \u201creal life\u201d examples were more relevant than  hypothetical ones), none was dismissed for failing to meet these criteria,  according to an EPA program manager. Agency staff familiar with the NSR  program then compiled, reviewed, and synthesized this information and  concluded that complying with NSR may have deterred some investments  in energy efficiency projects, including some that may have reduced air  emissions. It is important to note that the energy efficiency findings in the  Report to the President were not the basis of the analysis of the economic  impacts of the final rule, which found that the final rule would encourage  energy efficiency projects, according to an EPA manager of the NSR  program.", "The anecdotes generally cited three ways in which these industries believe  complying with NSR discouraged energy efficiency projects, including  concerns that (1) EPA would subsequently determine that projects  companies initiated as routine maintenance, repair, and replacement  without an NSR permit were actually major modifications subject to NSR  and enforcement action; (2) the test used to measure the emissions  impacts of company modifications was not fair; and (3) the NSR  permitting process caused unanticipated project delays and increased  costs.", "The first barrier, concerns about possible enforcement actions, stemmed  from recent EPA enforcement litigation against certain electricity  producers in which EPA contested industry\u2019s claims that certain projects  were exempt from NSR because they qualified as routine maintenance.  EPA maintained that these projects were in fact major modifications that  should have triggered NSR. According to senior industry representatives,  this meant that EPA could consider potentially thousands of projects that  industry had previously completed without an NSR permit under this  exemption as NSR violations, including some that state and local air  quality agencies had approved and confirmed did not trigger NSR. This  prompted some industry officials to allege that EPA was reinterpreting  what could be considered routine maintenance exempt from NSR. EPA\u2019s  Office of Enforcement, however, maintains that the agency is correctly  interpreting and enforcing the program.", "According to senior representatives of the electric utility and refining  industries, this litigation has produced substantial uncertainty for  companies pursuing facility modifications. Part of this uncertainty may  stem from what industry officials describe as a lack of clear policy  guidance on what qualifies as routine maintenance. EPA has never  explicitly defined routine maintenance since the exclusion was  established, although some clarification has grown out of EPA  enforcement, most notably in the case of Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v.  Reilly (WEPCO). This court decision upheld EPA\u2019s consideration of the  nature, extent, purpose, frequency, and cost of facility modifications, as  well as other relevant factors, when determining whether a project  qualifies for the routine maintenance and repair exemption. EPA  maintains that it takes a case-by-case approach to determining whether a  modification constitutes routine maintenance, and has cited WEPCO as  support for its recent enforcement actions.", "However, industry comments submitted to EPA claim that the agency\u2019s  enforcement actions, combined with what they regard as a lack of clear  guidance, make it difficult for them to reliably predict when their projects  will trigger NSR, especially when EPA may later disagree with state and  local NSR determinations. Companies are therefore reluctant to perform  projects that could trigger NSR or possible enforcement litigation,  including, they assert, energy efficiency projects. According to EPA, the  agency\u2019s proposed rule on the routine maintenance exemption would  address some of these concerns by changing its definition.  EPA expects to  issue the rule by the end of 2003.", "Several environmental groups disputed EPA\u2019s findings. For example, an  environmental advocacy group involved in NSR issues claimed that the  proposed rule would simply broaden the exemption in violation of the  Clean Air Act. One alternative in the proposed rule would allow companies  to claim as routine maintenance any modifications as long as they cost less  than a certain percentage\u2014depending on the industry\u2014of the total cost of  the polluting unit, such as a boiler, or the entire facility. Another  alternative would allow companies to invoke the routine maintenance  exemption if they are replacing equipment that performs the same  function as its predecessor and does not alter the basic design of a facility.  Environmentalists assert that these exemptions will allow companies to  falsely treat major plant modifications as routine maintenance, avoid NSR  requirements, and increase emissions.", "The second barrier cited in the anecdotes was the test used to determine  whether a modification would increase emissions beyond the NSR  threshold. Under the program prior to the final rule, companies making  physical or operational changes that did not qualify for exemptions, such  as the routine maintenance exemption, had to undergo this test to gauge  the changes\u2019 effects on emissions. Before the final rule, a company was to  compare a facility\u2019s emissions during the previous 24 months to its future  potential emissions if its facility was run at maximum capacity or the  highest capacity allowed by the existing NSR permit after making the  change, even if the facility had not run at this level before, or did not plan  to in the future. If the expected future emissions resulting from the change  were more than 40 tons per year higher after making the change, the  project qualified as a significant emission increase and triggered NSR.  Companies (except electric utilities) could request that the permitting  agency allow the use of any different two-year period based on a  demonstration that it is more representative of normal operation. Electric  utilities may use any 2-year period in the previous 5 years as their actual  emissions baseline.", "Industry submissions to EPA on the NSR program asserted that having to  assume maximum capacity biased the test and significantly overstated the  true emissions impact of a project. They cited cases where they expected a  project to reduce emissions, but the test showed that it would increase  them. For example, a refinery planned to implement a project that it  expected would improve the energy efficiency of a furnace by 5 percent.  While the furnace was permitted to emit 45 tons of air pollution per year, it  was not operating at full capacity and was therefore only emitting 35 tons  per year. According to the facility\u2019s submission, the project would  decrease annual emissions to 32 tons per year through more efficient fuel  combustion while running at the same capacity. However, the emissions  test required the refinery to compare its historical emissions\u201435 tons per  year\u2014with its future potential emissions running at full capacity\u201445 tons  per year. Because the facility was located in an area where a 10 ton per  year increase triggers NSR requirements, the facility would have had to  obtain an NSR permit for the modification.", "Likewise, a pulp and paper mill planned to install an air flow system that  would allow its boiler to more efficiently burn natural gas, creating annual  savings of $1 million. By using less fuel, the project was also expected to  reduce future emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile  organic compounds. However, the facility had been operating below its  maximum capacity during the 24 months preceding the planned  installation. Therefore, when managers compared the facility\u2019s actual  emissions during this period to its future potential emissions, assuming it  would operate at maximum capacity after the modification, the projected  emissions increase qualified as a major modification, even though the  project was expected to reduce emissions. If the company proceeded with  the project under NSR and installed the best available pollution controls, it  would incur $17 million in total costs, making the project cost-prohibitive,  according to the industry submission.", "While these anecdotes assert that having to assume maximum capacity  under this test was unfair, the NSR program required facilities to assume  that the changed equipment would operate at the maximum level allowed  in its operating permit unless the owners or operators of the facility made  a legally binding commitment to operate at lower production levels,  according to EPA. Otherwise, EPA and state and local air quality agencies  would have no way of ensuring that companies would not have a  significant increase in emissions under the NSR rules after making a  physical change, according to EPA. In addition, EPA acknowledged in its  Report to the President that performing an energy efficiency project can  provide an economic incentive to increase production levels at more  efficient facilities, potentially resulting in increased emissions. However,  EPA\u2019s new final rule now gives a company the option to compare a  facility\u2019s previous emissions to its projected actual emissions, instead of  its maximum potential emissions. EPA believes that this new test will  remove disincentives that discourage facilities from making the types of  changes that improve operating efficiency, implement pollution prevention  projects, and result in other environmentally beneficial changes. In  addition, EPA asserts that the new record keeping and reporting measures  required with this option will provide the information necessary for  reviewing authorities to ensure that such changes are made consistent  with the Clean Air Act.", "The anecdotes also identified a third barrier. According to industry,  unpredictable delays associated with the NSR process disrupt a project\u2019s  planning and construction timetables, increasing project costs. Program  managers and technical directors representing forest product companies,  chemical manufacturers, refineries, and utilities commented on this issue,  stating that the NSR permitting process can last anywhere from 6 to 24  months, thereby delaying or disrupting project planning and construction.  Petroleum refinery representatives claimed to be uniquely affected by this,  asserting that NSR permitting delays made it difficult for them to meet  federal mandates and deadlines for producing cleaner-burning gasoline,  potentially subjecting them to fines and enforcement actions. Industry  officials also claimed that project delays they attributed to NSR permitting  resulted in equipment wearing out, increasing replacement costs, and  raising safety issues. They also stated that certain repair projects required  quick decisions and turnaround, both of which are not compatible with the  amount of time it takes to obtain an NSR permit and install the appropriate  pollution controls. An EPA NSR program manager confirmed that  permitting delays could hinder energy efficiency upgrades in emergency  situations where a company needs to quickly replace broken or worn out  machinery and would like to install more efficient equipment. However,  the program manager said such situations are rare and that the timelines  for planned facility upgrades are generally compatible with the NSR  permitting schedule. In addition to permitting delays, some of the  anecdotes also asserted that, if a project triggered NSR requirements, the  costs of installing pollution controls would have outweighed the  anticipated benefits of the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The National Academy of Public Administration and Environmental Stakeholders Reached Different Conclusions about NSR\u2019s Effects on Energy Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["In an April 2003 report to the Congress on the NSR program, the  National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) stated that while a  lack of data prevented the organization from determining the extent to  which NSR has impeded energy efficiency improvements, NSR might  indeed have discouraged some industrial sources from undertaking  economically and environmentally sound maintenance and energy  efficiency projects. However, according to NAPA, some facilities continue  to operate without modern pollution controls because of widespread  noncompliance with NSR or flaws in its implementation. NAPA said that  these facilities have an advantage over their competitors because they  have not incurred the costs of controlling emissions, and that such  facilities have little basis to complain that NSR has adversely affected the  efficiency of their operations. An EPA manager for the NSR program took  exception to NAPA's findings, stating that EPA and the states have  enforced the program over the years. The official also said that facilities  only trigger NSR when they make physical changes in, or changes in the  method of operation of, their facilities that significantly increase  emissions.  Therefore, if the facilities NAPA refers to have not undertaken  such modifications, they have complied with the program, according to  the official.", "Several environmental groups experienced in NSR issues disagreed with  industry\u2019s claims about the NSR program\u2019s effects on energy efficiency. A  representative of one such group, who has testified before the Congress  on NSR, pointed out that if companies truly wanted to avoid NSR, they  could accept an emissions limit in their operating permit and make a  formal commitment to not emit above the NSR threshold. Companies that  agree to such limits may make any modifications they want without  triggering NSR, provided they do not exceed the limit. With this option  available, the representative asserted that the NSR process could not deter  energy efficiency projects that were expected to reduce emissions because  they would not trigger NSR, since they would not increase emissions  above the program threshold. For example, a source with an operating  permit limit could make a physical or operational change without an NSR  permit and increase emissions by 39.9 tons per year (where the threshold  is 40 tons per year) and not trigger NSR. The environmental representative  cited other factors, such as poor economic conditions and a lack of  willingness to control air emissions, as the primary factors hindering  companies from pursuing these projects, rather than compliance with  NSR.", "Representatives of the chemical, forest products, and electric utility  industries disagreed with this position and said that companies are  reluctant to accept an operating permit limit because they would be giving  up their flexibility to increase production in response to changing  economic and market conditions, just for the sake of one energy efficiency  project. A trade association representing the chemical industry also told us  that the lengthy and protracted process for obtaining an operating permit  makes it impractical to renegotiate a permit limit every time a company  wants to undertake an energy efficiency project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Anecdotes Do Not Necessarily Represent NSR\u2019s Effect on Energy Efficiency Projects Industrywide or Their Overall Impact on Emissions", "paragraphs": ["As EPA notes in its Report to the President, its conclusions about the  effect of NSR on energy efficiency projects are based on anecdotal  information because the agency lacked comprehensive data on the  number of projects that did not go forward as a result of NSR, according to  EPA program managers.

Reaching such conclusions  about the program\u2019s broader effects on energy efficiency projects would  have required gathering information from either a statistically valid sample  of companies subject to the program or a comprehensive survey of  affected industries. Conducting such an analysis, however, would have  required substantial resources.", "In addition, EPA\u2019s conclusion that the NSR program had discouraged some  energy efficiency investments that would have reduced emissions was  based on the assumption that the companies would not increase their  production after completing the energy efficiency project, according to an  EPA official responsible for the analysis. Under this assumption, 23 of the  69 anecdotes predicted that the proposed projects would decrease  emissions, 11 predicted an increase, 2 predicted no change, and 33 (or 48  percent) did not include sufficient data to determine the emissions  impact. However, facilities\u2019 future production levels and air pollutant  emissions may fluctuate in response to changing economic conditions and  other factors. In addition, performing an energy efficiency project can  provide an economic incentive to increase production levels at more  efficient facilities, potentially increasing emissions and related health  risks.", "The executive director of one industry trade association stated that it  would make economic sense to increase production at more efficient  facilities. The representative \u201ccould not imagine a utility spending money  on extra capacity, and then not utilizing it.\u201d In addition, according to EPA,  production at more efficient facilities could supplant that at less efficient  and higher-emitting facilities. Therefore, even in cases where an energy  efficiency project was expected to reduce emissions, future increases in  production after implementing a project could possibly increase  emissions, as well as related health risks, past the NSR threshold.", "On the other hand, according to an EPA official responsible for the  agency\u2019s energy efficiency analysis, the agency expected that if a company  increased production at its more efficient facilities, it could decrease  production at its less efficient facilities. Therefore, any emissions  increases due to higher production levels at more efficient facilities would  be offset by decreased production elsewhere. In addition, a facility\u2019s  emissions could decrease more than expected after implementing an  energy efficiency project if the facility decreased production, for example,  due to poor economic conditions.
