Development of these technologies is key to meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements. A reliable TRA serves as the basis for realistic discussions on how to mitigate risks as programs move forward from the early stages of technology development. Not identifying these technologies as critical means Congress may not have had the full picture of the technology risks and their potential effect on cost, schedule, and performance goals as increasing financial commitments were made. The Navy is not required to provide Congress with an update on the program's progress, including its technology development efforts, until fiscal year 2020\u2014when $8.7 billion for lead ship construction will have already been authorized.

In our 2009 report on best practices in  shipbuilding, we identified design maturity as important step in reducing  cost and schedule risk. As such, we recommended that the design be  stabilized through completion of basic and functional design and 3D  product modeling prior to the start of construction for a new ship.  Because, as mentioned previously, the Navy defined design  arrangements on the Columbia class program as being equivalent to  basic and functional design, having 100 percent of the arrangements  completed prior to the start of Columbia class construction would meet  the intent of our prior recommendation.", "Further, our analysis found that the Columbia class program\u2019s planned  level of design completion prior to starting construction is much higher  than most recent Navy shipbuilding programs. For example, the Virginia  class attack submarine program started construction with only 43 percent  of the design complete compared with a planned 83 percent completion  for the Columbia class. The Columbia class program also plans to have a  52 week buffer between the completion of design for an area of the  submarine and the start of construction on that area, which is intended to  allow time to address any challenges that may arise and thus minimize  schedule delays. Additionally, the Navy plans to have all components fully  developed 8 months before they are required in the shipyard, which will  provide some additional schedule buffer to address challenges before the  components are actually needed for construction.", "To facilitate design completion, the Navy made a commitment at the start  of the program to set realistic and reasonable requirements and to keep  those requirements stable throughout the program. This approach is also  in keeping with our previously identified best practices, which highlight the  importance of demonstrating balance among program requirements,  technology demands, and cost considerations. The Columbia class  program has not had any significant requirements changes since DOD\u2019s  Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated the Capability  Development Document in 2015. Setting realistic and reasonable  requirements also permitted the Navy and shipyards to reuse some  design elements for components of the submarine that are similar in  design and function to the Virginia class instead of requiring new design  work. Similarly, the program has worked to keep stable ship specifications  to minimize design disruptions.", "The technical specifications for the ship have been set since 2014, and  the program manager maintains personal visibility and accountability over  any proposed deviations or changes to the specifications. According to  the program manager, to date there have been minimal changes made to  the technical baseline. These steps help to minimize design rework that  can be caused by changing requirements, as was seen on the Littoral  Combat Ship program, and that can lead to cost increases or scheduled  delays. The program has also conducted some prototyping efforts\u2014 including building representative portions of the submarine to  demonstrate that its design tool can send the correct information to the  shop floor to build the ship\u2014and has plans for more.", "However, based on our analysis of the program\u2019s current technology  development plan and status, it is unlikely that the Navy\u2019s planned 83  percent of design disclosures will be finalized at the time construction  begins for the lead ship in 2021. Similar to many shipbuilding programs,  the Columbia class program plans to continue to mature technologies into  their final form while detail design is underway. As we have previously  reported, to offset this risk, shipbuilding programs, including the Columbia  class, often include design \u201creservations\u201d for space, weight, power,  cooling, and other key attributes to reserve a footprint for components. As  contractors or government employees develop and refine technologies or  systems, they provide vendor furnished information (VFI) or government  furnished information (GFI) to the shipyards to update the design.  Completion of the detail design of the submarine\u2014and subsequent  achievement of design stability to support a properly sequenced  construction phase\u2014requires shipbuilders to have final information on the  form and fit of each system that will be installed on the ship, including the  system\u2019s weight and its demand for power, cooling, and other supporting  elements.", "As development proceeds on a new technology, initial assumptions about  size, shape, weight, and power and cooling requirements can change,  potentially significantly. These changes in VFI or GFI\u2014if not resolved  early in the design phase\u2014can introduce considerable volatility to the  design process for a lead ship. As such, in our May 2009 report, we  recommended that, to attain the level of knowledge needed to retire  design risk and reduce construction disruptions, complete\u2014versus  notional\u2014VFI or GFI must be incorporated for the design to be truly  stable. DOD concurred with this recommendation. We have previously  reported that other Navy programs have run into difficulties, including out- of-sequence or more costly construction work, when space, weight,  power, and cooling reservations are based on immature or ill-defined  technologies or components that have changed in size, weight, or other  attributes when they are finalized. Ramifications from such changes can  ripple through much of the ship design. For example, we reported in 2009  that during construction of the Seawolf-class attack submarine, the  AN/BSY-2 combat system did not fit into the space and weight  reservations that the Navy had allocated within the submarine\u2019s design.  As a result, a portion of the submarine had to be redesigned at additional  cost.", "However, the Navy has entered the detail design phase for the Columbia  class with incomplete technical data on several key components that are  either significant in size relative to the submarine or spread throughout a  number of spaces of the submarine. These components include IPS, the  nuclear reactor, the propulsor and coordinated stern, and SAS. This  situation is problematic because even if the Columbia class design is 83  percent complete, if it contains many reservations for systems that are not  fully developed the design will continue to be immature and subject to  change. Thus, the 83 percent completion metric may be somewhat  meaningless since elements of the design are uncertain and could  change because of the incomplete technology development efforts.", "As shown in figure 12, the Columbia class program has entered the detail  design phase with a number of technologies still in development or design  finalization, which means that the VFI/GFI for these systems are not yet  final. This figure also depicts our recommended knowledge points for  shipbuilding programs, which align with contract award for detail design  and the start of lead ship construction. The concurrency depicted  between phases could be further exacerbated if the Navy pursues plans  to start construction of some components early.", "As is shown in figure 12, the Navy plans to continue technology  development while executing detail design; this concurrency may  potentially extend through construction if the Navy pursues its plans for  early construction. For example, the Navy and the shipyards are currently  designing the stern of the submarine\u2014with 95 percent of stern  arrangements planned to be complete by December 2017\u2014but the final  configuration of the propulsor has yet to be determined. As currently  planned, the Navy will not complete prototype testing until the third  quarter of fiscal year 2020, and development and design of the SAS is  planned to continue until the end of fiscal year 2021\u2014almost a year after  the start of lead ship construction. The Navy believes it is managing this  stern risk by controlling the interfaces through an Interface Control  Document that identifies set design constraints. According to Navy  officials, all aspects of the propulsor design that could impact the overall  ship design such as size, weight, and arrangements of major sub- assemblies of the propulsor are already finalized, and that the systems  are currently tracking to the reservation allowances. However, until a final  representative prototype is tested as a system, the possibility of design  changes and broader design impacts remains. Although the Navy plans  to have arrangements for the stern 100 percent complete at construction  start, the VFI or GFI for these important systems will not be finalized until  later after these systems finish development.", "Additionally, the electric drive of IPS has already experienced  manufacturing problems that could compromise its ability to meet its  schedule if further challenges arise. According to Naval Reactors officials,  a manufacturing defect was identified in February 2017 that affected the  assembly of the first production-representative propulsion motor intended  for installation in the land-based test facility to prove out the integration of  all the electric drive components. The officials explained that the vendor  responsible for the motor is in the process of repairing the defect\u2014a  process that will take up to 9 months to complete. As a result, Naval  Reactors is now executing a schedule recovery plan to regain some  schedule margin. Part of this plan involves using a smaller scale  prototype motor in initial land-based test facility testing to prove out  system integration. This plan means that initial full-scale system testing  will be conducted with a different motor, albeit one with the same  electromagnetic properties.

Specifically, technologies such as IPS  and the propulsor and coordinated stern demand more specific  congressional visibility to ensure they stay on track. These areas also  warrant specific assurances from the Navy that they will be delivered on  time and will perform as required. This assurance could augment the  Milestone B certifications which were predicated on a TRA that was not  representative of the technical risk facing the program. Further, such  information would help bolster confidence for Congress that the program  technologies will be matured in time to support construction, which is  especially important as the Navy pursues plans to start construction of the  lead ship early. Without putting in place a requirement for the Navy to  provide these assurances on a periodic basis, Congress will not have the  information until after the Navy has asked for another $8.7 billion in  funding for lead ship construction. It is also important for Congress to be  informed of the impact on performance requirements if technologies are  delayed or fail to mature as planned.", "The Columbia class program is also facing risks from its aggressive and  concurrent schedule as a result of the continued and pressing need for it  to meet the Navy\u2019s nuclear deterrent requirements as the legacy  submarine fleet that cannot be life extended any longer. Typically  addressing risks of such concurrency is accomplished by, among other  things, delaying milestones until more knowledge is obtained. Doing so  helps reduce concurrency and bring more stability to the design before  construction activities begin. Recognizing the mission imperatives that are  driving Columbia class\u2019s aggressive and concurrent schedule it is unlikely  that the Navy will have the ability to slow the pace of the program in order  to reduce cost and schedule risk. Therefore, additional reporting to  decisionmakers on the status of key technologies could help ensure they  fully understand the risks of such an approach and account for such risks  when making programmatic decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In our draft report we had suggested a matter for congressional  consideration related to additional Navy reporting on the Columbia class  technologies, but we have since removed it because the recently passed  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2018 includes Navy  reporting requirements for the Columbia class program that would  achieve the intent of our matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to DOD for comment. The Navy  provided technical comments earlier in the review process which we  incorporated where appropriate. In its written comments, reproduced in  appendix III, DOD\u2019s position was that there is not a need for additional  congressional reporting on the Columbia class program because there  are new reporting requirements in the conference report accompanying  the NDAA for fiscal year 2018. We agree that the reporting requirements  in the section 231 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 meet the intent of our  matter for congressional consideration. These new reporting  requirements for the Navy became law on December 12, 2017, after we  sent the report to DOD and appropriate congressional committees. We  agree that the reporting requirements meet the intent of our matter for  congressional consideration. Accordingly, we have removed our matter  from this report.", "In addition, DOD also disagreed with our characterization of technical  risks facing the Columbia class program and its TRA. Specifically, DOD  stated that the program is meeting statutory and DOD maturity standards  and met or exceeded DOD technology maturity requirements. DOD also  stated that the program\u2019s TRA was conducted in accordance with a 2011  DOD policy memo that directed TRA\u2019s should focus only on \u201ctechnology  maturity, as opposed to engineering and integration risk.\u201d However,  neither this policy memo nor the Columbia class TRA define what  constitutes engineering and integration risk and it is unclear what criteria  the Navy used in making these determinations. Our report acknowledges  that DOD followed statutory and DOD requirements for the two  technologies that the Navy identified as critical technologies in the  program\u2019s TRA. However, our report also identifies several other  technologies that we believe should have also been subject to these  requirements had the Navy conducted a TRA in accordance with our  identified best practices. By applying our identified best practices, we  believe these efforts would have been considered critical technologies  and would have been subject to an evaluation of technology maturity  levels, additional reporting requirements and, potentially, identification of  additional risk mitigation efforts.", "DOD also disagreed with our criteria for identifying a critical technology  and assessing maturity. DOD asserted that applying our criteria would  result in nearly every system on a submarine becoming a critical  technology. We disagree. Our criteria are consistent with DOD\u2019s own  criteria for identifying critical technologies, and only focus on those that  are most significant to a program. Given the program\u2019s cost and schedule  risks and operational imperatives, we believe that appropriately identifying  the critical technologies is an important step in acknowledging and  mitigating program risk. DOD also stated that achieving a TRL 7 by  milestone B would be unrealistic because of the difficulties in testing  some systems in an operational environment prior to launching the  submarine. We agree that in some cases testing at sea is not practical  and testing in a relevant environment may be sufficient to demonstrate  maturity. However, achieving a TRL 7 is not only based on the test  environment; it is also based on demonstrating a prototype near or at the  planned operational system configuration, which requires a design  resembling the final configuration. The Columbia class program has yet to  complete this type of prototype for the key systems we identified. As we  stated in the report some systems, like the propulsor, do not yet have a  final design. While we do not expect the Navy to test every critical  technology on a submarine at sea to demonstrate maturity, we would  expect testing of a prototype near or at the planned operational system  configuration prototype in a relevant environment. For example, prototype  testing of the electric drive at a land-based test facility would demonstrate  maturity\u2014but is not planned for several years\u2014well after the submarine\u2019s  design and potentially construction is underway. While such concurrency  introduces cost, schedule and technical risk, we have previously reported  that programs may choose to move forward with these risks, but should  acknowledged and appropriately resource the program to address the  risks should they materialize. As we stated in the report, this is not the  case for the Columbia class program: some risks have not been properly  identified and the cost estimate does not fully account for the margin of  technical and schedule risks facing the program.", "DOD also provided a table of Columbia class practices, reprinted with our  comments in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and  other interested parties.
