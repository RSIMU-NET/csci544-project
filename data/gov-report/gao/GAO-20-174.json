IRS determined that about 77 percent of returns (claiming $38.3 billion) were not business IDT and about 4 percent of returns (claiming $384 million) were confirmed business IDT. As of August 2019, IRS was reviewing the remaining returns.", "The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 created requirements for agencies to establish financial and administrative controls for managing fraud risks. These requirements are aligned with leading practices outlined in GAO's A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs ( Fraud Risk Framework) . IRS has taken steps to understand fraud risks associated with business IDT but has not aligned its efforts with selected components within the Fraud Risk Framework . First, IRS leadership has demonstrated a commitment to identifying and combating overall identity theft refund fraud, but has not designated a dedicated entity to design and oversee business IDT fraud risk management efforts agency-wide. This is because the program is relatively new. Without designating an entity to help guide agency-wide business IDT fraud risk efforts, it is not clear which entity would be responsible for assessing business IDT risks and documenting the results.", "Second, IRS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a fraud risk profile for business IDT consistent with the Fraud Risk Framework's leading practices. Doing so would help IRS determine the likelihood and impact of risks, the level of risk IRS is willing to tolerate, and the suitability, costs, and benefits of existing fraud risk controls. IRS officials stated that they have not formally performed a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk profile because they have directed their resources toward identifying and addressing business IDT that is occurring right now and improving fraud detection efforts. Documenting a risk profile would also help IRS determine whether additional fraud controls are needed and whether to make adjustments to existing controls.", "Third, IRS has not assessed which business-related tax forms or fraud scenarios pose the greatest risk to IRS and taxpayers. Current business IDT fraud filters cover the most commonly filed tax forms; however, IRS has not developed fraud filters for at least 25 additional business-related forms that may be susceptible to business IDT. Without additional data on business IDT, IRS cannot estimate the full size and scope of this problem.", "IRS has procedures for resolving business IDT cases and has described general guidelines for resolving business IDT cases, but it does not resolve all cases within these guidelines.

As we have reported previously, the risk of IDT refund fraud  has increased as personally identifiable information (PII) has become  more readily available through cyberattacks and data breaches.  Businesses are further at risk of IDT refund fraud because their  information is often easy to obtain, as they may post key information  online, such as the names of corporate officers, address, and number of  employees. Additional business information can also be obtained through  online commercial databases. Further, federal regulations require some  types of businesses to file public reports that include data which could be  useful to a fraudster, such as data from annual financial statements. The  availability of both PII and business information poses a threat to the tax  system, making it more difficult for IRS to distinguish legitimate taxpayers  from fraudsters.", "Within this context, you asked us to examine IRS\u2019s efforts to detect,  prevent, and resolve business IDT.

Since 2015, our biennial High-Risk Report has  highlighted the challenges associated with IDT refund fraud, the actions  IRS needs to take to address them, and the cybersecurity issue of  protecting PII amid large-scale data breaches. These challenges are  relevant to business IDT and further compounded by the complexity of  the business tax environment.", "According to IRS officials, this complexity stems, in part, from the number  of business types or structures, the various taxes that businesses pay,  and the different tax forms businesses must file. Further, many  businesses file tax returns throughout the year, unlike individual  taxpayers who generally file income tax returns once a year. These  factors make detecting, researching, and resolving potential business IDT  cases more challenging than individual IDT cases.", "When establishing a business, a business owner must determine the  structure of the business for tax purposes, among other things, and may  link business entities together in networks with multiple tiers. In addition,  unlike individuals, businesses are required to pay different types of taxes  depending on the business structure. For example, C corporations and S  corporations pay income tax, and may also pay employment taxes and  excise taxes on certain products and services such as fuel. Businesses  are required to file different forms for each type of tax and may also file  forms to claim various tax credits. Table 1 provides examples of  business types and associated tax forms, volume, and total refunds for  fiscal year 2018.", "IRS officials said that the complexity of the business tax environment  makes it difficult for tax examiners to distinguish between true business  IDT and frivolous tax arguments or noncompliance, such as incorrect or  missing information on a form. Officials also noted that fraudsters may  be attracted to the potential large payout associated with business tax  refunds. According to IRS data, the average 2018 tax refund for  corporations was about $286,200 and about $24,700 for estates and  trusts. In contrast, the IRS Data Book, 2018 reports that the average  individual tax refund was about $2,900.", "Further, business IDT may also lead to other types of tax fraud. In  addition to filing false business returns seeking a refund, fraudsters may  use stolen EINs and business information to support an individual income  tax refund scheme. For example, fraudsters may file fraudulent Forms W- 2, Wage and Tax Statement with information on fictitious employees.  These forms could then be used to file fraudulent individual tax returns  seeking refunds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Business IDT Can Occur in Two Ways", "paragraphs": ["According to IRS, there are two ways a fraudster can commit business  IDT, both of which involve the fraudulent use of the EIN.  1.  Obtain an existing EIN. In this scenario, a fraudster obtains federal  tax information from an existing business (see fig. 1). The business  may be active or dormant, meaning that the business owner has not  filed a tax return for at least two tax periods. The fraudster then uses  the EIN and other key business information to file a fraudulent  business return, such as Form 1120.  2.  Fabricate an EIN. In this scenario, a fraudster steals the identifying  information of an individual, such as a Social Security number and  uses it to apply for an EIN.

In addition,  guidance from OMB affirms that managers should adhere to the leading  practices identified in the framework. The Fraud Risk Framework  provides key components and leading practices for agency managers to  use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based  way.

IRS officials stated that they send the department a data extract on all  newly issued EINs from the prior month. The state performs research on  these businesses and, in turn, sends IRS a list of businesses that it has  determined to be fraudulent. As a result, IRS is able to deactivate the  fraudulent EINs before the fraudster files a false business, employment,  or individual tax return claiming a refund. This allows IRS to reject returns  associated with the fraudulent EINs. According to IRS data, in 2018 IRS  identified about 3 percent (1,343 out of 53,826) of new EINs in Alabama  as fraudulent.

IRS  officials stated that they believe correspondence-based authentication is  no less secure than other forms of authentication, such as having  business owners verify their identity in-person at a Taxpayer Assistance  Center or authenticating via telephone.", "However, unlike other forms of authentication, correspondence-based  authentication is inherently less secure because it may not require the  taxpayer to verify their identity using a government-issued form of  identification. Consequently, IRS has less assurance that the person is  the actual business owner and the return in question is legitimate.", "In June 2018, we reported that IRS had not performed risk assessments  to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with correspondence- based authentication because it did not have a policy that requires regular  assessments and timely mitigation of identified issues. Therefore,  without a policy for conducting risk assessments for correspondence- based authentication and a plan for performing an assessment, IRS may  underestimate known risks and overlook emerging threats to the tax  environment. We recommended that IRS establish a policy for conducting  such risk assessments and develop a plan for performing them. IRS  agreed with our recommendations and, as of November 2019, had  developed a draft policy for conducting risk assessments.

According to IRS, a business\u2019s EIN is not  considered PII and is not required to be protected like a Social Security  number. This may make it easier for a fraudster to obtain an existing EIN  and file a fraudulent business tax return. In addition, we have previously  reported that fraudsters may target paid preparers, tax software  providers, and other third parties to steal taxpayer data to commit IDT  refund fraud or other types of financial crimes. These data may include  existing EINs or the necessary information to obtain a new EIN, making it  easier for fraudsters to file fake business returns.", "IRS officials stated that they recognize the potential risk of the EIN  application process, but must balance the needs of legitimate businesses  against IRS\u2019s responsibility to detect and prevent fraud. Officials noted  that they have security measures in place to detect potentially suspicious  activity in the online EIN application and fraud filters to detect when  taxpayers file a return with a dormant EIN.

The National Taxpayer  Advocate\u2019s 2018 Annual Report to Congress noted that one of IRS\u2019s most  serious problems is a high false detection rate in its fraud detection  systems. In general, the false detection rate is the number of legitimate  returns selected by the IRS as potentially fraudulent, divided by the total  number of returns selected as potentially fraudulent. The National  Taxpayer Advocate noted that IRS\u2019s false positive rate for individual IDT  filters was 63 percent in 2018. The high rate contributed to increased  processing times and delays in issuing refunds for legitimate returns. It  also created additional work for IRS. Similarly, our data analysis of  BMFIC data shows that IRS\u2019s business IDT fraud filters had about an 85  percent false detection rate for returns screened by fraud filters from mid- January 2017 to December 2018.", "In September 2019, IRS officials described several factors contributing to  the high false detection rate for business IDT fraud filters. These factors  include taxpayers and tax preparers failing to update key information with  IRS, cross-referenced fraud filters triggering other filters, and changes in  taxpayer filing behaviors due to new tax laws. The officials said they are  working to reduce the false detection rate. While it is reasonable to expect  fraud filters will catch some legitimate returns, IRS has not conducted a  risk assessment\u2014or developed a fraud risk tolerance\u2014consistent with  leading practices. Determining a fraud risk tolerance would help officials  determine how best to balance the risks of missing fraudulent returns with  the risks of flagging legitimate returns. Doing so may also help IRS  prioritize any needed improvements to existing filters.", "According to the Fraud Risk Framework, a fraud risk assessment is the  basis for developing an antifraud strategy. Among other things, an  antifraud strategy considers the benefits and costs of control activities to  address risks, such as the inherent business IDT risks described above,  and other risks facing the program. As of July 2019, IRS\u2019s Wage and  Investment division had identified the overall threat of business IDT as  one of 12 risks it is currently facing.", "However, IRS\u2019s risk documentation does not include important  components of a fraud risk assessment consistent with GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework. Specifically, the documentation does not include information  on the likelihood or impact of each risk, IRS\u2019s risk tolerance, or clear plans or responsibilities for mitigating risks. A business IDT fraud risk  assessment with these key items would position IRS to develop a fraud  risk profile and an antifraud strategy for business IDT going forward.", "In addition, officials from IRS\u2019s Office of the Chief Risk Officer stated that  consistent with the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015  (FRDAA), the agency compiles an annual enterprise-wide fraud risk  report based on program-level risks that IRS business units identify and  monitor. The Office of the Chief Risk Officer\u2019s October 2019 report  acknowledges business IDT as one of 11 enterprise fraud risks for 2019\u2013 2020. A fraud risk assessment and a fraud risk profile on business IDT  consistent with leading practices would also help support IRS\u2019s broader  efforts to report and monitor enterprise-wide fraud risks.", "IRS officials stated that they have not performed a formal fraud risk  assessment or developed a fraud risk profile for business IDT because  they have directed their resources toward identifying and addressing  fraud that is occurring right now and improving fraud detection efforts.  When asked whether they had plans to further identify and assess  inherent fraud risks for business IDT\u2014the first step of the fraud risk  assessment process\u2014IRS officials said they thought that the costs of  identifying and assessing inherent risks of business IDT would likely  outweigh the benefits given the relatively low volume of confirmed  business IDT cases, compared with individual IDT refund fraud.", "Without assessing inherent risks, determining the likelihood, impact, and  IRS\u2019s tolerance for each risk, and examining the suitability of existing  fraud controls, IRS lacks reasonable assurance that it is aware of the  most significant fraud risks facing business IDT. Such an analysis would  also help IRS determine whether additional fraud controls are needed and  whether to make adjustments to existing controls.", "Further, without this critical information, IRS will be unable to develop a  fraud risk profile consistent with leading practices. A fraud risk profile for  business IDT may help IRS make better informed decisions about  allocating resources to combat business IDT and minimize financial  losses. Consistent with our Fraud Risk Framework, a fraud risk profile  that considers the likelihood and impact of fraud risks, IRS\u2019s tolerance for  risk, and the suitability of existing fraud detection activities is critical for  developing an antifraud strategy and ensuring that IRS has an effective  approach to addressing risks to business IDT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collecting Additional Data Could Help IRS Estimate the Size and Scope of Business IDT", "paragraphs": ["The Fraud Risk Framework states that managers may conduct  quantitative or qualitative assessments, or both, to help determine the  likelihood and impact of inherent fraud risks on the program\u2019s objectives  and help estimate fraud losses and frequency. Further, federal internal  control standards call for program managers to use quality information to  achieve their objectives, address relevant risks, and communicate that  information as necessary to internal and external stakeholders.", "As of September 2019, IRS was collecting fraud filter data for some, but  not all, business-related forms that may be susceptible to business IDT.  Our analysis of IRS\u2019s data shows that for 2018, business IDT fraud filters  covered about 88 percent of business tax forms claiming a refund (14.0  million out of 15.9 million returns) and nearly all employment tax forms  claiming a refund (30.7 million out of 31.0 million returns). IRS officials  stated that since 2016, they have incrementally implemented business  IDT fraud filters for the most commonly filed forms.", "We recognize that IRS has made progress in implementing filters for  commonly filed forms and that the deceptive nature of fraud makes  developing accurate fraud estimates challenging. However, our analysis  shows that IRS has not developed business IDT fraud filters for at least  25 additional business-related tax forms. In 2018, these forms  represented about $10.4 billion in refunds. As a result, IRS is not able to  analyze data from these forms for emerging fraud patterns or schemes.", "Further, while current business IDT fraud filters cover the most commonly  filed forms, IRS has not assessed which remaining forms or fraud  scenarios pose the greatest risk to IRS and taxpayers. IRS also has not  determined a risk tolerance for existing fraud filters, and whether the  benefits of expanding existing filters outweigh the risks of flagging  legitimate returns. Given the complexity of business tax forms and the  evolving nature of fraud schemes, IRS\u2019s existing fraud filters may not be  sufficient to detect different business IDT scenarios. For example, IRS  has implemented two fraud filters related to business tax credits, but they  are each limited to a specific scenario.", "TIGTA has previously reported that tax credit forms have been found to  be attractive to fraudsters. For example, in 2015, TIGTA reported that  fraudsters have targeted individual tax credits when filing a fraudulent tax  return to increase their refund. In September 2019, TIGTA reported that  IRS lacked systematic controls to identify or prevent fraudulent use of an  electric motor vehicle tax credit which is available to individuals and  businesses.", "Without additional data on business IDT, IRS cannot estimate the full size  and scope of this problem. As we have previously reported, IRS\u2019s annual  Identity Theft Taxonomy (Taxonomy) is a valuable tool to inventory,  characterize, and analyze available individual IDT refund fraud data and  to assess the performance of IRS\u2019s individual IDT refund fraud  defenses. Following each filing season, IRS estimates the volume of  returns and associated dollar amounts on attempted and prevented  individual IDT refund fraud, and on refunds it paid to fraudsters.", "While we recognize there may be differences in how IRS estimates the  extent of individual versus business IDT, the Taxonomy is a useful  framework to understand the data IRS needs to estimate the size and  scope of business IDT. For example, the Taxonomy estimates the  number of identified individual IDT refund fraud cases where IRS  prevented or recovered the fraudulent refunds (e.g., returns caught by fraud filters or suspicious refunds returned by banks). In December 2018,  IRS developed a draft plan for an initial business IDT taxonomy based on  two business tax forms on which IRS has collected data since 2016. IRS  officials stated that they intend to begin preliminary work on this effort in  December 2019. However, these efforts will be limited until IRS collects  additional data.", "IRS officials stated that they are committed to better understanding  business IDT and expanding their fraud detection and data collection  efforts. However, officials said that doing so depends on the availability of  resources to develop and test new fraud filters prior to each filing season.  IRS may address these constraints by, for example, determining which  forms or fraud scenarios pose the greatest risk for business IDT based on  a fraud risk assessment and profile. This would include determining a risk  tolerance for business IDT on these forms and prioritizing new filters or  filter enhancements based on its risk assessment.", "Having additional data to better estimate the size and scope of business  IDT is critical in helping IRS understand how fraudsters are evading IRS  defenses. Additionally, such data will help IRS identify unknown business  IDT fraud risks, allocate limited resources, assess the suitability of its  existing fraud control activities, and develop tools such as a business IDT  taxonomy. Further information on the size and scope of business IDT  could better position IRS to assess the risk of business IDT on tax  administration and inform the Congress and the public about the risk."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Procedures for Resolving Business IDT Cases, but Has Not Established Customer Service-Oriented Performance Goals", "paragraphs": ["IRS has established procedures for resolving business IDT cases in its  Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) and officials described general guidelines  for resolving both pre-refund and post-refund business IDT cases.  However, IRS does not resolve all cases within these guidelines due to  various challenges IRS could potentially address, such as  correspondence-based authentication; and challenges which are more  difficult to address, such as the overall complexity of business IDT cases.  In addition, we found that a lack of customer service-oriented  performance goals for resolving cases may also contribute to delays.", "Key IRS documents highlight both a commitment to combating IDT refund  fraud and improving customer service for taxpayers by, for example,  reducing case resolution time frames through new technologies, among  other things. In addition, Office of Management and Budget guidance  highlights that federal program and project managers have an obligation  to ensure that their programs deliver efficient and effective services to the  public. This includes assessing how well a program is working to  achieve intended results, and delivering customer service to align with the  program\u2019s goals.", "Our review of IRS documentation found that business units have  developed procedures to manage and resolve business IDT cases  identified during different stages of the tax return process. For example,  during the pre-refund stage, RICS notifies business taxpayers via mail if  their return shows signs of potential IDT refund fraud and has been held  for review. Similarly, when a taxpayer notifies IRS about potential IDT  refund fraud during the post-refund stage, Accounts Management (AM)  may require the taxpayer to submit a form describing how and when the  fraud occurred. IRS business units have also established procedures for  conducting in-depth research on taxpayer accounts to determine if a case  is business IDT or another type of fraud. However, RICS and AM have  had some difficulty in resolving cases within their respective guidelines,  as described below.", "Pre-refund cases. In regards to pre-refund business IDT, cases are  generally to be resolved within 90 days, according to IRS\u2019s IRM and  agency officials. RICS officials stated that they aim to meet this  guideline because it provides enough time to reach the correct taxpayer  via mail and for the taxpayer to respond. However, RICS has been  challenged in resolving cases within 90 days. Our analysis of pre-refund  business IDT cases opened from mid-January 2017 through December  2018 shows that RICS did not meet this guideline for about 87 percent of  cases, including open cases. RICS also took between 6 months to 2  years to resolve about 29 percent of cases (see fig. 4).", "Further, our analysis found that this delay was consistent across case  outcomes. On average, RICS took 136 days to resolve cases of  confirmed business IDT (7,248 cases) and 171 days to resolve cases  determined not to be business IDT (58,279 cases). As of August 2019,  IRS had not resolved 4,649 cases which had been open for an average of  383 days.", "RICS officials identified several reasons for the delay in resolving pre- refund cases, including ones rooted in business IDT policies and  procedures. Specifically, officials stated that communicating with the  taxpayer via correspondence is the primary driver of delays in resolving  cases. RICS officials stated that mail-based authentication generally  takes more time because letters can get lost, thrown away, or not reach  the right person. RICS officials stated that in March 2018, they began  making two attempts to correspond with a business with a potentially  suspicious return before closing a case, rather than one attempt. RICS  made this change because taxpayers were taking longer than 45 days to  respond to the letter, often after RICS had closed the case as a  nonresponse.", "Officials stated that while they are aware of IRS\u2019s other methods of  authenticating taxpayers for individual IDT refund fraud, such as by phone  or in person, they have not explored similar options for the business IDT  program. As we reported in June 2018, IRS uses a risk-based approach  to determine the ways in which a taxpayer can authenticate his or her  identity and what data are required during the authentication process.  High risk interactions include those when a taxpayer accesses prior year  tax information and other PII, while lower risk interactions include a  taxpayer paying a bill online. According to IRS officials, as the risk level of  taxpayer interactions increases, the authentication process becomes  more rigorous. This approach minimizes risk to both the taxpayer and  IRS.", "In addition, officials identified other challenges that contribute to delays,  including incorrect information on the business taxpayer\u2019s account,  nonresponses to authentication requests, and the complexity of business  IDT cases, which may be more difficult to address. RICS officials noted  that taxpayers do not always update the business\u2019s responsible party with  IRS when they sell or transfer a business to someone else. This can  make it more difficult for IRS to contact the taxpayer when their return has  been selected for review. RICS officials stated that IRS reminds business  taxpayers to check and update their information each year to avoid  unnecessary delays in processing tax returns; however, IRS does not  require taxpayers to make updates.", "IRS officials also stated that a business\u2019s failure to respond to mail-based  authentication requests contributes to case resolution delays. Finally,  RICS officials noted that the inherent complexity of the business IDT  environment may require RICS staff to research cases across multiple  IRS business units or refer cases outside of RICS, which can contribute  to delays.", "Post-refund cases. Our review of AM procedures and discussions with  officials indicate that post-refund business IDT cases are generally to be  resolved within 6 months. AM officials stated they established this  guideline for individual IDT refund fraud cases and extended it to  business IDT cases when the program started in 2016. We analyzed  post-refund cases that AM opened from July 2016 (when IRS began  collecting data) through December 2018. We found that AM resolved  about 84 percent of post-refund cases within 6 months. However, about  17 percent of these cases\u2014including open cases\u2014took more than 6  months to resolve (see fig. 5).", "Similar to RICS officials, AM officials cited several reasons for case  resolution delays, including the complexity of the business tax  environment and the need to research associated businesses,  employment, and individual tax returns. AM officials also noted  challenges inherent to the case research process, including that staff  often pursue multiple lines of inquiry to determine a case outcome. This  may involve referring cases to other business units if, for example, AM  staff do not have access to a specific IRS system to complete their  research.", "Finally, AM officials stated that AM staff do not always recognize business  IDT cases and may initially classify them as an individual IDT case, which  results in delays. To help address this issue, AM officials stated that  management periodically reviews business IDT operations, and provides  refresher training in areas where staff did not follow procedures  consistently.", "While RICS and AM officials have stated that they have general  guidelines for resolving business IDT cases, they have not established  customer service-oriented performance goals. We have previously found  that a fundamental element in an organization\u2019s efforts to manage for  results is its ability to set meaningful goals for performance, including  customer service standards, and to measure progress toward those  goals. Standards that include customer service-oriented performance  targets or goals allow agencies to define, among other things, the level,  quality, and timeliness of the service they provide to their customers.", "In the context of IRS\u2019s business IDT efforts, a customer service-oriented  goal could be, for example, to resolve a certain percentage of cases  within a specific timeframe. This is particularly important for IRS because  one of its strategic goals is to empower customers to meet their tax  obligations by providing exceptional customer service.", "Identifying and implementing methods to address challenges that IRS can  control\u2014such as reliance on correspondence-based authentication\u2014 could help IRS improve its timeliness in resolving business IDT cases and  address its overall strategic objective to reduce case resolution time  frames. It is also consistent with OMB guidance to deliver efficient and  effective services to the public. Further, establishing customer service- oriented performance goals could help IRS measure progress, identify  opportunities for improvement, and communicate reasonable time frames  for resolving cases to taxpayers.", "Case resolution performance goals may also help reduce costs to the  Treasury. Specifically, IRS has a legal obligation to pay interest on refunds issued after 45 days from the due date of the tax return. This  requirement includes incoming tax returns that IRS holds for review for  potential business IDT but then later releases for processing. Specific and  relevant performance goals for both pre-refund and post-refund cases  may help IRS balance its efforts to protect revenue against the burden on  legitimate taxpayers and additional costs to the Treasury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS has recognized business IDT as a growing threat to both taxpayers  and tax administration.

IRS also agreed with our recommendations to, consistent with leading  practices, develop a business IDT fraud risk profile; develop, document,  and implement a strategy for addressing fraud risks; and implement and  prioritize new fraud filters consistent with its fraud risk profile. IRS did not  provide details on the actions it plans to take to address these  recommendations.", "In its written comments, IRS stated that formally implementing leading  practices in the Fraud Risk Framework may be helpful, but noted that it  has consistently completed business IDT fraud risk assessments and  developed risk profiles. However, during our review, IRS did not provide  evidence that it had taken such actions. Figure 3 in our report outlines  leading practices for performing a fraud risk assessment and developing  a risk profile.", "For example, regarding the leading practice to identify and assess  inherent fraud risks, IRS stated that it has found that the risks associated  with in-person or telephone authentication are higher for business IDT  than correspondence-based authentication. However, we could not verify  this assertion, as IRS did not provide evidence during our audit that it had  assessed the risks of different authentication options for business  taxpayers. Further, IRS stated that our report does not acknowledge  that multiple individuals may be authorized to act on behalf of a business,  including authenticating a potentially suspicious tax return. We have  added this information to our report.", "IRS also stated that our report implies that it would be acceptable for a  percentage of potentially fraudulent returns to be filed, unchecked, solely  to reduce false detections or business costs. However, as we indicate in  our report, fraud risk tolerance does not mean IRS management tolerates  fraud, or that it needs to eliminate controls to detect and prevent fraud.  Rather, it means that IRS management accepts a certain amount of risk,  based on its assessment of the likelihood and impact of the fraud.  Determining a fraud risk tolerance would help IRS management establish  appropriate and cost-effective controls that are commensurate with the  fraud risk. Relatedly, we agree with IRS\u2019s statement that IDT victims  suffer significant financial, social, and emotional hardships. We have  updated the report\u2019s introduction to acknowledge these hardships.", "In addition, IRS stated that its work on business IDT filters is more robust  than stated in our report. Our report recognizes various IRS efforts to  improve business IDT fraud detection and prevention, including efforts to  refine its fraud filters. However, having fraud filters does not preclude IRS  from identifying and assessing other potential fraud risks. Further, IRS  cannot accurately determine the suitability of its business IDT filters\u2014or  other controls\u2014without first identifying inherent fraud risks, assessing the  likelihood and impact of those risks, and determining a fraud risk  tolerance.

In this report,  business IDT refers to the fraudulent use of both business and  employment tax forms. Both of these types of forms require an Employer  Identification Number (EIN) when filing with IRS, and a fraudster can file  these forms to obtain a refund.", "To address all of our objectives, we reviewed our prior reports on  individual identity theft refund fraud and the Treasury Inspector General  for Tax Administration\u2019s (TIGTA) prior reports on business IDT. We also  interviewed IRS officials from business units responsible for detecting,  preventing, and resolving business IDT cases, specifically from Return  Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS), Accounts Management (AM),  and Criminal Investigation (CI).

We also interviewed officials from IRS\u2019s Office  of the Chief Risk Officer to understand IRS\u2019s efforts to compile and  report on enterprise-wide fraud risks and agency efforts to develop an  antifraud culture.", "Further, we reviewed documentation related to three inherent fraud  risks to business IDT that we identified in the course of our work:  correspondence-based authentication, EIN vulnerabilities, and high  false-detection rates for IDT fraud filters. This included reviewing  prior GAO, TIGTA, and National Taxpayer Advocate reports and the  status of open recommendations, and relevant IRM sections. We  reviewed the methodologies of these reports and found them  reasonable for the purpose of describing the inherent risks related to  business IDT.", "In addition, we identified a false detection rate for business IDT fraud  filters based on BMFIC cases opened from mid-January 2017 through  December 2018. To do so, we compared the number of cases IRS  determined were not business IDT, relative to the total number of  cases. We did not include BMFIC cases from 2019 because at the  time of our analysis, about 27 percent of those cases were  unresolved.", "We also assessed the extent to which IRS is positioned to estimate  the size and scope of business IDT. To do so, we reviewed  documents and information on IRS\u2019s efforts to collect quality data on  incoming business and employment returns. We compared these  efforts to leading practices associated with the first two components of  the Fraud Risk Framework and Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government related to using quality information.  Specifically, we determined what proportion of incoming business and  employment tax forms filed in 2018 would have been screened by  business IDT fraud filters, by tax form type. We also reviewed a  preliminary plan and interviewed RAAS and RICS officials on their  efforts to develop a business IDT taxonomy.", "To assess IRS\u2019s efforts to resolve business IDT cases, we reviewed IRS  procedures for managing, researching, and resolving pre-refund and  post-refund business IDT cases. We interviewed officials from RICS and  AM to understand the rationale behind their respective current case  resolution time frames, and potential reasons for case resolution delays.  We compared RICS and AM\u2019s efforts to resolve business IDT cases  against Office of Management and Budget guidance on program  management and providing customer service. To determine RICS\u2019s  performance in resolving business IDT cases identified during the pre- refund phase, we analyzed 181,032 cases from BMFIC, described above.", "Specifically, we calculated the duration between when RICS opened the  case in BMFIC to when the case was closed. In addition, we determined  how many cases in RICS\u2019s inventory were open at the time of our  analysis in August 2019. For these open cases, we manually added the  date we received the data as the date the case was closed. This was an  indicator of the minimum amount of time RICS could have taken to close  these cases.", "For this analysis, we did not include cases opened and closed in 2019  because we wanted to ensure there was sufficient time for RICS to  research and close a case. We determined that cases opened by the end  of December 2018 gave both RICS and AM (discussed below) enough  time to resolve a case. In addition, we identified an anomaly in RICS\u2019s  2019 cases. IRS officials stated that a new fraud filter inaccurately  flagged incoming returns on one form, and IRS released these returns.  Our analysis of RICS\u2019s data showed that these returns accounted for  about 65 percent of closed cases in 2019, and that they were resolved in  an unusually short time frame (fewer than 45 days) thus skewing the  overall data. We also did not include 1,679 cases that were opened and  closed in zero or fewer days.", "To determine AM\u2019s performance in resolving business IDT cases  identified during the post-refund phase, we analyzed 1,997 relevant  business IDT cases from IRS\u2019s Correspondence Imaging System (CIS)  that AM opened from July 2016 through December 2018. As discussed  earlier, we did not include cases opened and closed in 2019 to allow AM  enough time to research and resolve a case. We calculated the duration  between when AM opened the case in CIS to when the case was closed.  We also determined how many cases in AM\u2019s inventory were open at the  time of our analysis. For these open cases, we manually added the date  we received the data as the date the case was closed. This was an  indicator of the minimum amount of time AM could have taken to close  these cases. We assessed the reliability of the CIS data by reviewing  relevant documents, testing key data elements, and interviewing  knowledgeable IRS officials. We determined that the data from CIS was  sufficiently reliable to determine how long it took AM to resolve post- refund business IDT cases during this time period.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to January 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Shannon Finnegan (Assistant  Director), Heather A.

We made 6 recommendations to help IRS stay ahead of criminals who would steal businesses\u2019 tax refunds, including designating an entity to provide oversight of its efforts and following leading practices to assess fraud risks."]}
