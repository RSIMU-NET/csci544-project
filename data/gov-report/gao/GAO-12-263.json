GAO examined DOD\u0092s use of this provision, known as the national security exception. It requires the use of competition to the greatest extent practicable.

DOD procures a range of goods and services under this exception, and according to federal procurement data, the Air Force accounted for about 74 percent of DOD\u0092s use during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. However, DOD intelligence agencies and special access programs frequently use the exception, but are generally excluded from reporting procurement data. While an Office of the Secretary of Defense memorandum exempts three of the intelligence agencies from reporting such data, DOD policy on reporting sensitive procurements for other military department programs is not clear.", "For most national security exception contract actions GAO reviewed, DOD used a single justification and approval document that applies to multiple contracts\u0097known as a class justification. Among those reviewed, $3.3 billion of $3.4 billion was obligated under contracts that used class justifications, which reduce the steps required to proceed with individual contract actions that do not use full and open competition. According to contracting officials, the increased flexibility of national security exception class justifications helps meet mission needs. However, in the Air Force, concerns about the reduced management review of these contracts have led to changes in the process for approving individual contract actions using class justifications. Nevertheless, all of the justifications GAO reviewed met Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements.", "GAO\u0092s analysis of federal procurement data on about 11,300 contract actions found that, from fiscal years 2007 through 2010, only 16 percent of all obligations under those actions by the military departments under the national security exception received more than one proposal. Contract files and contracting officials cited a limited pool of companies with the right capabilities, the difficulty of changing from an established vendor, and limited tools for soliciting competitive bids as reasons for their inability to obtain more competition. Twelve of the 27 military department contract files GAO reviewed did not include a record of market research, and others included few details on the results. Two intelligence agencies that reported using the national security exception for all contracting reported achieving comparatively high levels of competition. Both have systems that catalogue firms, capabilities, and solicitations that are used to facilitate security sensitive market research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD issue guidance clarifying when security sensitive contracting data must be reported, monitor the impact of new Air Force class justification processes, and consider using tools that facilitate market research in a secure environment.

The  mandate required us to review (1) the pattern of usage of such exception  by acquisition organizations within the department to determine which  organizations are commonly using the exception and the frequency of  such usage; (2) the range of items or services being acquired through the  use of such exception; (3) the process for reviewing and approving  justifications involving such exception; (4) whether the justifications for  use of such exception typically meet the requirements of the FAR  applicable to the use of such exception; (5) issues associated with follow- on procurements for items or services acquired using such exception; and  (6) potential additional instances where such exception could be applied  and any authorities available to the department other than such exception  that could be applied in such instances. To answer the mandate, we (1)  identified the pattern of DOD\u2019s use of the national security exception to  full and open competition, including the range of goods and services  acquired; (2) assessed DOD\u2019s process for using this exception; and (3)  determined the extent to which DOD obtained competition on selected  contracts when using the national security exception. To determine  DOD\u2019s pattern of use of the national security exception, we analyzed data  from the Federal Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation (FPDS- NG) for fiscal years 2007 through 2010, and obtained data on competition  and use of this exception from the DOD intelligence agencies. We  determined that the federal procurement data for these fiscal years were  sufficiently reliable to identify DOD\u2019s use of the national security  exception, in part by verifying a non-generalizable random sample of the  data from the Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to throughout this  report as the military departments). To determine DOD\u2019s processes for  using this exception, we used federal procurement data to select a non- generalizable sample of 27 contract files at the military departments  based on largest obligations, frequent users, and a range of procurement  types. In addition, we reviewed five contracts provided by DOD intelligence agencies, for a total of 32 contracts across DOD as a whole.We did not include other DOD entities in our sample that reported little or  no use of the exception in federal procurement data. We analyzed the  documents the military departments and intelligence agencies used to  seek approval to limit competition on the selected contracts and  determined whether they met the requirements of the FAR. We  conducted legal research and interviewed DOD officials on other uses of  the exception and alternative authorities. Furthermore, we analyzed  policies and guidance, federal procurement data, and met with DOD  officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the three military  departments, and four DOD intelligence agencies. To determine the  extent to which DOD obtained competition under the national security  exception, we reviewed the 32 selected military department and  intelligence agency contract files, and analyzed FPDS-NG data on the  number of proposals received for contracts awarded using this exception.

The approval levels range from the local  contracting officer for relatively small contract actions up to the  agencywide senior procurement executive for contracts worth more than  $85.5 million. The justifications can be made on an individual or class  basis; a class justification generally covers programs or sets of programs  and has a dollar limit and time period for all actions taken under the  authority. The approval levels for the class justification are the same as  those for an individual justification and are determined by the total  estimated value of the class.

The exception requires that agencies pursue limited competition by  requesting proposals from as many potential sources as is feasible. DOD  departments may not have a complete understanding of the extent of  competition, given that DOD lacks clear policy on when sensitive contract  actions should be excluded from the FPDS-NG, the database it uses to  track this information. However, the available data show that the military  departments have achieved relatively little competition in their national  security exception procurements. Obtaining competition on new  procurements is especially important, because our findings and previous  reports have shown that once a contractor receives an award, historically  that contractor is likely to receive any follow-on contract. There are  obstacles to competition in sensitive procurements, including a limited  number of firms that can meet security requirements. Because of these  obstacles, program offices may find it easier to forego competition when a  class justification is already in place. However, more competition is  possible. The recent changes that Air Force made to its process, which  introduced a new high-level review of contract actions under a class  justification, may help increase the extent of competition. Further, while  the military departments face challenges in conducting market research  for sensitive contracts, the DOD intelligence agencies, which face similar  challenges, have created tools to increase their ability to identify multiple  potential sources and obtain competition when using the national security  exception. The use of such tools could enhance the ability of the military  departments to obtain competition on their national security exception  procurements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three  actions:  Issue guidance establishing the circumstances under which security  sensitive contracting data are required to be reported to OSD and in  FPDS-NG, including the decision authority for excluding a given  program or contract from the database.", "Evaluate the effect of the Air Force\u2019s new review process on  competition and management oversight of national security exception  actions under a class justification; if the changes are found to be  beneficial, consider implementing similar changes across DOD.", "Assess the feasibility of providing contracting officials in military  department programs that routinely use the national security  exception with access to tools that facilitate market research and  competitive solicitation in a secure environment, either through  development of new tools or access to existing intelligence community  systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD.

Therefore, our review focused on the most current reliable data from  FPDS-NG, fiscal years 2007 through 2010. We conducted legal research  and interviewed DOD officials to identify other uses of the exception and  alternative authorities. To identify the DOD components to include in our  review, we used FPDS-NG data to determine those with the most  obligations under the national security exception during fiscal years 2007  through 2010.

We selected the individual  contracts based on several criteria. First, we selected high-dollar  contracts. Based on our analysis of commonly procured goods and  services from FPDS-NG data, we selected contracts with a mix of these  types of purchases. FPDS-NG data do not indicate whether a contract is  a follow-on procurement, therefore we selected both older and newer  contracts. DOD officials also identified contracts to select to capture  follow-on activities. However, based on other selection criteria, these  contracts had already been included.

OSD officials provided us with the directive from the  Director of National Intelligence that exempts all DOD intelligence  agencies from FPDS-NG.

We asked DOD officials to review contract files to determine  1) if the contract cited the national security exception, 2) whether the  contract was competed, and 3) how many proposals the contract  received. In addition, in discussions with the Navy, they identified  contracts that were incorrectly coded as using the national security  exception. After three Air Force contracts fell out of our sample due to  nonresponse, we found errors in the \u201cExtent Competed\u201d field for about a  third of the contracts. However, we found only two of the contracts (6  percent) had errors in the \u201cReason not Competed\u201d field and only one  contract (3 percent) with an error in the number of proposals.
