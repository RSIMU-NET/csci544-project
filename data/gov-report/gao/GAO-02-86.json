We warned that if this condition persists, the Department may not have key items, including spare aircraft parts, available when needed. This would impair aircraft and other equipment readiness. To compensate for shortfalls in logistics, all the military services\u2014Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014have resorted to cannibalization. The Department defines cannibalization as removing serviceable parts from one piece of equipment and installing them in another.", "Because of your concern that heavy use of cannibalization may increase both aviation maintenance costs and workloads, you asked us to examine the practice in the services. Accordingly, we determined (1) the extent to which the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force depend on cannibalizations to maintain aircraft; (2) the effects of cannibalizations; and (3) the reasons for cannibalizations. In addition, we assessed the sufficiency of the actions the Department of Defense and the services are taking to reduce the practice.

Navy policy specifically states that cannibalizations violate personnel utilization policies because they double the documentation and personnel hours needed to remove and install parts and components: two parts must be removed\u2014from two aircraft\u2014and two must be installed, instead of one. Although Army policy limits cannibalization to whenever a needed item is not available through the supply system, it allows commanders at installation levels and below to use their discretion as to whether and how much to cannibalize."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cannibalizations Are Extensive, but Full Magnitude Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 1996-2000, Air Force and Navy units reported a total of about 850,000 cannibalizations, and reported annual figures ranging between 154,000 and 176,000.

In fiscal year 1998, a Navy group noted that as many as half of all Navy cannibalizations may go unreported. In April 2000, the Navy Inspector General also confirmed that cannibalizations were being consistently underreported and that commanders were concerned that cannibalization was becoming an accepted maintenance practice.", "In fiscal year 2000, the Navy reported carrying out cannibalizations on 63 different aircraft types.

Several Army headquarters officials we spoke with agreed that cannibalizations should be tracked to provide an overall picture of how much cannibalization is used to compensate for parts shortage or availability.

According to one official, units do not have the resources to meet this increased requirement, so maintenance personnel must work harder and longer, even though they are not paid for overtime. If these people leave the military because of work and pay conditions, the services incur additional recruiting, retention, and training costs to replace them.", "Predictably, aircraft with the highest number of cannibalizations also accounted for a large share of maintenance hours spent on cannibalizations. For example, the Navy\u2019s FA-18A, FA-18C, S-3B, P-3C, E- 2C, and EA-6B consumed about 45 percent of the total reported cannibalization hours in fiscal year 2000. (See fig. 10.)

Cannibalizations may have to be performed at any time, day or night, and very quickly in order to meet operational commitments. In such cases, personnel must continue working until the job is done (without additional pay). Cannibalizations increase the maintenance personnel hours required for specific repairs, thus increasing the overall workload. For example, in fiscal year 2000, the Air Force reported that cannibalizations added 510,000 maintenance hours to the overall workload, or about 7.2 additional hours per cannibalization action. For the same period, the Navy reported that cannibalizations added approximately 441,000 maintenance hours, or about 5.2 additional hours per cannibalization. To the extent that cannibalizations contribute to extensive overtime, they may also have an adverse effect on morale and retention, thus adding to recruiting and training costs.", "In April 2000, the Naval Inspector General reported that cannibalization is counterproductive and has a \u201chuge\u201d impact on morale. Our analysis of the data collected during our 1999 survey of active duty personnel showed that a significant portion of aviation maintenance personnel reported working more than 50 hours a week and that some reported working 70 hours. In August 1999, we reported that the majority of the factors that personnel cited as sources of dissatisfaction and reasons for leaving the military were work-related, such as lack of parts and materials to successfully complete daily job requirements. At the recent hearing, Air Force and Army officials acknowledged that cannibalizations may have an adverse impact on morale and retention. But because they do not track all the maintenance hours they spend on cannibalizations, the services cannot assess all of the consequences.", "One example we found of how cannibalizations may become the source of waste or frustration was that of a major EA-6B component. This component, which was part of the aircraft\u2019s jamming mechanism, was removed from or reinstalled on four different aircraft, for a total of 16 times in 6 days.

Yet we observed numerous cases in which aircraft were grounded for much longer periods. One wing we visited provided us a daily aircraft status report showing that 6 out of 28 aircraft downed for parts had not flown for 37 days or more. One of these aircraft had not flown for more than 300 days and, according to the Maintenance and Material Control Officer, was missing 111 parts. As a result, the Navy had been unable to use this multi-million-dollar asset for almost a year. The officer estimated that it would take more than 1,000 maintenance hours to return the aircraft to flying status.", "In another example, four cannibalized FA-18 aircraft were missing so many parts that they were referred to as the \u201cwind chimes.\u201d (See fig. 12.) According to Navy officials, the number of days that these aircraft had not flown ranged from 903 to 1,756 days. They were finally transported to a Navy depot in July 2000. As of May 2001, one of them, which had been missing over 400 parts, had been funded for reassembly, while the remaining three were in storage awaiting funding approval. The depot estimated that the costs to reassembly the one aircraft would total about $568,000, assuming that the squadron that owns the aircraft supplies all the missing and failed parts. The depot\u2019s costs could increase if the squadron is not able to provide the parts.", "In another case, a Navy squadron within 30 days of a major exercise reported that 6 of its 13 assigned aircraft had not flown for 30 or more days\u20142 aircraft could not fly because the wing directed that parts be given to other squadrons.

This operation, if repeated several times, causes excessive wear on the wiring and ultimately requires the wiring to be replaced as well. The other services also provided anecdotal evidence indicating that cannibalizations do indeed increase the possibility of damage to parts because they involve two aircraft rather than one and are often performed under very rushed conditions.

Because this created safety concerns, the entire fleet was grounded in August 1999 until the gears could be replaced. The ensuing demand exacerbated an ongoing shortage because there were not enough transmissions on hand to meet the average monthly demand. As of March 2001, 75 transmissions were still on back order.", "We previously reported that some Air Force parts were unavailable because they did not last as long as expected. Thus, the parts in stock were exhausted before the Air Force could restock them. For example, a skid detector for the C-5 aircraft had a 50-percent increase in failures, and all spare parts were used before the item could be ordered or restocked.", "We also reported that some Navy parts were not available because of delivery delays by the contractor. The repairs of two types of EA-6B antennas were delayed because the contractor completely halted repair work from December 1999 to about March 2000 because of a company merger. One of these antennas later had problems passing quality inspections, exacerbating the shortage.", "The Comptroller General recently testified that for years, the Department of Defense has had equipment readiness problems because of a lack of key spare parts. He also said that the lack of spare parts was a major contributor to lower-than-expected mission-capable rates. In a recent report to Congress, the Department of Defense identified aviation readiness as one of its major problems and expressed concern about parts shortages and maintenance issues.

Original manufacturers may no longer make parts, forcing a new manufacturer to produce the item. This can result in long delays in filling orders and to increased cannibalizations. Army and Defense Logistics Agency officials informed us that the age of the Apache, Blackhawk, and Chinook helicopters is a contributing factor in these aircrafts\u2019 parts shortages. The Army Materiel Command Commander said in 1999 that the Army expects to maintain an upgraded model of the almost 40-year-old Chinook, for another 30 years. He added that the age of these aircraft increases parts consumption and makes cannibalization necessary.Similarly, the Navy had problems finding a firm to manufacture F-14 transmitters and found itself with a shortage of parts. It had not procured the transmitter for 10 years. Potential contractors were reluctant to make the part. One contractor willing to do so could not produce the transmitters on schedule. Consequently, unfilled demands for the transmitter affected the aircraft\u2019s capability to perform its missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Reasons", "paragraphs": ["The Navy Inspector General has cited three other reasons for cannibalizations that are related more to maintenance deficiencies than to parts shortages: (1) lack of experience and insufficiently trained maintenance personnel, (2) outdated maintenance manuals, and (3) lack of testing equipment.

As a result, the Navy initiated actions to better identify the specific causes of cannibalizations and increase the visibility of items that are being cannibalized extensively. Beginning in June 2001, the Navy implemented a requirement that more specific reasons for each cannibalization be reported. Although the Navy already required some reporting of the specific causes for cannibalizations, the new requirement increased the number of reportable reason codes. For example, maintenance personnel are now required to report whether a cannibalization was done (1) for troubleshooting, (2) because it was directed by higher authority, (3) because the part was not available in the required time frame to meet a flight schedule, (4) because the repair part was carried locally but was not on hand, (5) because the repair part was not carried in the local supply system, (6) because the consumable part was not carried or not in stock, or (7) because of a lack of storage space or testing equipment. A Web site has also been established to better highlight the items frequently cannibalized and to provide an avenue for maintenance personnel, program managers, and inventory control personnel to comment on problems and track progress in resolving issues.

The Army\u2019s current information system does not allow for the reporting of servicewide data on cannibalizations. As a result, neither the Department of Defense nor the services can accurately determine (1) which cannibalizations are necessary and what alternatives, if any, are available to reduce the number of those that are not; (2) what specific improvements or changes need to be implemented to effectively limit the adverse effects of cannibalizations; and (3) to what extent reducing the workload associated with cannibalizations would increase personnel morale and retention rates. Having standardized data on cannibalizations should help managers make sound economic decisions concerning the relative costs of alternatives, such as changing the stockage levels or storage locations for specific parts.", "We believe that the new requirement to report the use of cannibalizations as part of the current readiness reporting system outlined in the 2001 Defense Authorization Act will be beneficial. However, we believe that the new reporting requirement established by the Department in response to this Act could be improved by including the amount of time spent on cannibalizations. In our opinion, it is the amount of maintenance personnel time spent on cannibalizations\u2014not only the number of cannibalizations\u2014that contributes the most to morale and retention problems and to higher maintenance costs.", "Because they view cannibalization as a symptom of supply problems, the services are relying on improvements in the logistics system to reduce the practice. We agree that improvements in the supply system should help reduce cannibalizations, but we believe that actions aimed specifically at reducing the maintenance hours expended on cannibalizations are also needed. Although the services have taken some initiatives to address cannibalizations, and although we believe these initiatives are steps in the right direction, the magnitude of the problem and the many reasons for cannibalization call for a more coordinated approach that involves both the Department and the services. Because cannibalization is a problem whose causes are not service-specific and whose effects cut across all areas of Defense, the Department must provide the services with guidance and leadership in tackling the issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To permit the Department of Defense and the services to more accurately determine the extent of cannibalizations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to establish standardized, comprehensive, and reliable cannibalization data- collection procedures and systems for cannibalizations. The procedures should require the accurate documentation of the number of cannibalizations, the associated maintenance hours, and the specific reasons for the cannibalizations. They should also require the services to identify any adverse effects of cannibalizations on maintenance costs and personnel.", "The 2001 Defense Authorization Act requires the Department of Defense to measure, on a quarterly basis, the extent of cannibalizations. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the services to measure and report the number of maintenance hours associated with cannibalizations.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the services to develop strategies to reduce the number of maintenance hours spent on cannibalization, ensure that cannibalized aircraft do not remain grounded for long periods of time, and reduce the adverse effects of cannibalizations on maintenance costs and personnel. At a minimum, the strategies should include criteria to determine (1) which cannibalizations are appropriate, (2) cannibalization- reduction goals, and (3) the actions to be taken to meet those goals. The services must assign responsibility for ensuring that goals are being met and allocate resources for this purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Defense concurred with the intent of all our recommendations and commented that cannibalization is a serious issue. The Department indicated, however, that cannibalization accounts for a \u201cnegligible percentage\u201d of total maintenance hours. We believe that that the 5.3 million maintenance hours spent by the Navy and the Air Force on cannibalizations in fiscal years 1996-2000\u2013the equivalent of more than 500 aviation personnel working full- time for 5 years\u2014is significant, especially considering that, as our report points out, the Navy\u2019s data are probably understated by as much as 50 percent, the Air Force underreports cannibalizations, and the Army does not collect servicewide figures. In addition, virtually all Navy and Air Force aircraft types reported cannibalization actions for fiscal year 2000. Several of these aircraft experienced cannibalization rates from about 2 to over 7 times the service average. These data suggest that the services may benefit most by focusing their attention on specific aircraft types where cannibalization problems are the most severe.", "The Department does not agree that cannibalization is a pervasive problem throughout the military. While the Department indicated that a few weapons systems are showing cannibalization rates higher than desired, overall cannibalizations are declining\u2014for example, the levels for fiscal year 2000 are the lowest in 4 years. Even so, as our report indicates, the Navy and the Air Force still reported spending almost 1 million personnel hours cannibalizing aircraft that year. And senior service officials, who testified before your subcommittee on May 22, 2001, acknowledged that cannibalization rates are too high and need to be reduced.", "The Department concurred with our recommendation to establish standardized, comprehensive, and reliable cannibalization data collection procedures. According to the Department, an in-depth assessment of the impact of cannibalization has already been initiated. The Department said that the assessment will identify the causes and effects of cannibalizations and will recommend improvements. The Department said this assessment will provide a basis for potential modifications to logistics management policies and strategies.", "With regard to our recommendation that the number of maintenance hours associated with cannibalizations be included in the Quarterly Readiness Report to the Congress, the Department said the recommendation was \u201credundant\u201d because existing legislation already requires that this be done. However, our review of the latest readiness report (for the quarter ending June 2001) revealed that while cannibalization rates were being reported by weapon system, the associated maintenance hours were not. We believe that the hours spent on cannibalizations, not the number of cannibalizations, are the most important indicator of the negative impact of the practice on maintenance personnel and that this information should be included in the readiness reports. Although the Department has not made the number of personnel hours spent on cannibalizations part of its reporting requirement, it did state that it is reviewing the data submitted by the services to ensure that all necessary information is collected.", "We performed our work from July 2000 through November 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Our scope and methodology are provided as appendix I.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issuance. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army; the Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps; the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

To identify Department of Defense and service policies and practices regarding cannibalization, we interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense and service headquarters and aviation command personnel responsible for aircraft maintenance policies and oversight, reviewed applicable regulations and other guidance concerning the practice, and analyzed statistical data regarding cannibalization rates. We held discussions concerning the pros and cons of cannibalization, its impact on readiness, the alternatives and their relative costs, and any efforts on the part of the Department of Defense to address the issue. We obtained statistics concerning cannibalizations from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal 2000, identified weapons systems most dependent on the practice to maintain readiness, and documented the reasons for dependence. We did not independently verify the number of cannibalizations, associated maintenance hours, or cannibalization rates provided by the individual services. We also visited aircraft maintenance units to discuss the use of cannibalizations and tracking processes. We discussed the impact of cannibalizations on personnel and other readiness issues, the time involved, the processes used to decide when cannibalizations should be used, and alternatives.", "To determine the extent to which the services depend on cannibalizations, we requested that the services provide statistics for fiscal years 1996\u2014 2000 covering the total reported cannibalization actions, rates, and associated maintenance hours broken out by weapon system. With the exception of the Army, these data were provided by Navy and Air Force headquarters organizations; the Navy\u2019s data included Marine Corps figures. The Navy\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 data on cannibalizations were obtained from the Navy\u2019s Aviation Maintenance and Material Management Information System (AV-3M), and the Aircraft Inventory Readiness Reporting System (AIRRS) maintained at the Naval Air Systems Command located at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland. The Air Force\u2019s data were obtained from the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) and provided to us by Headquarters U.S. Air Force. Since the Army does not collect data on servicewide cannibalizations, we discussed the extent that the Army cannibalizes aircraft with officials at the Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile Command in Huntsville, Alabama; U.S. Army Forces Command, Ft. McPherson, Georgia; and the Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky. Although they provided us with some limited statistics regarding the number of cannibalizations, we did not include them in our report because the data were not comparable to those provided by the other services.", "To determine the effects of and reasons for cannibalization, we discussed the issues with maintenance and supply personnel and obtained studies and documentation during visits to various military headquarters and aviation activities, including the Commander, Naval Air Forces, Atlantic, Norfolk, Virginia, and Pacific, San Diego, California; headquarters and selected squadrons of Strike Fighter Wing U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, located at Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and at Lemoore Naval Air Station, California, respectively; and Commander, Electronic Attack Wing Pacific and selected squadrons at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington.
