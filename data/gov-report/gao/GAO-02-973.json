In this report, GAO reviewed the Bureau of Reclamation's managerial cost accounting and cost recovery practices. The Bureau does not currently identify and distribute all of the costs it incurs to its specific projects and activities. These costs are not distributed because the Bureau considers them nonreimbursable and because its cost accounting system is used to capture costs related to reimbursable purposes such as irrigation, municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply, and power generation. While GAO recognizes that the Bureau does not have the authority to recover certain costs, such as those funded through the Policy and Administration appropriation, all of the costs should nevertheless be distributed to the relevant activities to provide information useful in managerial decision making. Because not all costs are distributed, information on the full cost of projects and activities is not readily available to the Congress, program managers, and others to facilitate decision making and the allocation of the federal government's resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In previous work at the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of  Reclamation (Bureau), we identified reimbursable project costs that were  not being recovered by the Bureau.

To facilitate cost recovery and manage the  projects and programs, the Bureau collects budget and cost information  through its program and budget and financial accounting systems.", "The need for cost information is not unique to the Bureau.  Cost  information is needed throughout government for management, resource  allocation, and oversight purposes.  The cost of government is a concern to  the public as well as to the federal government itself.  One of the ways to  capture cost information is by applying managerial cost accounting  techniques.  By using managerial cost accounting information, agency  executives and managers, the Congress, citizens, news media, and interest  groups can better assess the costs of governmental activities.", "The need for useful managerial cost information has been recognized for  some time.   The Congress and others have taken a number of actions to  require cost accounting information and to encourage its use in  administering federal projects and programs.  Some of the specific  requirements for managerial cost accounting are as follows.", "The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 includes among the functions of  chief financial officers \u201cthe development and reporting of cost  information\u201d and \u201cthe systematic measurement of performance.\u201d", "Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts (SFFAC) No. 1,  Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting, issued in 1993, states that  the objectives of federal financial reporting are to provide useful  information to assist internal and external users in assessing the budget  integrity, operating performance, stewardship, and systems and control  of the federal government.  It also states that federal financial reporting  should provide information that helps users to determine the (1) costs  of specific programs and activities and the composition of, and changes  in, those costs, (2) efforts and accomplishments associated with federal  programs and their changes over time and in relation to costs, and (3)  efficiency and effectiveness of the government\u2019s management of its  assets and liabilities.", "Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4,  Managerial Cost Accounting Standards states that the objective of the  standard is to (1) provide program managers with relevant and reliable  information relating costs to outputs and activities, (2) provide relevant  and reliable cost information to assist the Congress and executives in  making decisions about allocating federal resources, authorizing and  modifying programs, and evaluating program performance, and (3)  ensure consistency between costs reported in general purpose financial  reports and costs reported to program managers.

Bureauwide program costs are generally not distributed to project  purposes for one of two reasons:  either because legislation specifically  designates these costs to be unrecoverable or the Bureau has otherwise  decided not to seek reimbursement for them.   These two undistributed  cost categories totaled nearly $200 million or 21 percent of the Bureau\u2019s  total budget authority for fiscal year 2002.  See appendix III for additional  information pertaining to budgeted amounts for Policy and Administration  and Bureauwide program costs for fiscal years 1997 through 2002.  As  discussed in the next section, we believe that certain of these undistributed  costs may be recoverable.", "Because such a large portion (21 percent) of the Bureau\u2019s budget is not  distributed, complete information regarding the total cost of each of the  Bureau\u2019s activities is not readily available.  Bureau managers and external  parties, such as congressional appropriators, do not have information on  the total costs of the Bureau\u2019s main activities at their disposal for decision  making purposes.

Reclamation law provides that the Bureau  recover the costs of certain reimbursable activities, including irrigation,  M&I water supply, and power generation.

The comments are reproduced in appendix II and summarized  and addressed below.  Interior concurred with our recommendation to  recover the costs of Bureauwide programs that either directly or indirectly  benefit projects, unless cost recovery is prohibited under current law.   Interior stated that, as part of ongoing action on a previous report, it will  review Bureauwide programs and issue, by March 31, 2004, directives for  those programs that will address, among other things, whether the  associated costs are recoverable.", "We are encouraged by Interior\u2019s comment and look forward to seeing the  results of its review.  However, we note that the referenced action on the  previous findings has been slow.  For example, in comments on a draft of  the May 31, 2000, report, Interior stated that it would work with the  Solicitor\u2019s office to determine whether it could recover costs identified in  the report.  In July 2002, in the course of our work on the current review,  we inquired about the status of the Solicitor\u2019s review and were told that the  Solicitor\u2019s input had not yet been requested.  We believe it is important to  note that while the previous report related only to unrecovered indirect  costs, our work during this review identified unrecovered costs related to  activities that benefit projects both directly and indirectly, as shown in  table 1.  Since the Bureau devotes significant resources to the Bureauwide  programs and we have now identified costs that directly benefit projects  but are not recovered from project beneficiaries, we believe that taking  timely action to implement this recommendation is important.", "Interior did not concur with our recommendation to distribute Policy and  Administration and Bureauwide program costs to projects and activities;  however, its comments in doing so were contradictory.  Interior did not  concur with the recommendation, but stated that it would explore doing as  we recommend as part of its implementation of a departmentwide ABC  system in fiscal year 2004.   We believe that implementing this  recommendation is critical if, as stated in its comment letter, Interior plans  to implement the recommendation to recover the costs of Bureauwide  programs because these programs consist of activities that directly or  indirectly benefit projects.  In our opinion, distributing these costs would  facilitate appropriate cost recovery.  Interior\u2019s major comments in  nonconcurring with this recommendation are synopsized below, along with  our responses.", "Interior\u2019s first major comment was that the current cost accounting system  already meets all of the cost accounting standards\u2019 objectives and purposes  and, due to the latitude allowed under the standards, is in compliance with  the standards.  Interior further states that our finding that the Bureau lacks  full cost information to support managerial decisions is misleading.  The  primary focus of our review was not to narrowly assess compliance with  the standards but, rather, to determine whether the Bureau identifies and  distributes for management purposes all the costs it incurs in operating its  projects and administering its programs.   This included determining the  Bureau\u2019s primary focus with respect to the purposes of managerial cost  information as delineated in the standards--budgeting and cost control,  performance measurement, cost reimbursement, program evaluations, and  economic choice decisions.  We found that the Bureau, because of its focus  on cost reimbursement, does not distribute a large portion of its budget (21  percent for fiscal year 2002) and, thus, complete information on the costs  of the Bureau\u2019s activities is not available to aid decision making.  It is not  misleading for us to note that distributing these costs would provide more  complete cost information that would be useful for resource allocation  decisions, cost analysis and management, and program and performance  measurement.", "In addition, although stating that its system meets the cost accounting  standards\u2019 objectives and purposes, Interior also stated that it plans to  continue enhancing the system to \u201cmore fully satisfy each of the five  purposes\u201d of the standards.  Such enhancements were precisely what we  had in mind in recommending that the Bureau distribute Policy and  Administration and Bureauwide program costs so that more complete  information on the costs of the Bureau\u2019s activities would be available to  decision makers both within and outside the Bureau.  We believe that  implementing our recommendation would aid the Bureau as it seeks to  \u201cmore fully satisfy\u201d the standards\u2019 purposes by providing the Congress,  executives, and managers with better and more complete information and  analysis on resource utilization and the costs of activities and outputs.", "Moreover, we believe that the nonconcurrence with our recommendation  to distribute Policy and Administration and Bureauwide program costs  contradicts the intent of Interior\u2019s departmentwide effort to implement the  President\u2019s Management Agenda.  The Deputy Secretary\u2019s January 16, 2002,  memo cited in our report emphasizes the importance of cost information in  implementing the President\u2019s Management Agenda and specifically  identifies ABC as Interior\u2019s vehicle for understanding and managing costs.   The Deputy Secretary\u2019s memo states that  \u201cABC is a cost accounting  method that measures the cost of work efforts leading to a specific result.\u201d", "To implement its cost accounting initiative, Interior has created an  interagency work group.  In discussing how to integrate budgeting and  performance and improve cost reporting, the work group wrote that ABC is  a management tool that attempts to ensure that an organization\u2019s  expenditures, including direct and overhead costs, are allocated to  products or services in order to identify the cost to the organization of  delivering those products or services.  The work group further wrote \u201cABC  will facilitate understanding the full cost (direct and indirect) of  performance by understanding what drives the cost of work processes\u2026  This approach helps assess the efficiency of performance, in dollar terms.   It requires detailed accounting for all expenditures and permits aggregating  the information at different levels to suit various decision making  purposes.\u201d   The Bureau will not be able to assess the efficiency of its  performance in delivering products and services in such a manner without  distributing the costs of its Policy and Administration and Bureauwide  program activities.", "The second major comment by Interior was that the Bureau\u2019s cost  accounting system provides the necessary information for program  management and full cost information for external reporting.  We disagree.   The full costs of the Bureau\u2019s projects, programs, and activities are not  reported.  As we state in the report, the cost accounting system focuses  primarily on cost recovery.  It does not identify the full costs of the major  activities undertaken by the Bureau in accomplishing the primary purposes  of its water projects, such as irrigation, M&I water supply, power  generation, recreation, fish and wildlife protection, flood control, water  conservation, and land resource management.", "As a result, the full costs of, for example, operating the Central Valley  Project, the Examination of Existing Structures Program, or the various  activities associated with operating and maintaining a facility are not  known.  In addition, the Bureau does not report the full costs of  Bureauwide programs in either its annual report or budget documents.  To  report the full cost of Bureauwide programs, the Bureau would need to  include the costs funded through the Policy and Administration  appropriation because many of these programs use Policy and  Administration funds to pay the employees who administer the Bureauwide  programs.", "The Bureau does report total costs, in aggregate, by Government  Performance and Results Acts (GPRA) responsibility segment.  However, it  does not distribute all of the Policy and Administration costs to its  responsibility segments.  For example, for fiscal year 2000, the Bureau  made Policy and Administration one of its GPRA responsibility segments  instead of distributing those costs to the other responsibility segments that  Policy and Administration supports.  The other responsibility segments  were: (1) Water and Energy Management and Development, (2) Land  Management and Development, (3) Fish and Wildlife Management and  Development, (4) Facilities Operations, and (5) Facilities Maintenance and  Rehabilitation.  Since the Bureau did not distribute the Policy and  Administration costs, it did not report the full costs of the other  responsibility segments because the Policy and Administration  appropriation funds activities that support the administration of the other  segments.", "For fiscal year 2001, the Bureau changed the GPRA responsibility segments  to the Commissioner\u2019s Office and its five regional offices.  The Policy and  Administration costs were distributed to each of these six offices, with the  Commissioner\u2019s Office accounting for over 60 percent of the Policy and  Administration costs.  However, since it made the Commissioner\u2019s Office a  responsibility segment and did not distribute its costs to the five regional  offices, the Bureau did not report the full cost of the regional offices  because the Commissioner\u2019s Office supports the regional offices.", "The third major comment by Interior was that distributing Policy and  Administration and Bureauwide program costs would not improve decision  making because these costs are not recoverable, are not controllable by  project and program managers, and should not be aggregated with program  and activity costs because these costs are not appropriated and budgeted  to project-level activities.  We disagree.  The purposes for which managerial  cost accounting information is used are different than those for financial  and budgetary accounting information and public policy decisions  regarding cost recovery that are made through the legislative process.   While managerial cost accounting should be integrated with financial and  budgetary accounting, it is different in that cost accounting information is  developed and tailored to facilitate decision making by program managers,  executives, and external stakeholders such as Members of Congress.   These decisions often relate to one or more of the purposes delineated in  the cost accounting standards, one of which addresses cost recovery.  To  meet these needs, managerial cost accounting may employ data produced  by the financial and budgetary accounting process as well as nonfinancial  or programmatic data, such as units of output.", "We understand Interior\u2019s point that Policy and Administration and some  Bureauwide programs have been legislatively excluded from cost recovery.   However this does not mean that these costs should be excluded from  distribution and analysis for the purpose of managerial decision making.   The Congress, executives, managers, and others need cost information in  determining how effectively and efficiently resources are being used,  irrespective of whether the costs are recovered.   Both the Bureau\u2019s  customers and the public have an interest in assuring that resources are  used effectively and efficiently and that the costs can be linked to results  and outcomes. \u201cFor performance measurement or other purposes, some entities may want to make a  distinction between controllable and uncontrollable costs with respect to an individual  responsibility segment or a cost center.  The full cost information need not interfere with  this distinction.\u201d \u201cUltimately, most costs are controllable at a certain level of activity by the entity.  If some of  them are not controllable at a lower level of the organization, they may very well be  controllable at a higher level.  Each segment should concern itself with the costs that are  assigned to it on a cause-and-effect basis.  These costs are often incurred because of a  segment\u2019s demand and use of services from other segments or entities.  Although the  service-receiving segment has no control over the efficiency in producing the service, it can  influence the costs by changing the demand for the service.  For an entity\u2019s top management,  full cost reporting provides it with an overview of how the entity\u2019s various costs, including  the general and administrative costs, are incurred and assigned to the entity\u2019s segments.   The full cost reporting also makes the entity\u2019s top management aware of the costs of  services that it receives from other entities.  The management can closely review those  costs and determine whether actions are needed to control them.\u201d \u201c\u2026as a principle, full cost should include the costs of all resources applied to a program,  activity, and its outputs, regardless of funding sources.\u201d", "Interior\u2019s fourth major comment was that implementing our  recommendation would require changes to the Bureau\u2019s accounting system  that would not be cost effective.   We are not aware of any formal Bureau  analysis that has determined what system changes would be required nor  the cost effectiveness of any changes.  However, any changes would be to a  detailed cost accounting system the Bureau already has in place and that  already accounts for most of its direct and indirect costs.  In addition, we  are recommending that any changes be done in conjunction with the  implementation of the department\u2019s cost accounting initiative.  The  department\u2019s interagency work group has recognized that some system  modifications will be necessary for each of Interior\u2019s bureaus.  It formed a  subgroup to identify contractors that the department\u2019s bureaus may already  be working with or are considering working with in implementing ABC  with the intent of maintaining consistency and trying to pool resources  across the department.", "Moreover, system costs did not stop the BLM from distributing all of its  costs and making changes to its cost accounting system as it implemented  ABC.  BLM\u2019s implementation of ABC is in part what prompted Interior to  implement ABC department wide.  Although BLM and the Bureau have  different missions and outputs, ABC is not a mission-dependent cost  accounting system and it is being used in both the private and public sector  by a wide range of businesses and federal agencies. BLM\u2019s implementation  of ABC resulted in its identifying activities and producing unit cost  information for 131 outputs and tying these amounts back to its Statement  of Net Costs (full costs).", "We will send copies of this report to appropriate House and Senate  Committees; interested members of the Congress; The Honorable Mitchell  E.
