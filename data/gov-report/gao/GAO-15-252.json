More than half of these reemployed civilian annuitants,  specifically DOD\u2019s civil service reemployed annuitants, would not be  covered under OPM\u2019s waiver authority. DOD accounted for 83 percent of  the increase in annuitants from 2004 to 2013\u2014 of this increase,  approximately 3 percent were civil service annuitants and about 98  percent were uniformed service annuitants.

The increase in reemployed annuitants reflects agencies\u2019  greater reliance on all types of annuitants, including former uniformed  service members covered by military pension systems as well as retirees  from federal civilian service covered by the Federal Employees\u2019  Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement System  (CSRS). Use of annuitants was concentrated in the three largest  agencies\u2014DOD, Veterans Affairs (VA), and Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014 which collectively employed about 92 percent of annuitants in 2013, with  nearly 80 percent employed at DOD alone. Most of the increased reliance  on annuitants in DOD is tied to reemployment of uniformed service  members: 98 percent of DOD\u2019s annuitants were retired uniformed service  members.", "Our analysis also indicates that the other 21 CFO Act agencies saw  increases in reemployed annuitants, as well.

Although these agencies collectively relied more heavily on civil service  annuitants than VA and DHS, reemployed uniformed service members  still comprised nearly 79 percent of the on-board annuitants among these  agencies in 2013. Greater reliance on annuitants suggests recent losses  in key staff and institutional knowledge due to retirement.

An example of  an unusual circumstance cited by agencies requesting a delegation is an  urgent need to rehire annuitants to support the hiring of critical staff. For  example, DHS cited a need to rehire investigative program specialists to  support the hiring of law enforcement officers to meet a Congressional  mandate.
