HUD also took measures in response to the National Performance Review\u2019s September 1993 report, which recommended that HUD eliminate its regional offices, realign and consolidate its field office structure, and reduce its field workforce by 1,500 by the close of fiscal year 1999. Following a July 1994 report by the National Academy of Public Administration that criticized HUD\u2019s performance and capabilities, Secretary Cisneros issued a reinvention proposal in December 1994 that called for major reforms, including a consolidation and streamlining of HUD\u2019s programs coupled with a reduction in staff to about 7,500 by the year 2000.", "Secretary Cuomo initiated the 2020 planning process in early 1997 to address, among other things, HUD\u2019s needs for downsizing and correcting management deficiencies.

Certain functions performed by FHA generally parallel some of those performed by other organizations in the single-family mortgage industry such as Fannie Mae. In 1994, as a pilot project, FHA began consolidating its single-family loan-processing operations that were performed in 17 of its field offices into the Denver Homeownership Center.

In its comments, HUD said that, in addition to the factors cited in our draft report, it consulted with recognized management experts prior to the June 1997 release of the 2020 plan; consulted with affected constituent groups and the Congress since the plan\u2019s release; and incorporated the Inspector General\u2019s suggestions into its implementation plans. We agree that such steps may be useful in building support for HUD\u2019s reforms. However, as noted, our objectives were to provide information on HUD\u2019s analytical support for the efficiencies it expects from the reforms\u2014that is, the extent of data supporting the anticipated quantitative and qualitative benefits stated in the 2020 plan.", "HUD said that it undertook substantial workload analyses to plan for reaching the goal of 7,500 employees and that the workload analyses\u2014along with the reengineering of numerous processes\u2014formed the foundation for staffing size and allocation decisions. As we noted in our draft report, HUD\u2019s management reform and change agent teams relied on a variety of factors, including workload data, to show whether each program area could carry out its responsibilities within assigned targeted staffing levels. However, we draw a distinction between (1) analysis that is directed at determining how many staff are needed to carry out a given responsibility or function and (2) the use of historical workload data to apportion, or allocate, a predetermined target number of staff among different locations or functions. While HUD clearly used the latter approach, at least within some program areas, it provided us with no evidence during our review or in its comments that it used the former.Rather, as our report states, the management reform and change agent teams were instructed by the Deputy Secretary to work within targeted staffing levels; the predetermined target level for the entire Department was 7,500, a number established prior to the 2020 planning process. As is also noted in our report, HUD\u2019s Inspector General reported in December 1997 that the downsizing target of 7,500 was adopted without first performing a detailed analysis of HUD\u2019s mission and projected workload under its proposed reforms. We have revised the language in our report where appropriate to make this distinction clear. We also added information that HUD provided in its comments concerning future downsizing to the 7,500 level from the current level of about 9,000.", "Concerning HUD\u2019s comment that the draft report did not acknowledge potential benefits from the 2020 reform plan, the report noted that the plan is directed in part towards correcting management deficiencies that we and others have identified. Furthermore, the report noted that, in addition to increased efficiency, HUD expects the planned consolidation of functions and other process changes to result in increased effectiveness, such as fewer troubled public housing agencies and troubled FHA multifamily projects. For the reasons stated in the report, we continue to believe that the extent to which these benefits will be realized is as yet uncertain. HUD implicitly acknowledges this uncertainty in its comments by conditioning its further downsizing in part on a \u201csubstantial\u201d reduction in troubled public housing agencies and multifamily projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify HUD\u2019s analyses supporting the (1) prospective efficiencies from centralizing and consolidating major programs and activities and (2) agency\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities with 7,500 employees, we reviewed the management reform and change agent reports for each of HUD\u2019s major program areas. We also interviewed officials in each program area who had participated in, or were familiar with, the process of developing the 2020 plan. We asked officials in each program area to provide any empirical studies or analyses underlying the proposed reforms that did not appear in the management reform or change agent reports. In addition, we spoke with officials in HUD\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and obtained the Inspector General\u2019s report on the 2020 planning process. To identify how HUD plans to manage the personnel changes that will result from the reforms and downsizing, we interviewed officials responsible for the changes and obtained copies of union agreements and other relevant documents. We performed our work from September 1997 through February 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.
