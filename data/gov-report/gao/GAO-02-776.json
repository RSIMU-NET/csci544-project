To fulfill this role, the agency oversees a staff of more than 28,000 civilian and military employees who work in all 50 states and 27 foreign countries. It manages approximately 4 million supply items and processes over 23 million requisitions annually. DLA reported that, in fiscal year 2001, these operations resulted in sales to the military services of about $15 billion, of which $12 billion was for supplies.", "This report is one in a series mandated under the Floyd D. Spence Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The act directed that we review DLA\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in meeting customer requirements, the application of best business practices, and opportunities for improving the agency\u2019s operations. As agreed with your offices, this report focuses on the relationship between DLA and its military service customers. More specifically, we determined (1) how customers perceive the quality of service they receive, (2) how useful the agency\u2019s approaches are for obtaining customer service feedback, and (3) whether there are opportunities to enhance the agency\u2019s initiatives for improving customer service. To address these objectives, we used a case study approach to obtain customers\u2019 views. Our scope was limited to a judgmentally selected number of materiel management customers. We visited eight military service customer locations within the continental United States. The results of our work at these locations are not projectable to the agency as a whole. However, studies conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, DLA surveys, and comments from agency headquarters officials suggest that many of the issues we raise in this report are systemic in nature.

DLA buys and manages a vast number and variety of items for its customers, including commodities such as energy, food, clothing, and medical supplies. DLA also buys and distributes hardware and electronics items used in the maintenance and repair of equipment and weapons systems.", "Customers determine their requirements for materiel and supplies and submit requisitions to any of four DLA supply centers.  The centers then consolidate the requirements and procure the supplies for their customers. DLA provides its customers with requested supplies in two ways: some items are delivered directly from a commercial vendor while other items are stored and distributed through a complex of worldwide distribution depots that are owned and managed by both DLA and the military services. DLA refers to this ordering and delivery process as materiel management or supply-chain management. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of this process.", "Because DLA is the sole supplier for many critical items that can affect the readiness of the military services, the agency strives to provide its customers with the most efficient and effective logistics support. Thus, DLA has adopted a policy to provide customers with \u201cthe right item, at the right time, right place, and for the right price, every time.\u201d In an effort to institutionalize this customer support concept, DLA has adopted the Balanced Scorecard approach to measure the performance of its logistics operations. The scorecard, a best business practice used by many private and public organizations, is intended to measure DLA\u2019s performance by integrating financial measures with other key performance indicators around customers\u2019 perspectives; internal business processes; and organization growth, learning, and innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customer Satisfaction with DLA Services Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Our work showed that customers at the eight locations we visited expressed satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the services the agency provides.

On the other hand, customers at some locations were dissatisfied that, among other things, DLA is unable to obtain less frequently needed, but critical, items and parts and provide accurate and timely delivery status information. Some customers did not express an opinion on the overall quality of customer service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Customers Generally Satisfied with Routine Services", "paragraphs": ["One aspect of DLA customer support is to provide customers with supplies when they need them. Common supplies include vehicle parts such as pumps, hoses, filters, and tubing.

However, customers at all locations we visited commented that they were generally satisfied with DLA\u2019s ability to provide most supply items in a time frame that meets their needs. Customers stated that the majority of the routine, frequently demanded supplies they order through DLA are delivered quickly\u2014a view that is also supported by a February 2002 DLA performance review. The review concluded that the majority of requisitions (over 85 percent) was filled from existing inventories within DLA\u2019s inventory supply system. Similarly, a 2001 Joint Staff Combat Support Agency Review Team assessment of DLA\u2019s support to the unified commands indicated that overall, DLA received outstanding comments regarding its ability to provide its customers with timely supplies and services.", "Customers were also satisfied with the ease in ordering supplies such as the pumps, hoses, and filters mentioned above. Customers stated that even though they conduct large amounts of business through DLA, they had few problems with the ordering process. This occurs because, according to some customers, ordering is facilitated by effective on-line systems that work well and have readily available information.", "Another method that DLA uses to ensure customer satisfaction is its prime vendor program, which DLA instituted to simplify the procurement and delivery of such items as subsistence and medical or pharmaceutical supplies that commonly have a short shelf life. The program enables customers to directly interact with vendors, thereby reducing the delivery time for these supplies. Two customers of these DLA-managed prime vendor programs told us the programs effectively reduced delivery time. For example, at one location, prime vendors reduced the delivery time of food items from 7 days\u2014the time it took to deliver the items when purchased from DLA\u2014to 2 days for items purchased directly from prime vendors. The customers we spoke with at a medical supply unit told us they were so pleased with the prime vendor\u2019s quick delivery time that they intend to obtain even more medical supplies from the prime vendor. They also told us that the prime vendor provides an additional service in the form of monthly visits to assess customer satisfaction with its services.

Customers at four locations we visited told us that DLA was not able to timely deliver some critical items, such as weapons systems parts, which significantly affected their equipment readiness. A number of customers told us that the items they have difficulty obtaining from DLA are those that are more costly or infrequently required. At two locations, customers used parts from existing equipment (known as \u201cparts cannibalization\u201d) because they were unable to obtain the parts they needed. At two other locations, customers said they grounded aircraft and/or deployed units without sufficient supplies. Customers at one location experienced an over-6-month delay in obtaining helicopter parts. As a result, customers at this location told us that some of the unit\u2019s helicopters were unable to fly their missions. We reported in November 2001 that equipment cannibalizations adversely affect the military services, resulting in increased maintenance costs, and lowered morale and retention rates because of the increased workload placed on mechanics.", "One customer also told us that DLA does not provide adequate information about items requiring long procurement lead times. The customer stated that having this information more readily available would aid customers in making decisions about the types and quantities of items they should retain to minimize the impacts of long DLA lead times.", "The 1998 Combat Support Agency Review Team\u2019s assessment conducted at military service field activities found that even though DLA met its overall supply availability goal of 85 percent, the remaining 15 percent of items that were not available \u201calmost certainly includes a number of items that are critical to the operation of essential weapon systems.\u201d The assessment attributed this shortfall to flaws in DLA\u2019s requirements determination models, which are used to estimate customers\u2019 demands so that DLA can maintain sufficient inventory quantities.", "The study further stated that customers are not satisfied with the delivery time for items that are not in stock. In fact, in April 2002, the overall logistics response time was almost 100 days for nonstocked items\u2014a problem that appears to have persisted for the last several years, in spite of efforts to reduce this time. Customers at four locations provided us with examples of back-ordered items having lead times in excess of 1 year, such as navigational instruments and airframe parts.

Customers at three locations said that when they tried to directly contact item managers by telephone, the managers often could not be reached and voice-mail messages were seldom returned.", "Furthermore, military service customers told us that DLA\u2019s automated requisition systems often do not contain accurate status data. Of particular concern to customers are the expected shipping or delivery dates posted on the automated systems. These dates show when parts will be available and allow units to coordinate maintenance schedules. If the dates are incorrect, units cannot effectively plan to have equipment available to be repaired.

DLA typically places such items on back order, which, to meet mission needs, places a burden on customers to find their own means to obtain the necessary items right away. A number of customers at these three locations said they felt that DLA, in an effort to be more customer focused, should do more to seek out alternate sources of supply to alleviate these high-priority back orders. Some customers also remarked that the required efforts for them to call vendors and solicit bids is a problem for their unit because of limited staffing levels and lack of contracting capabilities.", "In one instance, an aviation supply unit requisitioned a critical part from DLA that was needed to repair a helicopter unable to fly its mission. This requisition was placed on back order by DLA, and delivery was not expected to occur until 8 months later. Because of the critical nature of the needed part, the unit had to search for other means to obtain the part sooner. In fact, the unit directly contacted the same vendor that DLA was working with to fill the back orders and learned that the vendor had stock on hand and would be able to ship the item immediately. The unit subsequently purchased the part from that vendor instead of waiting for it to be available from DLA.", "In another instance, a DLA item manager informed an aircraft maintenance depot customer that $2 million worth of critical parts for a helicopter engine overhaul program would be placed on back order because the parts were not available from the DLA vendor. In researching listings for property to be disposed of, the customer found the required parts\u2014still new and unopened in the manufacturers\u2019 container\u2014available for redistribution or sale within DLA\u2019s disposal system.

Their concerns centered on DLA\u2019s process for recording the ownership of equipment and the commingling of different customers\u2019 inventories.", "To assign asset ownership, DLA \u201ccodes\u201d items in its automated inventory system. That is, DLA assigns unique codes to differentiate between Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and DLA-owned assets. However, customers at three locations we visited stated that in numerous instances, DLA assigned inventory items to the wrong management account, thus creating the possibility that an item ordered and paid for by one unit or service could be issued to another. One location we visited had documented over $1 million worth of items coded into the wrong management account. Another location identified $621,000 worth of incorrectly coded items. Before the errors were corrected, neither activity could access the materials they needed. As a result, both locations invested unnecessary amounts of time and money in correcting DLA\u2019s error. During our review, we brought this issue to the attention of DLA officials, who indicated that they would investigate the problem.", "Customers also expressed concerns about the commingling of service- owned assets with DLA-owned assets in DLA-managed warehouses. Like inaccurate coding, commingling creates a significant risk that items will be issued by the warehouse to someone other than the purchasing unit. As a result, the items would not be available to the true owner when needed. Also, for equipment items that need periodic inspection and repair, there is a risk the owner will expend resources to perform maintenance or repairs but not be able to retrieve the item because DLA mistakenly issued that item to a different requisitioning entity or military service. As a result, the \u201ctrue owner\u201d could have needlessly spent resources on items given to somebody else and also be left with items still needing repair.

DLA broadly defines a \u201ccustomer\u201d as someone who purchases items or directly causes products to be bought, but DLA has not identified who those individuals are from the multitude of organizations it deals with. DLA\u2019s current portfolio of customers is identified by approximately 49,000 address codes, known as DOD Activity Address Codes (DODAACs). The military services assign DODAACs to various organizations and activities for ordering supplies. However, these address codes, a legacy of a system built in the 1960s, contain little information about the customer\u2019s organization beyond a physical address. No meaningful customer contact point is associated with the codes or, in many cases, a specific organization that DLA can use as a basis for interaction with the customers using their services. As a result, DLA has no effective process to initiate and maintain contact with its customers for soliciting feedback. Without such a customer interface process, DLA has no routine means to understand customers\u2019 needs and to take appropriate corrective actions to address those needs.", "Our efforts to identify and interview DLA customers were hindered because a single DODAAC does not necessarily equate to a single customer. In many cases we found that one organization interacts with DLA using a number of DODAACs. For example, DLA\u2019s customer database shows over 580 DODAACs for Fort Bragg. However, according to DLA and Army officials, the number of Fort Bragg customer organizations interacting with DLA for these same DODAACs is smaller. The reason for this is that, in part, central order points at Fort Bragg are responsible for submitting and tracking orders for a number of smaller organizations, thereby covering multiple DODAACs. In addition, each of these organizations also uses multiple DODAACs to differentiate between various types of supply items, such as repair parts and construction materials. For example, one DODAAC is used for ordering numerous repair parts while another is used for ordering construction materials. One of these customer organizations at Fort Bragg is the Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, which interacts with DLA for supplies ordered using 159 different DODAACs. Thus, many DODAACs could represent only one customer.

DLA uses customer surveys, customer support representatives, and focus groups to obtain feedback from its customers on their level of satisfaction with the services DLA provides. For example, DLA conducts quarterly mail-out surveys to measure overall customer satisfaction levels. It also places customer support representatives at selected customer organizations to assist customers in planning, implementing new supply initiatives, and solving problems. However, we noted several weaknesses in these methods. Specifically, (1) the satisfaction survey response rates are too low to provide meaningful statistical analyses of customer satisfaction, (2) the survey instrument does not provide a sufficient means to understand why customers may be less than satisfied, and (3) customer support representatives are more reactive than proactive in soliciting customer feedback."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Quarterly Mail-out Surveys Have Low Response Rates", "paragraphs": ["The quarterly mail-out surveys that DLA uses to measure customer satisfaction elicit a relatively low number of responses from DLA customers, significantly limiting its usefulness in soliciting customer feedback. The survey response rates were too low to provide meaningful statistical analyses of customer satisfaction. The response rate for the 33,000 surveys that DLA mailed out in fiscal year 2001 averaged around 23 percent, and only about 20 percent for the August 2001 cycle (the latest cycle where results have been made available). As such, less than one quarter of DLA\u2019s customers are providing input on how they perceive DLA support and what problems they are experiencing that may need to be addressed.", "Large survey organizations like Gallup attempt to get response rates of between 60 and 70 percent for their mail surveys. Experts on customer satisfaction measurement have stated that although survey response rates are never 100 percent, an organization should strive to get its rate as close as possible to that number. They suggest that ideally, organizations can obtain response rates of over 70 percent. The experts also noted that organizations conducting surveys commonly make the mistake of assuming that if a final sample size is large, the response rate is unimportant. This leads organizations to accept response rates well under 25 percent. However, such low rates can lead to serious biases in the data.", "Having an inadequate understanding of who its customers are likely contributes to DLA\u2019s problem with low response rates. The surveys are mailed to addresses associated with the DODAACs and include with each survey a message asking that the survey be provided to a person most familiar with requisitioning and ordering supplies. However, during the fiscal year 2001 survey period, over 2,200 of the 33,000 surveys mailed (about 7 percent) were returned to DLA as \u201cundeliverable\u201d or were delivered to people who were no longer customers. Furthermore, another 128 respondents noted in their survey returns that they do not consider themselves to be customers. DLA officials stated that the undeliverable rate increases when there are many units that move to other locations or when service officials do not update DODAACs for changed addresses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surveys Are Insufficient for Identifying Causes of Customer Dissatisfaction", "paragraphs": ["The quarterly mail-out survey asks customers to rate their overall satisfaction with DLA products and services, along with specific aspects of support, such as providing products in time to meet needs and effectively keeping customers informed. While these surveys provide general aggregate information on the levels of customer satisfaction, they do not provide the means to understand why customers may be less than satisfied. For example, a number of customers we interviewed voiced concern over the fact that status dates for back-ordered items were either sometimes wrong or varied between different inventory systems. The survey might indicate only an overall low level of satisfaction in the area of keeping customers informed but would not provide a reason. If this problem were systemic throughout DLA, there would be less of an opportunity to take immediate corrective action. Most recently, in June 1999, DLA supplemented a quarterly survey with two focus groups targeted at soliciting specific customer feedback on DLA\u2019s communication efforts. While DLA determined the focus groups to be an excellent feedback mechanism, the sample size was too small for DLA to run a statistical analysis of the data obtained; and the topics for discussion were limited to customer communication.", "DLA officials stated that they use a number of methods to obtain customer feedback. These include analyses of survey results, focus groups, and structured interviews. However, they acknowledged that the usefulness of these methods is somewhat limited owing either to low response rates; limited discussion topics; small sample sizes; or, in the case of structured interviews, the fact that the most recent ones were conducted in 1997.", "DLA\u2019s own survey results also indicate the flaws with its survey techniques. For example, DLA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 survey results show that customers rated as \u201clow satisfaction\u201d their ability to reach the right DLA person to meet their needs. However, the survey noted that \u201cdue to its high importance to customers and the myriad of interpretations of \u2018less than satisfied\u2019 responses to this attribute, more information will need to be gathered\u201d to determine what issues are preventing customers from reaching the right person. This indicates that DLA\u2019s survey was not adequate to get behind the underlying causes of customer dissatisfaction. In fact, with respect to low satisfaction ratings, the survey reports for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 recommended that DLA conduct one-on-one interviews to identify why customers were not satisfied with DLA services.", "Another difficulty that DLA encounters in using mail-out satisfaction surveys to identify customer problems is that the surveys are designed to protect the confidentiality of the respondents, which limits DLA\u2019s ability to follow up with customers for adequate feedback. As a result, there is no means to follow-up with customers expressing low satisfaction levels to identify specific problems or to determine what, if any, corrective actions are needed. During our meetings with DLA customers, we were able to identify specific problems only by engaging in a dialogue with them about their experiences. In conducting these in-depth discussions on aspects of the supply process such as placing orders, obtaining the status of outstanding requisitions, receiving supply items, and obtaining customer service, we were able to ask follow-up questions to determine exactly what problems they were experiencing in some of these areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customer Support Representatives Not Proactive in Soliciting Feedback", "paragraphs": ["Another method DLA uses to facilitate customer service is the placement of customer support representatives at key customer locations. The use of these on-site representatives has the potential to provide DLA with a good link to its customers. In fact, some customers at three locations we visited specifically noted their satisfaction with the assistance the representatives provided. However, according to DLA headquarters officials, customer support representatives have been more reactive in that they help customers resolve only specific problems or assist in implementing new initiatives as requested. DLA headquarters officials told us that the representatives neither proactively solicit feedback on a regular basis from the multitude of customers in their geographical area nor reach out to identify the types of problems customers are experiencing.", "Furthermore, not all representatives are in contact with all DLA customers at their assigned locations.

According to officials at this location, the representative has been very helpful to them in resolving supply problems and implementing new initiatives. However, a number of other customers at this location said they do not use the customer support representative at all because they use other options, such as call centers. Some customers noted that they were not even aware that there was such a representative in the area. The Combat Support Agency Review Team\u2019s assessment in 1998 also found that some customers were unaware that customer support representatives even existed.

However, as DLA has noted, there is no single DLA contact point responsible for resolving customers\u2019 problems for all the items they requisition. For example, the supply centers are responsible for managing specific weapons system parts or types of commodities. As such, problem resolution is performed through each supply center, depending on the type of item the customer is ordering. To obtain assistance with requisitions, customers must contact the appropriate supply center, generally through its customer \u201ccall center,\u201d which is an activity dedicated to provide customer assistance for the particular items. In addition, Emergency Supply Operation Centers are available at each supply center for high- priority items. Also, customers can contact individual item managers at the supply centers to resolve problems with their orders. At three locations, some customers told us they are sometimes confused over whom to call and reported difficulties with getting in touch with the right person to resolve their problems. Customers at four locations were also frustrated with the quality of assistance provided by DLA, noting that while some of the DLA representatives were helpful, others were not able to give them the assistance they needed.", "To illustrate further, one aviation supply unit we visited had high-priority, back-ordered requisitions from each of the three DLA supply centers in Richmond, Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a result of these back orders, some of the unit\u2019s aircraft were unable to operate because of maintenance needs. In order to get assistance with these requisitions, either to request help in expediting the order or to obtain better status information, unit supply personnel needed to contact the call centers or the Emergency Supply Operation Centers at each of the supply centers, depending on the item. If there were a single DLA point of contact, the unit could go to that contact for assistance with all the items on its list of priority requisitions.", "Another problem with DLA\u2019s having many separate lines of communication with its customers is that meaningful information about those customers is not collected centrally for analysis. For example, each of the supply centers accumulates vital information about customer satisfaction through its contacts with customers. For instance, customers express specific problems they are having when getting help through the call centers. They might also convey information on problems they are having to various supply center teams conducting on-site visits for purposes of training or other liaison activities.

DLA hopes that this effort will reduce the number of channels a customer must navigate to obtain assistance and focus accountability for customer satisfaction on account managers rather than on item managers. DLA plans to establish account managers at three levels:   National Account Managers are to collaborate with military services at the departmental level, for demand planning and problem resolution.", "Customer Account Managers are to be the \u201csingle DLA face\u201d to each customer segment.

For example, the new strategy does not lay out milestones for implementing the program or specific improvements on how DLA solicits detailed feedback from its individual customers on their perceptions of service and the specific problems they are experiencing. The strategy also does not include a process for developing actions in response to issues that customers have identified and involving customers in that process. Furthermore, even though the plans include making account managers responsible for collecting customer feedback and exploring the idea of using Web-based tools to obtain customer feedback, they do not lay out specific tools or processes to accomplish this.", "To further illustrate, under the new Customer Relationship Management plan, an account manager would be created with responsibility for all customers within the U.S. Army Forces Command, which represents the Army\u2019s deployable forces segment. (See table 1.) This manager would work with the Army\u2019s customer representatives to identify customers\u2019 needs at the Forces Command level and reach formal agreements on service. However, there is no revised set of tools in the plan for collecting detailed feedback on an ongoing basis from the individual customer organizations representing the more than 6,600 DODAACs (address codes that represent mailboxes, locations, or people) in the Forces Command.", "Furthermore, the improvement initiatives do not provide for actions to link military service customer DODAACs to specific accountable organizations. Under the Customer Relationship Management program, DLA has developed a customer profile database that links DODAACs to major military commands, such as the U.S. Army Forces Command. It also plans to link each DODAAC to a business segment through this database sometime in the future. However, as noted previously, the major command and business segment levels comprise numerous DODAACs. Interaction with customers to get detailed feedback on their level of satisfaction requires better identification of customer organizations beyond the data currently associated with a DODAAC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Best Practice Organizations Use Multiple Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Studies examining best practices in the area of customer service have found that leading organizations use multiple approaches to listen to their customers\u2019 concerns. In particular, a 2001 Mid-American Journal of Business study pointed out that best practice companies use multiple tools to gather these data rather than relying on a single method such as a customer survey, which might be too narrow in scope and limited in its application to fully capture customers\u2019 concerns. The 2001 Mid-American Journal study and others concluded that the best approach for obtaining customer feedback is to use a broad measurement system with more than one listening tool to capture customers\u2019 input from many different perspectives.", "Using different tools alone is not enough to effectively obtain customer feedback. Centrally linking the feedback obtained is also important. Best practices research shows that information obtained through various methods needs to be integrated in order to gain a more complete understanding of customers. Thus, by linking all the various feedback tools in a standard and consistent manner, the organization would have better diagnostic information to guide improvement efforts.", "On the basis of our discussions with private sector experts and our reviews of literature on customer service best practices, leading organizations such as AT&T WorldNet Services, U.S. West, and Eastman Chemical combine quantitative and qualitative listening tools to obtain customer feedback and then centrally integrate the data in one location. Quantitative tools include such methods as customer satisfaction surveys and customer complaints, which can provide measurable data for use in performance scorecards. Qualitative tools include focus groups, personal interviews, and observation and are used by organizations to provide a more in-depth understanding of their customers. According to the research, not all tools are appropriate for all organizations, and the research points out that careful selection is therefore important. Examples of \u201clistening\u201d tools being used by the best practices organizations we identified through our reviews of best practice studies follow:   Customer satisfaction surveys. Research shows that most major organizations use listening tools such as relational and critical incident surveys to periodically capture customers\u2019 overall perceptions about their organization and to measure satisfaction with specific transactions soon after they occur. These surveys can be administered through the mail, such as with DLA\u2019s quarterly satisfaction survey; by telephone; in person; or electronically via the Internet. However, feedback from mail and electronic-based surveys can be more limited than that obtained through other methods because there is no opportunity to probe the respondent for better, more-detailed information. AT&T WorldNet Services, U.S. West, Eastman Chemical, and Hewlett-Packard are among the leading organizations that are turning to critical incident surveys in conjunction with other tools to learn more about customers\u2019 perceptions. Critical incident surveys are becoming more popular in the private sector because they provide information related to specific processes, which can be used to make specific improvements.", "Customer complaints. Gathering complaint data is a standard practice for most companies. All aspects of the customer complaint process are measured and tracked through this mechanism. Information collected and analyzed from this approach includes the nature of the complaint, speed of resolution, and customer satisfaction with the resolution. Eastman Chemical, for example, uses customer complaint data in conjunction with a survey tool to obtain customer feedback. It organizes the complaint data along the same attributes as the survey data.", "Benchmark surveys. Benchmark surveys gather perceptions of performance from the entire market. These surveys usually gather customer perceptions of performance about top competitors in an industry. This allows the company to examine its customer-perceived strengths and weaknesses in the overall marketplace. Best practices companies, such as Sun Microsystems, use this information primarily in the strategic planning process to identify their competitive advantage in the marketplace and to identify opportunities and shortfalls in the industry. While continuous improvement may be a result of this listening tool, the real value, according to the research in this area, comes from breakthrough thinking to gain a sustainable advantage.", "Won-lost and why surveys. \u201cLost\u201d customers\u2014those who do not replace orders with a company\u2014can be an excellent source of valuable information. Some companies, such as Eastman Chemical, employ \u201cwon- lost and why\u201d surveys to measure actual customer behavior and the rationale behind the behavior. This survey is utilized on a current basis, being administered to customers soon after they are \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost\u201d (i.e., decide to drop a company). For example, if a customer is won or lost, the company then probes the customer as to why its business was won or lost. For companies with a large number of customers, this tool may be implemented in a survey.", "Focus groups. Organizations use focus groups to get better information from customers than survey results provide. In these groups, customers are probed about why they answered survey questions the way they did. DLA has used focus groups to get detailed feedback on a single topic, but as noted previously, the number of individuals making up the focus groups was too small to draw agency-wide conclusions. AT&T Universal Card Services (now part of Citigroup) conducts multiple focus groups per year to discuss a wide range of topics. In these forums, both satisfied and dissatisfied customers discuss the company\u2019s service, products, and processes.", "Customer interviews. Conducting interviews with customers can provide a way to get very detailed information about their specific needs and problems. Like focus groups, this tool is used by leading customer service organizations to probe survey respondents as to why they answered survey questions a certain way. U.S. West identifies dissatisfied customers from its surveys and follows up with them to determine what problems they are having and how they can be fixed.", "Customer observation. In performing observations, organizations send teams to visit customers where they observe how those customers interact on a daily basis with the organization. This tool complements verbal information obtained through customer interviews and focus groups in that it provides confirmation to and a deeper understanding of that information.", "Management listening. Using this tool, managers listen in on actual customer calls to the organization to learn first-hand about what customers are experiencing. In an example of this technique, one best practice company encourages all of its managers, including the chief executive officer, to listen to customer calls.", "Customer service representatives. Collecting information from those employees who are in continuous direct contact with customers provides valuable information to best practice organizations. Often, these representatives are among the first to recognize customer problems. As mentioned previously, DLA uses customer support representatives to obtain feedback. However, according to DLA officials, it does not currently have enough representatives assigned to its customers, and the representatives generally are not proactive in obtaining customer feedback. Furthermore, while DLA\u2019s representatives provide headquarters with monthly written reports on customer support, best practice organizations have taken this a step further by using electronic feedback mechanisms. Research shows that best practice organizations have their customer service representatives gather ideas, perceptions, and opinions from customers and report them electronically through a corporate intranet system. These data are then coded and distributed throughout the organization, thereby centrally integrating the feedback information.", "Figure 3 shows an example of how multiple approaches can be linked, as illustrated by AT&T Universal Card Services\u2019 use of a \u201cCustomer Listening Post\u201d team."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While high-quality service to its customers is an overall goal, DLA lacks the information necessary to systematically assess the quality of service it is providing its customers with.

DLA is in the process of developing a program to improve its customer service relationships, but it currently does not have in place an effective mechanism that systematically gathers and integrates information on customer service views so that solutions can be identified to better meet their needs. The agency\u2019s current practices do not always surface these concerns, or more importantly, provide information on why they exist or how they can be corrected. To its credit, DLA is undertaking a number of initiatives to improve the effectiveness of its customer relationship improvement efforts. However, these initiatives do not completely address the limitations of its current approaches for obtaining customer feedback because DLA (1) has not yet fully determined who its customers are or how best to serve their needs; (2) has not established the means to determine the underlying causes for customer dissatisfaction in order to fully achieve its strategic goal of providing customers with the most efficient and effective worldwide logistics support; and (3) lacks a centralized, customer-driven integrated framework in which to solicit feedback from its customers.
