However, some of these efforts have been discontinued and potential savings for others are unclear. For example, in response to requirements set forth in a June 2010 presidential memorandum for agencies to achieve $3 billion in savings by the end of fiscal year 2012, the General Services Administration (GSA) reported approximately $118 million in lease cost savings resulting from four new construction projects. However, GSA has yet to occupy any of these buildings and the agency\u0092s cost savings analysis projected these savings would occur over a 30-year period\u0097far beyond the time frame of the memorandum. The five federal agencies that GAO reviewed have taken some actions to dispose of and better manage excess and underutilized property, including using these properties to meet space needs by consolidating offices and reducing employee work space to use space more efficiently. However, they still face long-standing challenges to managing these properties, including the high cost of property disposal, legal requirements prior to disposal, stakeholder resistance, and remote property locations. A comprehensive, long-term national strategy would support better management of excess and underutilized property by, among other things, defining the scope of the problem; clearly addressing achievement goals; addressing costs, resources, and investments needed; and clearly outlining roles and coordination mechanisms across agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, in consultation with FRPC, GSA develop a plan to improve the FRPP and that OMB develop a national strategy for managing federal excess and underutilized real property.

We have noted  long-standing problems with how this property is managed, designating federal real property management as a high-risk area in January 2003.In 2004, the administration added managing federal real property to the  President\u2019s Management Agenda and the President issued an executive  order establishing the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC). FRPC is  chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and is composed of all agency Senior  Real Property Officers, the Controller of OMB, the Administrator of the  General Services Administration (GSA), and any other full-time or  permanent part-time federal officials or employees as deemed necessary  by the Council Chairman. The executive order required FRPC to work  with GSA to establish and maintain a single, comprehensive database  describing the nature, use, and extent of all real property under the  custody and control of executive branch agencies, except when otherwise  required for reasons of national security.Property Profile (FRPP) to meet this requirement.", "FRPC created the Federal Real  These efforts notwithstanding, we have reported that the federal  government continues to face a number of challenges to effectively  managing its real property.  In particular, we have reported on challenges  to disposing of excess properties and making better use of properties that  are underutilized.", "In response to your request that we assess issues related to excess and  underutilized federal real property, this report addresses two objectives:  1)  the extent to which the FRPP database consistently and accurately  describes the nature, use, and extent of excess and underutilized  federal real property and  2)  the extent to which progress is being made toward more effectively  managing excess and underutilized federal real property.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed FRPP  submissions and other real property data from five civilian real property\u2013 holding agencies; interviewed real property officers at these agencies;  visited sites where the agencies had reported excess or underutilized  properties; interviewed OMB staff; and reviewed pertinent laws,  regulations, policies, and other documents related to the agencies\u2019 real  property management. The five agencies we selected for review were  GSA, the Departments of Energy (DOE), the Interior (Interior), Veterans  Affairs (VA), and Agriculture (USDA).  On the basis of the available data,  these five agencies report approximately two-thirds of the building square  footage reported by civilian agencies. We obtained answers to a set of  questions about managing excess and underutilized properties that we  posed to the senior real property officers of these five agencies. For each  agency, we also obtained fiscal year 2008, 2009, and 2010 FRPP  submissions, as well as data from each agency\u2019s internal systems that  were the source of their FRPP submissions. According to our  conversations with agency officials, FRPP submissions can be changed  only by the agency submitting the data. As a result, we believe that the  FRPP submissions obtained from the agencies match the data contained  in the FRPP database and are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  evaluating the consistency and accuracy of the corresponding data in the  FRPP database. To gather detailed examples of excess and underutilized  properties and to learn about the processes by which data on such  properties are collected and submitted to the FRPP database, we visited  a nonprobability sample of approximately 180 buildings at 26 sites   where excess or underutilized owned buildings had been reported by the  five civilian agencies. We selected sites clustered around four U.S.  cities. In selecting sites, we considered the number of excess or  underutilized buildings reported at each site and the distance of each site  from the city. Across the 26 sites, we attempted to balance the numbers  of sites and buildings selected for the five agencies, and the numbers of  excess versus underutilized buildings selected. Prior to each visit, we  analyzed data for each building and developed a set of questions about  the data submission for local property managers. During site visits, we  interviewed local property managers, compared what we observed at  each building with the FRPP data for that building, and documented what  we observed.  Where possible, we took photographs of the buildings. In  addition to this work related to the FRPP, we interviewed OMB staff  because OMB chairs FRPC, oversees the implementation of the  executive order, and has set cost savings goals related to excess and  underutilized properties.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2011 to June 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

By 2008, FRPC had expanded the  number of data elements included in the FRPP to 25.  FRPC requires  agencies to update their FRPP real property data annually.

We have reported that results-oriented organizations follow a  number of sound data collection practices when gathering the information  necessary to achieve their goals. For example, these organizations  recognize that they must balance their ideal performance measurement  systems against real world considerations, such as the cost and effort  involved in gathering and analyzing data. These organizations also tie  performance measures to specific goals and demonstrate the degree to  which the desired results are achieved. Conversely, we have observed  that organizations that seek to manage an excessive number of  performance measures may risk creating a confusing excess of data that  will obscure rather than clarify performance issues. Limiting the number of  measures to the vital few not only keeps the focus of data collection  where it belongs, it helps ensure that the costs involved in collecting and  analyzing the data do not become prohibitive. Furthermore, results- oriented organizations report on the performance data they collect.", "Following the implementation of the executive order and nationwide data  collection efforts, we have reported that agencies continue to face  challenges with managing excess and underutilized properties. For  example, we have previously reported that the legal requirements  agencies must adhere to, such as requirements for screening and  environmental cleanup as well as requirements related to historical  properties, present a challenge to consolidating federal properties. In  addition, before GSA can dispose of a property that an agency no longer  needs, it must offer the property to other federal agencies. If other federal  agencies do not need the property, GSA must then make the property  available to state and local governments as well as certain nonprofit  organizations and institutions for public benefit uses such as homeless  shelters, educational facilities, or fire and police training centers.  According to agency officials, as a result of this lengthy process, excess  or underutilized properties may remain in an agency\u2019s possession for  years. Furthermore, the costs of disposing of property can further hamper  an agency\u2019s efforts to address its excess and underutilized property  problems. For example, properties that contain radiological contamination  must be mitigated before they can be disposed. In addition, the interests  of multiple\u2014and often competing\u2014stakeholders may not align with the  most efficient use of government resources and complicate real property  decisions.", "Despite these challenges, both the previous and current administrations  have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives associated with  excess and underutilized property. In August 2005, the administration set  a goal to reduce the size of the federal inventory by $15 billion by 2009.  In June 2010, the President directed federal civilian agencies to achieve  $3 billion in savings by the end of fiscal year 2012 through reducing  annual operating costs, generating income through disposing of assets,  using existing real property more effectively by consolidating existing  space, expanding telework, and other space realignment efforts.  Furthermore, on May 4, 2011, the administration proposed legislation\u2014 referred to as the Civilian Property Realignment Act (CPRA)\u2014to establish  a legislative framework for disposing of and consolidating real property,  among other things. In September 2011, OMB projected that the  proposal would save the government $4.1 billion over 10 years from sales  proceeds, and that savings would also be achieved through decreased  operating costs and efficiencies. However, the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) has concluded that CPRA would probably not result in a  significant increase in proceeds from the sale of federal properties over  the next 10 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Excess and Underutilized Property Data Are Inconsistent and Inaccurate because of Lack of Sound Data Collection Practices", "paragraphs": ["FRPC has not followed sound data collection practices, and, as a result,  FRPP data do not describe excess and underutilized properties  consistently and accurately.

FRPC guidance states that for offices, hospitals, and  warehouses, utilization is the ratio of occupancy to current design  capacity.  Although USDA requires its agencies to follow FRPC  guidance, USDA stated that FRPC has not established governmentwide  definitions for occupancy or current design capacity.  As a result, each  agency within USDA has its own internal procedures for determining a  building\u2019s utilization level.  Moreover, VA defines utilization differently  from FRPC guidance, that is, the ratio of \u201cideal space\u201d to existing space,  which VA stated is different from occupancy.  Despite the inconsistency of  this method of defining utilization with FRPC guidance, VA officials reported that OMB staff approved of their method of reporting utilization.Furthermore, OMB acknowledged that it is standard practice for agencies  to measure utilization tailored to the agencies\u2019 specific needs and  circumstances.", "Among the 26 federal sites we visited, we found utilization data  inconsistencies or inaccuracies for properties at 19 of these sites. For  example, at one VA site, a building we toured was reported to have a  utilization of 39 percent in 2010 FRPP data and 45 percent utilization in  2011 source data, even though local officials said this building has been  fully occupied since 2008.

Another building that we toured  at the same site was reported to be 0 percent utilized in 2010 FRPP  data and 59 percent utilized in 2011 agency source data.", "However, all  but one of the rooms in the building were vacant, and local officials said  only 10 percent of the building was utilized.", "In addition, at one USDA site we visited, we found two houses that have  been empty since 2009; however, they were both reported to the FRPP  as utilized for 2009 and 2010.

We also found problems with the utilization data at  properties owned by the other three agencies included in our review.", "As was the case with utilization, we found that agencies do not report the  condition of their properties consistently. According to FRPC guidance,  condition index is a general measure of the constructed asset\u2019s condition  and is calculated by using the ratio of repair needs to the plant  replacement value (PRV). Needed repairs are determined by the  amount of repairs necessary to ensure that a constructed asset is  restored to a condition substantially equivalent to the originally intended  and designed capacity, efficiency, or capability. However, we found that  agencies do not always follow this guidance. For example, when  agencies have determined that a property is not needed and will  ultimately be disposed, they may assign no repair needs to that property  even though the property may be in a state of significant disrepair. Doing  so allows agencies to use their limited funds to maintain properties that  they regularly use, but it can lead to condition index data that do not  accurately reflect each property\u2019s condition as set forth in FRPC  guidance. Figure 3 is an example of how the condition index of a building  with high repair needs can significantly change depending on whether  agency officials choose to follow FRPC guidance or if they assign zero  dollars in repair needs because repairs are not planned.", "While it may be a good practice not to assign repair needs to dilapidated  buildings that no longer support agencies in carrying out their mission, the  fact that these buildings may report a perfect or near-perfect condition  index provide decision makers with an inconsistent representation of the  condition of buildings at a given site. We found examples at all five  agencies we visited where a property in very poor condition received a  higher condition index score than a property in good condition. Figure 4  demonstrates examples of this at an Interior site we visited.", "We found condition index reporting inconsistencies and inaccuracies at  21 of 26 sites visited. The practice of assigning no repair needs to many  excess and underutilized buildings because agencies have no intention of  repairing them led to severely blighted buildings receiving excellent  condition scores.received high condition index scores, even though they are in poor  condition.

The 2004 executive order  established FRPC to develop property management guidance and act as  a clearinghouse for property management best practices.

In 2007, we reported that adding real property  management to the President\u2019s Management Agenda in 2004 increased  its visibility as a key management challenge and focused greater attention  on real property issues across the government. As part of this agenda,  the previous administration set a goal of reducing the size of the federal  real property inventory by 5 percent, or $15 billion, by the year 2015.  OMB staff at the time reported that there was an interim goal to achieve  $9 billion of the reductions by 2009.

According to the  administration\u2019s website, as of September 2011, approximately half of the  cost savings had been achieved ($1.48 billion). Almost half of the total  goal (about $1.4 billion) is targeted to the five agencies we reviewed.  Officials from these agencies reported various cost savings measures  such as selling real property, forgoing operations and maintenance costs  from disposed properties, and reducing energy costs through  sustainability efforts to achieve agency savings targets. As of the first  quarter of fiscal year 2012, only two of the agencies we reviewed\u2014GSA  and USDA\u2014were claiming any sales proceeds from the sale of federal  real property: GSA reported $41.1 million in savings from sales proceeds  and USDA reported approximately $5.6 million. Interior officials stated  that individual sales with positive net proceeds are offset by those sales in  which the cost of the disposal (i.e., as a result of environmental  remediation and repair) is greater than any proceeds realized.  Furthermore, DOE officials reported that the disposition costs of the  properties they sold during the time frame of the memorandum were  actually greater than the proceeds. As a result, DOE has reported a net  loss of $128 million on property sales for this time period.

USDA determined that the total annual cost of maintaining  1,864 assets with annual operating costs less than $5,000 was $3 million.  Conversely, USDA concluded that the disposal costs for these assets  equals or exceeds their annual operating cost of $3 million. Thus,  disposal of the assets would not result in immediate cost savings, and  USDA has not demolished the assets. In addition, Interior officials  reported that numerous National Park Service buildings acquired during  the planning for a Delaware River dam that was never built are excess, as  are many cabins and houses along the Appalachian Trail.

The problems still facing the federal  government in this area highlight the need for a long-term,  comprehensive national strategy to bring continuity to efforts to improve  how the federal government manages its excess and underutilized real  property and improve accountability for these efforts. Such a strategy  could lay the framework for addressing the issue of inconsistent and  inaccurate data on excess and underutilized federal properties. We  continue to believe that consistent and accurate data on federal real  property are necessary for the federal government to effectively manage  real property. While the 2004 executive order charged the Administrator  of GSA, in consultation with FRPC, to develop the data reporting  standards for the FRPP database, the current standards have allowed  agencies to submit data that are inconsistent and therefore not useful as  a measure for comparing performance inside and outside the federal  government. Also, the current definitions of certain data elements could  perpetuate confusion on the nature of federal government properties. For  example, the FRPP data element, PRV, is commonly referred to as an  asset\u2019s \u201cvalue,\u201d which can cause decision makers to make assumptions  about the worth of the asset even though the PRV cannot be accurately  used in this way. Moreover, many agencies do not have the resources to  collect data at the asset level, and the information that is reported in order  to meet requirements for asset-level data is likely conveying an  inaccurate picture of excess and underutilized property. Furthermore,  federal government agencies have vastly different uses for properties,  and it may be challenging to collect certain kinds of property management  data using a single database. This makes it difficult for decision makers to  understand the scope of the problem and assess potential cost savings  and revenue generation. Now that FRPC has had several years of  experience with these data, it is in a better position to refine data  collection requirements by identifying data that are suitable for  comparison in a nationwide database. Following sound data collection  practices could help FRPC to thoroughly evaluate and retool the FRPP so  that it collects and provides data that are consistent and accurate to  decision makers, even if this means collecting less data in the short term.

We identified  five civilian real property-holding agencies for our review: the General  Services Administration (GSA); the Departments of Energy (DOE), the  Interior (Interior), and Veterans Affairs (VA); and the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA). We chose GSA, DOE, Interior, and VA because  these were the four largest agencies in terms of total building square  footage of all civilian real property agencies that are required to submit  data under the executive order. On the basis of the data available, these  five agencies report approximately two-thirds of the building square  footage reported by civilian agencies.

We obtained  the agencies\u2019 FRPP data submissions for fiscal years 2008 through 2010.   According to our conversations with agency officials, FRPP submissions  can only be changed by the agency submitting the data. As a result, we  believe that the FRPP submissions obtained from the agencies match the  data contained in the FRPP database and are sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of evaluating the consistency and accuracy of the FRPP  database. In addition, for select data elements, we obtained real property  data from the source databases that each agency uses to generate its  annual FRPP submissions. We obtained source system data to get the  actual percentage of utilization of each property as of the date when  these data were extracted and provided to us in September or October of  2011. For the years of our FRPP data review (fiscal years 2008 through  2010), agencies were only required to report utilization using four  categories: overutilized, utilized, underutilized, or not utilized. However,  the FRPP guidance stated that agencies should maintain the actual  percentage of utilization in their own systems for audit purposes.", "We posed questions to senior real property officers at the five agencies  about the collecting and reporting of real property data. To gather detailed  examples of excess and underutilized properties and to learn about the  processes by which data on such properties are collected and submitted  to the FRPP database, we visited sites where the five agencies had  reported excess or underutilized properties. We selected these sites  using information from the agencies\u2019 FRPP submissions.  To narrow our  scope, we chose only federally owned buildings for our visits. Using the  most recent FRPP submissions we had at the time (fiscal year 2010), we  selected a nonprobability sample of owned buildings for each agency that  were listed as excess (on the status indicator data element) or  underutilized (on the utilization data element), or both.

At some sites, there were too many  excess and underutilized properties to see them all. In those  circumstances, we prioritized large buildings with high reported values  and tried to see a number of different kinds of buildings (e.g., a mix of  offices and warehouses). At several sites, local property officials identified  other properties with issues related to excess and underutilized property  that we toured and analyzed.", "Prior to each site visit, we analyzed the FRPP data submissions for fiscal  years 2008 through 2010 and agencies\u2019 source system data we obtained  in September or October 2011, and developed questions about the data  submissions for local property managers. During our site visits, we  interviewed local property managers and compared what we observed at  each building with the FRPP data for that building.

Four analysts, working together, evaluated these data both  for inaccuracies (cases where the data clearly misrepresented the actual  utilization, condition, value, or annual operating costs of a property) and  for year-to-year inconsistencies (cases where reported values showed  large year-to-year changes that did not correspond to observable  changes in the property and that agency officials could not explain).

OMB stated that the agency agreed with the report\u2019s general  conclusion that challenges remain in the management of excess and  underutilized properties, but that significant progress has been made.   While we stated that limited progress has been made, our draft and  final report do not describe the progress as significant.   2.  OMB stated that the agency is concerned with some phrasing in the  report that may lead the reader to draw unintended conclusions  regarding the appropriate next steps for improving the accuracy and  consistency of the FRPP.  OMB stated that based on its  understanding of our report, our findings are based on the 26 site  visits we conducted and further study is needed to determine whether  the issues we found with the consistency and accuracy of FRPP data  are systemic.  OMB also asserts that despite our use of a non- probability sample, we make generalizations based on the sample in  the report.  As we discuss in the report and reiterated in discussions  with OMB staff during the comment period, our findings are primarily  based on the problems we found with FRPC\u2019s data collection  practices, which affect the entire data collection process.  The work  we did at 26 sample sites complement those findings and illustrate  how poor data collection practices impact data submissions, but they  are not the only basis for our conclusions. Furthermore, in its  comments, OMB acknowledged that \u201cit has been standard practice for  each agency to measure certain data elements, such as utilization,  through agency-specific means tailored to the agency\u2019s individual  needs and circumstances.\u201d  Therefore, it is unlikely, as OMB asserts,  that further study could find consistent data on properties outside of  our sample when OMB has acknowledged that the standards  themselves are inconsistent for reporting data.  For these reasons, we  believe our recommendation remains valid that GSA, in consultation  with FRPC, should first address the problems with data collection  practices, which our methodology and findings showed were in fact  systemic.  In response to OMB\u2019s comment, we clarified the report to  emphasize the basis for our findings.  3.  OMB commented that this report conflicts with previous testimonies  and our 2011 update to GAO\u2019s high-risk series which described prior  improvements.  This report acknowledges such prior progress but  provides a more in-depth review of multiple agencies\u2019 data collection  practices than prior work.  Furthermore, as our report describes, in  December 2011, changes were made to the data collection  requirements which led to further concerns by agencies about data  accuracy.  Our report findings are also consistent with a September  2011 GAO report that discussed the Department of Defense\u2019s FRPP  data.  In that report we found that the Department of Defense\u2019s  reported FRPP utilization data consisted of multiple discrepancies  between the reported utilization designations and actual building  utilization, along with other FRPP submission inaccuracies. Therefore,  this report is consistent with our prior conclusions that some progress  has been made since 2003, which we have discussed in multiple  GAO reports and testimonies.  However, the report on the Department  of Defense\u2019s data and this report demonstrated significant problems in  the data collection process.  4.  We believe that our first recommendation\u2014that OMB develop a  national strategy\u2014would assist in addressing the tension OMB  describes between providing agencies with the flexibility to define data  elements based on their agency-specific requirements and  establishing governmentwide data elements that can be used to  support aggregate analysis across the entire FRPP database.  We will  continue to engage OMB on the topic of real property management  and we believe that this report outlines the next steps.  As we  recommend in this report, a critical step is for OMB to develop a  national strategy for managing excess and underutilized properties.   In the area of data collection, a national strategy could help identify  management priorities for problems such as this and lay out the  principles for weighing the cost of uniform data collection to the  agencies with the benefit that would be obtained by aggregate  analysis of uniform data.  As we stated in the report, if certain data  elements cannot be collected consistently, they may not be  appropriate to include in a database that appears to be standard  across the government.  5.  We agree with OMB\u2019s statement that the method of attributing cost  savings to efforts made to improve property management could be  further clarified so that the public has a clear understanding of how  such savings are calculated.  We believe that transparency and  accountability are critical in the federal government\u2019s service to the  taxpayers and would support action taken by OMB to increase  transparency in this regard.  We did not make a specific  recommendation regarding how cost savings, particularly cost savings  associated with the June 2010 presidential memorandum, should be  clarified.  Our report assessed real property management issues  related to excess and underutilized property and recommended a  national strategy that could be used to guide efforts such as the June  2010 presidential memorandum.   6.  OMB stated that the report\u2019s characterization of the administration\u2019s  Civilian Property Realignment Act (CPRA) proposal could benefit from  further clarity on savings goals and further context about our recent  support for the proposal.  Regarding savings goals, OMB stated that  the administration\u2019s $4.1 billion estimate of the potential proceeds  from the Act\u2019s implementation reflects an analysis of the potential  proceeds that would result from the entire federal real property  inventory, not just those currently identified as \u201cexcess.\u201d  We  acknowledged in the report that these savings, according to OMB,  would also come from reduced operating costs and efficiencies.  We  could not, however, analyze the basis for these savings because, as  we discussed, OMB did not provide us with a methodology,  calculations, or any basis for its stated projections.  We requested this  information from OMB multiple times over a period of eight months,  and were only provided with a general description of the savings,  similar to what OMB provided in its letter commenting on this report.   Until we can evaluate the analysis OMB references, we will be unable  to provide a more thorough assessment.   Furthermore, our views on  the effect that CPRA could have on problems we have found in  federal real property management have not changed:  that CPRA can  be somewhat responsive to real property management challenges  faced by the government.  For example, CPRA proposes an  independent board that would streamline the disposal process by  selecting properties it considers appropriate for public benefit uses.  This streamlined process could reduce disposal time and costs.  7.  OMB stated that the administration has a strategy for improving the  management of federal real property that serves as an important  foundation for the national strategy we recommend in this report.   OMB stated that several significant initiatives, including the June 2010  presidential memorandum on excess property and the  recommendation for a civilian property realignment board, represent a  comprehensive and carefully considered governmentwide strategy for  addressing the government\u2019s long-term real property challenges.   While the efforts OMB describes represent a range of individual  initiatives, we continue to believe that they lack the key characteristics  of a cohesive national strategy.  A national strategy would improve the  likelihood that current initiatives to improve real property management  will be sustained across future administrations.  The desirable  characteristics of a national strategy that we\u2019ve identified\u2014such as a  clear purpose, scope, and methodology; problem definition and risk  assessment; and identified resources, investments, and risk  management\u2014could serve to articulate a more sustained, long-term  strategy to guide individual initiatives such as those described in  OMB\u2019s comments.  For example, related to resources and  investments, agencies often lack funding to prepare unneeded  properties for disposal or to pursue demolition.  A national strategy  could address this issue directly and transparently so that the true  costs of real property reform are evaluated more completely by  decision makers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  GSA stated that it is unclear whether the examples of inconsistencies  described in our report are systemic throughout the FRPP, or are  occurring in specific agencies\u2019 reporting of the data.  As we discuss in  the report, our findings are primarily based on the problems we found  with FRPC\u2019s data collection practices, which negatively impact the  entire data collection process.  The examples of inconsistencies and  inaccuracies that we describe complement those findings and  illustrate how poor data collection practices affect data submissions,  but they are not the only basis for our conclusions.  In fact, our  recommendation to improve FRPP data collection involves the sound  data collection practices that we believe should be put in place.  GSA  has agreed with this recommendation and has taken action to begin  correcting the problems we identified. In response to GSA\u2019s  comments, we made some clarifications to the report\u2019s discussion of  the basis of our findings.  2.  GSA stated that, because the FRPP is an annual report, property  utilization may change from the time it is submitted in December.  As  we conducted site visits for this review, we took steps to ensure that  any inconsistencies and inaccuracies we found were not due to a  significant change in the building\u2019s use from the time it was reported  to the time we visited.  First, we discussed the history of the building\u2019s  use with the local officials who manage the building to ensure that  there was no recent change in the building\u2019s utilization.  Second, since  2011 FRPP data had not been reported at the time we began our site  visits, we obtained utilization data from the agencies\u2019 source systems  (which are used to produce FRPP utilization data) so that we had  recent utilization data (as of the fall of 2011) before we began our site  visits in December 2011.", "GSA also stated that the condition of the buildings may change or  may not be updated annually.  Related to this issue, we found that all  five agencies did not always follow the guidance provided by the  FRPC on how to calculate condition index.  This led to severely  blighted buildings receiving excellent condition scores, which could  not be accounted for by reported changes in condition over a  relatively short period of time.  3.  GSA made a comment related to the computation formula for  Condition Index. We have clarified this statement in the report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  VA stated that its complex model for calculating utilization is  consistent with FRPC guidance because the guidance allows for  flexibility on how agencies determine a key component of utilization  (current design capacity) and that OMB agreed with their approach.   However, rather than exercising flexibility in its use of current design  capacity, VA used a different definition of utilization than the definition  outlined in FRPC guidance.  FRPC guidance defines utilization as the  ratio of occupancy to current design capacity; however, VA defines  utilization as the ratio of ideal space to existing space. While we  acknowledge in our report that VA received OMB approval for  reporting utilization differently, this method of reporting utilization is  still inconsistent with the definition of utilization in FRPC guidance.   Utilization is a performance measure and the 2004 executive order  stated that performance measures shall be designed to allow  comparing the agencies\u2019 performance against industry and other  public sector agencies.  The inconsistencies we found from VA and  other agencies in reporting utilization makes comparing utilization  among agencies impossible.  2.  VA also stated that \u201cidentifying underutilizations is much better than  ignoring the fact that the building may not be properly sized to deliver  services to Veterans.\u201d  We did not suggest that VA should ignore any  aspect of its buildings that is problematic.  We continue to believe that  VA\u2019s method of calculating utilization has led to some buildings being  continuously designated as underutilized even when local officials,  who know the buildings best, have told us that the buildings have  been fully occupied.  3.  VA stated that the reasons for the inaccuracies that we found in  utilization at two VA buildings were due to the use of these buildings  as \u201cswing space,\u201d meaning that utilization changes frequently based  on need for space.  In its comments, VA indicated that since FRPP  data are reported annually, the designation of this space at the time of  reporting changed from the time that we visited the sites.  However,  as we conducted our site visits for this review, we took steps to  ensure that any inconsistencies we found were not due to a significant  change in the building\u2019s use from the time it was reported to the time  we visited.  First, we discussed the history of the building\u2019s use since  2008 with the local officials who manage the building to ensure that  there was no recent change in the building\u2019s utilization.  Second, since  2011 FRPP data had not been reported at the time we began our site  visits, we obtained utilization data from the agencies\u2019 source systems  (which are used to produce FRPP utilization data) so that we had  recent utilization data (as of the fall of 2011).  The data we obtained  from VA were current as of October 2011 and our visit took place in  December 2011.   Based on VA\u2019s comments, we clarified this  information in our report to show that we accounted for the time  between 2010 FRPP reporting and our visit in December 2011.   Based on our visits to the buildings and our discussions about the  history of the buildings\u2019 use with the VA officials who manage them,  we do not believe that VA\u2019s explanation accounts for the  inconsistencies we found in utilization as detailed below:", "Local VA officials who manage the buildings told us that the first  building VA discussed in its comments is used for accounting and  payroll purposes and that it was always fully occupied during the  period of our review (dating back to 2008).  However, the building  was reported to the FRPP as underutilized during each of these  years.  In fact, just two months prior to our visit, VA\u2019s October  2011 source data showed a utilization of 45 percent for this  building even though it was fully occupied.", "Local VA officials who manage the second building VA discussed  in its comments told us that the building was mostly unoccupied  because they had recently acquired it from the Department of  Defense and that multiple improvements had to be made before it  could be occupied by staff.  Based on this, the local officials told  us that it could not have been utilized at 59 percent in October  2011 as VA source data indicated.   4.  VA made a comment related to individually metered buildings. We  clarified VA\u2019s statement in the report so that it is consistent with these  comments. 5.  In reference to our findings on problems with cost savings associated  with the June 2010 presidential memorandum, VA stated that it  disagreed with findings in a previous GAO report (GAO-12-305) that  we referenced.  In its comments on GAO-12-305, VA officials did not  concur with certain parts of the report related to decreasing energy  costs and improving non-recurring maintenance contracting.   However, we did not reference the previous GAO report on these  matters.  Rather, we referenced that report\u2019s discussion on savings  associated with reducing leased space through telework.  VA  confirmed the problems that the previous GAO team found with the  savings associated with the telework program in its comments on  GAO-12-305, stating that the \u201ctelework program is still in its infancy  and actual real property savings requires reducing space that is  currently leased.  These reductions in leased space may not be fully  realized in 2012.\u201d  As a result, VA stated it its comments on GAO-12- 305 that the telework initiative was removed from the description of  savings in its fiscal year 2013 budget.  This is consistent with what we  describe in this report.  Therefore, VA\u2019s restatement of its  disagreement with findings in GAO-12-305 has no bearing on this  report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David Sausville, Assistant  Director; Amy Abramowitz; Russell Burnett; Kathleen Gilhooly; Raymond  Griffith; Amy Higgins; Amber Keyser; Michael Mgebroff; John Mingus Jr.;  Joshua Ormond; Amy Rosewarne; Minette Richardson; Sandra Sokol;  and Elizabeth Wood made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
