The regulators also conducted training on CRE treatment for examiners and internal reviews to help ensure compliance with CRE guidance. Nevertheless, a number of banks reported that examiners have been applying guidance more stringently since the financial crisis and believe that they have been too harsh in treatment of CRE loans. Regulators have incorporated lessons learned from the crisis into their supervision approach, which may help explain banks' experiences of increased scrutiny. GAO found that examiners generally provided support for exam findings on loan workouts, but identified some inconsistencies in applying the 2006 CRE concentration guidance-- which is similar to what some of the regulators uncovered in their internal reviews. Moreover, regulatory officials had varying views on the adequacy of the 2006 guidance, and some examiners and bankers noted that the guidance lacked clarity on how to comply with it. As a result, examiners and bankers may not have a common understanding about CRE concentration risks. Although many factors influence banks' lending decisions, research shows that the capital banks hold is a key factor. Capital provides an important cushion against losses, but if a bank needs to increase it, the cost of raising capital can raise the cost of providing loans. High CRE concentrations also can limit a bank's ability to lend because the bank may need to raise capital to mitigate the concentration risk during a downturn. Economic research on the effect of regulators' examination practices on banks' lending decisions is limited, but shows that examiners' increased scrutiny during credit downturns can have a small impact on overall lending. Although isolating these impacts is difficult, the recent severe cycle of credit upswings followed by the downturn provides a useful reminder of the balance needed in bank supervision to help ensure the banking system can support economic recovery. Federal banking regulators should enhance or supplement the 2006 CRE concentration guidance and take steps to better ensure that such guidance is consistently applied. The Federal Reserve and OCC agreed with the recommendations. FDIC said that it had implemented strategies to supplement the 2006 guidance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The financial crisis, and the economic downturn that followed it, largely  arose out of problems related to the residential mortgage sector, but the  commercial real estate (CRE) market also has experienced significant  setbacks, that in turn, have affected community banks. More than a third  of community bank lending is tied to CRE, and delinquencies for such  loans have more than doubled since 2008. While segments of the CRE  market have shown some improvement, problems in CRE lending are  expected to continue, and refinancing such loans could present further  challenges to the market in coming years. Banks are addressing these  problems in many ways, including modifying borrowers\u2019 loan terms so that  they can continue to make payments, increasing bank capital and reserves  as protection against future losses, and, in some cases, reducing lending.  However, reduced lending to creditworthy borrowers can exacerbate  credit tightening and inhibit economic recovery.", "The federal banking regulators have been monitoring the increasing CRE  concentrations for a number of years and have responded to the current  CRE downturn and its impact on the banks they supervise.

We reviewed CRE-related reports from the Congressional  Oversight Panel, Congressional Research Service, FDIC, Federal Reserve,  and academic journals, and conducted interviews with bank examiners,  regulatory officials, and community bankers. We also examined material  loss reviews (MLR) conducted by the inspectors general (IG) of the bank  regulators and previous GAO products. To understand how FDIC, the  Federal Reserve, and OCC have responded to the CRE downturn, we  collected and analyzed regulatory guidance related to CRE loan treatment  and interagency statements on lending, and also assessed regulatory  efforts to address CRE-related concerns.

For our bank official interviews, we  contacted 62 banks and spoke with all 21 that responded to us based on a  nonprobability sample of banks in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, and  Texas. We chose those states because banks in the first two states have  had a relatively greater share of CRE-related nonperforming loans (as  measured by the percentage of CRE loans past due or on nonaccrual) and  banks in the last two a relatively smaller share. From these states, we  selected banks that had a federal bank regulator examination after  October 2009; elevated concentrations in CRE; or elevated concentrations  in acquisition, development, and construction (ADC) loans. This sampling  approach also was used to select the 55 ROEs for analysis. Our sample is  not designed to be generalizable to all banks, but instead provides  information on a range of banks working under different supervisors,  having different conditions, and operating in different economic  environments. For our bank official interviews, we supplemented the  sample by interviewing officials from 22 additional banks that testified  before Congress on the issue of CRE, were identified through bank  associations, or requested an interview after learning about our work.", "To understand examiners\u2019 practices and views on certain regulatory  measures, especially on the CRE loan workout guidance, we spoke with  regulatory staff at district, regional, and field offices in California,  Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Texas, and in headquarters at  Washington, D.C.

As we have identified in previous work, financial  regulation more broadly has sought to achieve four goals: to (1) ensure  adequate consumer protections, (2) ensure the integrity and fairness of  markets, (3) monitor the safety and soundness of institutions, and (4) act  to ensure the stability of the overall financial system. Federal banking  regulators use a number of tools to achieve these goals.", "Capital requirements: Regulators require banks to maintain certain  minimum capital requirements to help ensure the safety and soundness of  the banking system, and generally expect banks to hold capital above  these minimums\u2014commensurate with their risks. Capital provides an  important cushion against losses for banks, and represents the amount of  money that can cover losses the bank may face related to nonpayment of  loans and other losses on assets. Capital can be measured as total capital  or tier 1 capital. Regulators oversee the capital adequacy of their  regulated institutions through ongoing monitoring, including on-site  examinations and off-site tools. When regulators require banks to hold  capital above regulatory minimums, these requirements may result from  an enforcement action through an agreement between the regulator and  the bank. However, requiring banks to hold more capital may reduce the  availability of bank credit and reduce returns on equity to shareholders.", "Examinations and ratings: Federal banking laws and regulatory  guidance require on-site examinations, which serve to evaluate a bank\u2019s  overall risk exposure and its ability to identify and manage those risks\u2014 especially as they affect a bank\u2019s financial health. At each full-scope  examination, examiners review the bank\u2019s risk exposure on a number of  components using what is known as the CAMELS rating system (Capital  adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity  to market risk). Evaluations of CAMELS components consider the  institution\u2019s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its  activities, and its risk profile. In examinations, a bank is rated for each of  the CAMELS components and given a composite rating, which generally  bears a close relationship to the component ratings. However, the  composite is not an average of the component ratings. The component  rating and the composite ratings are scored on a scale of 1 (best) to 5  (worst). Regulatory actions typically correspond to the composite  CAMELS ratings, with the actions generally increasing in severity as the  ratings become worse.

CRE loans in which the primary  source of repayment is not the property itself are called owner-occupied  loans and can include loans to businesses for working capital purposes  that use real estate as collateral. For example, a line of credit for a  business\u2019s operating expenses might be secured in part by commercial  property, such as an office.", "Owner-occupied properties generally are considered to carry less risk than  non-owner-occupied properties because regulators consider them to be  less sensitive to the condition of the CRE market. In ADC loans, also  called construction and land development (CLD) loans, generally are  considered to be the riskiest class of CRE, due to their long development  times and because they can include properties (such as housing  developments or retail space in a shopping mall) that are built before  having firm commitments from buyers or lessees. In addition, by the time  the construction phase is completed, market demand may have fallen,  putting downward pressure on sales prices or rents\u2014making this type of  loan more volatile.

This volatility and cyclical behavior is attributed to  characteristics such as information-gathering difficulties, infrequent  transactions, high transaction costs, rigid and constrained supply, long  construction times, and a two-fold reliance on external finance (shorter- term to cover construction, and longer-term for the occupancy period).  Additionally, CRE is by nature diverse and localized. For example,  shopping centers are one type of CRE, but even within this category  properties can have significant differences depending on design, types of  tenants, and other factors that can affect their value. Because of these  factors, the supply of CRE in the marketplace is slow to respond to an  increase in demand, which drives prices up when investor optimism rises.  Conversely, the marketplace is slow to respond when the market supply of  CRE catches up and new construction projects are delivered, resulting in  oversupply and declining property values. According to regulatory  officials, the weakness in the ADC sector during this crisis was primarily  due to residential housing construction, and that weakness affected the  performance of other areas of CRE (for example, failed residential housing  developments will affect the ability of nearby strip malls to attract and  generate rental income from tenants).", "The recent downturn in the CRE markets can be seen in the market values  for commercial property and the condition of the commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) market.

Overall  deterioration in CRE markets can be found in the condition of the CMBS  market as well. By January 2011, the delinquency rate on loans included in  CMBS was at a record high, above 9 percent. As we have reported, overall  CMBS issuance slowed severely since the CRE downturn started. After  peaking in 2007, the CMBS market came to a complete halt by the end of  2008.", "Although CRE market price deterioration appears to have leveled off  recently, vacancies at many properties remain high and signs of a market  recovery have been uneven in different areas of the country. High-value  properties in markets such as New York, Washington, San Francisco, and  Boston have performed well more recently. But low rental rates and high  vacancies indicate that demand for office, retail, multifamily housing, and  warehouse space remains relatively weak. Furthermore, although CRE  markets nationally have experienced a downturn, some regions have  experienced more distress than others.

During the last decade, large banks and other financial  institutions increased their market share for consumer loans, credit cards,  and residential mortgages. As a result, community banks shifted their  focus to CRE lending. Some market observers argue that community  banks\u2019 focus on CRE lending, and, therefore, the long-term trend of  increased CRE concentrations, came about because community banks  generally know their local CRE markets better than larger banks and are  well-positioned to gather location-specific information for CRE properties.", "The increased exposure of community banks to CRE loans has been  pronounced over the last 10\u201315 years. While CRE collateral backed about  30 percent of total loans and leases at community banks in 2000, a decade  later that rate increased to more than 43 percent. Concentrations have  been less pronounced at larger banks, which tend to rely less heavily on  CRE lending. Since 2000, CRE as a percent of total loans and leases has  ranged from about 15 percent to about 21 percent at commercial banks  with more than $1 billion in total assets.", "Community banks also have come to hold large concentrations of CRE  loans in comparison to their total capital. The average CRE concentration  at community banks as a percentage of total risk-based capital increased  from about 168 percent in 1996\u20132000 to about 289 percent in 2005\u20132010  (see fig. 2).", "Increased exposure to CRE has made community banks vulnerable to the  decline of this market.

This means that nearly a third of community banks are  exposing three times their total capital to risks related to their CRE loans.

Conversely, increases in collateral values lower  the premium on external financing\u2014improving credit availability for  borrowers, boosting demand for real estate assets, and driving up prices.  Therefore, falling property prices can generate a cycle of declining CRE  values because they can accompany reduced credit.

CRE loans usually are written  for 3\u201310 years, with a 20\u201330 year amortization schedule and a balloon  payment at the end. Instead of making the large balloon payment, the  borrower typically will sell the property or refinance the loan at the end of  the term. Small businesses that are looking to refinance a loan against a  property that has lost a significant amount of market value may have to  put up more equity. Alternatively, such borrowers might default on the  loan, or the bank could work with the borrower to restructure the loan  and avoid default.

The  purpose of such analysis is to determine whether they have sufficient  income and liquid assets to support loan payments. In some cases, such  analysis shows that a borrower is unable to pay the loan, even if the  borrower is currently paying.

However, regulatory officials told us  that examiners do not classify loans solely because of a lack of financial  statements, but a lack of such statements combined with other  weaknesses could provide sufficient support for classifying a loan.

ROEs in our sample that comment broadly on banks\u2019 CRE  loan workouts tend to cite areas for improvement (20 of 27). Examiner  concerns include that the bank management or its board could have better  identified, monitored, or tracked problem loan workouts, and therefore  better identified loans that should have been reported as TDRs.  Improvements to managing loan workouts that examiners cited include (1)  reporting on current loan status and related developments (such as  periodic analysis of the borrower\u2019s financial situation); (2) creating and  tracking benchmarks to measure workout progress; (3) providing the  rationale for loan grades related to loan workouts; and (4) updating  collateral values (as appropriate). Almost half of the ROEs in our sample  that raise concerns related to CRE loan workouts (8 of 20) specifically  note concerns about the nature of banks\u2019 loan workouts.

The procyclical effects of regulation may not adequately  discourage overly risky behavior during economic upswings or may inhibit  bank lending during downturns, as banks may need to meet more stringent  requirements during times when it is more difficult to do so. For instance,  if regulators increase capital requirements at the same time that losses  from an economic downturn decrease banks\u2019 capital, banks may be less  able to lend while they seek to rapidly raise additional capital. This can  exacerbate downswings in credit cycles.", "Consistent and balanced application of policy guidance in strong and weak  economic times is important to avoiding unnecessary procyclical effects.  Regulatory efforts to better ensure that guidance is applied consistently  during strong and weak economic periods helps to ensure that regulatory  policies do not exacerbate economic upturns or downturns. While  bankers with whom we spoke understood why examiners were looking  more closely at CRE loans given the market\u2019s downturn, a few said the  shift to closer review and attention was a difficult adjustment. Bank  examiners with whom we spoke in the field offices also noted that  problems can be difficult to identify during strong economic times.", "Discussions about the procyclicality of regulation have been a central  feature of recent deliberations on revised capital requirements among U.S.  banking regulators and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision. The  discussions have been seeking to address the procyclical effects of capital  requirements by having banks raise additional capital, commensurate with  risks, during times of economic growth. In December 2010, the Basel  Committee released the framework for Basel III, which includes increased  and higher-quality capital requirements, enhanced risk coverage, the  establishment of a leverage ratio as a \u201cbackstop\u201d to the risk-based  requirement, steps to encourage the \u201cbuild up\u201d of capital that can be used  to absorb losses during \u201cperiods of stress,\u201d and the introduction of two  global liquidity standards. As part of the establishment of procedures to  help ensure the consistent global application of this framework, the Basel  Committee has developed standards that will be implemented gradually so  that banks make the shift to higher capital and liquidity standards while  \u201csupporting lending to the economy.\u201d", "Federal bank regulators also have acknowledged the importance of  addressing procyclicality in regulatory requirements and have made efforts  in this regard. For example, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve has  stated the importance of regulators acknowledging the significance of  procyclicality and he has noted that both the Basel Committee and the  Financial Stability Forum have worked to address this as it relates to  capital requirements. In addition, FASB has issued accounting guidance  aimed at changes to mark-to-market accounting for assessing asset values  in inactive markets. More recently, in May 2010, FASB released a proposed  Accounting Standards Update, which encompassed proposals on the  impairment of financial assets and suggested implementing a more  forward-looking impairment model. Based on exposure draft comments,  in January 2011 FASB proposed with the International Accounting  Standards Board a common solution on how to account for the  impairment of financial assets and presented the document for public  comment. Efforts such as these seek to address procyclicality concerns  related to capital and accounting requirements, while the potential  procyclical effects of examiners\u2019 application of policy guidance is  something regulators consider in their supervision of banks, according to  regulatory officials with whom we spoke. The recent financial crisis  underscored how important it is for regulators to evenly apply guidance  during strong economic periods, although this was not always the case, as  previously noted. Consistent application of guidance is important to avoid  unduly hampering credit provision throughout the economy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CRE still is working through a downturn sparked by the broader financial  crisis, presenting an ongoing challenge to community banks and  regulators. While community banks have been working through the  challenges associated with many years of past growth in CRE  concentrations, CRE portfolios continue to have a significant effect on  community bank balance sheets as loan delinquencies and charge-offs  remain historically high. Community banks continue to seek ways to work  with their borrowers and shore up capital to remain solvent, but the  current economic environment and the expectation that refinancing of  CRE loans will bring a new round of market stress suggest many  community banks may face these challenges for some time. And, because  community banks tend to provide a greater proportion of their loans to  small businesses, the availability of credit to small businesses could be  constrained while community banks work through these difficulties.", "Prior to the financial crisis, regulators\u2019 efforts included guidance on CRE  concentrations and risk management, but these efforts were not as robust  as they could have been in addressing CRE risks. Since the financial crisis,  the shift in examination focus and differences in the application of the  CRE concentration guidance has contributed to concerns among  community banks about regulatory stringency. That is, a number of  bankers remain concerned that regulators have become more stringent in  reviewing CRE loans since the crisis, which could be explained partly by  regulators re-emphasizing fundamentals and addressing lessons learned  from the crisis. While we and the regulators have reviewed examiner  application of the CRE guidance and generally found examiners\u2019 actions  were accurate or well-supported, some inaccuracies and inconsistencies  were evident\u2014particularly relating to the 2006 guidance. Regulators have  mixed views about the adequacy of the 2006 guidance. Our findings from  an analysis of ROEs were similar to those of the regulators\u2019 internal  reviews and assessments, which raised questions about the consistency of  policy guidance application. Given these findings, and in light of lessons  learned from the recent financial crisis and CRE market downturn, the  regulators could reassess the adequacy of the guidance. Revising or  supplementing the guidance to provide more details about risk- management practices and examples of when to reduce CRE  concentrations would help both examiners and bankers better understand  how to assess and manage such concentrations. Furthermore,  incorporating CRE-specific analyses into the scope of internal and quality  assurance reviews\u2014at least while CRE issues remain a concern\u2014will help  ensure consistent application of the guidance and produce clearly  articulated support in examination reports for requiring reduced  concentrations. In this way, regulatory management can better ensure that  examination practices related to CRE concentrations and risks will be  carried out consistently from examiner to examiner and across regulators.  Consistent treatment also will make clear to banks what regulatory  expectations are for managing CRE concentration risks.", "Given the key role community banks play in business lending, bank  regulators are aware of the potential effects of their actions in  exacerbating the credit cycle. Many factors can affect a bank\u2019s decision to  lend, including regulatory requirements. But if such requirements are too  stringent, they can unduly limit lending. Such limits on lending can have  widespread effects on the economy, as acknowledged in Basel Committee  for Banking Supervision discussions on capital requirements.

As  noted in our report, the federal banking regulators all have numerous  controls to help ensure examination consistency, such as training and  internal reviews that FDIC highlights in its letter. Nonetheless, our review  of ROEs from all three regulators, and their own internal reviews,  uncovered instances of inconsistency in the treatment of CRE loans and  application of the 2006 CRE guidance\u2014demonstrating that no regulator  was immune from consistency issues. We also noted in our report some  concerns raised by bank examiners and bankers about applying the 2006  guidance, such as whether the current CRE concentration thresholds are  hard limits, how the CRE concentrations should be calculated, and  whether specific amounts of additional capital should be required for  banks with elevated CRE concentrations. Though FDIC provided  clarification on CRE risk management in March 2008 that could contribute  to interagency action on CRE guidance, this guidance does not address all  of the concerns raised more recently by examiners and bankers that we  describe in the report, nor was it developed in conjunction with the other  regulators. Therefore, we continue to believe that our recommendations  on enhanced or clarified CRE concentration guidance\u2014on an interagency  basis that involves the FDIC\u2014would help bankers and examiners better  understand how to comply with CRE risk management requirements and  help ensure the consistent application of such requirements.", "FDIC also cited a study by the Bank for International Settlements that  concluded the social benefits of higher bank capital requirements  outweigh the large reductions in economic activity from a banking  collapse.

In this simplified example, the bank begins with  $1,000 in assets ($1,010 in loans and $10 in ALLL), $900 in liabilities, and  $100 in capital, which equates to a total capital ratio of 10 percent  (calculated by dividing total capital by total assets). In this example the  bank has analyzed the collectibility of its loans and decided to add $20 to  its ALLL in anticipation of loan losses. Provisions for these losses increase  the ALLL, which in turn are charged to the bank\u2019s expenses, reduce  income, and therefore reduce retained earnings that are included as part  of total capital. As a result, the capital ratio falls to 8.2 percent. If the bank  identifies as uncollectible and charges off a $20 loan that it holds as an  asset, given the assumptions in the example, the bank\u2019s total loans and  ALLL would each decline by $20 with no change in capital.

If the bank cannot raise additional capital because it is  in poor financial condition, or chooses not to because the cost of capital is  prohibitive, then it could, among other options, reduce its assets (perhaps  by selling assets such as other real estate owned) to decrease liabilities or  by paying off borrowings to increase the capital ratio. Reducing assets is  often referred to as \u201cshrinking the balance sheet.\u201d However, banks in  better financial condition may be able to respond differently in the face of  loan losses\u2014they may be able to continue lending without raising  additional capital or can rely on their stronger financial position to secure  new capital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Kay Kuhlman, Assistant Director, and Robert Lee, Analyst-in-Charge,  managed this review.
