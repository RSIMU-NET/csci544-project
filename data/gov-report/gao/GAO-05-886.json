Also, Labor has focused in recent years on registering new programs and recruiting apprentices. Although Labor collects much data about the programs it oversees, it has not employed its database to generate information indicative of program performance, such as completion rates, that might allow it to be more efficient in its oversight. Labor does not regularly review council-monitored states or collect data from them that would allow for a national picture of apprenticeships. Labor is responsible for conducting formal reviews of the 27 states and the District of Columbia that established apprenticeship councils to monitor their own apprenticeship programs; but, according to directors in these states, the reviews have been infrequent and not necessarily useful. While Labor collects only aggregate data on apprentices from these states, we identified 10 states with large numbers of apprentices that were willing and capable of providing GAO data on apprentices by occupation as well as some information on completion rates, completion times, and wages. Data in Labor's apprenticeship database and from council-monitored states show that completion rates and wages for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions were higher than those for programs sponsored by employers alone. We found that completion rates for apprentices in programs jointly sponsored by unions and employers were 47 percent on average compared with 30 percent in programs sponsored solely by employers.

The National Registered Apprenticeships  System, administered by the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer  and Labor Services (OATELS) within the Department of Labor, has an  important role in the development of this skilled workforce. With a budget  of $21 million, OATELS promulgates standards to safeguard the welfare of  apprentices and registers apprenticeship programs that meet those  standards, which include requirements for related instruction, on-the-job  training, and equal employment opportunity for apprentices. OATELS also  oversees apprenticeship programs to ensure that they provide quality  training for apprentices, as many as 480,000 of whom may be enrolled at  any one time. Labor, through OATELS, directly registers and oversees  programs in 23 states. It has granted 27 other states, the District of  Columbia, and 3 territories authority to register and oversee their own  programs, and ensures programs comply with federal standards and meet  additional state standards. In these states, referred to here as council- monitored states, OATELS reviews the activities of the apprenticeship  councils that are responsible for ensuring programs in their state comply  with federal labor standards and equal opportunity protections. While  Labor and apprenticeship councils provide oversight, recent studies have  shown that a significant number of construction apprentices are not  completing their programs and that construction programs sponsored by  employers without union participation have lower completion rates and  wages for apprentices. In addition, some have raised concerns that the  failure to complete programs could be indicative of poor program quality.  The anticipated shortage of skilled construction workers has heightened  concerns about the relationship between program outcomes and program  quality, the prospect for expanding the supply of skilled workers through  apprenticeships, and Labor\u2019s oversight of these programs.", "In view of these concerns, you asked us to review the extent of federal  oversight of apprenticeship programs in general and compare  apprenticeship outcomes in the construction industry by type of program  sponsorship. Specifically, we assessed (1) the extent to which the  U.S. Department of Labor monitors the operations and outcomes of  registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct  oversight, (2) its oversight activities for council-monitored states, and   (3) the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored  jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by  employers alone.", "To obtain national information on Labor\u2019s monitoring and oversight  activities, we surveyed all state directors of apprenticeship training  programs through electronic questionnaires posted on the World Wide  Web. We excluded the three territories\u2014Guam, Puerto Rico, and the  Virgin Islands\u2014from our analyses because the few programs they had  were atypical. We also visited four states, both federal (Texas) and  council-monitored (California, New York, and Washington), that had large  numbers of construction apprentices (from about 52,000 to 6,500). In these  states, we talked to knowledgeable officials, private-sector experts and  stakeholders, including employer and labor union sponsors of  apprenticeship programs. In some cases, we visited apprentice training  facilities. To determine completion rates, times to completion, and wage  rates for apprentices, we analyzed data in Labor\u2019s apprenticeship database  for the fiscal years 1994 through 2004. In calculating completion rates, we  constructed five cohorts based on when apprentices enrolled in a  program\u20141994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998\u2014and established their  completion status 6 years after they enrolled. These analyses included data  on programs in 23 states where Labor has direct oversight and programs in  8 council-monitored states. In addition, we obtained comparable data on  construction programs from 10 council-monitored states that have large  numbers of construction apprentices and were able to provide this  information. The 41 states for which we had some type of data accounted  for an estimated 92 percent of all construction apprentices. We also  interviewed Labor officials and other knowledgeable parties.

The responsibility for formulating and promoting these  standards resides with OATELS. OATELS had a staff of about 176 full-time  equivalencies and an annual appropriation of about $21 million in 2004. In  addition, because of budgetary constraints, OATELS officials do not  expect resources to increase. At the national level, OATELS can register  and deregister apprenticeship programs (i.e., give or take away federal  recognition), issue nationally recognized, portable certificates to  individuals who have completed registered programs, plan appropriate  outreach activities targeted to attract women and minorities, and promote  new apprenticeship programs to meet workforce needs. In addition to this  national role, OATELS directly oversees individual apprenticeship  programs in 23 states. In these states, the director for the state\u2019s  apprenticeship system and other program staff are federal employees who  monitor individual apprenticeship programs for quality and their provision  of equal opportunity.", "Labor can give authority to states to oversee their own apprenticeship  programs if the state meets certain requirements. Labor has given this  authority to 27 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories. In  these states, which we refer to as council-monitored, the federal  government is not responsible for monitoring individual apprenticeship  programs; instead, the state is. It does so through state apprenticeship  councils. OATELS does, however, conduct two types of reviews to  determine how well the state fulfills its responsibilities. Quality reviews  determine, in part, conformance with prescribed federal requirements  concerning state apprenticeship laws, state council composition, and  program registration, cancellation and deregistration provisions. Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) reviews assess the conformity of state  EEO plans, affirmative action activities, record-keeping procedures, and  other activities with federal EEO regulations. In addition to these reviews,  OATELS may also provide state agencies with federal staff to assist in day- to-day operations.", "The number and type of construction apprenticeship programs are  distributed differently across federally- and council-monitored states.  Council-monitored states not only have more programs, but these  programs are more likely to be jointly sponsored by employers and unions  than sponsored by employers alone. On average, a construction  apprenticeship program in federally-monitored states trains about   17 apprentices and in council-monitored states trains about 20. Beyond  this average, it\u2019s important to note that there can be great variation among  programs, with some having over 400 participants and others 1 or 2.   Figure 1 identifies states where programs are federally- and council- monitored.", "Both the federal and council-monitored states collect data on the  individual programs they oversee. Labor maintains a large database called  the Registered Apprenticeship Information System (RAIS) and collects  information about individual programs, apprentices, and sponsors for  apprenticeships in the 23 states where it has direct oversight and in   8 council-monitored states that have chosen to report into this system. The  other council-monitored states, 20 in total, maintain their own data and  collect various pieces of information on apprenticeship systems. Labor  does collect aggregate data on apprentices and programs from these  states.", "In all states, individuals can enter the construction trades without  completing formal apprenticeship programs, but many construction  workers, particularly those working in highly skilled occupations that  require extensive training, such as the electrical, carpentry, and plumbing  trades, receive their training though registered apprenticeship programs.  To complete their programs, apprentices must meet requirements for on- the-job training and classroom instruction that must meet the minimum  standards for the trade as recognized by Labor or the state apprenticeship  council. Programs in some trades, for example, commercial electricity,  may take 5 years to complete but programs to train laborers may only take  a year. Beginning apprentices\u2019 wages generally start at about 40 percent of  the wage of someone certified in a particular trade and rise to about   90 percent of that wage near completion.

As a result, it lacks  information that would allow it to identify poorly performing programs  and adjust its oversight accordingly.

Federal apprenticeship directors in  these states reported they conducted 379 quality reviews in 2004, covering  only about 4 percent of the programs under their watch. These reviews are  done to determine, for example, whether sponsors have provided related  instruction and on-the-job training hours in accordance with the standards  for the program and whether wages reflected actual time in the program.  The number of reviews conducted varied across states. On average,   22 quality reviews per state were conducted, but one director reported  conducting as many as 67 reviews while another reported conducting no  reviews at all. In addition, programs in council-monitored states were  almost twice as likely as programs in federally-monitored states to have  been reviewed within 3 years. (See fig. 2.) Several federal officials said  over the past several years they had placed primary emphasis on  registering new programs and recruiting more apprentices, particularly in  nontraditional areas such as childcare and health. In addition, they told us  it was not possible to do more reviews in part because of limited staff.", "In addition to having fewer reviews, apprenticeships in federally- monitored states had fewer staff dedicated to monitoring activities than  council-monitored states. In 2004, each staff person in a federally  monitored state was responsible, on average, for about 2,000 apprentices,  according to federal program directors; to put this in context, case loads  of monitors in federally-monitored states were almost twice as large as  those in council-monitored states. In federally-monitored states, on  average there were about 2.5 staff to monitor programs, less than one-third  the average in council-monitored states. Labor\u2019s practice of assigning  federal staff to monitor programs in 18 of the council-monitored states  rather than to programs in federally-monitored states compounded  differences in staff resources. Directors in council-monitored states  reported that at least two federal employees, on average, monitored  programs in their jurisdiction. As important as the number of staff, is how  they spent their time. About a half of the staff in federally-monitored states  spent 40 percent or more of their time in the field performing monitoring,  oversight, and providing related technical assistance, according to federal  program directors whereas one-half of the staff in council-monitored  states spent about 70 percent or more in the field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Labor Collects Much Information about Apprenticeship Programs, It Does Not Systematically Use Data to Focus Its Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Although Labor collects information to compute completion rates and  track participants who do not complete programs in the time expected, it  does not use these data to focus its oversight efforts on programs with  poor performance.

In the absence  of performance information, directors and staff in federally-monitored  states reported that a variety of factors dictated which programs to review.  These included size, newness, location, date of the last review, sponsor\u2019s  cooperativeness, as well as the location of staff resources.", "In addition to not using program data to target reviews, Labor has not  collected and consistently entered into its database information about why  apprentices cancel out of programs, although its database was designed to  include such information and having it could help target reviews. Officials  told us that voluntary cancellation or transfers to another program were at  times associated with program quality, while other nonvoluntary reasons,  such as illness or military service, were not. Currently, recording the  reason for an apprentice\u2019s cancellation in the database is an optional field.  We found that no reason was recorded for 60 percent of the cancellations  and the remaining 40 percent did not effectively capture the reasons for  leaving.

For journey-level wages there was only one trade for which wages were  higher for non-joint apprentices\u2014that of millwright. Officials we spoke  with commonly attributed this distinction in wages to the bargaining  process associated with joint programs. Data from the 10 additional states  (outside Labor\u2019s database) whose data we examined showed a similar  pattern\u2014with joint apprentices earning higher wages. (See app. II.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As a small program with finite resources tasked with an important  mission, it is incumbent on Labor\u2019s Apprenticeship Office to leverage the  tools at its disposal to carry out its oversight, all the more so during a  period of tight budgets. Labor\u2019s responsibility for assuring that registered  apprenticeship programs meet appropriate standards is no small charge,  given the thousands of programs in operation today. In terms of the  programs it directly monitors, Labor has not made optimal use of the  information it collects to target resources. The failure to do so limits the  agency\u2019s ability to target its oversight activities to address and remedy  areas where there may be significant need, particularly the construction  trades where completion rates are declining. Underscoring this point is the  fact that apprenticeship directors in federally-monitored states cannot get  easy access to the data in the form of customized reports. Irrespective of  distinctions between apprentice outcomes for joint and non-joint  programs, without better use of its data, Labor is still not in a position to  assess programs on their individual merits. Given the relatively limited  number of staff available for field visits, by not using the program data it  has, Labor misses opportunities to more efficiently use its staff.", "With regard to states with council-monitored apprenticeship programs,  Labor\u2019s oversight practices do not necessarily ensure that those states\u2019  activities comply with federal standards for oversight because the  Apprenticeship Office has only sporadically assessed their operations.  Moreover, to the extent that the federal office does not provide useful  feedback to the states when it does conduct reviews, states may lose  opportunities to improve programs under their jurisdiction. Finally,  because Labor does not seek much information beyond aggregate  numbers from a majority of council-monitored states, policymakers lose  an opportunity to gain perspective and insight for aligning workforce  training with national needs, specifically for key occupations within  construction that are likely to be faced with shortages of skilled workers  in the near future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Labor take steps to (1) better utilize  information in Labor\u2019s database, such as indicators of program  performance, for management oversight, particularly for apprenticeship  programs in occupations with expected future labor shortages; (2) develop  a cost-effective strategy for collecting data from council-monitored states;  (3) conduct Labor\u2019s reviews of apprenticeship activities in states that  regulate their own programs on a regular basis to ensure that state  activities are in accord with Labor\u2019s requirements for recognition of  apprenticeship programs; and (4) offer substantive feedback to states from  its reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor for review  and comment.

We used two  surveys\u2014one for federally- monitored states and one for council- monitored states\u2014to obtain national information on OATELS\u2019 monitoring  and oversight activities. We focused only on apprentices in the civilian  sector of the economy and did not include military or prison-based  programs. We asked questions designed to determine the amount of  resources devoted to oversight, the frequency of oversight activities, and  the outcomes from these activities. The surveys were conducted using  self-administered electronic questionnaires posted on the World Wide  Web. We pretested our surveys with a total of five federally-monitored and  council-monitored state officials to determine if the surveys were  understandable and if the information was feasible to collect. We then  refined the questionnaire as appropriate. We sent e-mail notifications to all  federally-monitored and council-monitored state officials on January 5,  2005. We then sent each potential respondent a unique password and  username by e-mail on January 13, 2005, to ensure that only members of  the target population could participate in the appropriate survey. To  encourage respondents to complete the surveys, we sent e-mail messages  to prompt each nonrespondent approximately 1\u00bd weeks after the initial   e-mail message and a final e-mail reminder on February 7, 2005. We also  called nonrespondents to encourage them to complete the survey. We  closed the surveys on March 18, 2005. We received responses from all   23 federally-monitored and 27 of 28 council-monitored state officials  including the District of Columbia. (See table 2.) Copies of the surveys are  provided in appendices III and IV.", "To examine the outcomes for apprentices in the construction industry, we  analyzed data from Labor\u2019s RAIS database. In calculating completion rates,  we constructed five cohorts based on when they enrolled in their  programs; we had cohorts for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.  We then considered the status of these cohorts 6 years after they enrolled  to determine if they had completed, cancelled, or remained in training. Our  analysis of wage data focused on data collected in fiscal year 2004, the first  full year that Labor began collecting such information. We assessed the  reliability of the RAIS database by reviewing relevant information on the  database, interviewing relevant OATELS officials, and conducting our own  testing of the database. This testing included examining the completeness  of the data, performing data reliability checks, and assessing the internal  controls of the data. Based on this information and our analysis, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report.", "Because Labor\u2019s RAIS database does not contain data from all states, we  supplemented these data with data from 10 council-monitored states that  do not report to this database. We selected these states based on the  number of apprentices they had and whether their data were in an  electronic format that would facilitate extracting and sending these data to  us. We submitted a data request that asked for selected information on  enrollment, completion, and wages for the 10 largest apprenticeship  occupations to these states and received data from all of them. We  determined that these data were reliable for our purposes. We did not  combine these data with those from RAIS; we used them as a means of  comparison.", "To learn more about the oversight of apprenticeship programs and their  outcomes, we conducted site visits to four states\u2014New York, California,  Texas, and Washington. These states represented both federal and council- monitored states and had large numbers (from a high of about 52,000 to a  low of 6,500) of construction apprentices. On these site visits, we  interviewed relevant federal and state officials along with joint and non- joint program sponsors. We also toured facilities in two states where  certain apprentices are trained.", "Throughout the engagement we interviewed relevant Labor officials and  experts that have researched apprenticeship programs and reviewed  relevant past reports and evaluations of these programs.
