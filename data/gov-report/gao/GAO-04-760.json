The degree of coverage on some reporting requirements was limited to avoid prejudging the ongoing analytical process for the 2005 round. As directed, GAO analyzed DOD's worldwide installation inventory, force structure plan, and selection criteria. While all three are important in setting a framework for the BRAC process, the latter two figure prominently in guiding DOD's analyses for the 2005 round. The unclassified portion of the 20-year force structure plan, extending through 2009, provides a macro-level focus (e.g., number of Army divisions), and reflects limited changes across the military services, even though the services have initiatives under way that could affect future force structure and infrastructure requirements. Today's security environment is evolving, as are force structure requirements along with technology advancements, and defense transformation efforts. The department must consider these factors in its BRAC analyses with appropriate allowances for future uncertainties. DOD's selection criteria closely parallel criteria used in previous rounds, while incorporating the provisions required by legislation authorizing the 2005 round. The analytical sufficiency of the criteria will best be assessed through their application in the ongoing BRAC process. GAO addressed other BRAC-related issues such as excess defense infrastructure capacity and BRAC savings because of their importance to DOD's certification of need for the 2005 BRAC round. DOD's excess capacity analysis, completed for the 2004 report, has some limitations that could result in either overstating or understating excess capacity across various functional areas, and make it difficult to project a total amount of excess capacity across DOD. While the analysis gives some indications of excess capacity within the department, the issue warrants a more complete assessment in the BRAC process. That process will also consider joint base use with the potential for better identifying excess capacity. DOD's historical financial data suggest that, assuming conditions similar to those in the 1993 and 1995 rounds, each of the military departments could achieve annual net savings by 2011, as stipulated by the mandate. While the potential exists for substantial savings from the upcoming round, it is difficult to conclusively project the expected magnitude of the savings because there are too many unknowns at this time. Additionally, improvements are needed in DOD's accounting for savings after BRAC decisions are made. GAO found no basis to question DOD's certification of the need for an additional BRAC round. While clear limitations exist in DOD's assessment of excess capacity, it does point to some areas that warrant additional analysis-and the current BRAC process is an appropriate forum for doing so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While the Department of Defense (DOD) continues its work in preparing  for the upcoming base realignment and closure (BRAC) round in 2005,  legislation required DOD to report to Congress on several BRAC-related  issues in 2004 in order for the 2005 round to proceed.

The force structure plan was to be  based on assessments by the Secretary of Defense of the probable threats  to national security between fiscal years 2005 and 2025. Furthermore, the  plan was to be based on the probable end strengths and major military  force units (land divisions, carrier and other major combatant vessels, and  air wings) needed to meet these threats. DOD was also required to prepare  a comprehensive inventory of military installations worldwide that  indicated the number and type of facilities in the active and reserve forces  of each military department.", "Using the force structure plan and the infrastructure inventory, the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s submission to Congress was required to address  (1) the inventory necessary to support the force structure, (2) the  categories of excess infrastructure and infrastructure capacity, and (3) an  economic analysis of the effect of the closure or realignment of military  installations to reduce excess capacity. In analyzing the infrastructure  requirements, DOD was to consider the continuing need for and  availability of military installations outside the United States and any  efficiency that may be gained from joint tenancy by more than one branch  of the Armed Forces on military bases. On the basis of the force structure  plan, the infrastructure inventory and the economic analysis, the Secretary  was required to certify whether the need existed for further closures and  realignments and, if so, that an additional round would result in annual net  savings for each military department, beginning not later than 2011.  Collectively, these requirements were to be addressed in a report to  Congress at the time it submitted its fiscal year 2005 budget justification  documentation. The legislation also stipulated that if the certifications  were provided in DOD\u2019s report to Congress, we were to evaluate the force  structure plan, infrastructure inventory, and the final selection criteria,  and the need for an additional BRAC round.

The proposed selection criteria were published on  December 23, 2003, with a public comment period ending January 30,  2004. The final criteria were published on February 12, 2004.

Specifically, the Army is restructuring the way it organizes its forces to  achieve greater flexibility by increasing the number of brigade combat  teams from 33 to 43 or more. To achieve these goals while maintaining  global commitments, the Army has been authorized by the Secretary of  Defense to temporarily increase its end strength by 30,000 personnel  through fiscal year 2007. Congress is considering legislation to  permanently authorize this increase. In addition, the Army is in the  process of rebalancing capabilities between the active and reserve  components by moving certain early-deploying and high-demand  capabilities such as military police and civil affairs from the reserve  components into the active force. Although the BRAC statute allows DOD  to submit a revised force structure plan with the fiscal year 2006 budget  submission, Army officials told us that many of the details about this  restructuring would not be completed by this timeframe.", "Navy officials told us that their plans include the commissioning of 17 new  ships (13 Arleigh Burke destroyers, 2 submarines, 1 amphibious ship, and  1 littoral combat ship) while decommissioning 2 older ships. Navy officials  indicated that the projected reductions in the number of active personnel  result primarily from decommissioning ships and air squadrons and  changes to crew requirements on some ships, and the projected reduction  in reserve personnel is caused primarily by plans to deactivate 7 maritime  patrol squadrons. Navy officials also noted plans to increase the number of  ships in its inventory in future years but also have efforts under way to  reduce average crew size per ship. Although the force structure plan  shows a planned increase in the number of ships, available information  indicates some uncertainty over the total number of ships the Navy may  expect for its future force structure.", "Air Force end strength levels shown in the force plan reflect authorized  levels and not the current over-strength levels, reflecting Air Force  expectations of reducing the current levels to those authorized. While the  Air Force showed minimal force structure changes through 2009, an Air  Force official stated that the service plans to increase the number of  aircraft per squadron as well as increase crew ratios to make more  effective use of fewer but more capable aircraft, which would most likely  reduce future infrastructure requirements. We have previously reported  that the Air Force could not only reduce infrastructure by increasing the  number of aircraft per fighter squadron but could also save millions of  dollars annually by doing so.", "We recognize that developing a 20-year force structure plan is a  challenging task for the department, given a host of uncertainties about  the future security environment, potential technology advances and their  application to the future force, and ongoing departmental transformation  efforts. The uncertainties are evident in various ongoing defense  programs. While increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles, for example,  could have far-reaching effects for future defense force structure, we  noted in a recent report that DOD\u2019s approach to planning for developing  and fielding this capability does not provide reasonable assurance that its  investment will facilitate the integration of these vehicles into the force  structure efficiently. Further, DOD officials told us that another  challenging aspect of its force structure planning resides in the longer  term (those years beyond 2009) of the plan. In addition to the uncertainties  cited above, these longer-term years are characterized by additional  unknowns regarding future funding levels that could impact the future  force structure and associated requirements, such as the total number of  ships for the Navy.

The Defense Base Closure and  Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2002, required DOD to give  priority to selection criteria dealing with military value, including (1) the  impact on joint war fighting, training, and readiness; (2) the availability  and condition of training areas suitable for maneuver by ground, naval, or  air forces throughout diverse climates and terrains and staging areas for  use by the Armed Forces in homeland defense missions; and (3) the ability  to accommodate contingency, mobilization, and future force requirements.  The legislation also required DOD to give special consideration to other  criteria, many of which parallel those used in prior BRAC rounds.  Furthermore, the legislation required DOD to consider cost impacts to  other federal entities as well as to DOD in its BRAC decision making.  Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004  requires DOD to consider surge requirements in the 2005 BRAC process.  Table 3 compares the 1995 BRAC criteria with that adopted for 2005, with  changes highlighted in bold.", "Our analysis of lessons learned from prior BRAC rounds affirmed the  soundness of these basic criteria and generally endorsed their retention  for the future, while recognizing the potential for improving the process by  which the criteria are used in decision making. Notwithstanding our  endorsement of the criteria framework, in a January 27, 2004, letter to  DOD, we identified two areas in which we believed the draft selection  criteria needed greater clarification to fully address special considerations  called for in the legislation (see app. III). Specifically, we noted that the  criterion related to cost and savings does not indicate the department\u2019s  intention to consider potential costs to other DOD activities or federal  agencies that may be affected by a proposed closure or realignment  recommendation. Also, we pointed out the criterion on environmental  impact does not clearly identify to what extent costs related to potential  environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental  compliance activities would be included in cost and savings analyses of  individual BRAC recommendations. We suggested that DOD could address  our concerns by incorporating these considerations either directly, in its  final criteria, or through later explanatory guidance. DOD indicated it  would address our concerns through clarifying guidance rather than a  change to the criteria. We have not yet seen that guidance.", "DOD also received a variety of other comments on the draft criteria from  members of Congress, other elected representatives, and the general  public but did not make any changes before issuing the final criteria. Most  of these comments involved the military value criteria (see table 3: 1-4)  and centered on the maintenance of adequate surge capacity; the roles  military installations fulfill in homeland defense missions; the unique  features of research, development, test, and evaluation facilities; and the  preservation of vital human capital in various support functions. In  responding to those comments, DOD expressed the view that the draft  criteria adequately addressed these issues and did not see the need to  make any changes to its draft criteria. For example, DOD said that surge  requirements will be addressed under criterion one, which requires the  department to consider \u201ccurrent and future mission capabilities,\u201d and  criterion three, which requires DOD to consider an installation\u2019s ability to  \u201caccommodate contingency, mobilization, and future total force  requirements\u201d to support operations and training. Furthermore, DOD  noted that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004  requires the Secretary of Defense to \u201cassess the probable threats to  national security\u201d and determine \u201cpotential, prudent, surge requirements\u201d  as part of BRAC 2005. DOD also noted that criterion two recognizes the  role of military installations as staging areas for forces conducting  homeland defense missions.", "Collectively, in our view, many of the public comments on DOD\u2019s criteria  expressed concern that the criteria for the 2005 BRAC round focused more  on assessing military value based on military missions and operational  capabilities without recognizing important support capabilities such as  research, development, test, and evaluation. Although modifications to the  criteria might have been made to address some of these concerns, the  absence of such changes does not necessarily mean that these issues will  not be considered in applying the criteria during the BRAC process. For  example, the department has established a variety of joint cross-service  groups to analyze various support functions during the upcoming round  and each group will have to adapt the final criteria for its particular  support area to assess military value related to each functional area. While  our monitoring of the ongoing BRAC process indicates this is occurring,  the effectiveness of these efforts will best be assessed as these groups  complete their work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations on Other Key BRAC-Related Issues Included in DOD\u2019s Report", "paragraphs": ["Other BRAC-related issues included in DOD\u2019s report\u2014excess  infrastructure capacity, estimated savings for the 2005 round, and the  economic impact of prior BRAC actions on communities\u2014are of  widespread interest to Congress and the public and important to DOD\u2019s  certification regarding the need for a BRAC round.

Further, historical financial data would suggest that,  assuming conditions similar to those in the 1993 and 1995 round, each of  the military departments could achieve annual net savings by 2011. As to  economic impact, our work has shown that many communities  surrounding closed bases from the previous rounds have fared better than  the national average, in terms of changes in unemployment rates and per  capita income, with more mixed results recently, allowing for some  negative effect from the economic downturn in recent years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Analysis Indicates Excess Infrastructure Capacity Exists", "paragraphs": ["While DOD\u2019s analysis of its infrastructure capacity for the 2004 report,  which was completed outside the 2005 BRAC process, gives some  indication of excess capacity across certain functional areas through fiscal  year 2009, the methodology for that analysis has some limitations that  could cause the results to be either overstated or understated, and raises  questions about use of the methodology to project a total amount of  excess capacity across DOD. At the same time, DOD\u2019s methodology did  not consider any additional excess capacity that might occur by analyzing  facilities or functions on a joint or cross-service basis, a priority for the  2005 round. A more complete assessment of capacity and the potential to  reduce it must await the results of the current BRAC analyses being  conducted by DOD.", "To estimate excess capacity, the military services and the Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA) compared the capacity for a sample of bases in  1989 with the projected capacity of a sample of bases in 2009. The services  and DLA categorized the bases according to their primary function, and  they identified a variety of indicators, or metrics, to measure capacity for  each functional category. For example, they used total maneuver acres per  brigade to establish capacity for Army training bases, total square feet of  parking apron space to establish capacity for active and reserve Air Force  bases, and total direct labor hours (versus budget or programmed direct  labor hours) to establish capacity for Navy aviation depots. See app. IV for  additional information on how DOD computed excess capacity.", "This methodology has some limitations as we reported in 1998 when  DOD used it to project excess capacity in supporting the need for a future  BRAC round. DOD\u2019s use of 1989 as a baseline did not take into account the  excess base capacity that existed in that year prior to base closures in the  1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995 BRAC rounds. As a result, the percentage of  increased excess capacity reported understated actual excess capacity by  an unknown amount for some functional categories, and may have  overstated excess capacity for other categories. The Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) also reported that the department\u2019s use of 1989 as a  baseline did not take into account the excess capacity that might have  existed in 1989. Furthermore, CBO reported that the approach could  understate the capacity required if some types of base support are truly a  fixed cost, regardless of the size of the force. The methodology also did  not consider any additional excess capacity that might occur by analyzing  facilities or functions on a cross-service basis, a priority for the 2005  round. In addition, capacity for some functions was measured differently  for each service. For example, the Army and Air Force measured capacity  for test and evaluation facilities in terms of physical total square feet of  space, while the Navy measured its capacity for these facilities in terms of  work years. Finally, as we recently noted, the variety of metrics and  differences across the military services makes it difficult to be precise  when trying to project a total amount of excess capacity across DOD.", "Military service officials told us that they typically use most of the capacity  metrics included in DOD\u2019s report, along with other measures, to assess  excess capacity. For example, these officials stated that the metrics for  depots, industrial, shipyards, logistics bases, and supply are used, along  with other measures, as indicators of excess capacity. However, we found  that some of the metrics used in DOD\u2019s report were less reliable than  others as indicators of excess capacity. For example, the metric for Marine  Corps bases compared the acres at five Marine Corps bases to the total  authorized military personnel for the Marine Corps, and not just the  authorized personnel at the five bases. Marine Corps officials  acknowledged that this was not a requirements-based metric to measure  excess capacity at Marine Corps bases. Likewise, the metric for  administrative space in the Air Force was based on the administrative  space at only one Air Force base. Air Force officials stated that this  occurred because under the methodology each Air Force base could only  be considered in one functional area.", "While prior BRAC rounds have focused primarily on reducing excess  capacity, DOD officials have stated this is not the sole focus of the 2005  BRAC round. These officials noted that the 2005 round aims to further  transform the military by rationalizing base infrastructure to the force  structure, enhance joint capabilities by improving joint utilization, and  convert waste to war-fighting capability by eliminating excess capacity.  This approach has the potential to identify greater excess capacity than  previously identified.

DOD estimated that it would  accrue net annual savings of $3 billion to $5 billion departmentwide by  2011. While we believe that the potential exists for significant savings to  result from the 2005 BRAC round, it is difficult to conclusively project the  expected magnitude of the savings because there simply are too many  unknowns, such as the specific timing of individual closure or realignment  actions and the extent to which DOD\u2019s efforts to maximize joint utilization  and further its transformation efforts, would impact savings. Finally, to  what extent forces that are currently based overseas may be redeployed to  the United States and what effect that redeployment may have on BRAC  and subsequent savings remains an unknown as well.", "The Secretary\u2019s estimate of $3 billion to $5 billion in net annual savings by  2011 was based in part on savings achieved from the 1993 and 1995 BRAC  rounds. The lower estimate assumes that the actions in the 2005 round  would reduce infrastructure by about 12 percent, comparable to the  reduction that occurred in the 1993 and 1995 rounds combined. The higher  estimate assumes that infrastructure would be reduced by 20 percent,  which is about 67 percent higher than the previous two rounds combined.  While we believe the potential for significant savings exists, a more  reliable estimate of savings is not practical until the department has  developed actual closure and realignment proposals.", "While DOD\u2019s report estimated net annual savings of $3 billion to $5 billion  could be achieved departmentwide, it did not explicitly indicate the  amount of savings that each service would achieve by 2011. Our analysis  of the savings from the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, however, indicates  that each department accrued net annual savings by the sixth year of  implementation, as seen in table 4.", "Another way of looking at net savings is to consider the point at which  cumulative savings exceed the cumulative costs of implementing BRAC  decisions over a period of years. Experience has shown that the  department incurs significant upfront investment costs in the early years  of a BRAC round, and it takes several years to fully offset those cumulative  costs and begin to realize cumulative net savings. The difference in the  terminology is important to understand because it has a direct bearing on  the magnitude and assessment of the savings at any given time. As  previously discussed, each military department achieved net annual  savings during the 1993 and 1995 rounds by the sixth year of  implementation. However, with the exception of the Navy in 1995, the  military departments did not achieve cumulative net savings for both the  1993 and 1995 rounds until after the sixth year of implementation.", "Notwithstanding the issues we raise that could affect savings, we continue  to believe that it is vitally important for DOD to improve its mechanisms  for tracking and updating its savings estimates. We have previously noted  that DOD\u2019s BRAC savings estimates have been imprecise for a variety of  reasons such as weaknesses in DOD\u2019s financial management systems that  limit the ability to fully account for the cost of its operations; the fact the  DOD\u2019s accounting systems like other accounting systems are oriented to  tracking expenses and disbursements, not savings; the exclusion of  BRAC-related costs incurred by other government agencies; and  inadequate updating of the savings estimates that are developed.  Improvements can and should be made to address this issue. In its 1998  report to the Congress on BRAC issues, DOD proposed efforts that, if  adopted, could provide for greater accuracy in the estimates. Specifically,  DOD proposed developing a questionnaire that would be completed  annually by each base affected by BRAC rounds during the 6-year  implementation period. The questionnaire would request information on  costs, personnel reductions, and changes in operating and military  construction costs in order to provide greater insight into the savings  created by each BRAC action. DOD suggested that developing such a  questionnaire would be a cooperative effort involving the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the military services, the defense agencies, the  Office of the DOD Inspector General, and the service audit agencies. This  proposal recognizes that better documentation and updating of savings  will require special efforts parallel to the normal budget process. DOD has  not yet initiated actions to implement this proposal. We strongly endorse  such action. If DOD does not take steps to improve its estimation of  savings in the future, then previous questions about the reliability,  accuracy, and completeness of DOD\u2019s savings estimates will likely  continue.

The following are selected excerpts from key GAO products.  \u201cDespite these recent BRAC rounds, DOD continues to maintain large  amounts of excess infrastructure, especially in its support functions, such  as maintenance depots, research and development laboratories, and test  and evaluation centers. Each service maintains its own facilities and  capabilities for performing many common support functions and, as a  result DOD has overlapping, redundant, and underutilized infrastructure.  DOD has taken some steps to demolish unneeded buildings on various  operational and support bases; consolidate certain functions; privatize,  outsource, and reengineer certain workloads; and encourage  interservicing agreements\u2014however, these are not expected to offset the  need for additional actions. At the same time, DOD officials recognize that  significant additional reductions in excess infrastructure requirements in  common support areas could come from consolidating workloads and  restructuring functions on a cross-service basis, something that has not  been accomplished to any great extent in prior BRAC rounds.\u201d U.S.  General Accounting Office, Military Bases: Lessons Learned From Prior  Base Closure Rounds, GAO/NSIAD-97-151 (Washington, D.C.: July 25,  1997, p. 3). \u201cNotwithstanding the results of the four recent BRAC rounds, DOD  officials recognized, even while they were finishing the 1995 round, that  they had missed OSD\u2019s goal in terms of reductions needed through base  closures. DOD calculated that the first three BRAC rounds reduced the  plant replacement value (PRV) of DOD\u2019s domestic facilities by 15 percent.  It established a goal for the fourth round of reducing PRV by an additional  15 percent, for a total of 30 percent. When the Secretary announced his  recommendations for base closures and realignments in 1995, OSD  projected that if all of the Secretary\u2019s recommendations were adopted, the  total PRV would be reduced by 21 percent, nearly a third less than OSD\u2019s  goal.\u201d GAO/NSIAD-97-151, p. 17. \u201cThe Secretary of Defense\u2019s 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, which  assessed defense strategy, programs, and policies, included the issue of  future base closures in the infrastructure portion of the review.
