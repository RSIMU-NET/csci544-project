These products were classified for payment purposes as specified covered outpatient drugs (SCOD). The legislation directed CMS to set 2006 Medicare payment rates for SCODs equal to hospitals' average acquisition costs and included requirements for GAO. As directed, GAO surveyed hospitals and issued two reports, providing information to use in setting 2006 SCOD rates. To address other requirements in the law, this report analyzes SCOD price variation across hospitals, advises CMS on future surveys it might undertake, and examines both lessons from the GAO survey and future challenges facing CMS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Analyzing pharmaceutical price data collected from its 2004 survey of hospitals, GAO found that prices hospitals paid for SCOD products varied across hospitals. Certain factors--namely, whether the hospital had a major teaching program or not, was in an urban or rural area, and had a large or small hospital outpatient department--were associated with whether hospitals paid higher or lower prices for SCOD products. Major teaching hospitals paid prices that were an estimated 3.2 percent lower than those paid by nonteaching hospitals for drug SCODs; rural hospitals paid prices an estimated 4.4 percent higher than those paid by urban hospitals for radiopharmaceutical SCODs; and large hospitals paid prices an estimated 1.4 percent lower than those paid by small hospitals for drug SCODs and 3.1 percent lower for radiopharmaceutical SCODs. Combining these factors, GAO found that large, urban, major teaching hospitals--compared with other hospitals--generally paid lower prices, on average, for all SCOD products. From conducting its hospital survey, GAO learned a key lesson that CMS could use in the future: such a survey would not be practical for collecting the data needed to set and update SCOD rates routinely but would be useful for validating, on occasion, CMS's rate-setting data. GAO's survey produced accurate hospital drug price data, but it also created a considerable burden for hospitals as the data suppliers and considerable costs for GAO as the data collector. Nonetheless, the benefit of collecting actual prices paid by hospitals could make such surveys advantageous for occasionally validating CMS's proxy for SCODs' average acquisition costs--the average sales price (ASP) data that manufacturers report. CMS will face important challenges as it seeks to obtain accurate data on hospitals' acquisition costs for drug and radiopharmaceutical SCODs. Regarding drugs, CMS lacks the detail on manufacturers' ASP data needed to determine if rates developed from these data are appropriate for hospitals. Manufacturers report ASP as a single price paid by all purchasers, making it impossible to distinguish the price paid by hospitals alone. CMS instructs manufacturers to report ASP net of rebates but does not specify how to allocate individual product rebates when several products are purchased. Regarding radiopharmaceuticals, GAO found that the diversity of forms in which they can be purchased--ready-to-use unit doses, multidoses, or separately purchased radioactive and non-radioactive substances--complicates CMS's efforts to select a data source that can provide reasonably accurate price data efficiently. Efficiency as well as accuracy is a factor in selecting a data source because radiopharmaceuticals account for only 1.5 percent of Medicare hospital outpatient spending. GAO's experience suggests that the best option available to CMS, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, is to collect price data on radiopharmaceuticals purchased in ready-to-use unit doses, the form in which an estimated three-quarters of hospitals purchase these products."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, federal legislation required the establishment of Medicare  payment rates for a particular set of new pharmaceutical products that  were provided to beneficiaries in hospital outpatient settings but were  generally paid for differently than other services paid under Medicare\u2019s  hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS). These products  were newly introduced drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals used  to treat and in some cases diagnose serious conditions such as cancer.  Specifically, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) to set rates for these pharmaceuticals. MMA classified them for  payment purposes as specified covered outpatient drugs (SCOD). In  addition, MMA defined a SCOD as a drug or radiopharmaceutical, used in  hospital outpatient departments, covered by Medicare, and paid for as an  individual product for which CMS established a separate payment  category rather than placing it in a category that included other services.", "The MMA directed CMS to set 2006 payment rates for SCOD products  equal to hospitals\u2019 average acquisition costs\u2014the cost to hospitals of  acquiring a product, net the cost of rebates. In several related  requirements, the MMA directed us to provide information on SCOD costs  and CMS\u2019s proposed rates. First, we were required to conduct a survey of  a large sample of hospitals to obtain data on their acquisition costs of  SCODs and provide information based on these data to the Secretary of  Health and Human Services for his consideration in setting 2006 Medicare  payment rates. We provided information from this survey in two  reports\u2014one on drugs and another on radiopharmaceuticals. These  reports presented systematic information on hospitals\u2019 purchase prices of  SCODs and limited information on rebates. Second, we were required to  evaluate CMS\u2019s proposed rates for SCODs and comment on their  appropriateness in light of the survey of SCOD prices we conducted. We  provided our comments in a report issued in October 2005.", "Two other MMA requirements had a role for us\u2014to report on any variation  found in our survey results in acquisition costs among hospitals and to  advise on future data collection efforts by CMS based on our survey  experience. This report addresses these requirements and examines   (1) the extent to which SCOD prices identified in our survey differed  among hospitals with different characteristics, (2) lessons the MMA- mandated survey experience provided for the methodology and frequency  of future collection of SCOD price data, and (3) the challenges CMS faces  in collecting data to set SCOD payment rates accurately after 2006.", "To examine price variation among a sample consisting of 1,157 hospitals  purchasing SCOD products, we conducted a multivariate statistical  analysis and grouped hospitals by certain key characteristics, including  teaching status, location, and size. We defined a hospital\u2019s teaching status  as major, other teaching, or nonteaching, based on the hospital\u2019s  intern/resident-to-bed ratio; location as urban or rural based on  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA); and size as a hospital\u2019s total  Medicare outpatient charges, classifying a hospital as large if its Medicare  charges were at or above the 80th percentile of all hospital outpatient  charges. The prices we examined were drawn from our survey of  hospitals\u2019 purchase prices for 62 SCODs for the period July 1, 2003,  through June 30, 2004. We determined that our survey data were reliable  for estimating SCOD prices.

In particular, we reviewed CMS\u2019s published method for  collecting the average sales prices (ASP) of drug SCODs: manufacturers  report their ASPs quarterly to CMS, which uses them as a proxy for  average acquisition costs in setting drug SCOD payment rates.

When OPPS was first developed as required by the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997, the rates for hospital outpatient services, drugs, and  radiopharmaceuticals were based on hospitals\u2019 1996 median costs.  However, these rates prompted concerns that payments to hospitals would  not reflect the costs of newly introduced pharmaceutical products used to  treat, for example, cancer, rare blood disorders, and other serious  conditions. In turn, congressional concerns were raised that beneficiaries  might lose access to some of these products if hospitals avoided providing  them because of a perceived shortfall in payments. In response to these  concerns, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget  Refinement Act of 1999 authorized pass-through payments, which were a  way to temporarily augment the OPPS payments for newly introduced  pharmaceutical products first used after 1996. The MMA modified this  payment method for some of these pharmaceutical products. As part of  the modification, the MMA defined the new SCOD payment category,  which includes many of these newly introduced pharmaceutical products.

In addition, hospital size was important in affecting  price differences for both drugs and radiopharmaceuticals. (See table 1.)", "In assessing the magnitude of each factor\u2019s separate effect on prices, we  found the following results:    Teaching status: Compared with nonteaching hospitals, major teaching  hospitals paid prices that were, on average, an estimated 3.2 percent lower  for drug SCODs.

Hospitals told us that, to submit the required  price data, they had to divert staff from their normal duties, thereby  incurring additional staff and contractor costs.

A number of hospitals, however, either  collected the data manually, provided us with copies of paper invoices, or  had automated information systems that were not designed to retrieve the  detailed price data needed and required additional data processing effort.  Hospitals\u2019 data collection difficulties were particularly pronounced  regarding information on manufacturers\u2019 rebates, which affect a drug\u2019s net  acquisition cost. Typically, hospitals did not systematically track all  manufacturers\u2019 rebates on drug purchases, although nearly 60 percent of  hospitals reported receiving one or more rebates.", "As collectors of data on SCOD prices, we also experienced difficulties  obtaining the information needed from hospitals. Hospitals\u2019 information  systems were diverse and produced data in many different formats,  causing substantial resource and timing difficulties in the data collection  process.

We focused on prices for  radiopharmaceuticals purchased in unit doses. Most of the hospitals  purchased radiopharmaceuticals in this ready-to-use form, and only a  small fraction of hospitals purchased radiopharmaceuticals in separate  components (the radioisotope and the nonradioactive substance), which  need to be compounded. We were unable to make prices for separately  purchased components comparable to those obtained for unit doses, as  the labor costs for compounding the products are included in hospitals\u2019  reported prices of ready-to-use products but not in their reported prices of  products they purchased as separate components.", "The short half-life of certain radiopharmaceutical SCODs can also pose  challenges for collecting and interpreting price data. Because the  radioactive component decays over time, the amount of the product  purchased for a given patient may vary with the distance between where  the radiopharmaceutical is compounded and where it is administered. The  result is that for those short-lived radiopharmaceuticals paid on a per-dose  basis, the cost per dose is more for the doses prepared far from the point  of administration than for those prepared closer by, as more of a  radioactive product must be purchased to account for its decay in transit.  This applies most commonly to F-18 radiopharmaceuticals, the most  common of which, F-18 FDG, has a half-life of 1.8 hours. F-18  radiopharmaceuticals, including F-18 FDG, are used in the diagnosis of  various diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and liver disease.", "Finally, CMS faces the challenge of balancing accuracy and efficiency in  obtaining price data on radiopharmaceutical SCODs. Our approach in  estimating prices from our survey data was to use only information on unit  dose prices, the form purchased by most hospitals. CMS, as stated in the  2006 final rule governing payment rates for SCODs, has not found what it  considers a satisfactory method for obtaining data on acquisition costs of  radiopharmaceuticals and is continuing to explore both ASP and other  alternatives. Hospitals and manufacturers are the most direct source of  price data because both are parties to the transactions in which the  hospitals acquire the radiopharmaceuticals. In its notice of proposed  rulemaking for radiopharmaceutical SCODs, CMS proposed collecting  ASPs from manufacturers for use in setting 2007 payment rates.

Using claims data may be a more  efficient but less accurate means of obtaining price estimates than  obtaining price data directly from manufacturers or from hospitals\u2019  invoices. In its final rule, CMS stated that it was basing 2006 payments on  hospitals\u2019 charges (derived from outpatient claims) for  radiopharmaceuticals. CMS plans to adjust these charges to reflect costs  and noted that it did not plan to use this methodology permanently. For  rate-setting after 2006, CMS also noted the possibility of using invoice data  submitted to Medicare by physicians who administer  radiopharmaceuticals in their offices.

As we  previously reported, we agree with CMS that ASP is a practical data source  for setting and updating rates for drug SCODs on a routine basis. However,  we remain concerned about whether CMS can determine that ASP  accurately represents purchases made by hospitals and believe that CMS  should implement our October 2005 recommendation to collect sufficient  information on ASP to make such a determination. We are also concerned  about the likelihood that ASPs are not calculated consistently across all  manufacturers, owing to CMS\u2019s lack of detailed instructions. As for  validating the data CMS collects to set payment rates equal to hospitals\u2019  acquisition costs, an examination of hospitals\u2019 actual purchase prices, by  definition, is optimal for assessing accuracy.

However, HHS agreed to consider this recommendation, saying that  it would continue to analyze the best approach for setting payment rates  for drugs and radiopharmaceutical SCODs in view of our  recommendation. It will also continue to analyze the adequacy of paying  for drugs at ASP+6 percent in the light of claims data, which persuaded  HHS that for 2006 ASP + 6 percent was the best available proxy for  hospital acquisition and handling costs.", "Regarding the second recommendation\u2014that HHS use unit-dose prices to  set and update payment rates for radiopharmaceuticals\u2014HHS agreed with  us that the multiple forms in which radiopharmaceuticals can be  purchased makes setting their payment rates difficult. While agreeing to  consider our recommendation, HHS expressed several reservations. First,  it noted that we had not specified whether the survey to collect acquisition  cost data should be a survey of hospitals or manufacturers and asked that  we clarify this point. Second, it noted that we had emphasized the burden  of annual surveys of hospital drug prices and expressed the concern that  an annual survey of hospital radiopharmaceutical prices would be equally  burdensome. Finally, HHS noted that we had confined our report to 9 of  the approximately 55 radiopharmaceuticals that are paid separately, and  questioned whether unit-dose data would be available for all or most  radiopharmaceuticals.", "Our recommendation that HHS validate ASPs through occasional surveys  or by using other methods is based in considerable part on our experience  of the difficulty of a hospital survey. The burden that annual surveys  would place on both hospitals and the agency is the reason that we  rejected annual surveys as a source of acquisition cost data and instead  proposed only occasional surveys to validate ASPs. Furthermore, as we  noted in the recommendation, HHS could use a method other than a  survey if that method were similarly accurate and efficient.", "In our recommendation on radiopharmaceuticals, we did not comment on  whether the survey to collect acquisition cost data should be a survey of  hospitals or manufacturers, because we have not analyzed the feasibility  of obtaining these data from manufacturers. We recognize the potential  burden of hospital surveys; this burden would need to be taken into  account in weighing the merits of a hospital survey versus other  alternatives. Regarding our recommendation to collect unit-dose prices,  we have clarified it, saying that unit-dose prices should be used when  available. In our survey, we used unit-dose data when we reported  purchase prices for the 9 radiopharmaceuticals that accounted for 90  percent of Medicare\u2019s costs for hospital outpatient drugs.

We also considered qualitative  factors when selecting our preferred measures of location and size. For  example, we selected hospital outpatient charges as our measure of size,  instead of number of hospital beds, because both measures had similar  statistical properties and our analysis focuses on the hospital outpatient  setting.", "In addition to conducting separate regression analyses of the price data for  drug SCODs and for radiopharmaceutical SCODs, we analyzed price  variation separately for each of four therapeutic categories of drug SCODs.  We also conducted separate regression analyses of SCOD price variation  for drugs without biologicals, for biologicals, and for  radiopharmaceuticals. We determined that any gains in statistical  properties did not outweigh the greater complexity of these analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods and Results of Price Analysis", "paragraphs": ["In analyzing SCOD price variation, our dependent variable was the natural  logarithm of SCOD price. SCOD prices are not distributed symmetrically  around the average. SCOD prices are skewed to the right and are not  distributed normally, reflecting some SCODs with particularly high prices.  Taking the natural logarithm of price is intended to take skewness into  account and make the resulting distribution consistent with the statistical  assumptions of a regression.", "We weighted prices paid by hospitals for individual drugs and  radiopharmaceuticals by the purchase amount of each invoice. That is, we  weighted prices more heavily in the statistical analysis for invoices that  represented a larger proportion of total annual purchases of a particular  SCOD than for invoices that represented a smaller proportion of  purchases. In addition, our analysis took into account the fact that  multiple prices paid by a particular hospital were not necessarily  statistically independent of each other\u2014a phenomenon known as  clustering. In estimating our statistical models, we corrected the potential  bias in our estimates due to clustering by using the robust and cluster  options in STATA, a statistical software package.", "To gauge the effects of our explanatory factors on price variation among  hospitals, we estimated one regression model for drug SCODs and a  separate model for radiopharmaceutical SCODs. Table 3 shows estimates  of the first model, which indicate the effects of three hospital  characteristics on the natural logarithm of price of drug SCODs.", "To examine the separate effect of each factor, holding constant the effects  of the remaining factors, we referred to the estimated coefficients for each  factor in the model. From the estimated coefficient, we calculated the  percentage difference in price attributable to each factor. For example,  major teaching hospitals paid lower prices for drugs compared to  nonteaching hospitals: major teaching hospitals paid 3.2 percent less than  nonteaching hospitals, holding constant location, size, and the mix of  SCODs purchased. In contrast, we found no statistically significant  difference in prices paid by hospitals with other teaching programs and  those paid by nonteaching hospitals, holding the other factors constant.", "Although the R-squared statistic in table 3 indicates that the model  accounts for over 99 percent of the variation in the logarithm of the SCOD  price, this feature of the estimated model requires careful interpretation.  Most of the variation in the logarithm of the drug SCOD price was due to  the particular SCODs that were purchased\u2014for some, hospitals paid on  average about $300 per unit while for others, hospitals paid about $3 per  unit. Consequently, after accounting for differences in the mix of SCODs  purchased by different hospitals, only a small amount of variation in price  remains to be explained by other factors. As a result, the R-squared for this  model should not be interpreted as an indicator of the three factors\u2019  success in explaining SCOD price variation. Instead, the t-statistics  associated with teaching status, location, and size are more useful, since  they signal these factors\u2019 statistical significance\u2014that is, whether the  difference between the estimated effect of each factor and zero is  statistically significant.", "Table 4 presents the results for the second model, which estimates the  effects of the three factors on the prices of radiopharmaceutical SCODs.", "As table 4 shows, two factors\u2014location and size\u2014are statistically  significant in the model examining radiopharmaceutical SCOD prices.
