Based on that definition, small businesses include (1) all farmers and sole proprietorships and (2) partnerships, S corporations, and corporations that annually reported less than $5 million in assets.", "A large majority of all businesses are small businesses. To illustrate, for tax year 1995, we used IRS data to identify approximately 23.4 million businesses that filed returns. Of this population, 94 percent of partnerships reported total assets of less than $5 million, and 98 percent of S corporations reported total assets of less than $5 million.

To develop a more comprehensive list of federal tax requirements that apply to small businesses, we contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in the Department of the Treasury for information on requirements pertaining to the excise taxes that it administers. The ATF requirements apply generally to any business.", "To determine the actual experience of small businesses in meeting their filing, reporting, and deposit requirements, including their involvement in IRS\u2019 enforcement processes, we (1) interviewed IRS compliance officials specializing in examination, appeals, and collection issues to ascertain how small businesses are affected by the enforcement processes and (2) obtained some computerized information from IRS databases on the filing and enforcement experience of small businesses.

If total deposits of withheld income and FICA taxes were more than $50,000 in the second year preceding the current year, the employer must make electronic deposits using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). In addition, a small business employer must annually report and quarterly deposit FUTA taxes separately from FICA and withheld income tax. Lastly, an employer must send a federal Form W-2, Wage and Earnings Statement, to each of its employees and file federal Forms W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements, and W-2 with the Social Security Administration.

Simplified Employee Pensions (SEP), Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE), and Keogh plans offer small employers and self- employed individuals a deduction for contributions to the plan and deferral of tax on income of the plan. Generally, SEP and SIMPLE plans are less complex than Keogh plans, and while businesses must maintain records about the plans, they do not have any separate filing or reporting requirements with IRS. Keogh plans offer certain benefits not offered by SEP and SIMPLE, but they tend to be more complex and entail substantial filing and reporting requirements with IRS using Form 5500 and related schedules.

These requirements, of which there are nearly 140, range across income taxes, excise taxes, and information reporting. (For a complete list, see tables II.4, II.5, and II.6 in app. II.)", "Some of these requirements are used to implement provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that can benefit small (and other) businesses. For example, businesses must complete Form 8861, Welfare-to-Work Credit, to receive a tax credit for hiring long-term family assistance recipients. Also, businesses must complete Form 4562 to claim deductions for depreciation and amortization of business assets or to make the election to immediately expense the cost of certain property. The election to expense property allows the taxpayer to take an immediate deduction instead of using the depreciation schedules to recover a portion of the costs annually over the property\u2019s useful life.

The excise taxes administered by IRS consist of several broad categories, including environmental taxes, communications taxes, fuel taxes, retail sale of heavy trucks and trailers, luxury taxes on passenger cars, and manufacturers\u2019 taxes on a variety of different products.

The most commonly filed secondary income tax form among the 44 was Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization. Approximately 74 percent of farmers, 62 percent of partnerships, 69 percent of S corporations, and 73 percent of corporations filed the depreciation and amortization form in 1995.

On average, sole proprietorships and corporations filed approximately three schedules, while farmers filed slightly less than three. Partnerships and S corporations filed more schedules than other types of businesses. Partnerships filed approximately 11 schedules, and S corporations filed approximately 6 schedules, on average, in 1995. The filing results are higher for partnerships and S corporations because of their unique structure as pass-through entities. Partnerships and S corporations must file a Schedule K-1, Partner\u2019s or Shareholder\u2019s Share of Income, with IRS for each partner or shareholder.

By contrast, IRS audited 1.3 percent of all returns filed in 1997. The audit rate for sole proprietors (individuals filing Schedule C) was 3.2 percent, compared to 1.2 percent for individuals not filing Schedule C.", "According to IRS officials, the audit rate for small business taxpayers is higher than the overall rate because small businesses tend to have more compliance problems than other taxpayers. A common kind of problem that small businesses can face is in the area of employment tax compliance. A small business can fall short of operating capital, and as a consequence, it may divert some or all of its estimated tax deposits or employment tax withholdings to make up the shortfall, hoping to pay IRS at a later date. According to IRS officials, the amount of these unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest can pyramid quickly. The danger is that a business that must rely on these funds for working capital is likely to have other liabilities and delinquencies that reflect financial problems so severe that it cannot recover.", "Table 3 provides detailed information on the audit rates in 1997 for the four types of small businesses and farmers.", "IRS has little data on the burden imposed by its audits of small businesses and other taxpayers.

Examples cited included (1) difficulties in scheduling appointments with taxpayers, (2) the time required for a taxpayer to assemble needed information, and (3) the fact that some audits involve highly complex business tax issues requiring extensive research and investigation. With respect to audits of partnerships in particular, the officials said that the audits tend to take longer because IRS must secure and examine each partner\u2019s return in addition to the partnership return. An audit of a partnership\u2019s return remains open as long as any partner is in disagreement with any audit issue.

To further complicate matters, data on filings and payments by small businesses may be divided between the individual and business masterfile. Data from Schedule C (sole proprietorship), Schedule E (partnership and S corporation shareholder), and Schedule F (farmer) are posted to the individual masterfile. Data from Schedule 1120 for corporations, including S corporations, are posted to the business masterfile. In addition, all employment and excise tax data are posted to the business masterfile.
