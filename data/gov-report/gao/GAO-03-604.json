GAO was asked to (1) provide information for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 on the composition of the Region X workforce and for personnel actions such as promotions, awards, and adverse actions by EEO group; (2) describe the EEO complaint process in Region X and any changes to it; (3) assess whether the Region's process is consistent with federal regulations and related guidance; and (4) assess the familiarity with the EEO process of the Region's employees and their attitude toward it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In a geographic area where minorities represent a small portion of the civilian workforce (about 13.5 percent), Region X generally had a higher percentage of each minority group, except for American Indian and Alaska Natives. Moreover, the percentage of minority employees in Region X had increased from about 19 percent in fiscal year 1997 to about 27 percent in fiscal year 2001. Women represented a much higher proportion of SSA's workforce than of the civilian workforce. Differences among racial/ethnic and gender groups for most of the personnel actions reviewed were not statistically significant. For fiscal years 1997 and 1998, current and former Region X EEO counselors described a process that mirrored the informal stage of the required federal sector complaint process. In fiscal year 1999, Region X changed its EEO process, so that EEO counselors were no longer allowed to talk with managers but were required to submit their questions in writing. In addition, managers were encouraged to routinely have an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) review their written responses before these responses were provided to the EEO counselors. After the changes were in place for about a year, SSA headquarters officials held discussions with Region X officials to explain that having written inquiries and OGC involved in the informal EEO process was not consistent with the intent of resolving issues informally. Beginning early in fiscal year 2001, neither written EEO counselor queries to managers nor OGC involvement was required in the informal process. Region X's former use of written queries and OGC involvement were counter to the spirit of EEO regulations and their related guidance, which emphasize the informal nature of precomplaint counseling. In doing its work at Region X, GAO found that SSA had issued EEO handbooks for managers and employees, but the handbooks do not contain agency-specific procedures on how EEO counselors are to process complaints of discrimination. Agency-specific procedures are required by EEO regulations. Absent such procedures, components of an agency can use different procedures, as illustrated by Region X, resulting in employees across the country being treated differently. To gain an understanding of how familiar the Region's employees are with the EEO process and their willingness to participate in it, GAO surveyed all of the Region's employees. Most Region X employees reported having received or seen within the last 2 years written materials about EEO regulations and how to contact regional EEO counselors. Also, almost half the employees reported a willingness to participate in counseling or to file a formal EEO complaint if they believed they had been discriminated against. However, a sizeable portion of employees--about 40 percent--reported being unwilling or uncertain about becoming involved with the processes established for handling EEO complaints."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An October 2000 report by the Seattle branch of the National Association  for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) alleged that the Social  Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Region X\u2014which covers Alaska, Idaho,  Oregon, and Washington and has about 1,800 employees\u2014may have  violated federal regulations governing equal employment opportunity  (EEO) and the processing of employment discrimination complaints.  The  report alleges, among other things, that the Office of the General Counsel  (OGC) in Region X interfered with EEO precomplaint counseling, the  informal stage of the EEO complaint process.  In addition, the report  alleges that in the informal stage, EEO counselors were required by Region  X management to submit written inquires to responsible management  officials rather than conversing with them to get information.  SSA did not  agree with the report\u2019s allegations but agreed to two of its  recommendations:  to provide on-site precomplaint counseling at one of  the Region\u2019s largest facilities and to provide ongoing training to  management on provisions concerning employees\u2019 rights in SSA\u2019s labor- management agreement.

In addition, federal employees are  protected from retaliation for filing a complaint, participating in an  investigation of a complaint, or opposing any practice made unlawful under  these antidiscrimination laws.  The Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC) has issued regulations that govern how the  discrimination claims of federal employees are to be processed  administratively.  Federal agencies covered by these regulations are  responsible for developing and implementing their own EEO programs and  complaint processing procedures consistent with EEOC\u2019s regulations.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to (1) provide information  on the composition of Region X\u2019s workforce by EEO group (race/ethnicity  and gender) for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 overall and for personnel  actions such as promotions, awards, and adverse actions; (2) describe the  Region\u2019s EEO complaint process and any changes to it during the 5-year  period; (3) assess whether the Region\u2019s EEO complaint process was  consistent with federal regulations and related guidance; and (4) assess the  familiarity of the Region\u2019s employees with the EEO process and their  attitude toward it.", "For our discussion of the composition of Region X\u2019s workforce as well as  the breakdown of personnel actions by EEO group, we used SSA data  provided by the Region\u2019s human resources management information  system for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 for African Americans, American  Indian/Alaska Natives (AIAN), Asian/Pacific Islanders (Asian), Hispanics,  and Whites.  Each racial/ethnic group was broken down by gender.  As part  of our analysis of the composition of SSA staff for selected personnel  actions, we tested to see if statistically significant differences by EEO  group occurred.  Our analyses of personnel actions are designed to  provide information at a common and aggregate level about EEO group  differences in personnel actions at Region X and not to determine whether  or not discrimination existed.  The presence of a statistically significant  difference does not prove discrimination, nor does the absence of a  statistically significant difference prove that staff have not been  discriminated against.", "To describe the EEO process in the Region and any changes made to it for  the 5-year period, we reviewed documents provided by SSA headquarters  and Region X officials and interviewed those officials.  To determine  whether the Region\u2019s EEO complaint process is consistent with federal  regulations, we reviewed EEOC\u2019s regulations governing how the  discrimination claims of federal employees are to be processed and  compared their requirements with the processes employed by the Region.

Under EEOC regulations, employees or applicants for employment who  believe that they have been discriminated against by a federal agency may  file a complaint with that agency.  Before filing a complaint, the employee  must consult an EEO counselor at the agency in order to try to informally  resolve the matter.  The employee must contact an EEO counselor within  45 days of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a  personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.

When the counselor has a good  grasp of the issues involved, he or she is ready to attempt resolution.   Resolution means that the employee and the agency come to terms with the  matter and agree on a solution.  In seeking resolution, the counselor is to  listen to and understand the viewpoint of both parties and act as a neutral  and not as an advocate for either the employee or the agency.  Counseling  is to be completed within 30 days from the date the employee contacted the  EEO office for counseling.  If the matter is not resolved by the 30th day of  counseling or if ADR is unsuccessful, the counselor is required to inform  the employee in writing of his or her right to file a formal discrimination  complaint with the agency.  The written notice must inform the employee  of the (1) right to file a discrimination complaint within 15 days of receipt  of the notice, (2) appropriate agency official with whom to file a complaint,  and (3) duty to ensure that the agency is informed immediately if the  complainant retains counsel or a representative.", "After a complainant files a formal discrimination complaint, the agency  must decide whether to accept or dismiss the complaint.  If the agency  dismisses the complaint, the complainant can appeal the dismissal to  EEOC.  If the agency accepts the complaint, it must investigate the  complaint and present the complainant with a report of the investigation  results.  The complainant may then choose between requesting a hearing  before an EEOC administrative judge or a final decision from the agency.

The number of employees with disabilities increased slightly  from about 10 percent in fiscal year 1997 to 11 percent in fiscal year 2001.   Over the 5-year period, most of the Region X workforce was in the general  schedule (GS) grade levels 5 through 12.  The distribution across grade  levels by EEO group varied somewhat but was generally close to the  representation of the various EEO groups in the Region\u2019s workforce.  The  main differences were higher proportions of men in the GS-13 through 15  grade levels and higher representation of African Americans and Hispanics  in the GS-5 through 8 grades.  As discussed in the section on hiring,  substantial numbers of African Americans and Hispanics have been hired  over the last few years, which may explain their higher representation in  grades GS-5 through 8.

Because career ladder promotions do not  involve current competition, we focused on competitive promotions.  We  calculated the percentage of promotions received by members of each EEO  group over the 5-year period and compared it with the group\u2019s average  percentage of the workforce overall.

Appendix A to MD-110, which contains  methods for seeking resolution, suggests that during precomplaint  counseling, the counselor talk or meet with agency officials to explain the  employee\u2019s allegations, afford the agency an opportunity to present its  position concerning the allegations, and suggest how the problem might be  resolved.", "SSA\u2019s then Associate Commissioner of OCREO said that the changes made  by Region X in the informal EEO process, although not illegal, were  counter to the spirit of the regulations and the related guidance, MD-110.   The then Associate Commissioner said that by having written EEO  counselor queries and managers\u2019 responses and involving OGC, the  informal stage of the EEO process in Region X was more like an  investigation in the formal stage of the EEO process.  In addition, in a June  2001 letter to a Region X employee, SSA\u2019s then Deputy Commissioner for  Human Resources wrote that, \u201cExcept in rare instances, OGC should not be  involved in the precomplaint process.\u201d  When asked whether OGC was  involved in the informal stage of the EEO complaint process in other SSA  regions, the then Associate Commissioner for OCREO said that he has  never had any complaints or allegations that OGC was involved in the  informal part of the process in other regions.", "In addition, the EEOC regulations require that all agencies ensure that all  agency employees provide full cooperation to EEO personnel in the  processing and resolution of precomplaint matters.  According to a recent  EEOC report, the involvement of OGC during the informal stage of the  EEO process may thwart attempts during counseling to resolve matters  before the filing of a formal complaint.  An EEOC official responsible for  overseeing agencies\u2019 EEO programs said that involving OGC in the informal  stage of the process causes EEOC concern because complaints should be  resolved informally and OGC involvement can hinder the counselor\u2019s  ability to facilitate resolution.  This official added that having managers put  responses to counselors\u2019 queries in writing and involving OGC at the  informal stage of the process could drag out the process and that the longer  the process takes, the less likely it is to result in an informal settlement.  In  addition, the EEOC official said that EEOC encourages alternative dispute  resolution (ADR), and requiring managers to put responses in writing is  counter to ADR.

The handbook for managers also  states that the manager\u2019s cooperation with the counselor is required by  regulation and that the manager may have a representative present when  meeting with an EEO counselor.  Thus, the language in the handbook for  managers is similar to appendix A of MD-110, which suggests that the  counselor talk or meet with agency officials and points out the requirement  of EEOC\u2019s regulations that all agencies ensure that all agency employees  provide full cooperation to EEO personnel in the processing and resolution  of precomplaint matters."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Has Not Adopted Procedures for Counselors Processing EEO Complaints as Required by EEOC Regulations", "paragraphs": ["In doing our work on Region X, we asked SSA headquarters and Region X  for documents pertaining to the processing of EEO complaints.

However, the handbooks, which were issued in November 1995, do not  contain agency-specific procedures on how EEO counselors are to process  such complaints.  Under EEOC\u2019s regulations, agencies have certain  responsibilities for maintaining a continuing affirmative program to  promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory  practices and policies.  In order to implement their programs, the  regulations require agencies to (1) make written materials available to all  employees and applicants informing them of the variety of EEO programs  and administrative and judicial remedial procedures available to them and  (2) prominently post such materials in all personnel and EEO offices and  throughout the workplace.  In addition, the regulations require agencies  to adopt procedures for processing\u2014both at the informal and formal  stage\u2014individual and class complaints of discrimination that are  consistent with all other applicable provisions of the regulations and the  instructions for complaint processing contained in MD-110.", "SSA has addressed two of these regulatory requirements.  It has  communicated in memorandums to all employees its policy prohibiting  discrimination against employees and applicants for employment, most  recently in a February 10, 2003, memorandum.

The EEOC official said that EEOC anticipated that when agencies adopted  such procedures, they would be in writing, so others could review them, if  necessary.

The official said he thinks it is  appropriate for agencies to have standard operating procedures, especially  when they have more than one installation or operations spread across  installations or regions, to help ensure consistent compliance with the  regulations.

Without agency-specific procedures for EEO counselors to process  complaints of discrimination, counselors in different components could  use different procedures, with the result that employees are not treated  consistently.

During fiscal years 1997  through 2001, the official said that often, because of time constraints, the  system\u2014which required a code for race/ethnicity\u2014was coded with  unverified data (i.e., White) so the action could go through and the  employee be paid.  The official said that in August 2002 SSA began  requiring the human resources staff processing the new hire personnel  actions to have the completed form with race/ethnicity submitted  electronically or by fax on the day the employee reports for duty, so the  data can be coded properly into the initial accession action.  An OPM  official analyzed Region X data on hires and confirmed that submissions of  subsequent personnel actions updated race/ethnicity for some Region X  employees.
