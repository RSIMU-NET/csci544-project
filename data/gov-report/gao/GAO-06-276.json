A trigger could result in a \"hard\" or automatic response, unless Congress and the President acted to override or alter it. Alternatively, reaching a trigger could require a \"soft\" response, such as a report on the causes of the overage, development of a plan to address it, or an explicit and formal decision to accept or reject a proposed action or increase. By identifying significant increases in the spending path of a mandatory program relatively early and acting to constrain it, Congress may avert larger financial challenges in the future. However, both in establishing triggers and in designing the subsequent responses, the integrity of program goals needs to be preserved. In addition, tax expenditures operate like mandatory programs but do not compete in the annual appropriations process. The analysis GAO applied to spending in this report would also be useful in examining tax expenditures. The budget experts GAO consulted had mixed views of triggers. Proponents of triggers noted that mandatory spending is currently unconstrained and a mechanism that causes decision makers to at least periodically reevaluate spending is better than allowing spending to rise unchecked. Others, however, expressed considerable skepticism about the effectiveness of triggers; many felt they would either be circumvented or ignored. While GAO appreciates the views expressed by budget experts, in our opinion establishing budget triggers warrants consideration in efforts to constrain significant and largely unchecked growth in mandatory programs. However, recognizing the natural tension in balancing both long-term fiscal challenges and other public policy goals, each program needs to be considered individually to ensure that any responses triggered strike the appropriate balance between the long-term fiscal challenge and the program goals. To better understand growth in mandatory spending and thus inform GAO's thinking on triggers, for seven case study accounts GAO categorized the reasons provided by agencies for differences between estimated and actual outlays during a 5-year period as the result of legislative, economic, or technical changes. Out of 40 differences, subsequent legislation was the primary reason for 19, economic changes for 7, and technical changes for 13. In many cases, a combination of these factors caused the differences."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the next few decades as the baby boom generation retires and health  care costs continue to rise, federal spending on retirement and health  programs\u2014Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal pension,  health, and disability programs\u2014will grow dramatically.  Absent policy  changes on the spending and/or revenue sides of the budget, a growing  imbalance between expected federal spending and tax revenues will mean  escalating and ultimately unsustainable federal deficits and debt that  threaten our future economy and national security as well as the standard  of living for the American people.", "Given rising deficits, the expiration of the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA)  of 1990, and the long-term fiscal outlook, new budget control mechanisms  are needed.   Accordingly, there have been calls for the reintroduction of  discretionary spending caps and PAYGO rules.  Although PAYGO was  effective in preventing legislative actions that increased the deficit, it did  not address increases that occurred absent legislative action. Constraining  the growth of existing mandatory spending programs requires additional  action.", "In our 1994 report on capping mandatory spending, we noted that an  alternative method to prompt congressional review of mandatory spending  trends would be to require Congress to vote periodically on whether or not  to make program changes when mandatory spending exceeds certain  targets.  One way to do this and potentially achieve greater fiscal  responsibility would be to create triggers for individual mandatory  programs\u2014predetermined spending or revenue thresholds\u2014that signal the  need for some type of action to be taken on the program.  Once tripped, the  trigger could drive either a review or an automatic action.  It could, for  example, trigger a requirement for Congress to either review or reaffirm  acceptance of the unexpected increase in actual program spending or  projections.  Alternatively, it could trigger previously specified changes to  the program that automatically take effect to reduce spending or increase  program revenue.", "Insufficient transparency regarding both the expected and actual cost path  for spending and revenue decisions hampers the ability of decision makers  to make informed choices.  In previous work, we have called for increased  disclosure and recognition of long-term costs of proposed policies and  programs.  The ability to monitor actual spending paths can also play an  important role in decisions about both the overall fiscal position and the  allocation of scarce resources.  Moreover, as we reported in 1994, a cap on  mandatory spending would have little if any effect on the longer-term  growth trends until and unless issues of underlying program eligibility and  benefits are addressed. Thus, efforts to constrain growth in mandatory  programs need to be focused on and tailored to individual programs.  One  way to assess mandatory spending is to analyze growth by examining the  estimated and actual outlays for each program. Because budget estimates  can be linked to achieving fiscal responsibility in the government,  identifying and understanding recurring patterns between mandatory  account budget estimates and actual results can facilitate future budget  decisions.", "This report, prepared as part of our basic statutory responsibility for  monitoring the condition of the nation\u2019s finances, examines issues related  to using such triggers on mandatory programs.  The objectives were to   (1) determine the feasibility of designing and using trigger mechanisms to  constrain growth in mandatory spending and (2) provide an analysis of the  factors that led to differences between estimated and actual outlays in  seven mandatory budget accounts during fiscal years 2000 through 2004.", "This report does not deal with the question of projected costs at the time  decisions are made but instead with the need for responses when there is  significant growth. Analogous analyses could be applied to the revenue  side of the budget (e.g., tax expenditures)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BEA divided federal spending into two broad categories:  discretionary  and mandatory.  Discretionary spending refers to outlays from budget  authority that is provided in and controlled by appropriation acts; it can  and has been controlled through annual, adjustable dollar limits (spending  caps) that permanently lower the base for future appropriations.  Mandatory spending refers to outlays resulting from budget authority that  is provided in laws other than appropriation acts, for example, entitlement  programs such as Medicare, Food Stamps, and veterans\u2019 pensions.   Mandatory spending\u2014like tax expenditures\u2014is governed by eligibility  rules and benefit formulas, which means that funds are spent as required to  provide benefits to those who are eligible and wish to participate.  Therefore, unforeseen events such as changes in the economy or additional  demands for services can translate into unanticipated additional program  outlays. Congress controls spending for these programs indirectly by  defining eligibility and setting the benefit or payment rules rather than  directly through appropriation acts.  On an annual basis, however,  mandatory spending is relatively uncontrollable since Congress and the  President must change substantive law in order to further increase or  decrease outlays.  This makes it more challenging to constrain costs and to  design both triggers and triggered responses.", "Over the past 4 decades, we have seen mandatory spending grow as a share  of the total federal budget. For example, figure 1 shows that spending on  mandatory programs rose from approximately 42 percent of total federal  spending in 1984 to about 49 percent in 1994, and to 54 percent in 2004.  This growth is projected to continue with mandatory programs claiming  about 58 percent of total federal spending in 2010.", "The nation\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook is daunting under many different  policy scenarios and assumptions.  For instance, under a fiscally restrained  scenario, if discretionary spending grew only with inflation over the next 10  years and all existing tax cuts expire when scheduled under current law,  spending for Social Security and health care programs would grow to  consume over three-quarters of federal revenues by 2040 (see fig. 2).  On  the other hand, if discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the  economy\u2014measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\u2014in the near term  and if all tax cuts were extended, federal revenues may just be adequate to  pay interest on the growing federal debt by 2040 (see fig. 3).  Numerous  alternative scenarios can be developed incorporating different  combinations of possible policy choices and economic assumptions, but  these two scenarios can be viewed as \u201cbookends\u201d showing a range of  possible outcomes.", "As both these simulations illustrate, absent policy changes on the spending  and/or revenue side of the budget, the growth in spending on federal  retirement and health entitlements will encumber an escalating share of the  government\u2019s resources. Neither slowing the growth in discretionary  spending nor allowing the tax provisions to expire\u2014nor both together\u2014 would eliminate the imbalance. Although revenues will be part of the  debate about our fiscal future, making no changes to Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, and other drivers of the long-term fiscal gap would  require at least a doubling of taxes\u2014and that seems implausible.  Accordingly, substantive reform of Social Security and our major health  programs remains critical to recapturing our future fiscal flexibility.", "These long-term spending projections can largely be attributed to the aging  population and increased health care costs.  This does not, however, mean  that the rest of the budget should be exempt from review.  It is important to  periodically look at mandatory accounts in order to determine possible  ways to constrain spending and ensure a more accurate and responsible  federal budget process.", "Congressional interest in fiscal discipline and the adoption of budget tools  to control mandatory spending are not new. The Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, commonly referred to as Gramm- Rudman-Hollings (GRH), established declining deficit targets and a  sequestration procedure to reduce spending if those targets were  exceeded. GRH was amended several times, most significantly by BEA in  1990. One important reason for BEA\u2019s success in reducing the deficit during  the 1990s was that the process enforced a previously reached agreement to  reduce the deficit.  However, recurring surpluses at the end of the decade  caused a new debate to emerge and undermined the acceptance of BEA\u2019s  spending caps and PAYGO enforcement. BEA rules were not extended  beyond their scheduled expiration date at the end of fiscal year 2002.", "In the past, mandatory spending caps were proposed as a way to control  the growth of mandatory programs. This idea was discussed in a report we  issued in 1994. Mandatory caps fail to address underlying eligibility and  benefits formulas\u2014which drive spending. In addition, if caps were imposed  in the context of a control requiring across-the-board spending cuts, they  would present agencies with difficulties in successfully reducing their  program spending to stay within limits, and perhaps lead to a cycle of  continual sequestrations. This difficulty is because in such a regime, any  shortfalls in savings or growth in spending that occurred despite agency  efforts would be added to the amount of cuts required in the next year.  Moreover, the mandatory programs that would be most affected by a cap\u2014 because of their high and/or volatile growth rates\u2014are also the programs  for which a cap would be hardest to implement.", "In the mid-1990s, there was a period when the idea of constraining greater-  than-expected growth through the use of triggers surfaced.  However, it  coincided with a period when actual growth generally was less than  expected.  Recently, with the reappearance of large deficits, there has been  a resurgence of interest in restoring budget controls and containing the  growth in both discretionary and mandatory spending.  For example, in  2005, numerous bills to reinstate fiscal discipline were proposed.   Moreover, in May 2005, OMB issued a memo to agencies that required them  to propose offsets to any administrative action that would increase  mandatory spending.", "Budget estimates and actual outlays are determined over a period that  spans nearly 2 years: from the time the President\u2019s budget is formulated,  about a year before the start of the fiscal year in question, to the  completion of that fiscal year.  Within this 2-year lag period between  original estimates and actual outlays, legislative, economic, and technical  factors can affect program outlays. Budget estimates are revised part way  through the fiscal year and included in the budget request for the following  fiscal year. These revisions reflect updated technical and economic  assumptions as well as any legislative changes.  Also, midsession reviews  conducted during the summer, usually in July, update budget estimates  prior to the completion of the fiscal year. In addition, both CBO and OMB  estimate the cost of bills that affect mandatory spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the feasibility of  designing and using trigger mechanisms to constrain growth in mandatory  spending and (2) provide an analysis of the factors (legislative, economic,  and technical) that led to differences between estimated and actual outlays  in seven mandatory budget accounts during fiscal years 2000 through 2004.   This second objective contributed to our understanding of programs,  helped us better appreciate the reasons behind growth in mandatory  accounts that experienced relatively large dollar changes, and more fully  informed our thinking about triggers.", "To accomplish our first objective, we performed a literature search on  mechanisms to constrain mandatory spending and had discussions with  numerous budget experts from OMB, CBO, the Senate Budget Committee  staff, and various policy research organizations. Based on our research,  interviews at agencies, and discussions with experts, we then considered  possible approaches for budgetary constraint within each account.", "To accomplish our second objective we extracted from OMB\u2019s budget  database mandatory outlays of accounts where 50 percent or more of the  outlays were mandatory. We analyzed these data for fiscal years 2000  through 2004. To determine the estimated and actual outlays for each year,  we used the original budget estimate and the actual outlays reported 2  years later, after the end of the fiscal year.  For example, when determining  the difference between estimated and actual outlays for fiscal year 2000,  we compared the fiscal year 2000 budget estimates published in February  1999 to the actual outlays published in February 2001.", "From the 534 accounts with outlays at least half mandatory, we selected the  top 10 accounts that experienced the greatest average dollar change  between original estimate and actual outlays in absolute value terms for 5  fiscal years (2000\u20132004).  The complete list of these accounts is included as  appendix III.   These 10 accounts, which represent approximately 50  percent of total average mandatory outlays, include (1) Interest on  Treasury Debt Securities, (2) Unemployment Trust Fund, (3) Commodity  Credit Corporation Fund, (4) Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance  Trust Fund (Medicare Part B), (5) Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund  (Medicare Part A), (6) Grants to States for Medicaid, (7) Rail Industry  Pension Fund, (8) Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDLP) Account,  (9) Payments to Health Care Trust Funds, and (10) Mutual Mortgage  Insurance Program Account (MMI). Because many of the programs we  selected are relatively big, large dollar increases may represent small  percentage increases relative to program size.", "After initial analysis, we excluded three of these accounts from further  analysis: Interest on Treasury Debt Securities, MMI, and Payments to  Health Care Trust Funds. We eliminated the U.S. Treasury account because  interest payments are a function of all other funding decisions and thus  provide little insight into trigger design. We excluded the MMI account  because the program itself is discretionary\u2014only the large mandatory  reestimates of its credit subsidy required by the Federal Credit Reform Act  of 1990 caused it to fall into our original sample.  Because decisions about  the size of this program are annually made in the appropriations process  and can be informed by the reestimates of previous years\u2019 loans, there is no  need for separate triggers.  Finally, we excluded the Payments to Health  Care Trust Funds account because the payments are classified as  intragovernmental transfers and therefore do not affect overall budget  outlay data. Moreover, these transfers are captured within other accounts  in our sample.", "Figure 4 below shows the 5-year average difference between estimated and  actual mandatory outlays in absolute value terms for the seven accounts  we reviewed.  These differences ranged from $9.4 billion in the  Unemployment Trust Fund to $2.6 billion in FDLP.", "To gain more perspective on what factors contributed to the differences  between estimated and actual outlays in the remaining seven accounts, we  met with officials from the cognizant agencies to determine if the reasons  behind the differences were (1) legislative, (2) economic, (3) technical, or a  combination of the three.  We did not independently verify the explanations  agencies provided for differences.", "Our work was done between May 2005 and January 2006 in Washington,  D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trigger Mechanisms Could Help Constrain Mandatory Spending but Must Be Carefully Designed", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of a budget trigger is to either automatically cause some  action to occur or to prompt decision makers to evaluate and consider  responding to rising costs.  For example, where differences between  expected and actual growth in a program exceed a specified amount,  Congress could decide explicitly\u2014by voting\u2014whether to accept the  slippage or could take action to bring the spending path closer to the  original goal by recouping some or all of the slippage through changes in  the program.  Our background research, work in case study agencies, and  discussions with budget experts highlighted several issues to consider  when designing triggers and their resulting actions, such as the extent of  agreement among decision makers about underlying fiscal goals, measures  selected to trip the trigger, and the triggered response.", "While a budget process can surface important issues, it is not a substitute  for substantive debate\u2014no process can force agreement where one does  not exist.  Accordingly, the success of any effort to constrain growth  depends on whether there is widespread agreement on the underlying  goals; absent such agreement, any trigger would likely be circumvented.  For example, underlying the successful budget enforcement mechanisms  embodied in BEA was the broadly accepted goal of deficit reduction and an  agreement on a specific set of legislative changes to reach that goal. Its  triggers were centered around measures that Congress could control\u2014 discretionary spending caps and changes to entitlement and tax laws.  However, once the budget moved into surplus in the late 1990s and there  was no longer agreement on fiscal goals, actions were taken to bypass BEA  controls. For example, the consolidated appropriations acts for both fiscal  years 2000 and 2001 mandated that OMB change the PAYGO scorecard  balance to zero. Both OMB and CBO estimated that without instructions to  change the scorecard, sequestrations would have been required in 2001.", "Other countries we have studied have sought to address national priorities  by developing explicit goals to guide fiscal policy and justifying their goals  with compelling rationales that often pointed out the potential fiscal and  economic benefits of budgetary discipline. In a 2000 report, we noted that  having fiscal goals anchored by a rationale that is compelling enough to  make continued restraint acceptable is critical to sustain support for  budgetary discipline."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issues to Consider in Constructing a Trigger", "paragraphs": ["One of the reasons for the success of BEA was its link to congressional  action.  Discretionary spending caps and PAYGO constrained  congressional action\u2014BEA held Congress accountable only for things it  could control and not for the effect of economic or technical factors on  spending or revenues. This was both the strength and the limitation of  PAYGO. Triggers seek to go beyond the PAYGO regime by subjecting  program growth to scrutiny even where that growth is the result of  economic, population, or other factors outside congressional control.  Triggers recognize that even the best estimates can turn out to be wrong  and that decision makers who expected one path might wish to consider  changes in a program where the path is significantly different from what  was anticipated.", "In general, there are two types of responses to budget triggers\u2014soft and  hard\u2014depending on what type of action results when the trigger is tripped.  A \u201csoft\u201d response prompts special consideration of a program or a proposal  for action when a certain threshold or target is breached.  Examples of soft  responses that could be triggered include requiring the administering  agency to prepare a special report explaining why the trigger\u2019s threshold  was breached, or requiring the President to submit a proposal for reform.   An example of a soft response already exists in the Medicare program,  which requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress for action if  the Medicare Trustees determine in 2 consecutive years that the general  revenue share of Medicare spending is projected to exceed 45 percent  during a 7-year period.   In addition, a few Social Security reform  proposals have included language requiring presidential and congressional  action if the Social Security Board of Trustees determines that the balance  ratio of either of the Social Security trust funds will be zero for any  calendar year during the succeeding 75 years.", "Soft responses can help in alerting decision makers of potential problems  but they do not ensure that action to decrease spending or increase  revenue is taken.  With soft responses, the fiscal path continues unless  Congress and the President take action. In contrast, a trigger could lead to  \u201chard\u201d responses requiring a predetermined, program-specific action to  take place, such as changes in eligibility criteria and benefit formulas,  automatic revenue increases, or automatic spending cuts.  With hard  responses, spending is automatically constrained, revenue is automatically  increased, or both, unless Congress takes action to override.  Figure 5  below illustrates the conceptual differences between hard and soft  responses of a budget trigger.", "In establishing triggers, both near- and long-term perspectives need be  considered.  For some programs it might be appropriate to tie triggers to  historical data. For example, unexpected spending growth in student loans  might be measured against past historical spending data.  However, for  other programs that expose the government to long-term commitments\u2014 such as Medicare or Social Security\u2014it might be more appropriate to tie  the trigger to projections of future spending.   Social Security, however,  represents a large long-term commitment of future resources.  Thus,  growth for this program might be measured against changes in actuarial  projections of Social Security\u2019s 75-year outlook.  Such an approach could  be used for other programs with long-term commitments, such as pension  insurance, if good long-term projections become available.", "Since all estimates are subject to some uncertainty, the triggering  mechanism should not be so tight that it is overly sensitive to normal  variation in budget estimation.  One way to address this concern is to  establish a normal or expected range of budget uncertainty and set a trigger  level that falls outside this range.  For example, if a program\u2019s actual  outlays historically fall within plus or minus 5 percent of estimated outlays,  a trigger set at a level greater than 5 percent would best signal unexpected  growth.  This approach resembles one CBO uses for certain programs to  analyze the budgetary effects of legislative proposals.  Using a  probabilistic model, CBO estimates the weighted average of the effects  associated with all possible sets of circumstances, taking into account their  respective probabilities.  Such an approach could be adapted to establish a  range of uncertainty around a budget estimate.", "Triggers also could be used to ensure that policy changes actually achieve  intended reductions in spending growth.  Such triggers could address  concerns that some budget constraint mechanisms create the false  impression that long-term problems have been addressed.", "Although any hard response can be overridden by congressional action, it  could be important to incorporate a more automatic escape clause into  budget enforcement mechanisms such as triggers.  Effective budget  enforcement mechanisms need to be able to accommodate changing  budget policy and political environments in which future outcomes are  difficult to predict.  For example, periods of economic growth may be brief  or sustained, but inevitably are followed by periods of economic downturn  that may be shallow or deep.  Escape mechanisms, such as expiration  dates, allow budget policies and procedures to be renegotiated later.  In  addition to expiration dates, House or Senate rules can provide flexibility.   For example, any Senator may raise a point of order against legislation  violating PAYGO rules prohibiting consideration of revenue or direct  spending legislation that is not deficit-neutral. However, the point of order  may be waived if there is broad consensus on the need to do so\u2014that is, if  there is an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the membership.", "Although they provide important flexibility, escape clauses can be  overused.  For example, in fiscal year 2002, the Department of Defense and  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act instructed that $130.3  billion in costs be eliminated from the PAYGO scorecard.  Both OMB and  CBO estimated that without instructions to change the scorecard, a  sequester\u2014across-the-board spending cuts\u2014would have been required in  2002.  In addition, many programs were exempt from PAYGO\u2019s  sequestration requirement.  These exemptions meant that the full brunt of  any sequester was concentrated in the remaining programs, resulting in  cuts so draconian that Congress and the President changed the targets  rather than impose the required cuts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues to Consider in Designing the Triggered Response", "paragraphs": ["Whether a triggered response is soft, hard, or a combination of the two,  efforts to constrain growth in mandatory programs need to be focused at  the program level.  The experience with GRH highlights the importance of  individually designed triggers and responses.   The deficit-neutrality targets  under GRH triggered a hard response\u2014across-the-board spending cuts\u2014if  they were not met.  The deficit targets under GRH were not achieved due to  the inability of Congress and the President to control all of the factors\u2014 mainly economic factors\u2014that affected whether the trigger would be  breached and their unwillingness to accept the across-the-board cuts that  would have been necessary to meet the deficit targets.", "In developing program-specific triggers and responses, proposed changes  in underlying benefits structure and design of mandatory programs can be  considered in the context of the factors that drove the growth and the goals  and objectives of specific programs.  For example, certain programs such  as unemployment insurance and crop assistance are designed and intended  to have a countercyclical effect on the economy.  That is, they are aimed at  reducing the size and duration of swings in economic activity in order to  keep economic growth closer to a pace consistent with low inflation and  high employment.  Thus, a triggered response in these programs needs to  be sensitive to whether growth is being driven by automatic budget  stabilizers.  For example, a rise in the unemployment rate would by design  increase outlays in federal unemployment insurance not only to provide  assistance to the unemployed but also to stabilize the economy.  If a trigger  were established that resulted in a contractionary response, it could  undermine these important goals and exacerbate the effects of  unemployment on the economy.  In a January 2002 report, the  Congressional Research Service (CRS) suggested one option to avoid  procyclical triggers would be to delegate to some entity\u2014for instance  Congress or an executive department\u2014the responsibility for evaluating  each year whether deteriorating economic conditions would make a trigger  detrimental.  If conditions were found to be deteriorating, decisions would  need to be made about whether and how to implement any reduction. CRS  acknowledged, however, that this type of proposal could be criticized on  the grounds that it is based on a subjective decision and thus could be prey  to the sort of political pressures that critics fear would undermine a trigger.   Indeed, one budget expert we met with expressed concern that in devising  a budget trigger, it would be helpful to acknowledge political pressures by  considering who would judge progress against the trigger and the neutrality  of the judging entity.", "The programs and agencies we reviewed have objectives and missions that  contribute to the achievement of public policy goals such as income  security, feeding the nation, fostering higher education, and providing  health care. To these ends, these programs are designed to provide  entitlements\u2014benefits and assistance\u2014to eligible recipients. While  striving to meet these commitments, our nation is faced with a daunting  long-term fiscal outlook based on the challenges of an aging population,  unsustainable deficits, and mounting debt while also ensuring truth and  transparency.  Figure 6 depicts the inherent tension in balancing public  policy goals and long-term fiscal challenges.", "Addressing this tension invariably entails difficult political choices among  competing programs that promise benefits to many Americans but are  collectively unaffordable and unsustainable at current revenue levels. In  February 2005 we highlighted the size of fiscal imbalances looming in the  future and the challenge of our policy process to act with more foresight to  take early action on problems that may not constitute an urgent crisis but  pose important longer-term threats to the nation\u2019s fiscal, economic,  security, and societal future. Budget triggers are mechanisms that can  encourage and facilitate such action.", "To help us better consider the implications of establishing triggers, we  looked at seven mandatory accounts with relatively large differences  between estimated and actual outlays: Commodity Credit Corporation  (CCC), Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account, Grants to States for  Medicaid, Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund (Medicare Part A),  Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund (Medicare  Part B), Rail Industry Pension Fund, and the Unemployment Trust Fund.   We explored ways in which existing triggers and their corresponding  actions could be revised, as well as an array of new trigger mechanisms  that take into consideration the issues just discussed and could be adopted  to promote better budgeting in light of the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook.", "It is important to consider the data upon which the trigger will hinge\u2014 future projections based on historical data, growth as a percent of GDP,  total growth, or another measure altogether.  For example, Congress has  established a trigger to constrain growth in Medicare spending for  physicians\u2019 services.  The sustainable growth rate (SGR) is a statutorily set  formula that estimates the allowed rate of increase in spending for  physicians\u2019 services; that rate is used to construct the spending target for  the following calendar year. If actual spending exceeds the cumulative SGR  targets, fee updates in future years must be lowered sufficiently both to  offset the accumulated excess spending and to slow expected spending for  the coming year. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established another trigger\u2014the general  revenue share of Medicare spending.  If the Medicare Trustees determine in  2 consecutive years that the general revenue share is projected to exceed  45 percent during a 7-year projection period, the President must submit a  proposal to Congress for action.  To date, this threshold has not been  breached and thus no response has been triggered.  However, Medicare  Trustees are expected to determine the first breach in their upcoming 2006  report as the trigger is projected to be tripped in 2012, which falls within  the 7-year projection period captured in that report. For unemployment  insurance, a trigger was established around balances in the Unemployment  Trust Fund.  When funds accumulating in federal unemployment accounts  reach statutorily set limits, a distribution of the \u201cexcess\u201d funds from the  trust fund to individual states\u2019 accounts\u2014called \u201cReed Distributions\u201d\u2014 are automatically triggered based on each state\u2019s share of covered wages.   One way to constrain federal spending would be to increase the statutory  cap on federal unemployment accounts, thus making it more difficult to  trigger Reed Distributions to states.  By making it more difficult to trip the  trigger, funds could continue to build during economic prosperity and be  available to states when truly needed to counter rising unemployment.", "Our analysis allowed us to develop a list of illustrative examples, which  analyze the related trade-offs involved in balancing restraint with  optimization of program goals.  These are shown in appendix I, along with a  brief description of the program and account.  Finally, where appropriate  we present illustrative examples of hard responses that could be  established to constrain spending.  We do not specifically advocate any of  these approaches\u2014they are presented for illustrative purposes only to  provide a sense of the types of trigger and resulting actions that could be  established.  Although the illustrative examples we developed apply  specifically to the seven case study accounts that we reviewed, we believe  the information can further the larger policy conversation about how to  increase oversight of the path of mandatory spending and advance and  encourage budgetary discipline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expert Views on Trigger Mechanisms Are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["We interviewed budget experts from OMB, CBO, the Senate Budget  Committee staff, and various policy research organizations to discuss  views on using triggers to constrain mandatory spending. Overall, views  were mixed.  While some were more in favor of triggers than others, many  expressed concern that they would be circumvented or ignored, thereby  questioning their effectiveness.  In addition, many were concerned that  triggers could jeopardize the underlying intent of mandatory programs.   Several experts also pointed to the need to ensure that any triggers  developed be carefully designed to avoid procyclical effects.", "Some of the experts expressed strong support for budget triggers.  These  individuals believed that triggers with hard responses had the potential to  constrain mandatory spending and that the accountability added by  triggers would be preferable to the current unconstrained environment.", "For example, one expressed concern about the debt burden being  permitted to mount for future generations in order to avoid the reduction in  benefits or increase in taxes needed to finance current benefits.  Linking  revenues and spending with GDP, she argued, would help avoid such  generational inequities.  Another added that under current policy, spending  grows automatically, by default, faster than tax revenues as the population  ages and health costs soar.  He argued that only by changing the budget\u2019s  autopilot programming can we gain the flexibility needed to continually  improve government policies and services.", "Others, however, said that triggers reduced accountability because they  enable decision makers to publicly extol budget constraint but quietly  continue to increase spending.  One pointed to \u201caccounting tricks\u201d that  have resulted from triggers with hard responses, such as when Congress  mandated certain costs not be counted against spending limits so as to  avoid across-the-board cuts.  However, as discussed previously, triggers  also could be used to ensure that policy changes actually achieve intended  reductions in spending growth.  Such triggers could address concerns that  some budget constraint mechanisms create the false impression that long- term problems have been addressed.", "Many expressed skepticism that budget constraint mechanisms such as  triggers would be adhered to; one cited Medicare\u2019s SGR as an example.  The  SGR system is designed to apply financial brakes whenever actual spending  for physicians\u2019 services exceeds predefined spending targets.  It does this  by reducing physician fees or limiting their annual increase.  Because the  actual versus target spending comparison is cumulative, future fee updates  are reduced to lower future actual spending below future target spending  until total cumulative actual spending is the same as total cumulative target  spending. However, fee declines were averted for 2003, 2004, and 2005 by  administrative and legislative actions that modified or overrode the SGR  system.", "Some experts worried that applying budget triggers to various mandatory  spending programs would divert attention from the real source of the  nation\u2019s fiscal woes\u2014health care\u2014whose costs continue to rise faster than  GDP. They pointed to CBO data as evidence that, outside of health care and  to a lesser extent Social Security, virtually all other mandatory programs  are decreasing or holding steady as a percent of GDP.   Accordingly, they  expressed concern that establishing triggers on such programs could  mislead the public into thinking that the long-term fiscal problem had been  addressed, thus delaying efforts to appropriately address it.", "Many of the budget experts raised concerns about triggers jeopardizing the  important underlying missions and program goals financed by mandatory  accounts.  In particular, concerns were raised about undermining  countercyclical effects of programs such as unemployment insurance,  Food Stamps, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Some noted that the  desire to preserve program goals is the reason why triggers with hard  responses have not worked in the past.  With respect to the SGR, for  example, one expert explained that the reason Congress overrides the  trigger is to ensure doctors do not stop accepting Medicare patients.", "Finally, a couple of experts pointed out that triggers need not only apply to  spending; the revenue side of the budget should also be addressed.  One  noted, for example, that an increase in taxes to cover spending growth  would increase visibility to the public and thus permit the American people  to be more aware of how much they are paying for services.  Applying  triggers to tax cuts was an issue considered in 2001 when the budget was in  surplus and tax cuts were proposed.  For example, Federal Reserve  Chairman Greenspan at that time expressed his preference for a trigger  that would make tax cuts contingent on the realized net debt level.   Comptroller General Walker also raised the possibility of using a trigger to  return a \u201csurplus dividend\u201d if actual surpluses occurred in excess of  specific levels.  Ultimately, however, triggers were not adopted.  Instead,  tax cuts were enacted through 2010 even though substantial deficits have  reappeared.  In addition, as we reported in a February 2005 testimony,  there has been an extensive use of tax incentives, rather than direct  spending authority, to fund social objectives. As we reported in September  2005, the sum of revenue loss estimates associated with tax  expenditures\u2014such as tax exclusions, credits, and deductions\u2014was nearly  $730 billion in 2004.  Many tax expenditures operate like mandatory  spending programs and generally are not subject to reauthorization.  Such  tax expenditures are embedded in the tax system and are off the radar  screen for the most part.  This is a concern from a budgetary standpoint  because federal dollars committed to fund these expenditures do not  compete in the annual appropriations process and are effectively \u201cfully  funded\u201d before any discretionary spending is considered.   The analysis we  applied to spending in this report would also be useful in examining tax  expenditures.  However, challenges in defining and measuring tax  expenditures, to some extent, would affect any effort to curtail revenues  foregone through tax expenditures.  For example, after taxpayers have  taken advantage of tax expenditures, the federal government still may not  know, with much certainty, how much tax revenue was foregone, who  benefited, and what results were achieved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Differences between Estimated and Actual Outlays in Selected Accounts Varied", "paragraphs": ["To better appreciate the reasons behind growth in mandatory accounts and  thus inform our thinking on triggers, we examined the reasons for  differences between originally estimated and actual outlays for seven  mandatory accounts that experienced relatively large dollar changes.

Furthermore, the Act provided up to 13 additional weeks of federally  funded benefits to workers in states with especially high unemployment  rates.  Congress renewed this extension in April 2003, which allowed  qualified individuals to file for federal extensions through December 2003  and collect on those extensions through December 2004.

For example, Crop Disaster Assistance  programs are funded through supplemental appropriations every year  throughout the 5-year period that we reviewed, which led to an additional  total of $6 billion in program outlays.  According to OMB officials, the  Administration prefers not to include estimates in the budget for relatively  unpredictable disaster-related programs such as crop disaster assistance.   Instead, such funding is typically initiated by Congress through  supplemental appropriations.  Accordingly, for all 5 years we examined,  no estimates were provided and all of the outlays were as a result of  supplemental appropriations.", "Legislative action that increased market loss assistance payments to corn  producers largely contributed to the greatest underestimates of outlays for  that particular commodity\u2014nearly $9 billion in 2000 and 2001 together.

Furthermore, both the HI and SMI trust funds incurred  unanticipated additional outlays as a result of MMA.  Several of the  provisions under MMA were implemented in 2004 and directly affected that  year\u2019s outlays; however, officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) said that the largest factors that led to additional HI outlays  of approximately $4.4 billion and additional SMI outlays of nearly $12.3  billion were the substantially increased payments to private health plans  and rural health providers, as well as the increased physician payment  update\u2014all of which were provided for under MMA.", "Finally, the Railroad Retirement and Survivors\u2019 Improvement Act of 2001  changed a number of benefit and eligibility criteria, which led to a sharp  rise in retirements.

Economic factors also affected the hospital market basket, which  contributed to greater-than-expected Medicare outlays.", "For CCC\u2019s corn program, market prices were both underestimated and  overestimated over the 5-year period.  According to a Department of  Agriculture (USDA) official, corn prices are extremely volatile and highly  dependent on weather conditions and global food production.  In addition,  the countercyclical design of federal commodity subsidies results in  outlays that are highly sensitive to changes in price.  This official explained  that a 1 cent change in estimated corn prices results in about an $85 million  change in federal outlays.", "The historically low interest rates that prevailed in recent years were below  levels previously forecasted, which affected estimated student loan subsidy  costs.  Subsidy cost estimates for FDLP are highly sensitive to changes  between projected and actual interest rates because borrower interest  rates are variable.  The decline in interest rates resulted in lower-than- expected interest payments to the government from FDLP borrowers, thus  increasing reestimated subsidy costs for these loans.  Concurrently, the  volume of student consolidation loans, which allow borrowers to lock in  fixed interest rates, increased as interest rates declined.  In consolidating  their loans, borrowers effectively paid off their underlying loans, thereby  lowering anticipated interest payments to the government on the loans and,  in turn, increasing the estimated subsidy costs of the underlying loans.", "Discrepancies between estimated and actual unemployment insurance  outlays are partially attributed to economic factors such as unanticipated  changes in both the unemployment rate and benefit recipiency rates.  For  example, Department of Labor officials said that most of the outlay  overestimate in 2000 resulted from a lower-than-expected unemployment  rate\u2014the ratio of the total number of unemployed individuals to the total  workforce\u2014which translated into lower-than-expected outlays.  In  subsequent years, the unemployment rate was underestimated and thus  contributed to greater-than-expected outlays.  Inaccurate assumptions  about the benefit recipiency rates, that is, the ratio of the total number of  unemployed individuals filing for or receiving benefits to the total number  of unemployed, further contributed to the agency\u2019s errors in accurately  estimating program outlays.  According to agency officials, these economic  factors tend to be key drivers affecting budget estimates, albeit to a  somewhat lesser degree during the timeframe we reviewed given the  significance of the temporary extended unemployment compensation  legislation that substantially increased outlays in 2002 through 2004.", "To a lesser extent, economic factors affected Medicare outlays.

For example, delayed implementation and difficulty  in predicting the behavior of providers under new payment systems, an  increased case mix, and the deferral of adjusting payments for skilled  nursing facilities utilization led to differences between estimated and  actual Medicare outlays.  Increases in administrative costs and revised  assumptions of the amount of loan defaults and collections caused some of  the direct student loan outlays to differ from original estimates.  Similar to  the diversity of the programs we reviewed, there was great variability  among the technical factors that affected account outlays.", "Actual outlays for both Medicare Parts A and B differed from estimates  primarily due to a number of technical factors, which accounted for both  some of the largest and some of the smallest discrepancies.  For example,  the largest discrepancy in the HI fund (Medicare Part A) occurred in fiscal  year 2000 for which outlays were lower-than-originally estimated by nearly  $16 billion.  According to CMS, the majority of this inaccuracy is attributed  to lower-than-expected benefit payments as a result of the agency\u2019s  difficulty in predicting the behavior of providers under newly implemented  payment systems for skilled nursing facility (SNF) services and home  health services. CMS officials said that these payment systems were very  new at the time fiscal year 2000 budget estimates were done and the effect  of these new systems was unknown. Similarly, SMI outlays were $4.6 billion  less-than-originally estimated due largely to the delayed implementation of  and unfamiliarity with a new outpatient hospital prospective payment  system. Other technical factors CMS cited to explain the differences  between estimated and actual Medicare outlays included case mixes that  were more complex than expected and deferred payment refinements for  SNF utilization. Case mix refers to the average complexity of inpatient  admissions for Medicare beneficiaries. A change in the mix of cases causes  the amount of benefit payments to change. The deferral of payment  adjustments for SNF utilization contributed to greater-than-expected  outlays in both fiscal years 2003 and 2004. These adjustments would have  reduced payment rates that had previously been increased on a temporary  basis under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget  Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA).  CMS included the budgetary effects of  these adjustments in their HI estimates for 2003 and 2004, but later decided  not to implement them citing the need for additional time to review and  analyze the implications of implementing hospital case mix refinements.", "Differences between estimated and actual outlays for federal direct student  loans were most frequently explained by technical factors, including  revised assumptions in the Department of Education\u2019s loan subsidy model,  increased administrative costs, and Congress\u2019s decision not to adopt a  budget proposal to shift administrative expenses to a discretionary  account.  Moreover, because of the way federal credit programs are  budgeted, original estimates include a loan subsidy amount for one fiscal  year but actual outlays include a loan subsidy reestimate for all prior fiscal  years\u2014in the case of FDLP, up to 8 years for fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that unsustainable federal deficits and debt threaten our future  economy and national security as well as the standard of living for the  American people, renewed emphasis on increasing fiscal discipline is  crucial.

Unexpected growth in individual programs\u2014especially certain very  large programs\u2014can significantly change the nation\u2019s fiscal position.  By  identifying significant increases in mandatory spending relatively early and  acting to constrain it, Congress may avert even larger fiscal challenges in  the future.", "The notion of establishing budget triggers to constrain growth is not new  and has been used in the past with varying degrees of success.  Given that  spending for mandatory programs is driven by underlying benefit and  eligibility formulas, serious efforts to constrain spending would require  substantive changes to current law.  Such changes should consider  program goals and objectives and be enacted as programs are created,  reexamined, or reauthorized.  While budget triggers certainly are neither a  panacea nor a substitute for deliberate consideration by stakeholders and  decision makers, they can help to prompt action and enhance fiscal  responsibility.", "Ignoring significant growth in mandatory accounts is inconsistent with  evaluation of programs and their costs. While we appreciate the concerns  raised by budget experts, in our opinion, establishing budget triggers  warrants serious consideration in order to constrain growth in mandatory  spending programs.

For example, once widespread agreement  on underlying public policy goals has been achieved, it needs to be decided  whether a soft or hard response to a trigger\u2014or a combination thereof\u2014 would be most appropriate.  Also, it is important to consider the data upon  which the trigger will hinge\u2014future projections of historical data, growth  as a percent of GDP, total growth, or another measure altogether.   Moreover, this trigger concept might also be useful in examining tax  expenditure growth.  Calculating a normal range of uncertainty for a  program could help avoid triggering an action prematurely or  unnecessarily.  In addition, it is important to strike an appropriate balance  between responses that constrain spending or increase revenues.  We  recognize that automatic responses pose much more difficult trade-offs.   Ensuring countercyclical effects are not undermined is of particular  importance.  In any case, recognizing the natural tension in balancing both  long-term fiscal challenges and other public policy goals, each program  needs to be considered individually to ensure that any responses triggered  strike the appropriate balance between the long-term fiscal challenge and  the program goals.

Addressing growth in  mandatory spending is an important but complicated matter that requires  looking below the aggregate and into specific programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences between Estimated and Actual Mandatory Outlays Had Limited Effect on the Unified Deficit/Surplus", "paragraphs": ["The unified budget deficit/surplus measures federal fiscal position, that is,  the difference between total annual receipts and outlays.  Not surprisingly,  the relatively small differences between total estimated and actual  mandatory outlays had a limited effect on the unified budget  surplus/deficit.  In most cases throughout fiscal years 2000 through 2004,  the difference between estimated and actual mandatory outlays accounted  for approximately 7 percent or less of the difference between the estimated  and actual fiscal position.  Despite the fact that mandatory outlays were  close to expectations, surplus/deficit measures proved difficult to estimate  throughout the 5-year period, primarily because of misestimates of federal  receipts.", "During fiscal years 2000 through 2004, deficit/surplus projections were  generally more optimistic than reality.  Figure 10 illustrates the estimated  and actual fiscal position (surplus/deficit) throughout the 5-year period.   Although increasing surpluses were projected for the first three years  followed by growing deficits, actual results show that the nation\u2019s fiscal  position in fact declined throughout the 5-year timeframe.  In addition,  projections for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 show that the deficit was  expected to grow but not to the magnitude that ultimately resulted.", "The fiscal position represents the difference between total federal revenues  and outlays in a given year.  Although mandatory spending constitutes  more than half of total federal spending, misestimates of the amount of  mandatory spending did not contribute significantly to the differences  between the predicted and actual fiscal position.  According to the detailed  receipt and outlay data shown in table 17, the mandatory outlay difference  in most cases accounted for less than 7 percent of the difference between  the estimated and actual fiscal position with one exception.  In fiscal year  2001, the mandatory outlay estimating error had a larger than usual  effect\u2014approximately 29 percent\u2014on the fiscal position estimating error.   While this particular year stands out in the analysis, it is a reasonable result  given that the total amount of error in surplus/deficit projections was much  smaller\u2014approximately 30 percent or $60 billion\u2014compared with any  other year during the 5-year period.  For example, a $242 billion surplus  was projected for 2002 when in fact the nation\u2019s fiscal position changed  from surplus to deficit, resulting in a $165 billion deficit for that year.  This  discrepancy represented a misestimate of approximately 168 percent.  In  both fiscal years 2001 and 2002, mandatory outlay estimates differed from  actual outlays by approximately 2 percent.  This relatively small difference  accounted for over one quarter of the resulting error in the surplus  projection for 2001 because the difference between estimated and actual  receipts also was relatively small.  It accounted for less than one-tenth of  the total error in the fiscal position projection for 2002 because the  difference between estimated and actual receipts was much larger.  Effects  similar to the latter occurred more frequently throughout the 5-year period,  indicating that estimation errors in mandatory outlays had a limited effect  on fiscal position.", "In contrast, revenue estimate inaccuracies proved to have a greater effect  on projections of the nation\u2019s fiscal position.  Throughout the 5-year period,  total estimated outlays differed from actual outlays by no more than 3  percent while total estimated receipts differed from actual receipts by up to  15 percent in absolute value terms.  This suggests that revenue, rather than  outlay estimates, led most significantly to the discrepancies in  surplus/deficit projections.   Figure 11 shows the total estimated and actual  federal receipts in dollar terms for each year we reviewed.", "As mentioned earlier in this report, the greatest revenue estimating errors  occurred in 2000, 2002, and 2003, which correlate with the years in which  the fiscal position projections were the most inaccurate.  For example, in  fiscal year 2002, an approximate 2.6 percent underestimate in total outlays  coupled with an approximate 15.4 percent overestimate of receipts  translated into a large shift in fiscal position from surplus to deficit.  Similar  effects occurred in 2000 and 2003.  As shown in table 18, the driving source  of revenue misestimates in any given year varied, but individual and  corporate income taxes often proved difficult to estimate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Christine Bonham, Assistant  Director, as well as Carol Henn, Richard Krashevski, Leah Nash, Sheila  Rajabiun, Paul Posner, and Stephanie Wade made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
