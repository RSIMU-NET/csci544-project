In addition, national survey data indicate that the recent downward trend in illicit drug use among youth has reversed. From 1992 to 1995, for example, past-month prevalence of marijuana use by 12- to 17-year-olds more than doubled. The costs of drug abuse to society\u2014which include costs for health care related to drug use, drug addiction prevention and treatment services, and fighting drug-related crime, as well as the cost of lost earnings due to premature death\u2014were estimated at about $110 billion in 1995.", "Each year since the mid-1980s, the Congress has appropriated billions of dollars for federal agencies to reduce the supply of and demand for illicit drugs.

To identify emerging drug use problems, researchers and government agencies look for changing patterns in drug use, some of which may signal the onset of an epidemic. Primary among these patterns are the use of a new illicit drug; a change in how a drug is taken, such as smoking rather than inhaling\u2014or \u201csnorting\u201d\u2014cocaine; a change in the level of use of an existing drug among populations that routinely abuse drugs; and the use of a drug by a new population group or in a different geographic area.

According to ONDCP, about 25 percent of federal drug control resources are for grants-in-aid or other forms of assistance provided to state and local governments and private entities, which commingle such funds with resources from other sources. In fiscal year 1997, federal funding for drug control efforts was over $15 billion, and the fiscal year 1998 request was for $16 billion. The President has requested about $17 billion in funding for fiscal year 1999. About two-thirds of federal drug control funds are channeled into efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs; the remaining one-third supports efforts to reduce drug demand.

Essentially, NIDA was responsible for planning and administering drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and for developing and conducting comprehensive research and research training (teaching professionals about conducting substance abuse research). The act also gave NIDA responsibility for creating a national community-based treatment system to respond to the drug abuse problem.", "In 1974, the same year NIDA was established, ADAMHA was created as an umbrella agency to oversee the functions and operations of NIDA and two other research institutes. In 1981, ADAMHA was given additional responsibility for (1) administering demonstration programs related to the prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse and mental health disorders and (2) providing assistance and information about such disorders to other federal agencies, states, health care providers, and public and private organizations. The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services (ADMS) block grant program was also created in 1981 to provide funds to states for planning, establishing, and evaluating programs for the development of more effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services.", "In 1992, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321) created a new agency, SAMHSA, to replace ADAMHA and transferred NIDA and the two other research institutes to NIH.

Adjustments for nonresponse patterns were also made. MTF was expanded to include a representative sample of 8th- and 10th-grade students in addition to the 12th-graders and young adults already being surveyed. NHSDA was expanded to include civilians living on military bases and people living in noninstitutional quarters, such as college dormitories, rooming houses, and shelters. NHSDA was also expanded to include Alaska and Hawaii. To provide more timely national data, since 1990 NHSDA has been conducted every year, instead of every 2 to 3 years. There are also plans, promoted by ONDCP, to expand NHSDA to collect state-level drug use prevalence data. This expansion is expected to provide annual estimates for each state\u2019s household population and, specifically, for the population aged 12 to 17 and 18 to 25.", "Steps were also taken toward improving the reliability of data by correcting some of the problems with drug use prevalence estimates. Drug use prevalence estimates had been dramatically affected by an estimation technique known as \u201clogical imputation\u201d and by weighting the estimates for certain drugs. Logical imputation calls for revising a survey participant\u2019s initially negative drug use response if one or more subsequent responses related to the same drug are positive. For example, in the 1990 NHSDA, 40 percent, or 53 of 131 past-month positive cocaine use responses, were imputed\u2014changed from an initial response indicating no cocaine use. The initial \u201cno drug use\u201d response was changed because of an apparently conflicting response to another question in the survey. Although the problem with logical imputation is still a concern, the probability of a logical imputation error in estimating drug use has been lowered somewhat by reducing the number of questions being asked about the same drug on the survey, according to SAMHSA officials. Weighted estimates of the national prevalence of drug use have also been questioned in the past, given the limited number of surveyed cocaine and heroin users from which to make projections. For example, in a study in which the 1991 NHSDA age variable was weighted to account for subject sampling probabilities and nonresponse rates, it was discovered that, when projected to the nation, one 79-year-old woman accounted for an estimated 142,000 heroin users, or about 20 percent of all people who used heroin in the past year. SAMHSA officials said that they have taken steps to try to limit such effects of weighted estimates by assessing each outlier on a case-by-case basis and using their judgment to decide when to truncate or reduce the weights.", "In addition to changes in DAWN, MTF, and NHSDA, several new drug use detection mechanisms have been developed. SAMHSA has cited the particular importance of two of these mechanisms: the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). ADAM, formerly the Drug Use Forecasting program, comprises an ongoing quarterly study of the drug use patterns of new arrestees at booking facilities in approximately 20 cities across the country. TEDS is a database of substance abuse client admissions to those publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs that receive some of their funding through a state alcohol and drug agency. In commenting on this report, SAMHSA officials stated that their Violence Data Exchange Teams (VDET) are in the process of creating a local-level system to track trends and changes in substance abuse-related violence. When fully operational, VDETs will assist local communities in the detection of drug abuse patterns as they are manifested through violence-related data.

In addition, SAMHSA was to ensure, through coordination with NIDA, the dissemination of relevant research findings to service providers to improve the delivery and effectiveness of prevention and treatment services. To carry out these responsibilities, SAMHSA initially established demonstration grant programs that supported individual grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. SAMHSA also assumed responsibility for administering the separate Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant program.", "In 1995, SAMHSA developed the Knowledge Development and Application (KD&A) program, consolidating SAMHSA\u2019s individual demonstration grant programs. According to SAMHSA officials, the program offers improved ways of generating and disseminating knowledge on the prevention and treatment of problems related to drug use and how to apply that knowledge to delivering services. In fiscal year 1997, 17.4 percent of SAMHSA\u2019s budget was devoted to KD&A program activities.", "Since fiscal year 1992 when the SAPT block grant was established, funding for substance abuse has continued to increase. SAPT block grant funds to states gradually increased from about $1.04 billion in fiscal year 1993 to more than $1.15 billion in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1997, the funding increased by $126 million.", "According to SAMHSA officials, the agency is not yet adequately positioned to deter emerging drug use that might result in future epidemics. They told us that the SAPT block grant, which currently comprises 60 percent of SAMHSA\u2019s funding, is not designed to provide a rapid response to emerging drug problems. They also stated that it is difficult to determine when an increase in a certain type of drug use warrants attention and the type of response needed. SAMHSA officials said, however, that they have planned several initiatives to address emerging drug use trends. For example, CSAP plans to continue its support of the HHS Secretary\u2019s Youth Substance Abuse Prevention Initiative\u2014including budgeting $5.0 million for two new State Incentive Grant (SIG) programs. SIGs are competitive grants to states to coordinate disparate funding streams and facilitate the development of effective local drug prevention strategies targeted to youth. These programs serve as an incentive for governors to examine and synchronize statewide prevention strategies with private and community-based organizations.", "Additionally, CSAT plans to test the feasibility of implementing new approaches in treatment settings. For example, more individuals\u2014 particularly on the West Coast and in the Southwest\u2014are seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence; but, according to CSAT, there are no well-established treatment approaches for this drug. CSAT\u2019s Replicating Effective Treatment for Methamphetamine Dependence study is designed to develop knowledge of psychosocial treatment for methamphetamine dependence as well as to provide an opportunity to determine the problems involved in transferring this knowledge.", "To help states put the infrastructure in place to respond to emerging drug use trends, CSAT plans to further strengthen its partnerships with state and local governments as well as with community-based treatment providers and the private sector to solve common problems. For example, the Targeted Treatment Capacity Expansion Program is designed to award grants to states, cities, and other government entities to create and expand comprehensive substance abuse treatment services and promote accountability. CSAT plans to support states, cities, and other partners in their efforts to identify gaps in the delivery system and, where current capacity within a treatment modality is insufficient, provide for expanded access to treatment.", "In an effort to disseminate information to service providers and others, SAMHSA operates the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information.

That is, it takes time to generate grants in a new priority area, conduct the research, publicize the research findings, and move these findings from the \u201clab\u201d into practice. NIDA has a key role to play both in generating research-based prevention and treatment approaches and in training research scientists who potentially can be useful to the public health community in addressing drug control problems.

Most of the NIDA-funded research is conducted through extramural research programs. However, a portion of NIDA\u2019s resources is dedicated to its intramural program\u2014that is, research conducted by NIDA researchers. Currently, NIDA\u2019s research activities are organized into four extramural research divisions and an intramural research program, each of which plays a role in addressing issues relevant to emerging drug problems. For example, both the intramural research program and the Division of Clinical and Services Research are investigating the relationship of brain functions (through neuroimaging techniques) to drug craving. Results of such research may be useful in helping drug users reduce the craving or need for specific illicit drugs. NIDA\u2019s Division of Medications Development has been investigating the utility of cocaine medications for the treatment of users of methamphetamine as well as examining the clinical utility of buprenorphine to reduce the spread of heroin use among youth and newly addicted individuals. The Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research continues to sponsor both MTF and CEWG and funds promising treatment research in prevention. NIDA\u2019s basic research division explores those behavioral and biomedical mechanisms associated with drug abuse and addiction.", "NIDA officials have indicated, however, that quickly focusing research on newly emerging drug problems is difficult, in part, because of the time it takes to generate grant applications and award grants in a new priority area. The extramural research grant application approval process has multiple stages and can take several months to complete. In some cases, NIDA can reduce the time consumed with the grant award process by administratively awarding supplements to existing grants. These supplements must not exceed 25 percent or $100,000 of a grantee\u2019s base award, unless an exception is approved by the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse. This approach was recently used to encourage research related to the rise in marijuana use among adolescents. In addition, NIH has made available a l-percent set-aside for special research initiatives. Using this set-aside, NIDA applied for and obtained an extra $2 million in funding to support additional methamphetamine activities directed at averting a crisis.", "NIDA also supports research training activities to help build a resource knowledge base for research on illicit drug use. Between 1986 and 1997, NIDA\u2019s research training budget grew sharply, from a total of $1.43 million in 1986 to $11.7 million in 1997. However, NIDA\u2019s research training budget, as a percentage of total extramural research funds, has consistently been lower than those of both NIMH and NIH throughout the 12-year period.

Recently, NIDA distributed more than 150,000 copies of a research-based guide on preventing drug use among children and adolescents to help control the rise in drug use among youth. NIDA has also presented its findings at national drug conferences, CEWG meetings, congressional hearings, and town meetings, as well as on the Internet.

Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, ONDCP is required to assess the quality of mechanisms used to measure supply and demand reduction activities and to determine the adequacy of existing mechanisms to measure national drug use by the casual drug user population and populations at risk for drug use. The act also requires ONDCP to describe the actions it will take to correct any deficiencies and limitations identified.", "In 1995, ONDCP tasked the Subcommittee, composed of representatives from 19 federal agencies, with evaluating the adequacy and ability of federal drug-related data systems to inform the drug control policy planning process. In its July 1997 draft report, the Subcommittee concluded that a systematic approach for gathering drug-related data must be developed to ensure that policymakers and analysts have useful information for making public policy decisions. The Subcommittee recommended that duplication of effort in drug-related systems be identified and eliminated and that better use be made of regional-, state-, and local-level data. The Subcommittee saw a need for more accurate and complete information on chronic, hardcore drug users and for increased or enhanced information on illicit drug consumption and the risks and consequences of drug use, including expansion of such indicators beyond those obtained from hospital emergency departments, arrestees, and domestic violence records. The Subcommittee also recommended that data be made more available to researchers to encourage more in-depth analyses of existing data sets and broaden the dissemination of results. Our expert panel raised some of the same issues about the nation\u2019s drug detection system that led to the Subcommittee\u2019s recommendations. Moreover, officials in the several states and cities we visited raised similar\u2014and additional\u2014issues about the use of drug detection data, including the limited usefulness of federally generated drug detection information in monitoring most local changes in drug use patterns and the poor use of drug detection information generated by state and local substance abuse authorities. In commenting on this report, ONDCP officials stated that they have already begun implementing some of the \u201cprinciples\u201d in the Subcommittee\u2019s draft report.", "Other assessments of the nation\u2019s drug data collection efforts conducted in the early 1990s similarly concluded that drug-related data systems could be improved. For example, a RAND study found that policymakers have been handicapped by inconsistent and fragmented information. A University of California at Los Angeles Drug Abuse Research Center report concluded that the data systems were limited by inadequate coverage of people at high risk of drug use. In a 1993 report, we also raised concerns about gaps in coverage and methodological limitations of three major federal drug data collection mechanisms.

While we learned of different approaches the federal government uses to respond to changing drug use patterns, some of which address emerging drugs, we found that no overall defined strategy for specifically addressing emerging drug use problems exists.
