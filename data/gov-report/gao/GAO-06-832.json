Our statistical model showed that when accounting for citizenship, required for most federal employment, Hispanics were nearly as likely as non-Hispanics to be employed in the federal workforce, relative to the nonfederal workforce (the portion of the CLF excluding federal employees). In addition, the federal workforce has a greater proportion of occupations that require higher levels of education than the CLF. When we compared citizens with similar levels of education, Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanics to be employed in the federal workforce relative to the nonfederal workforce. Other factors in our model, including age, gender, race, veteran's status, English proficiency, and geography (state where employed), had a more limited or almost no effect on the likelihood of Hispanics being in the federal workforce. In addition to reporting and comparing representation levels overall and in subsets of the federal workforce to the CLF, EEOC and OPM require that agencies analyze their own workforces. However, the CLF benchmarks of representation that EEOC, OPM, and the agencies use do not differentiate between citizens and noncitizens, and therefore do not identify how citizenship affects the pool of persons qualified to work for the federal government. Where these analyses identify differences in representation, EEOC, for example, requires agencies to determine if there are barriers to participation and develop strategies to address them. OPM provides resources and guidance to assist agencies in implementing human capital strategies. Through these efforts, OPM has promoted the use of student employment programs as a source of qualified candidates. Analyzing agency use of these programs, including the extent to which agencies convert participants to permanent employment, could provide OPM with valuable information to assist agencies in maximizing the use of these programs in their strategic workforce planning. The agencies we reviewed use a variety of approaches to address Hispanic representation, including recruiting at colleges and universities with large Hispanic populations, publicizing employment opportunities in Hispanic media, reaching out to Hispanic communities and Hispanic-serving organizations, and using student employment, internship, career development, and training programs. For example, the U.S. Air Force partners with vocational-technical schools to develop aircraft maintenance technicians, and staff at selected National Aeronautics and Space Administration facilities mentor and tutor students to encourage careers in science, technology, engineering, and math."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the Civilian Labor Force  (CLF), with their representation having increased from 8.5 percent in 1990  to 12.6 percent in 2005.

To determine the effect of these factors on Hispanic representation in the  federal workforce, we constructed a multivariate logistic regression model  using 2000 Decennial Census data. Logistic regression analysis is a very  common and widely accepted approach to analyze outcomes that have two  possibilities (such as being in the federal vs. nonfederal workforce) when  the interest is in determining the net effects of multiple factors that may be  related to one another. We used the model to measure the extent to which  the identified factors that could be reliably measured affected the  likelihood of Hispanics and non-Hispanics being in the federal workforce,  as opposed to the nonfederal workforce. In developing the model, we  obtained the opinions of experts identified by the National Academy of  Sciences as well as officials from EEOC, OPM, the Department of Justice  (DOJ), and the Census Bureau.

Signed in 1969, Executive Order No. 11478, Equal Employment  Opportunity in the Federal Government, stated that it is the policy of the  U.S. government to provide equal opportunity in federal employment.  Later, Congress passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972,  which extended to federal workers the protections of title VII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of  race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. This law requires each  federal department and agency to prepare plans to maintain an affirmative  program of equal employment opportunity and establish training and  education programs. Pursuant to this and other authorities, EEOC  establishes equal employment program standards, monitors federal  agencies\u2019 compliance with equal employment opportunity laws and  procedures, and reviews and assesses the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 equal  employment programs. EEOC has carried out its responsibilities by issuing  regulations and management directives providing guidance and standards  to federal agencies for establishing and maintaining effective programs of  equal employment opportunity.", "Recruitment should be from qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an endeavor  to achieve a work force from all segments of society, and selection and advancement should  be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge and skills, after fair and open  competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.", "The CSRA also created the Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment  Program (FEORP) to carry out the government\u2019s policy to ensure equal  employment opportunity.

In 1997, OPM implemented the 9-Point Plan calling for agencies  to recruit greater numbers of qualified Hispanic Americans for federal  service and improve their opportunities for management and senior  executive positions. More recently, Executive Order No. 13171, Hispanic  Employment in the Federal Government, signed in 2000, provides that  agencies, among other actions, (1) develop recruiting plans for Hispanics  and (2) assess and eliminate any systemic barriers to the effective  recruitment and consideration of Hispanics. The order requires OPM to  take the lead in promoting diversity to executive agencies and for the  director of OPM to establish and chair an Interagency Task Force on  Hispanic employment in the federal government to review best practices,  provide advice, assess overall executive branch progress, and recommend  further actions related to Hispanic representation.", "As an indicator to Congress and the President of the government\u2019s progress  toward ensuring equal employment opportunity, both EEOC and OPM, in  their oversight roles, analyze and report on governmentwide and agency  workforce data.

Subsequent to the completion of our audit work, EEOC sent a  letter requesting that the Census Bureau review the possibility of including  citizenship data in the 2010 Special EEO File. According to the Census  Bureau, citizenship data can be included but at an additional cost to  consortium members based on the extent of data requested (e.g.,  geographic or occupational specificity) and amount of staff and  programming resources to produce the requested data. In addition, the  Census Bureau said that the extent of geographic or occupational  specificity of citizenship data could be limited based on the risk of  disclosing the identity of a respondent. Census Bureau officials also noted  that because the 2010 Special EEO File will be based on a 5-year roll up of  annual ACS data, current plans are to produce an updated Special EEO File  every 5 years.", "OPM also presents data on Hispanic representation in its reports to the  President under Executive Order No. 13171 and to Congress under the  FEORP. In its Annual Report to the President on Hispanic Employment in  the Federal Government, prepared pursuant to Executive Order No. 13171,  and in Statistical Information on Hispanic Employment in Federal  Agencies, OPM has included data on Hispanic representation overall, for  each agency, by pay plan/group, and among new hires.

However, in  making comparisons of the demographic composition of the overall federal  workforce to the CLF for the FEORP and the statistical reports on Hispanic  employment, OPM has used the Current Population Survey (CPS). By using  the CPS, OPM reports more-current CLF data than EEOC\u2019s and reflects the  changing composition of the CLF. At the time of our review, OPM was  benchmarking to the September 2005 CPS, which showed Hispanic  representation in the CLF to be 12.6 percent.

This  experience might be substituted for holding an MBA in rendering an applicant qualified for  consideration for a higher-graded position. If it is determined that the agency\u2019s requirement  for an MBA is in fact job-related and consistent with business necessity, the agency should  consider whether other alternatives exist which will have less impact on a particular group.

In addition, the agency might consider steps it could take to facilitate  its own lower-graded employees obtaining MBAs.", "Under OPM\u2019s FEORP regulations and guidance under the Human Capital  Accountability and Assessment Framework (HCAAF), agencies are also to  analyze their workforces. Under FEORP, agencies are required to  determine where representation levels for covered groups are lower than  the CLF and take steps to address them. Agencies are also required to  submit annual FEORP reports to OPM in the form prescribed by OPM.  These have included (1) data on employee participation in agencywide and  governmentwide career development programs broken out by race,  national origin, gender, and grade level and (2) a narrative report  identifying areas where the agencies had been most successful in  recruiting, hiring, and formal training of minorities and women, and how  they were able to achieve those results.

According to  recently proposed regulations, each system consists of standards against  which agencies can assess their management of human capital and related  metrics. The HCAAF practitioners guide outlines suggested performance  indicators reflecting effective practices in meeting these standards.

For example, the Marshall Space  Center in Huntsville, Alabama, annually sponsors a Hispanic Youth  Conference attended by students from across Alabama that includes  workshops on leadership development and pursuing NASA career fields  and provides opportunities to establish mentoring relationships.  NASA  also provides grants to fund educational support programs including in  locations where there are high concentrations of Hispanics.  For example,  the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, provided a grant for  the development and implementation of a K-12 technology-awareness  program designed to expose students to NASA and higher education  through competitive team activities based on key aeronautic concepts.  The  program has been implemented in schools throughout California that have  a high percentage of Hispanic students.

We did not analyze Hispanic  subgroup data because of concerns we expressed in our prior work and those expressed by the Census Bureau and outside researchers.   Additionally, some factors identified were not asked on the Census and we  could not identify an adequate proxy suitable for our methodology; we  cannot say how, or if, these factors would affect the results of our analyses.   Variables for which we could not control include experience in a particular  occupation, number of years naturalized U.S. citizens have been citizens of  the United States, and an individual\u2019s preference for employment in either  the federal or nonfederal workforce.  Additionally, we did not control for  Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area or other geographical units smaller  than states because these would result in sample sizes too small to control  for the full range of factors.  For foreign-born respondents, we did not  control for years since arrival in the United States because the data were  insufficiently reliable. Finally, we could not control for how unemployment  affects the likelihood of being in the federal workforce because  unemployment perfectly predicts not being in the federal workforce;  however, unemployed individuals are considered part of the CLF.", "Additionally, with respect to race\u2014one of the factors for which we  controlled\u2014some have suggested that many Hispanics view race  differently than non-Hispanics and consider their ethnicity as a separate  racial category.  Such differences in the perception of race could affect our  estimates on the effect of race on the likelihood of Hispanics and non- Hispanics being employed in the federal workforce relative to the  nonfederal workforce.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, among  Hispanics in the 2000 Decennial Census, 47.9 percent reported themselves  as white, 2.0 percent as black, 1.2 percent as American Indian/Alaska  Native, 0.3 percent as Asian, 0.1 percent as native Hawaiian and Other  Pacific Islander, 6.3 percent as two or more races, and 42.2 percent as some  other race.

In the PUMS there were about 2,658,000 federal  employees (excluding the Postal Service) compared to slightly less than 2  million reported by OPM for 2000 in either of its sources.

In addition, OPM\u2019s CPDF data do not include judicial and  some legislative branch employees and employees of the Tennessee Valley  Authority.  Another potential source of the difference in the number of  federal employees is that employees of federal contractors who work at  federal agencies or on military installations might have responded on the  Census that they were employees of the federal government.  Several  experts who commented on our methodology and results expressed a  similar view.", "To assess whether our results were affected by the difference in the  number of federal employees in the PUMS and CPDF datasets, we  substituted the federal employees from the CPDF for the federal employees  in the PUMS.  Our analysis, using the combined CPDF and PUMS data,  confirmed that citizenship and education accounted for the difference in  likelihood of Hispanics and non-Hispanics being employed in the federal  workforce.  Given these, the large sample size of PUMS, the high response  rate to the Census 2000 long form that is the basis for PUMS, and the  quality control measures Census uses in collecting the PUMS data, we  believe our reported results are sound and the conclusions we reached are  reasonable.", "Like reported federal employment in PUMS, reports of citizenship in self- reporting surveys may be inflated.  As we lacked benchmark data to assess  the potential effect of misreporting of citizenship, we cannot say if or how  the results would be affected by such misreports.  Additionally, because we  used data from a single census, we cannot make statements regarding  future trends in the estimates.  For example, changes in the number or  geographic distribution of Hispanics might affect the likelihood of federal  employment in future censuses.", "Finally, our results are limited and intended to only reflect the effect of  selected factors on Hispanic employment in the overall federal workforce  and cannot be applied to individual occupations, grades, agencies, or other  subsets of the federal government.  We attempted to analyze the effect of  selected factors on the federal occupations that employed 10,000 or more  federal employees in 2004 and similar occupations in the nonfederal  workforce, but we found that our results were not reliable.  First, sample  size within job categories is much smaller and subject to much greater  sampling variability than in the full data set.  Sample sizes this small  preclude controlling for the full range of factors considered in our model.   Second, PUMS data and our models cannot account for specific skills and  certification, which might be particularly relevant for a given occupation.   For example, the education categories do not distinguish between a  bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry or in English literature.  Third, we could not  account for the specific career paths required for certain occupations or  those that can only be obtained on the job.  For example, job seekers with a  background in policing may be more qualified to be a federal officer.", "Fourth, we could not account for individuals who may be qualified for a  given occupation, but holding a different one.
