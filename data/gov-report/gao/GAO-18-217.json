The tool also provides a common set of standards that  organizations can use to mitigate skill gaps through hiring or using  developmental opportunities.", "The Navy\u2019s systems command responsible for delivering and  supporting aircraft provides a career roadmap for the program  management career field, as well as detailed descriptions of the  different levels of skills and competencies needed to advance.", "However, the systems command responsible for delivering and  supporting ships does not have a formal career roadmap.", "Both Army and Navy Directors for Acquisition Career Management are  aware of these inconsistencies, and are working to put approaches in  place in fiscal year 2018 to address them and ensure that key groups in  the program management career field are not missing important  information about skills they should develop.", "Practice #7\u2014Education subsidies: All the services offer tuition  assistance to military and civilian personnel to further their education,  which has helped increase the percentage of program management  personnel with a graduate degree from 46 percent in fiscal year 2008 to  57 percent in fiscal year 2016. The services also offer student loan  repayments, but use them for different purposes. The Army and Navy use  DAWDF-funded student loan repayments\u2014and the requirement that  recipients sign an agreement to serve for 3 years\u2014as a retention tool for  program management personnel.", "However, the Air Force only uses these repayments as a recruiting tool,  despite the fact that they can be used for both recruitment and retention.  This decision stems from the results of a 2016 study the Air Force  commissioned from the RAND Corporation that found limited utility in  offering retention bonuses as a tool to retain talent. The Director for  Acquisition Career Management told us that the Air Force is scaling back  its use of all financial retention incentives and prefers to use student loan  repayments as a recruiting tool. The service agreement therefore only  covers the early part of someone\u2019s career with the Air Force, instead of  being a way to drive retention of more senior personnel. Prior GAO work  has found that financial retention incentives are among the most effective  flexibilities that agencies have for managing their workforce, and that  insufficient use of existing flexibilities can significantly hinder the ability of  agencies to retain and manage personnel.", "Practice #9\u2014Identification of high-potential talent by senior leaders:  The Army regularly and systematically involves senior management in  identifying high-potential program management talent among civilian and  military personnel. It requires senior managers to annually evaluate the  leadership potential of all civilian acquisition personnel at midcareer or  above, and the Army\u2019s annual evaluation for all military officers assesses  their potential for positions of greater responsibility. The Air Force has a  similar process for military personnel, but not civilians. The onus is on  civilian personnel to nominate themselves for development programs and  resources, rather than being identified and guided toward those  opportunities by senior leaders. The Navy only identifies high-potential  military and civilian talent on an informal basis, which varies across the  service. The Air Force and Navy risk overlooking high-potential talent as a  result of their approaches. The Directors for Acquisition Career  Management for both services acknowledge the ad hoc nature of their  practices, and are looking into steps they could take in fiscal year 2018 to  more systematically identify high-potential talent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "None of the Military Services\u2019 Practices Align Extensively with the Practice of Providing Financial Rewards for Good Performance", "paragraphs": ["None of the military services\u2019 practices align extensively with leading  practices for providing financial rewards for good performance, as shown  in table 5 below.", "Commercial companies have more flexibility than DOD to financially  reward good performance. They are not subject to the legal restrictions  on compensation that federal agencies must consider, and can offer  types of compensation, such as stock options, that federal agencies  cannot. Despite this, DOD has mechanisms to financially reward high- performing people. However, these incentives are either unavailable to all  program management personnel because of the various pay systems  used by DOD, or are underutilized by the military services. For example,  military and civilian personnel are compensated under different systems.  Military pay and allowances are delineated in Title 37 of the U.S. Code,  and while there are provisions for retention bonuses that would cover  acquisition officers, there are none that reward high performance.", "Most DOD civilian personnel, on the other hand, are covered by the  General Schedule classification, a pay system that is used in many  agencies across the federal government. For the most part, people in this  pay system receive set pay increases as long as their performance is at  an acceptable level. The military services also have the option to convert  civilian personnel to the Civilian Acquisition Workforce Personnel  Demonstration Project, known as AcqDemo, where people including  those in the program management career field have the opportunity to  earn varying levels of pay increases or bonuses based on their  performance.", "The military services\u2019 use of AcqDemo varies. According to AcqDemo  data collected by DOD\u2019s Human Capital Initiatives office, as of the end of  fiscal year 2016, approximately 64 percent of the Army\u2019s civilian program  management workforce is covered by the system. Army officials told us  that the level of coverage has increased since then, and that  organizations containing the remaining eligible workforce are considering  participation in fiscal year 2018. Furthermore, officials told us that all  Army program managers are covered by AcqDemo. However, only 38  percent of the Navy\u2019s civilian program management workforce is covered  by the system, and 29 percent of the Air Force\u2019s. According to the  AcqDemo program manager and the Air Force and Navy Directors for  Acquisition Career Management, organizations are hesitant to extend  coverage because they are apprehensive about whether what is currently  a demonstration program will become permanent, and the time it takes  management to reach formal agreement with local bargaining units. The  greater coverage of AcqDemo across the Army\u2019s civilian program  management workforce compared to the Air Force and Navy suggests  that these two services may have opportunities to learn lessons from the  Army\u2019s experience.", "Congress recently took actions that could address some of the concerns  about AcqDemo. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018, for example, extends the authorized timeline for AcqDemo use from  December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2023, and increases the total  number of people who may participate in the program at any one time  from 120,000 to 130,000. As of February 2017, a total of approximately  36,000 people across DOD were participating in AcqDemo.", "The military services can also use DAWDF funding to recognize high- performing civilian personnel, but have only made limited use of this  funding for program management personnel. The Directors for Acquisition  Career Management reported the following awards between fiscal years  2008 and 2017:", "The Air Force awarded $5,000 to one recipient in fiscal year 2017.", "The Army awarded a total of $70,000 to 351 recipients on one team in  fiscal year 2015.", "The Navy awarded a total of $10,000 to seven recipients between  fiscal years 2008 and 2017.", "Requests for DAWDF funds are left to the discretion of acquisition  commands. According to the military services\u2019 Directors for Acquisition  Career Management, local commanders are not frequently requesting  DAWDF funds for program management recognition awards. One director  stated that this was because they want to avoid the perception of treating  civilian personnel differently from military personnel. As a result, the  military services are missing an opportunity to financially reward good  performance and potentially losing talented civilians by not using all  available retention tools. The Army Director stated that Army  organizations have also used other financial performance incentives,  such as spot awards for civilian program management personnel that are  not funded by DAWDF. This director also noted that government-wide  budgetary limitations for individual monetary awards have reduced the  flexibility to offer rewards for performance.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 requires  DOD to commission a review of military and civilian program manager  incentives, including a financial incentive structure to reward program  managers for delivering capabilities on budget and on time.

Of note, DOD has developed a solid training regimen  and established minimum training, experience, and education  requirements for people to manage acquisitions of various dollar  thresholds. The services have also established repositories that share  lessons learned and provide on-the-job learning opportunities to  supplement the formal training.", "Yet, when compared to leading practices, we found that several practices  used by the military services for training, mentoring, retaining, and  selecting people for program manager positions could be improved. For  instance, the Air Force has practices that extensively align with all leading  practices for training and mentoring, but we identified some practices for  retaining and selecting program managers that do not. We assessed the  Army as having practices that extensively align with all leading practices  for selecting program managers, but identified some practices for training,  mentoring, and retaining program managers that do not. We assessed  the Navy as having practices that do not extensively align with leading  practices in each of the areas of training, mentoring, retaining, and  selecting program managers.", "In nearly all cases, the military services could improve their practices by  learning from ideas and initiatives being used by another military service  or by commercial companies and ensuring that civilian and military  personnel have similar opportunities to develop. While commercial  companies have more flexibility in providing financial incentives to their  program managers, the military services could make greater use of  financial mechanisms provided by Congress\u2014such as DAWDF and  AcqDemo\u2014to reward high performing civilian personnel. DOD also has  an opportunity to identify for Congress any concerns about the equitable  treatment of civilian and military program management personnel when it  comes to rewarding good performance.

Extensive alignment means that the service\u2019s practice  contains all of the elements of the leading practice and is not limited to a  subset of the population. Partial alignment means that the service\u2019s  practice contains some, but not all, elements of the leading practice, or is  limited to a subset of the population, such as military or civilian personnel  only, or a particular organization within the service. Little to no alignment  means that the service\u2019s practice contains minimal or no elements of the  leading practice. The following is a list of elements for each practice:  1.  Training classes that allow program managers to share experiences:  Training classes that involve current or prospective program  managers and that allow for knowledge and experience sharing.  2.  Rotational assignments: Internal and external\u2014that is, industry\u2014 rotational assignments available to military and civilian personnel.  3.  On-the-job learning and information repositories: Resources that  provide access to guidance on how to perform program management  activities and learn from past program management experiences.  4.  Mentoring programs with senior leader involvement: Existence of  programs that facilitate mentor-mentee relationships and expectation  that senior personnel serve as mentors.  5.  Career paths that describe skills needed to advance: Documentation  for military and civilian personnel of skills needed at different stages of  career path(s) to becoming a program manager.  6.
