To support this program, a network of facilities was built, with most of the major ones located in Russia. Ten closed, or \u201csecret,\u201d cities were built to house workers at the major sites. In the quest to produce nuclear weapons, the health and safety of workers\u2014as well as the environmental impact of production\u2014were not adequately considered. As the threat of nuclear confrontation has receded, the long-term consequences of the Soviet\u2019s nuclear program are being examined more closely by international environmental and health experts.

Of the 221 facilities identified, 99 (or about 45 percent) are in Russia, including all of the Soviet Union\u2019s facilities to produce or reprocess plutonium. In addition, Russia maintains all of the facilities of the former Soviet Union that were used to design or assemble nuclear weapons. Russia also operates 31 of the 48 research, training, and experimental reactors. (See app. II for a list of research reactors in the former Soviet Union.)", "Most of the other countries of the former Soviet Union have nuclear facilities. For example, Kazakhstan operates a significant number of facilities, including five research reactors, one fuel fabrication plant, and at least 22 mining sites. It also contains what was a major nuclear testing area, Semipalatinsk, which closed in 1991. Ukraine has a large concentration of nuclear facilities, including research reactors and waste storage and disposal facilities. Uranium mining, milling, and ore processing is concentrated around the central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. These four republics and Ukraine have about 87 percent of the former Soviet Union\u2019s 78 mining, milling, and ore-processing sites.", "In addition to the 221 operating nuclear facilities, Russia also has a fleet of nuclear-powered vessels, including 228 submarines, 7 icebreakers, and 1 transport ship.

During our discussions with these experts, the following five factors emerged as the main contributors to unsafe conditions: (1) lack of technology as well as aging facilities and equipment, (2) the lack of awareness and commitment to the importance of safety, (3) the long-standing emphasis on production over safety, (4) the absence of independent and effective nuclear regulatory bodies, and (5) the lack of funds to improve safety.", "Several officials from DOE\u2019s national laboratories and nuclear weapons facilities noted similarities between aging U.S. and former Soviet Union plutonium production and reprocessing facilities. In 1988, we reported that aging and deteriorating U.S. facilities resulted in safety and/or operational problems. DOE officials noted that while all of the U.S. plutonium production and reprocessing facilities have been closed, some of the former Soviet Union\u2019s aging facilities continue to operate.", "DOE, IAEA, and European Union officials\u2014as well as Russian officials\u2014expressed concern about the safety of plutonium production reactors and associated reprocessing facilities at Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, and Chelyabinsk. Two operating production reactors are located at Tomsk, and one is at Krasnoyarsk. Prior to 1987, 13 plutonium production reactors operated at these three sites. Ten of the reactors have been shut down. In 1994, Russia announced that it was no longer fully processing weapons grade plutonium at these sites and the plutonium was being placed in storage. The three remaining reactors continue to operate, however, and supply heat and electricity to nearby cities. Although Chelyabinsk\u2019s production reactors were shut down several years ago, the site remains a major reprocessing center for spent fuel from civil nuclear power reactors and nuclear-powered submarines. While Russia plans to significantly expand its reprocessing capabilities at Krasnoyarsk, the project has stalled because of a lack of funding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Russia\u2019s Plutonium Production Reactors and Reprocessing Plants Raise Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Russia\u2019s three operating plutonium production reactors are over 30 years old and share design characteristics with Chernobyl-style reactors, including the lack of a containment structure. However, the Krasnoyarsk reactor is located underground thereby reducing the potential release of radioactive material to the environment. Russia has denied DOE officials permission to visit the operating reactors at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk because of their military sensitivity. Although detailed safety analyses are not available to DOE officials, they believe the reactors have safety problems because of their design and age. According to a 1994 study conducted by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL), the reactors were designed and operated without the benefit of safety improvements made at other nuclear facilities. An official from Russia\u2019s Gosatomnadzor (GAN), the agency responsible for safety at nuclear fuel cycle facilities, including plutonium production reactors, told us that the reactors need extensive upgrades to continue long-term operations and are \u201cunreliable.\u201d Furthermore, he noted that a small incident at one of these reactors could have \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d In June 1994, Russia agreed with the United States to shut down the three remaining production reactors not later than the year 2000. Because the reactors will not be closed until an alternative source of energy is available, the United States has agreed to help Russia evaluate various alternatives.", "DOE, IAEA, and European Union officials told us that Russia\u2019s reprocessing facilities present safety concerns. Reprocessing involves the use of chemical processes to separate uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. Under certain conditions, the chemical solutions can cause an explosion. DOE officials obtained first-hand information about the conditions at Russia\u2019s reprocessing facilities after an accident at the Tomsk plant, which occurred in April 1993. In June 1993, DOE officials visited Tomsk to investigate the accident. Although they were not permitted to view the chemical tank that had exploded, they did see other parts of the facility. Several operational errors, such as improper mixing of chemicals in the reprocessing tank, and possible design flaws, such as inadequate tank ventilation, were identified as contributors to the accident.", "According to DOE officials, inadequate safety awareness at nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union affects operational safety levels and increases the risks for accidents. DOE officials who visited Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk within the past 2 years in conjunction with a U.S.-Russian exchange program on reprocessing observed that the Russian safety practices were generally not comparable to U.S. practices. Despite their recent visits to Russian facilities, DOE officials said that they needed increased access to them\u2014as well as more opportunities to discuss safety issues with their counterparts\u2014to obtain a better understanding of the overall safety environment. A PNL official noted that access to and information about Russian facilities are improving. For example, he said that a U.S. team planned to visit the operating reactors at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk in September 1995.", "According to an official from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM), Russia\u2019s reprocessing facilities have many safety problems. MINATOM is responsible for most nuclear-related activities in Russia, including the weapons production complex and electricity generated by nuclear power. This official noted that since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the discipline of operators at these facilities has significantly deteriorated. He also said that the Soviet-era emphasis on meeting production goals rather than maintaining safety had hampered efforts to improve safety, which was better at other nuclear facilities, such as research institutes and design laboratories. An official from Russia\u2019s nuclear regulatory body told us that although safety is becoming more important at Russian facilities, it is difficult to undo problems created many years ago.", "According to NRC, although GAN is Russia\u2019s nuclear regulatory agency, it does not have the legal authority\u2014backed by national legislation\u2014to exercise strong and independent oversight; nor has it been adequately funded to carry out its mission. According to information furnished by DOE, although a 1992 Russian presidential decree gave GAN the overall responsibility for inspecting and licensing activities that involve handling radioactive material, its inspectors are not empowered to enforce compliance. The head of GAN\u2019s nuclear fuel cycle enterprises, which are responsible for the safety of production reactors and reprocessing plants, told us that his agency\u2019s regulatory authority is limited. He noted that although some safety changes were made, many recommendations GAN made after the Tomsk accident have been ignored. A 1994 Russian report noted that GAN had a skeletal staff supervising safety\u2014only 22 percent of the authorized slots were filled\u2014at nuclear weapons facilities.", "Furthermore, this report said that GAN was unable to carry out its responsibilities because the Russian Ministry of Defense had created obstacles to prevent inspections at nuclear defense facilities.", "DOE officials who have visited Russian nuclear facilities told us that accidents at nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union\u2014other than civil nuclear power reactors\u2014would not be of the magnitude of the Chernobyl accident. Most of the accidents that have been reported at these facilities did not have widespread radiological consequences. For example, while the 1993 accident at the Tomsk reprocessing facility caused substantial damage to the facility, it contaminated a largely unpopulated area of about 123 square kilometers. The accident released a relatively small amount of contamination\u2014about 40 curies\u2014compared to approximately 50 million curies released after the Chernobyl accident. The Tomsk accident could have had more serious local consequences if the wind had carried the contamination to two large nearby cities. According to available information, most accidents and incidents\u2014at facilities other than civil nuclear power reactors\u2014have occurred at reprocessing plants in Russia. More than one-half of these accidents occurred from the 1950s through the 1970s.

These facilities have generated massive amounts of nuclear waste and contamination that have created environmental problems. The possible migration of this contamination may also pose some risks to neighboring countries. For example, within the past few years there has been scientific and congressional concern that Alaska could be affected by this contamination.", "The majority of nuclear waste contamination is concentrated in Russia. Three plutonium production and reprocessing sites have been identified as the major sources of nuclear waste contamination from years of improper disposal practices. According to a June 1995 analysis prepared by a PNL scientist, the current level of discharge of radioactive material to the environment at these three sites is approximately 600 times greater than the remaining contamination from various other nuclear sources in Russia combined. This analysis also notes that the current radioactive inventory released from the nuclear weapons complex in Russia is approximately 1.7 billion curies, compared to about 2.6 million curies released by the U.S. nuclear weapons complex.", "Soviet-era nuclear waste practices have left a lasting imprint on Russia\u2019s environment. For example, starting in the late 1940s, radioactive waste from the Chelyabinsk facilities was released directly into the Techa River and nearby lakes, buried at the site, and stored in tanks. According to DOE, although the direct discharge of radioactive waste into rivers and lakes was curtailed many years ago, the cumulative effect has left some areas uninhabitable. As the contamination migrates, it threatens the groundwater supplies and waterways that flow into the Arctic Ocean. As a result of releases from Chelyabinsk, about 18,000 people were relocated and more than 440,000 people received an elevated dose of radiation. Beginning in the 1960s, the Soviet Union began to inject liquid radioactive waste into deep underground wells, a practice that has been used extensively at both Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk.", "Radioactive waste from other facilities and activities throughout the former Soviet Union have caused contamination problems. For example, Kazakhstan\u2019s Semipalatinsk and Russia\u2019s Novaya Zemlya test sites for nuclear weapons were used by the Soviets for approximately 40 years. Estonia has radioactivity problems resulting from Soviet nuclear submarine training reactors that operated at Paldiski. Uranium tailings\u2014radioactive particles and other hazardous materials\u2014resulting from mining, milling, and ore processing have caused contamination in several republics of the former Soviet Union."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nuclear-Powered Submarines and Ships Are Sources of Radioactive Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Environmental concerns resulting from Russia\u2019s nuclear fleets have received increased international attention in recent years. The primary source of concern is radioactive contamination from Russia\u2019s nuclear submarines and nuclear-powered civilian icebreakers. Most of the concerns stem from four main sources: (1) the dumping of damaged submarine and icebreaker reactors into the Kara Sea, (2) submarine accidents, (3) the dumping of liquid and solid radioactive waste from the Russian fleets into the Kara and Barents seas and the Sea of Japan, and (4) the inadequate treatment of and storage capacity for fuel from nuclear-powered vessels.", "In 1993, the Russian government released a report describing over three decades of Soviet-era dumping of radioactive material in the ocean. The report noted that during this time, the former Soviet Union dumped 2 reactor compartments without spent nuclear fuel into the Sea of Japan and 16 reactors into the Kara Sea, 6 of which contained spent or damaged fuel.", "The report also cited submarine accidents as a source of radioactive contamination. In August 1985, a submarine accident at a shipyard near Vladivostok released significant amounts of radioactive material. In 1989, the submarine, Komsomolets, sank approximately 300 miles from Norway after a fire disabled the vessel. Although the submarine had nuclear fuel in its reactor and nuclear warheads on board when it sank, Russian and international expeditions have not found evidence of substantial contamination around the sunken vessel.", "Because Russia does not have adequate treatment and storage facilities for radioactive waste, it has not signed a 1993 amendment to Annex I, section 6, of the London Convention. This amendment prohibits the dumping of all radioactive waste or other radioactive matter, including low-level liquid waste, into the seas. In September 1994, Russia announced that it intended to continue to voluntarily comply with the ban on low-level liquid waste dumping. However, according to several U.S., international, and Russian reports, Russia has a severe shortage of adequate waste storage and disposal facilities for liquid waste as well as for spent fuel assemblies and decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines. An EPA official who recently visited Russia told us that Russian naval officials believe the decommissioned submarines pose an increasingly significant safety hazard.", "The international community, including the United States, has conducted several studies to assess the impact of Russia\u2019s nuclear waste disposal practices on neighboring waterways, including the Arctic seas. Although these studies have not indicated significant contamination around the dump sites, they have not ruled out future problems. In a January 1995 report, the Office of Naval Research stated that nuclear waste in the Arctic and North Pacific regions poses no immediate threat to Alaskan citizens or its resources. According to an EPA official, there is reason to believe that the high-level radioactive material associated with the dumped reactors has yet to be released. Because this radioactive waste may start to enter the marine environment within a few years, the effects of this future contamination is uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Control of Other Radiation Sources Poses Threats of Radiation Exposure and Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Some officials, including the Nuclear Safety Attache to the U.S. Mission (in Vienna, Austria) and IAEA\u2019s Deputy Director, Division of Nuclear Safety, have expressed concerns to us about the inadequate control of radiation sources used in medicine, agriculture, research, and industry throughout the former Soviet Union. In May 1993, similar concerns were noted by several representatives from the former Soviet Union who were attending an IAEA forum on strengthening radiation protection and nuclear safety. The small size, portability, and value of these sources make them susceptible to misuse, improper disposal, or theft.", "Countries of the former Soviet Union have not established adequate systems to register, control, monitor, or account for radiation sources. These sources had been loosely controlled under the Soviet Union, but with its dissolution, the loss of centralized authority has left the new republics without adequate legal and regulatory structures. Representatives of some former Soviet Union republics have voiced concerns about the need to bring radiation sources under control, and some have admitted they do not know how many are still in use within their countries.", "Without an adequate control system, radiation sources may be lost, abandoned, stolen, or improperly disposed of, thereby creating the potential for human radiation exposure and localized environmental contamination. Numerous incidents involving the exposure of persons and contamination of areas have occurred over the past several years. For example, in 1994 a stolen source of radiation caused the death of a man and serious injury to his son in Estonia. In addition, the lack of control creates the potential for illicit trafficking of radiation sources to other countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. and International Assistance for Nuclear-Related Activities in the Former Soviet Union", "paragraphs": ["Several U.S. and international efforts focus on radioactive waste, radiation protection, and other related activities in the former Soviet Union.

According to an official from Norway\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway plans to spend about $20 million in 1995 on radiation protection and waste management projects. A Swedish official has estimated that Sweden has already spent about $10 million for similar projects. Japan plans to assist in underwriting the establishment of a joint venture between a Russian firm and a Japanese firm to construct and operate a storage and processing facility for liquid radioactive waste from the Russian Pacific Fleet.

The objective is to channel a modest amount of funds to primarily study issues of concern, such as the effects of radioactive waste contamination because of its potential impact on Alaska. The United States is not providing direct assistance to help remediate the nuclear waste contamination in the former Soviet Union. DOE is not authorized to provide such assistance, and both DOE and State Department officials said that such aid could be very costly because of the magnitude of the contamination problems.", "DOE, which is responsible for managing the cleanup of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, faces a major challenge to clean up the radioactive waste generated by more than four decades of nuclear weapons production. As a result, DOE is interested in acquiring innovative nuclear waste cleanup technologies from foreign countries through technology exchanges and other cooperative programs. DOE believes that its environmental programs with countries of the former Soviet Union should provide some tangible benefits to accelerate the cleanup of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. For example, DOE hopes to identify new cleanup technologies that could improve remediation at U.S. facilities through a $2 million technical cooperation program with Estonia. Additionally, DOE is contracting with various Russian and Ukrainian research institutes to identify cleanup technologies.

For example, the strengthening of Gosatomnadzor as the regulatory body responsible for inspecting these facilities in Russia may be one of the most effective ways to improve safety at weapons complex facilities that do not meet safety requirements.
