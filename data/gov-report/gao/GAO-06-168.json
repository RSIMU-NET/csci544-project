We found  the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in  conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, although  substantial doubt exists about the Foundation\u2019s ability to continue as a  going concern;  the Foundation did not have effective internal control over financial  reporting (including safeguarding assets) and compliance with laws and  regulations; and  a reportable noncompliance with one of the laws and regulations we  tested.", "The following sections provide additional detail about our conclusions and  the scope of our audit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opinion on Financial Statements", "paragraphs": ["The financial statements and accompanying notes present fairly, in all  material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles, the Foundation\u2019s financial position as of September 30, 2004,  and 2003, and the results of its activities and its cash flows for the fiscal  years then ended.  However, material misstatements may nevertheless  occur in information reported by the Foundation on its financial status to  its Board of Directors and others as a result of the material weakness in  internal control over financial reporting described in this report.", "As discussed in a later section of this report and in Note 12 to the financial  statements, the Foundation continues to experience increasing difficulties  in meeting its financial obligations.  The Foundation\u2019s continuing financial  difficulties and deteriorating financial condition raise substantial doubt, for  the third consecutive year, about its ability to continue as a going concern.   The financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the  Foundation would continue as a going concern, and do not include any  adjustments that would need to be made if the Foundation were to cease  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opinion on Internal Control", "paragraphs": ["Because of the material weakness in internal control discussed below, the  Foundation did not maintain effective internal control over financial  reporting (including safeguarding assets) or compliance with laws and  regulations, and thus did not provide reasonable assurance that losses,  misstatements, and noncompliance with laws material in relation to the  financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Our  opinion is based on criteria established in our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.", "The deteriorating financial condition of the Foundation led to further  deterioration in its control over its financial reporting process during fiscal  year 2004, impeding its ability to prepare timely and accurate financial  statements.  The lack of an individual with accounting and financial  management expertise taking responsibility for the Foundation\u2019s financial  operations during the period, brought about by the Foundation\u2019s lack of  funds, prevented it from fulfilling this and other key financial operations,  and contributed to its inability to maintain current and accurate financial  records.    We reported on this matter during our audit of the Foundation\u2019s  fiscal year 2003 financial statements.", "The Foundation\u2019s Director of Finance and Administration resigned his paid  position at the Foundation and became Treasurer of the Congressional  Award Board of Directors, an unpaid position, during fiscal year 2003.  He  continued to perform, on a limited and voluntary basis, some of the duties  associated with his former position during the first three quarters of fiscal  year 2004, as the continued shortage of funds precluded the Foundation  from hiring a replacement.  This resulted in the Foundation continuing to  be unable to fulfill its financial reporting responsibilities, particularly with  respect to preparing timely and accurate financial statements.  For  example, because the Foundation did not always record transactions in its  general ledger as they occurred during the year, numerous entries had to be  made to the general ledger as late as 12 months after fiscal year-end.  These  entries were ultimately prepared and recorded by a part-time bookkeeper  hired 6 months after the end of the fiscal year.  However, these entries were  not adequately reviewed by Foundation management to ensure their  completeness and accuracy.  This resulted in the need for management to  make material adjustments to correct errors we identified during our audit.", "Additionally, the Foundation continued to lack appropriate written  procedures for making closing entries in its financial records and for  preparing complete and accurate financial statements.  At the conclusion  of our audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2003 financial statements, we  stressed to the Foundation\u2019s management the importance of documenting  the Foundation\u2019s financial reporting policies and procedures, and further  stressed that the policies and procedures should detail such functions as  the monthly closing procedures, preparation of the financial statements,  and review of financial data by management.  The continued lack of written  policies and procedures contributed to the errors we identified during our  audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2004 financial statements.", "The Foundation was ultimately able to produce financial statements that  were fairly stated in all material respects for fiscal years 2004 and 2003.   However, the process was long and laborious, due to the lack of 1)  appropriate written policies and procedures and 2) routine maintenance of  the Foundation\u2019s financial books and records by personnel experienced in  accounting and financial management.  As a result, material corrections  were required between the first draft of the financial statements and the  final version.  Additionally, the Foundation\u2019s continued lack of an effective  financial reporting process forced us for the second consecutive year to  notify its congressional oversight committees that we would be unable to  meet our May 15, 2005, statutorily mandated audit reporting date.   Consequently, the Foundation\u2019s weakness in internal control over its  financial reporting process resulted in its inability to prepare reliable  financial statements on time and to produce financial information to  support management decision making.  This is especially critical in light of  the Foundation\u2019s precarious financial condition\u2014when accurate and timely  financial information is of utmost importance to make prudent and  informed operational decisions.", "Foundation management asserted that its internal control during the period  were not effective over financial reporting or compliance with laws and  regulations based on criteria established under Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.  In making its assertion, Foundation  management stated the need to improve control over financial reporting  and compliance with laws and regulations.  Although the weakness did not  materially affect the final fiscal year 2004 financial statements as adjusted  for misstatements identified by the audit process, this deficiency in internal  control may adversely affect any decision by management that is based, in  whole or in part, on information that is inaccurate because of the  deficiencies.  Unaudited financial information reported by the Foundation  may also contain misstatements resulting from these deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance With Laws and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Our tests for compliance with relevant provisions of laws and regulations  disclosed one area of material noncompliance that is reportable under U.S.  generally accepted government auditing standards.

For calendar year 2004, the Foundation still did  not have appropriate written fiscal procedures for its financial operations.   Additionally, the Foundation recorded entries for only half of the calendar  year, leaving many of the financial transactions of the Foundation  unrecorded during 2004.", "For 2004, because the Foundation did not have appropriate fiscal  procedures and did not have an individual with expertise in accounting and  financial management to routinely administer the procedures and account  for the financial operations of the Foundation, we determined that the  Director did not substantially complied with the requirements in section  104(c)(1) of the Congressional Award Act, as amended (2 U.S.C. \u00a7  804(c)(1)).  Under the requirements of section 104(c)(2)(B) of the  Congressional Award Act, as amended (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(c)(2)(B)), if the  Director fails to comply with the requirements of section 104(c)(1) of the  Act, the Director is to prepare, pursuant to section 108 of the Act, for the  orderly cessation of the activities of the Board.   The Foundation\u2019s Board  Chairman stated that during fiscal year 2005, its Board elected several new  Board Members and the Foundation hired an accountant to focus on  improving financial management.  The newly elected Treasurer and Audit  Committee Chair are working with the National Office staff to improve  internal control over financial reporting and develop written fiscal policies  and procedures for financial operations and reporting.  Additionally, the  accountant is to help ensure the accurate and timely accounting and  reporting of financial information occurs.", "Except as noted above, our tests for compliance with selected provisions  of laws and regulations for fiscal year 2004 disclosed no other instances of  noncompliance that would be reportable under U.S. generally accepted  government auditing standards.  However, the objective of our audit was  not to provide an opinion on overall compliance with laws and regulations.   Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Foundation\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern", "paragraphs": ["The Foundation incurred losses (decreases in net assets) of almost  $168,000 and $6,000 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Although  the Foundation\u2019s expenses decreased by over $166,000 between fiscal years  2003 and 2004, revenues decreased even more--by about $290,000, largely  attributable to a nearly $334,000 decline in contributions.  Net assets as of  September 30, 2004 were approximately $42,000.", "During fiscal year 2002, the Foundation borrowed $100,000, the maximum  amount allowable against its revolving line of credit, due to ongoing cash  flow problems associated with its daily operations.  This debt, partially  secured by a $50,000 certificate of deposit, remained outstanding at  September 30, 2004.", "Note 12 to the financial statements acknowledges the Foundation\u2019s  increasing difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.  While the  Foundation has taken steps to decrease its expenditures and liabilities,  those steps may not be sufficient to allow it to continue operations.  For  example, accounts payable at September 30, 2004, were approximately  $135,500, with 86 percent of that amount representing unpaid balances  owed to vendors from expenses incurred in fiscal year 2002.  The  Foundation was able to negotiate with certain of its vendors to cancel  nearly $39,000 in liabilities to these vendors subsequent to the end of the  fiscal year.  However, unaudited financial data compiled by the Foundation  as of September 30, 2005, showed that its financial condition has not  improved.  This raises substantial doubt about the Foundation\u2019s ability to  continue as a going concern, absent a means of generating additional  funding.", "As discussed earlier, during fiscal year 2003, the Director of Finance and  Administration resigned his position at the Foundation and became  Treasurer of the Congressional Award Board of Directors.  This move was  in part because of the Foundation\u2019s deteriorating financial condition.  In  another effort to keep expenses to a minimum, the Foundation reduced its  staff by over one-half during fiscal year 2004.   Additionally, during the  second half of fiscal year 2004, the Foundation\u2019s Board directed the  National Director to reduce his pay by 50 percent in order to further control  Foundation expenses.  The National Director retired as of September 30,  2004, and the Foundation promoted the Program Director to serve as the  Acting National Director.", "In its plan to deal with its deteriorating financial condition and increase its  revenues, the Foundation modified its approach to fundraising by holding  more frequent but smaller and less expensive fundraising events than in the  past.  However, these smaller fundraisers did not increase contributions  which, as noted above, decreased by $334,000 or 54 percent between fiscal  years 2003 and 2004.  To further improve fundraising efforts, the  Foundation stated that its Board created a Congressional Liaison  Committee, Development Committee, and Program Committee during  fiscal year 2005.  The newly elected Development Chairperson is leading  fundraising initiatives in the corporate community, including pursuing  grant opportunities, and the Foundation continues to work with  professional fundraisers to more actively involve congressional members.   At present, the Foundation is prohibited from receiving federal funds, but is  permitted to receive certain in-kind and indirect resources, as explained in  Note 5 to the financial statements.  The Foundation has attempted, but has  been unsuccessful, in securing federal funding through a direct  appropriation.", "On July 14, 2005, the Senate passed S. 335 to reauthorize the Congressional  Award Board, which terminated on October 1, 2004, until October 1, 2009.
