While the Navy has provided leadership in some rotational crewing programs, the Navy has not fully established a comprehensive management approach to coordinate and integrate rotational crewing efforts across the department and among various types of ships. GAO's prior work showed that sound management practices for implementing transformational programs include ensuring top leadership drives the change and dedicating an implementation team. The Navy has not assigned clear leadership and accountability for rotational crewing or designated an implementation team to ensure that rotational crewing receives the attention necessary to be effective. Without a comprehensive management approach, the Navy may not be able to lead a successful transformation of its crewing culture. The Navy has promulgated crew exchange instructions for some types of ships that have provided some specific guidance and increased accountability. However, the Navy has not developed an overarching instruction that provides high-level guidance for rotational crewing initiatives and it has not consistently addressed rotational crewing in individual ship-class concepts of operations. Defense best practices hold that key aspects of a concept of operations include how a set of capabilities may be employed to achieve objectives and identifies by whom, where, and how it is to be accomplished. The Navy has conducted some analyses of rotational crewing; however, it has not developed a systematic method for analyzing, assessing and reporting findings on the potential for rotational crewing on current and future ships. Despite using a comprehensive data-collection and analysis plan in the Atlantic Fleet Guided Missile Destroyer Sea Swap, the Navy has not developed a standardized data-collection plan that would be used to analyze all types of rotational crewing, and life-cycle costs of rotational crewing alternatives have not been evaluated. The Navy has also not adequately assessed rotational crewing options for future ships. As new ships are in development, DOD guidance requires that an analysis of alternatives be completed. These analyses generally include an evaluation of the operational effectiveness and estimated costs of alternatives. In recent surface ship acquisitions, the Navy has not consistently assessed rotational crewing options. In the absence of this, cost-effective force structure assessments are incomplete and the Navy does not have a complete picture of the number of ships it needs to acquire. The Navy has collected and disseminated lessons learned from some rotational crewing experiences; however, some ship communities have relied on informal processes. The Atlantic Sea Swap initiative used a systematic process to capture lessons learned. However, in other ship communities the actions were not systematic and did not use the Navy Lessons Learned System. By not systematically recording and sharing lessons learned from rotational crewing efforts, the Navy risks repeating mistakes and could miss opportunities to more effectively implement crew rotations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["At a time when the federal government is facing a large and growing fiscal  imbalance, the Department of Defense (DOD) and Congress will be asked  to make important program and investment decisions on Navy surface  ships.

The Navy  consistently faces affordability challenges as it attempts to provide  necessary forward presence while supporting a high pace of operations,  rising personnel costs, and cost growth in new ship classes. The Navy has  traditionally maintained overseas presence by using standard deployments  whereby individual ships and their permanently assigned crews are  deployed for approximately 6 months out of a 27-month cycle that  includes time for training and ship maintenance. To maximize its return on  investment while maintaining forward presence, the Navy is examining  different means for employing its surface ships. Rotational crewing is one  of many alternatives the Navy is pursuing to increase the utilization and  operational availability of Navy ships. Recently, the Chief of Naval  Operations cited rotational crewing as a cost-effective means of increasing  forward presence while maintaining current force structure levels.", "Rotational crewing has been and is a part of today\u2019s Navy; however, this  practice is not widespread and is still evolving. Since the 1960s, the Navy  has used \u201cBlue-Gold\u201d rotational crewing on its ballistic missile  submarines, whereby two complete crews are assigned to a single ship,  and they rotate deployments. The Navy also uses this \u201cBlue-Gold\u201d  rotational crewing alternative on its high speed vessel (HSV) experimental  ship, the HSV-2 Swift, and plans on using this crewing alternative for its  four newly converted guided missile submarines. In recent years, the  United States Pacific and Atlantic Fleets have both completed \u201cSea Swap\u201d  efforts that demonstrated the ability to rotate the crews of destroyers. The  \u201cSea Swap\u201d crewing alternative uses one deploying ship but multiple  sequentially deploying crews. Newly deploying crews swap ships with the  crew on the forward-deployed ship and nondeployed crews train and  perform maintenance on a ship in the home port. Currently, the Navy uses  similar rotational crews to employ mine warfare and patrol coastal ships  in the Persian Gulf. The Navy also plans to rotationally crew its new  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class, implementing a \u201cBlue-Gold\u201d alternative  on the first two ships and additional approaches in the future.

Recognizing the  Navy\u2019s need to explore ways to improve the use of its surface ships and its  plan to employ rotational crews on several types of surface ships in the  current and planned force, the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 directed us to report on the Navy\u2019s  Atlantic guided missile destroyer (DDG) Sea Swap initiative as well as  lessons learned from recent ship rotational crew experiments and the  extent to which these lessons are systematically collected and shared. The  mandate refers specifically to the Atlantic Fleet Sea Swap demonstrations,  but at times collectively refers to other rotational crewing efforts, current  or planned. We provided a briefing to the Committee on Armed Services of  the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of  Representatives to meet the mandate on March 4, 2008. In this report we  assess the extent to which the Navy has: (1) employed a comprehensive  management approach to coordinate and integrate rotational crewing  efforts; (2) developed and implemented guidance and concepts of  operations for rotational crewing; (3) systematically collected and  analyzed data on rotational crewing efforts for current and future ships;  and (4) collected and used lessons learned.", "To assess the extent to which the Navy employed a comprehensive  management approach to coordinate and integrate rotational crewing  efforts, we compared the Navy\u2019s approach with our prior work on best  practices for organizational transformations; reviewed relevant Navy  practices; and interviewed DOD, Navy, and fleet headquarters officials. To  assess the extent to which the Navy has developed, disseminated, and  implemented guidance and concepts of operations for rotational crewing  on surface ships, we obtained and analyzed relevant documentation  including, but not limited to, concepts of operations, directives,  instructions, and procedures from the Navy, and we interviewed fleet and  Navy headquarters officials. To assess the extent to which the Navy has  analyzed, evaluated, and assessed potential rotational crewing efforts for  current and future ships, we reviewed and analyzed the Atlantic Fleet DDG  Sea Swap data-collection and analysis plan and final report; collected and  analyzed recent ship-class acquisition documents, including analyses of  alternatives; interviewed fleet and Navy headquarters officials; and  conducted 19 focus groups with rotational crews.

By being forward-deployed, maritime forces can enable familiarity with  the environment and behavior patterns of regional actors. The Navy has  traditionally maintained overseas presence by using standard deployments  whereby individual ships and their permanently assigned crews are  deployed for approximately 6 months out of a 27-month cycle. However,  the amount of time a ship ultimately spends forward-deployed in a theater  of operations is affected by several factors in its employment cycle. These  factors include length of deployment, transit speeds to and from operating  areas, port calls, crew training and certification, ship maintenance  requirements, and maintaining sufficient readiness for surging forces  during nondeployed periods. The result is that a ship homeported in the  United States and deploying to the Persian Gulf area for 6 months will  normally spend less than 20 percent of its 27 month cycle in-theater and  that the Navy would need about six ships to maintain a continuous  presence in the region over a 2-year period.", "Rotational crewing has been proven to provide greater forward presence  for Navy ships by eliminating ship transits and maintaining more on- station time in distant operating areas. Specifically, the 2004 Pacific Fleet  Destroyer Sea Swap initiative demonstrated that rotational crewing  provides more forward presence with fewer ships. For example, one  Pacific Fleet destroyer, rotationally crewed with three sequentially- deployed crews, produced an additional 16 days of forward presence  compared with a standard four-ship/four-crew deployment. The Atlantic  Fleet DDG Sea Swap initiative produced similar results. For example, one  Atlantic Fleet destroyer, rotationally crewed with three crews, produced  25 days more of forward presence than a standard four-ship/four-crew  deployment. Assessments completed by the Center for Naval Analyses and  the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations confirmed the results of the  Pacific and Atlantic Sea Swap initiatives.

Naval Sea Systems Command  builds, buys, and maintains the Navy\u2019s ships and submarines and their  combat systems, as well as directs resources from program sponsors into  the proper mix of manpower and resources to properly equip the fleet.  Recently established Class Squadrons are functional command  organizations specific to particular ship classes (e.g., Patrol Coastal, LCS)  and are responsible for the manning, training, equipping and maintaining  processes. Class Squadrons use metric-based analysis to assess readiness,  examine class trends, establish lessons learned, and provide  recommendations and solutions. Other groups with critical involvement in  the implementation of rotational crewing efforts include Naval Surface  Forces, Naval Submarine Forces, and many others. However, none of  these groups has the overall authority, responsibility, and accountability to  coordinate and integrate all rotational crewing efforts because the Navy  has not specified how this will be accomplished in an overarching  guidance document for rotational crewing. Without formally designating  an overarching implementation team with diverse representation to  provide day-to-day management oversight of rotational crewing efforts,  the Navy can not be assured that rotational crewing programs will be  coordinated and integrated, and their results applied to the rest of the  fleet.

According to military  best practices, developing a data-collection and analysis plan is essential  to any experimental initiative by determining what needs to measured,  what data will be necessary to collect, and how the data are to be  analyzed. A data-collection and analysis plan consists of all data to be  collected, the content of the data (type, periodicity, and format), the  collection mechanism (automated or nonautomated processes, time  frame, location, and method), the data handling procedures, and  relationships of the data to the initiative itself.

The analysis of alternatives process is intended to refine the initial weapon  systems concept and requires an evaluation of the performance,  operational effectiveness, operational suitability, and estimated costs,  including full life-cycle costs, of alternatives that satisfy established  capability needs. The analysis of alternatives assesses the advantages and  disadvantages of alternatives being considered to satisfy capabilities,  including the sensitivity of each alternative to possible changes in key  assumptions or variables. In at least three recent surface-ship acquisitions,  the Navy has not consistently applied these principles because it did not  thoroughly analyze and evaluate rotational crewing options and because  the Navy\u2019s acquisition instruction does not explicitly require evaluating  rotational crewing in the Navy\u2019s ship analysis of alternatives.

The Swift has employed Blue-Gold rotational crewing while  conducting a range of missions, including experimentation, humanitarian  operations, and Global Fleet Station deployments. According to focus  groups, HSV-2 Swift sailors praised the predictability of the operating  cycle and Blue-Gold rotational crewing. Additionally, Fleet Commanders  and the commanding officers of the HSV-2 Swift Blue and Gold crews  provided positive feedback on the Swift mission performance. High  demand for the ship and its capabilities has been met because rotational  crewing enabled the ship to maintain a high operational availability and a  sustained forward presence.

However, the Joint High Speed Vessel  analysis of alternatives does not include any discussion of the Swift\u2019s  rotational crewing experiences, despite their successes with maintaining a  very high operational availability. In the analysis of alternatives, the Joint  High Speed Vessel force structure requirements and basing options are  driven by forward presence and the need for critical response time, but  rotational crewing was not included as an option that may increase Joint  High Speed Vessel forward presence.", "During the analysis of alternatives for the DDG-1000 guided missile  destroyer, rotational crewing was not thoroughly analyzed despite  statements by Navy officials early in the acquisition process and in the  original operational requirements document that linked rotational  crewing to the ship. The analysis of alternatives for the DDG-1000  compared the effects of rotational crewing and traditional crewing on the  number of ships required to generate forward presence requirements. The  evaluation showed that using rotational crewing alternatives, in place of  the traditional single crew approach, produces a higher forward presence  with fewer ships. Although the analysis of alternatives acknowledged that  rotational crewing met forward presence requirements, while requiring  fewer ships, the analysis of alternatives omitted further analyses of  rotational crewing for DDG-1000. Furthermore, the analysis of alternatives  addressed the rotational crewing concept, but did not analyze the effect of  different rotational crewing schemes on force structure, training, materiel,  and other aspects that would affect overall life-cycle costs.

Further, several ship commands have  promulgated their own crew-exchange instructions and concepts of  operations.", "Progress has been limited, however, to specific rotational crewing efforts  and has not been systematically integrated across the Navy. Without a  comprehensive management approach that includes top-level leadership  and an implementation team to guide and assess rotational crewing, the  Navy can not be assured that rotational crewing efforts are coordinated  and integrated as it attempts to lead a successful transformation of its  ship-crewing culture. Further, without an overarching instruction to guide  rotational crewing initiatives, the Navy may limit the potential for  successfully managing, implementing, and evaluating rotational crewing as  a transformational means of increasing capabilities in a cost-effective  manner.", "The Navy has also not developed a systematic approach to analyzing  rotational crewing alternatives or collecting and sharing related lessons  learned. Without a systematic approach to analyzing rotational crewing  alternatives on current and future ships, the Navy may not be able to  determine if particular alternatives are successful in, or have the potential  for, fulfilling operational needs and maximizing return on investment. As a  result, the Navy may not develop and procure the most cost-effective mix  of ships to meet operational needs.

DOD disagreed with our five other  recommendations that would assign clear leadership and accountability  for managing rotational crewing efforts; establish an overarching  implementation team; develop and promulgate overarching guidance to  provide the high-level vision and guidance needed to consistently and  effectively manage, implement, and evaluate all rotational crewing efforts;  ensure the systematic collection and dissemination of lessons learned  pertaining specifically to rotational crewing; and incorporate components  of the lessons-learned approach outlined in the Atlantic Fleet DDG Sea  Swap Concept of Operations. DOD stated that measures are already in  place to manage ship and submarine manning, training, and equipping.  However, as discussed below, we do not believe that the Navy\u2019s actions go  far enough in providing leadership, management, and guidance in  transforming the Navy\u2019s surface-ship-crewing culture; collecting data,  analyzing, reporting, and integrating the results of different rotational  crewing efforts; and in documenting and acting on lessons it has learned  during implementation of different rotational crewing alternatives. As  such, the Navy may be missing opportunities to improve its  transformational capabilities and cost-effectively increase surface-ship  operational availability.

Our specific comments follow.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Navy facilitate the  successful transformation of its ship-crewing culture by assigning clear  leadership and accountability for managing rotational crewing efforts.  DOD stated that the Department of the Navy has existing clear leadership  and accountability for the manning of ships and submarines and that this  management structure includes oversight and leadership within both  operational and administrative chains of command. It further noted that  additional organizational structure dedicated to rotational crewing is  unnecessary and potentially counterproductive. We have identified several  key management practices at the center of implementing transformational  programs, which include ensuring that top leadership drives the  transformation. While the Navy has administrative and operational  management structures, there is not a designated leader to manage all  rotational crewing efforts in the Department of the Navy. As a result,  numerous separate rotational crewing efforts continue with little, if any,  top-down leadership and coordination, and no team or steering group  exists within the Navy to manage the transformation of the Navy\u2019s ship- crewing culture. We continue to believe that our recommendation merits  further action and have included this issue in a matter for congressional  consideration.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Navy should establish  an overarching implementation team to provide day-to-day management  oversight of rotational crewing efforts, coordinate and integrate efforts,  and apply their results to the Fleet. DOD stated that the Navy already  exercises day-to-day management to support ship and submarine manning  and training and that an implementation team dedicated to rotational  crewing is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive. We reported in  2003 that key practices for successful transformations include that an  implementation team should be responsible for the day-to-day  management of transformation to ensure various initiatives are integrated.  Although the Navy has established implementation teams for selected  rotational crewing initiatives and has other existing management  structures, it has not established an implementation team for managing all  rotational crewing programs to ensure successful transformation of the  Navy\u2019s ship-crewing culture. As a result, the Navy does not have a  dedicated team or steering group that can devote focused attention,  provide a communication structure, apply lessons learned, and execute  other key practices that would build on its successful efforts and ensure  consistent management of rotational crewing across the fleet. We continue  to believe that our recommendation merits further action and have  included this issue in a matter for congressional consideration.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Navy should develop  and promulgate overarching guidance to provide the high-level vision and  guidance needed to consistently and effectively manage, implement, and  evaluate all rotational crewing efforts. DOD stated that the Navy has  sufficient guidance in place to provide the high-level vision necessary to  manage ship and submarine manning. As discussed in the report, the Navy  has developed guidance for some rotational crewing efforts. However, the  development, dissemination, and implementation of rotational crewing  guidance has been inconsistent and fragmented. As noted in this report, an  overarching directive for rotational crewing would provide essential and  consistent Navy-wide policy and guidance on rotational crewing efforts;  establish leadership, delegate authority, and assign responsibilities; assign  missions, functions, or tasks; and establish a reporting requirement. DOD  also stated that, although rotational crewing includes some unique crew  considerations and support requirements, the training and support of  sailors involved in rotational crewing are little different than those for  sailors in the standard crewing process. We agree that the goals and  objectives of ship and crew training and support are little different  between rotational and standard crews. However, as shown in some of the  concepts of operations and in the Navy Lessons Learned System, crew  exchange guidance for rotational crewing and the execution of training  and support for rotational crewing efforts can provide many unique  challenges for sailors, in addition to the challenge of adapting sailors to a  change in ship-crewing culture. We continue to believe that our  recommendation merits further action and have included this issue in a  matter for congressional consideration.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation that the Commander, U.S.  Fleet Forces, direct the development and promulgation of concepts of  operations by all ship communities using or planning to use rotational  crewing. DOD stated that the Navy already uses appropriate concepts for  fleet operations and, when or if additional rotational crewing is warranted,  the Navy will issue specific guidance, instructions, and concepts of  operations. While we strongly support the Navy\u2019s efforts to develop  concepts of operations that guide fleet rotational crewing efforts, its  efforts have been inconsistent. For example, ship communities, such as  patrol coastal and mine warfare, have experienced implementation  challenges because they lacked key information such as the roles and  responsibilities of individual decision makers, managers, and leaders  involved in rotational crewing execution. For these reasons, we continue  to believe that our recommendation merits further action and that the  Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces, should direct the development and  promulgation of concepts of operations by all ship communities using or  planning to use rotational crewing, using the Atlantic Fleet DDG Sea Swap  Concept of Operations as a model for other rotational crewing initiatives.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation that the Navy develop a  standardized, systematic method for data collection and analysis,  assessment, and reporting on the results of rotational crewing efforts,  including a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis that includes life- cycle costs, for all rotational crewing efforts. DOD stated that the Navy has  no plans for broad general application of rotational crewing to all ship  classes, and a standing implementation team and data collection is  unnecessary. DOD also stated that the Navy will conduct appropriate  studies to determine if and when additional rotational crewing is  appropriate based on cost effectiveness. While we support DOD\u2019s efforts  to proactively conduct studies, based on cost effectiveness, to determine if  and when rotational crewing is appropriate to use on surface ships, we  urge the Navy to take steps to develop a standardized, systematic method  for collecting data and analyzing, assessing, and reporting results,  including cost-effectiveness analysis, on all rotational crewing efforts,  including those currently underway. As discussed in the report, the  Surface Warfare Enterprise is collecting data from surface ships, including  those participating in rotational crewing initiatives; however, the data they  collect is not consistent from initiative to initiative, and none of the data  are tied to the effectiveness of different crewing schemes or rotational  versus traditional crewing schemes. DOD also stated that the LCS is the  only new ship class that currently plans on implementing rotational  crewing. While we agree that the LCS is the only new ship class with  definitive plans to rotationally crew its ships, several other future ship  classes, including the Joint High Speed Vessel, DDG-1000, and CG(X), still  fit the requirements of potential rotationally crewed ships, as described by  Fleet Forces Command. Therefore, we continue to believe, as we have  recommended, that DOD should direct the Navy to develop a standardized,  systematic method for data collection and analysis, assessment, and  reporting on the results of rotational crewing efforts, including a  comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis that includes life-cycle costs, so  that the potential value of rotational crewing will be known and the Navy  will be able to determine optimal crewing concepts for current and future  ship classes.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation that the Navy require, as  part of the mandatory analysis of alternatives in the concept refinement  phase of the defense acquisition process, assessments of potential  rotational crewing options for each class of surface ship in development,  including full life-cycle costs of each crewing option. DOD agreed that all  feasible crewing options should be considered during the concept  refinement phase of the defense acquisition process. Ships determined to  have a potential advantageous rotational crewing application will assess  and include this option among the various crewing alternatives reported  by the analysis of alternatives. We support DOD\u2019s assessment that all  feasible rotational crewing options should be considered during the  concept refinement phase in the analysis of alternatives.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Navy develop  overarching guidance to ensure the systematic collection and  dissemination of lessons learned pertaining specifically to rotational  crewing. DOD stated that the Navy already uses \u201clessons learned\u201d tools as  part of the rotational crewing and that further guidance to use these tools  is not needed. We support the progress the Navy has made in collecting  lessons learned and documenting these lessons in the Navy Lessons  Learned System. However, as discussed in the report, most ship  communities did not submit or draw on lessons in the Navy Lessons  Learned System to enhance knowledge sharing or learn from others\u2019  experiences. For example, the mine warfare, patrol coastal, LCS, and  guided missile submarine communities lack formal written processes to  collect lessons learned related specifically to rotational crewing. Without  guidance to ensure collection and dissemination of lessons learned, the  Navy unnecessarily risks repeating past mistakes and could miss  opportunities to more effectively plan and conduct crew rotations.  Therefore, we continue to believe that our recommendation merits further  action and have included this issue in a matter for congressional  consideration.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Navy incorporate  components of the lessons-learned approach outlined in the Atlantic Fleet  DDG Sea Swap Concept of Operations, including, among other things,  establishing a lessons-learned team, developing a data-collection plan, and  increasing use of the Navy Lessons Learned System. DOD stated that the  Navy already relies on data collection and analysis from ships and that  requiring already implemented rotational crewing efforts to adopt  experimental data collection procedures is unnecessary. DOD further  stated that procedures are already in place for crews, rotational or  standard, to provide data to the chain of command to identify  improvements. As discussed in the report, the Navy has taken some  actions to collect, disseminate, and capitalize on lessons learned from its  crew rotation experiences. However, despite some progress in collecting  and sharing lessons learned within individual ship communities, the  Navy\u2019s efforts in many cases were not systematic and did not use the Navy  Lessons Learned System. Instead, the development and sharing of lessons  learned relied on informal processes that are left to individual ship  commands, and thus were not done consistently across all ship  communities that use rotational crewing. The initiative ensured  documentation of lessons learned by outlining a requirement and a  process in the Atlantic Fleet DDG Sea Swap Concept of Operations. The  concept of operations also noted that the risks of not taking a proactive  approach to lessons learned include failing to document policy changes  and preserve process improvements, which is important given the high  turnover of personnel during the time frame of the initiative.

Discussions were  held in a structured manner, guided by a moderator who used a  standardized list of questions to encourage participants to share their  thoughts and experiences. Our overall objective in using a focus group  approach was to obtain views, insights, and feelings of Navy submarine  and ship officers and enlisted personnel involved in crew rotations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of Our Focus Groups", "paragraphs": ["To gain broad perspectives, we conducted 19 separate focus group  sessions with multiple groups of Navy ship officers and enlisted personnel  involved in crew rotations on a broad range of ship types, from small  focused mission ships such as patrol coastals to larger, more complex  ships such as nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed strategic missile  submarines. Table 3 identifies the composition of the focus groups on  each of the vessels. Across focus groups, participants were selected to  ensure a wide distribution of officers, enlisted personnel, seniority, and  ship departments. GAO analysts traveled to three naval stations to conduct  the focus groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology for Our Focus Groups", "paragraphs": ["We conducted focus groups with all ship communities currently  participating in rotational crewing. The number of focus groups we  conducted varied by ship community depending upon ship crew sizes, the  types of crew member responsibilities (e.g., command, engineering, and  maintenance) and the experience level of the crew members. We  developed a guide to assist the moderator in leading the discussions. The  guide helped the moderator address several topics related to crew  rotations: training, maintenance, infrastructure and operations,  management and oversight, readiness, crew characteristics, quality of life,  lessons learned, and overall satisfaction with the rotational crewing  experience. We assured participants anonymity of their responses, in that  names would not be directly linked to their responses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Focus Groups", "paragraphs": ["Methodologically, focus groups are not designed to (1) demonstrate the  extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger population,   (2) develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or make  decisions about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically  representative samples or reliable quantitative estimates. Instead, they are  intended to generate in-depth information about the focus group  participants\u2019 reasons for the attitudes held toward specific topics and to  offer insights into the range of concerns and support for an issue.", "The projectability of the information produced by our focus groups is  limited for several reasons. First, they represent the responses of Navy  ship officers and enlisted personnel from the 19 selected groups. Second,  while the composition of the groups was designed to assure a distribution  of Navy officers, enlisted personnel, seniority, and ship departments, the  groups were not randomly sampled. Third, participants were asked  questions about their specific experiences with crew rotations. The  experiences of other Navy ship officers and personnel involved in crew  rotations, who did not participate in our focus group, may have varied.", "Because of these limitations, we did not rely entirely on focus groups, but  rather used several different methodologies to corroborate and support  our conclusions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["GAO DRAFT REPORT \u2013 DATED APRIL 8, 2008  \u201cFORCE STRUCTURE:  Ship Rotational Crewing Initiatives Would Benefit   From Top Level Leadership, Navywide Guidance, Comprehensive Analysis   and Improved Lessons Learned Sharing\u201d", "RECOMMENDATION 1: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy to assign clear leadership and accountability for managing  rotational crewing efforts.", "DOD RESPONSE:  Non-concur.   The Department of the Navy has clear leadership and  accountability for the manning of ships and submarines.  This management structure  includes oversight and leadership within both operational and administrative chains of  command.  These organizational structures provide for manning, training and equipping  all Navy ships and submarines regardless of crewing concept.  Additional organizational  structure dedicated to rotational crewing is unnecessary and potentially  counterproductive.", "RECOMMENDATION 2: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy to establish an overarching implementation team to provide  day-to-day management oversight of rotational crewing efforts, coordinate and integrate  efforts, and apply their results to the Fleet.", "DOD RESPONSE:   Non-concur.  The Navy already exercises day-to-day management  to support ship and submarine manning and training.  An implementation team dedicated  to rotational crewing is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive.", "RECOMMENDATION 3: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy to develop and promulgate overarching guidance to provide the  high-level vision and guidance needed to consistently and effectively manage,  implement, and evaluate all rotational crewing efforts.", "DoD RESPONSE: Non-concur.   The Navy has sufficient guidance in place to provide  the high-level vision necessary to manage ship and submarine manning.  Although  rotational crewing includes some unique crew considerations and support requirements,  the training and support of Sailors involved in rotational crewing are little different than  those for Sailors in the standard crewing process.", "RECOMMENDATION 4: The GAO recommends that the Commander, U.S. Fleet  Forces direct the development and promulgation of concepts of operations by all ship  communities, using or planning to use rotational crewing, that include a description of  how rotational crewing may be employed and the details of by whom, where, and how it  is to be accomplished, employed, and executed.", "DoD RESPONSE: Partial concur.  The Navy already uses appropriate concepts for Fleet  operations.  When or if additional rotational crewing is warranted, the Navy will issue  specific guidance, instructions, and/or concepts of operations.", "RECOMMENDATION 5: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy, under the purview of the implementation team, to develop a  standardized, systematic method for data collection and analysis, assessment and  reporting on the results of rotational crewing efforts, including a comprehensive cost- effectiveness analysis that includes life cycle costs, for all rotational crewing efforts.", "DoD RESPONSE: Partial concur.  The Littoral Combat Ship is the only new ship class  that currently plans on implementing rotational crewing. The Navy has no plans for broad  general application of rotational crewing to all ship classes, and a standing  implementation team and data collection is unnecessary.  The Navy will conduct  appropriate studies to determine if and when additional rotational crewing is appropriate  based on cost effectiveness.", "RECOMMENDATION 6: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy, under the purview of the implementation team, to require as  part of the mandatory analysis of alternatives in the concept refinement phase of the  defense acquisition process, assessments of potential rotational crewing options for each  class of surface ship in development, including full life cycle costs of each crewing  option.", "DoD RESPONSE: Partial concur.  The Department of Defense agrees that all feasible  crewing options should be considered during the concept refinement phase of the defense  acquisition process.  Ships determined to have a potential advantageous rotational  crewing application will assess and include this option among the various crewing  alternatives reported by the Analysis of Alternatives.", "RECOMMENDATION 7: The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy to develop overarching guidance to ensure the systematic  collection and dissemination of lessons learned pertaining specifically to rotational  crewing.", "DoD RESPONSE: Non-concur.
