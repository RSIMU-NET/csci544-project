According to the Navy, the ground attack capabilities were required to partially compensate for the loss in combat capabilities during the period starting in 1997, when all of its A-6E Intruder attack aircraft are scheduled to be retired, to the turn of the century when the F/A-18E/F, the next generation strike fighter, is scheduled to arrive. The F-14 was to undergo two upgrades. An initial upgrade, commonly called the A/B upgrade, included structural modifications to extend the F-14\u2019s fatigue life to 7,500 hours, improved defensive capabilities and cockpit displays, and incorporation of digital architecture and mission computers to speed data processing time and add software capacity. The A/B upgrade had to be incorporated into 157 F-14 aircraft before the second upgrade, called the Block I, could be added. Block I was to add a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) pod with a built-in laser to designate targets and allow F-14s to independently drop laser guided bombs (LGBs), a modified cockpit for night attack operations (night vision devices and compatible lighting), and enhanced defensive countermeasures.", "Concerned about the Navy\u2019s capability to maintain carrier-based power projection without A-6Es and with only limited F-14 upgrades, the Joint Conference Committee on the fiscal year 1994 Defense Authorization Act directed the Navy to add an F-15E equivalent capability to its F-14D aircraft, including the capability to use modern air-to-ground stand-off weapons. The act restricted the obligation of fiscal year 1994 F-14 procurement funds until 30 days after the Navy submitted a report outlining its plans to add more robust ground attack capability. The report, submitted on May 20, 1994, reiterated the Navy\u2019s intent to add only the A/B and Block I upgrades.", "During recent fiscal year 1995 deliberations, the defense authorization act conferees eliminated funding for F-14 Block I ground attack upgrades, authorizing funds for only the A/B structural and survivability modifications. In a subsequent similar action, defense appropriation act conferees did not appropriate funds for the Block I upgrades. The Navy eliminated the Block I ground attack upgrade from its Program Objectives Memorandum. However, Navy officials continue to believe a ground attack upgrade is necessary. A final decision on the extent of the upgrade depends upon the results of a COEA and an acquisition milestone decision scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995.", "In a related response to congressional direction to add more robust capability to the F-14, beyond that mentioned above, the Navy estimated it would cost $1.8 billion to add F-15E-equivalent capability to 53 F-14Ds and another $9 billion to upgrade 198 F-14A/Bs. According to the Navy, an upgrade of that magnitude was not affordable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Upgraded F-14s Will Be Less Capable Than F/A-18Cs", "paragraphs": ["Most F-14s, even after receiving the Block I upgrade, will lack some important capabilities that the F/A-18C currently has or will gain in the near future. The absence of these capabilities could limit the combat effectiveness and utilization of the F-14 under some adverse conditions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most F-14s Will Lack Ground Attack Radars", "paragraphs": ["The Block I upgrade will permit F-14s to drop LGBs, which are more accurate than unguided gravity bombs. But the usefulness of laser targeting is limited when targets are obscured by clouds, smoke, haze, and moisture that prevent laser beams from illuminating and marking the targets and from providing a clear path for the bomb guidance system to follow. Thus, to assist crews in locating and identifying targets, attack aircraft need synthetic aperture radar with ground mapping capability.", "The F-14A/B models\u2019 AWG-9 radar is one of the most powerful U.S. military aircraft radars for detecting multiple air targets approaching at long range, but it is not ideally suited to pinpointing ground targets under some conditions. For example, it does not provide a ground mapping capability that permits crews to locate and attack targets in adverse weather and poor visibility or to precisely update the aircraft\u2019s location relative to targets during the approach, a capability that improves bombing accuracy. Only the 53 F-14Ds, with their improved APG-71 synthetic aperture ground mapping radar, will have this capability. The 157 F-14A/Bs in the Block I program, lacking the APG-71 radar, will not be as effective in locating, identifying, and attacking targets, except in daylight and clear visibility conditions. F/A-18Cs, which have synthetic aperture ground mapping radar with a doppler beam sharpening mode to generate ground maps, have greater capability, and they will get even more precise and clear radar displays when they receive the APG-73 radar upgrade later this decade.

No Block I F-14s will be able to launch precision stand-off attack weapons such as the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), Harpoon antiship missile, Maverick anti-armor missile, Walleye guided bomb, and Stand-off Land Attack Missile (SLAM).

(AMRAAM is the Defense Department\u2019s newest air-to-air missile.) The Navy has stated that it cannot afford to add stand-off weapon capability to other F-14s.

While range (distance) and endurance (loiter time in the target area) are important capabilities, they are not as critical in littoral warfare, when carriers may operate close to shore. Operating close to the shore decreases the distance to targets and increases the amount of loiter time the aircraft has at or near the target. The Secretary of the Navy, in the 1994 Posture Statement, stated that 85 percent of the Navy\u2019s potential targets are within 200 miles of the world\u2019s shorelines.", "Although the F-14 generally has greater range and endurance than the F/A-18C, the majority of littoral targets should be within the F/A-18C\u2019s range, even with an aircraft carrier operating 100 miles or more offshore. The Navy\u2019s Atlantic Fleet officials told us that F/A-18Cs carrying four 1,000-pound bombs and external fuel tanks have an unrefueled mission radius of about 340 miles. Future F/A-18Es are projected to carry the same weapon load up to 520 miles without refueling. While the longer range F-14s could potentially reach the 15 percent of the targets beyond 200 miles of shorelines, alternatives are available. The Navy\u2019s Tomahawk cruise missile can strike fixed targets up to a range of about 700 miles. Air Force bombers, with mid-air refueling, have even a greater range. If aerial refueling is available, as should be the case with U.S. forces operating jointly, an aircraft\u2019s range, including the F/A-18\u2019s, can be extended significantly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Upgraded F-14s Will Be Less Capable Than Some Attack Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["The Block I F-14 aircraft will not have all of the capability of the Air Force\u2019s F-15E Strike Eagle (a long range, all-weather, multimission strike fighter with precision weapons capability), the Navy\u2019s own F/A-18C Hornet, or its A-6E Intruder (see table 2). F-14A/Bs can drop most unguided bombs, including 500-, 1,000-, and 2,000-pound gravity bombs, as well as cluster munitions. They can also drop LGBs if another aircraft marks the target with a laser beam. Block I will add the capability to independently drop LGBs without external assistance. F-14A/B aircraft will not have a radar ground mapping capability to assist crews in locating, identifying, and attacking targets when visibility is poor.

The Navy plans to procure F/A-18 E/F aircraft starting in fiscal year 1997 and expects the aircraft to enter service in the year 2000. In the interim, two carrier air wings have retired their A-6Es, and these air wings will operate for 5 years, at a minimum, before the first upgraded F-14s are delivered in 1999. The USS Constellation is scheduled to deploy late in 1994, without A-6Es. Its F-14Ds cannot drop bombs because they lack the necessary computer software.", "The first carrier air wing equipped with Block I F-14s will not deploy until fiscal year 1999 or 2000. The last F-14s will not complete the upgrade until fiscal year 2003. By that time, if not earlier, the Navy should start receiving squadrons of F/A-18E/Fs to replace F-14s and older F/A-18s.", "As the Navy eliminates A-6Es from carrier air wings, it plans to add a third squadron of F/A-18s to each wing, increasing the number of F/A-18s in each air wing from 20 to 36. The Navy also plans to eliminate one F-14 squadron from each air wing, reducing the number from 20 to 14 planes. Two air wings, including the USS Constellation\u2019s, will receive this modified air wing mix in fiscal year 1994.

Commenting on the Navy\u2019s willingness to immediately deploy carriers without A-6Es, relying completely on F/A-18s for its strike capability, Navy officials said this decision is a reflection of affordability constraints, not a willingness to forgo the capability.
