Policies for managing its major acquisition  programs are primarily set forth in a directive and supporting instruction.  These policies outline an acquisition life cycle framework (ALF) that  includes a series of predetermined milestones\u2014known as acquisition  decision events\u2014at which the Acquisition Decision Authority reviews a  program to assess whether it is ready to proceed to the next phase of the  ALF. DHS\u2019s Under Secretary for Management serves as the Acquisition  Decision Authority for the department\u2019s major acquisition programs.", "A separate DHS instruction and associated guidebook outline a  framework of major systems engineering activities and technical reviews,  collectively considered the systems engineering life cycle (SELC), which  should be conducted by all DHS programs, both major and non-major.  The SELC helps to ensure that appropriate systems engineering activities  are planned and implemented and that a program\u2019s development effort is  meeting business needs. The SELC consists of major activities and a set  of related technical reviews and artifacts that fit within the acquisition life  cycle.", "Figure 2 depicts the acquisition life cycle and associated technical  reviews established in DHS acquisition management policy.", "DHS provided programs with flexibility in their SELC technical reviews.  Within the ALF, Agile processes are applied primarily within the obtain  phase, where design, development, testing, and implementation of a  system takes place. Prior to entering the obtain phase, a program selects  its software development approach, such as Agile. The agreed-upon  approach is then codified in an SELC Tailoring Plan, which is approved at  acquisition decision event 2A. The SELC Tailoring Plan identifies the  technical reviews and artifacts that the program is responsible for  completing based on its unique characteristics (e.g., scope, complexity,  and risk).", "To assist in tailoring efforts and further guide the implementation of Agile,  DHS published an Agile instruction that includes the scope, definitions,  roles and responsibilities, and procedures for establishing an Agile  framework for developing all DHS IT acquisitions. DHS supplemented  this instruction with an Agile instruction manual and provided a template  that Agile programs can follow to tailor their activities. For example,  instead of holding a system definition review, an Agile program is  encouraged to conduct a release planning review (which encompasses  the development and release of a segment of software). This optional  approach to tailoring a technical review is depicted in figure 3.", "Outside of technical reviews, DHS updated acquisition policy in February  2019 and associated guidance in May 2019 to allow programs greater  flexibility in the larger ALF. The Director of Strategic Technology  Management (STM) stated that, under the previous acquisition policy and  guidance, IT programs were using in-house expertise due to limited  funding to prepare for the 2B decision, when full program funding was  received. He noted that, by the time a contract was awarded for  development following a 2B decision, the contractor might or might not  have been using planning artifacts developed by the program and instead  might have recreated them, thereby rendering 2 to 3 years of work  useless. The Director stated that programs were unable to fully flesh out  the program architecture and other key aspects of the program because  programs did not receive funding until the 2B decision and in-house  expertise was limited. For example, if a program had not proven out its  architecture prior to a 2B decision, it could continue to refine and modify  the architecture during the course of development, thereby impacting  productivity and quality. DHS updated acquisition management policy and  guidance to modify the requirements for the acquisition decision events  and addressed a related GAO recommendation.", "DHS policy and guidance also allowed for programs to modify  requirements over the course of development. The traditional process for  requirements may be modified as part of tailoring the SELC in order to  allow for increased flexibility. The DHS Requirements Engineering User\u2019s  Guide detailed requirements engineering steps, activities, and methods  for performing those steps.", "DHS developed this user guide to supplement SELC policy and guidance.  One section of this guide focused on Agile development. According to the  guide, requirements are broken down over the course of the ALF and  commitments are made at different levels of specificity. Fundamental  capability gaps are defined in the mission needs statement presented at  acquisition decision event 1. Subsequently, the analyze/select phase  would ultimately define the high-level features and functions of each  required capability, define the fundamental performance of those high- level features and functions, and establish the business case to support  approving the acquisition at an acquisition decision event 2A. Often, a  preliminary concept of operations is developed and delivered with the  mission needs statement.", "The guide also states that the activities to evaluate these potential  alternatives will ultimately result in a preferred solution with defined  business practices, methods, and processes that allow the development  of business epics and associated architecture epics. Business epic is an  Agile term that defines the high-level \u201cstories\u201d that describe a capability,  or what the new system is required to perform. Architectural epic is an  Agile term that defines the architecture the system will be incorporated  into. In addition, the preferred solution would have defined high-level  performance requirements (stated from the operational perspective) in  terms of how well the solution must perform to be operationally effective  and suitable. Key constraints such as security, Section 508 compliance,  privacy, reliability, etc., should also be identified. These top-level  requirements will be documented in the operational requirements  document.", "According to the guide, Agile teams capture the capabilities and  constraints (essentially the functional and non-functional requirements  that reflect the business epic level of performance) in an artifact called the  capabilities and constraints document. Requirements statements in this  document should follow the standard \u201cshall statement\u201d format for ease of  translation between the operational requirements document and the  capabilities and constraints document. The capabilities and constraints  document and its contents mature over time and, as the document  matures, business and architectural epics decompose to  features/functions or themes, and ultimately to user stories that reflect the  specific tasks that users will perform. Officials within the DHS Joint  Requirements Council noted that headquarters involvement occurred at  this level to approve the high-level operating requirements.", "After headquarters oversight and approval, the program may then  decompose requirements as part of planning for and executing technical  reviews. If tailored into an Agile program, the capabilities and constraints  document should drive the development of a backlog. The backlog is a  list of all the user stories that describe what the system needs to do. The  backlog should become more refined as the program decomposes the  high-level features (a service that fulfills a user need) and functions down  to specific stories that an individual software developer will code and test  during a specific iteration.", "To prevent the backlog from becoming unmanageable, DHS guidance  stated that backlogs may be established at different levels. For example,  the business and architectural epics along with the associated operating  requirements would constitute the \u201cprogram backlog.\u201d Sub-epics are  usually broken down into \u201chigh-level features\u201d with business epics broken  down into business features and architectural epics broken down into  architectural features. Features or functions are decomposed into detailed  stories that are then allocated to a \u201crelease\u201d. The list of user stories in a  specific release constitutes the release backlog. This process of  decomposing stories continues to the iteration backlog.", "DHS guidance places an emphasis on end user needs. The  Requirements Engineering User\u2019s Guide raised the importance of  identifying stakeholders, including system users, and capturing the needs  of those users via requirements or, in the case of Agile, user stories. The  Agile instruction manual placed an emphasis on the importance of users  to a program and articulated that the product owner represent the user  community and was expected to continually seek ongoing feedback and  elicit requirements from users. The Agile core metrics also strongly  recommended the use of a net promoter score. This score was one  mechanism for measuring customer satisfaction through asking users to  rank how likely they would be to recommend the system or application to  a friend or colleague, based on a score of 1 to 10.", "Clearly align goals and objectives  Program goals should clearly reflect stakeholder needs and concerns  based on input from stakeholders and stakeholder review and approval.  Program goals should align with strategic IT objectives. Software-related  goals should be defined and clearly aligned with program goals. The  agency should collect objective measures that are well defined to track  progress towards achieving software goals so the agency knows which  features and capabilities have been achieved.", "The Requirements Engineering User\u2019s Guide described program  expectations for tracing from mission needs to operating and functional  requirements, or user stories. The guide recognized that, as a program  progressed through the ALF and SELC, it was important to trace  requirements from the top-level mission needs or capabilities and/or  business requirements down to the system/sub-system, component, or  configuration item level that enabled those requirements to be met. This  helped ensure continuity across various DHS artifacts, such as the  program\u2019s mission need statement, concept of operations, and  operational requirements document, to vendor specifications (or  applicable equivalent artifacts). Although an Agile program will modify the  SELC to accommodate its needs, generally programs were expected to  follow the same conceptual approach to the requirements of planning,  development, and management.", "The user\u2019s guide stated that collaboration among the various  stakeholders was important and the program requirements team must  continuously work to establish partnerships and networks. To do so, the  guide stated that the program team must identify all individuals and  organizations that may be impacted by their program and ensure those  stakeholders were engaged throughout development to facilitate  understanding of their perspectives and needs. The first step was to  identify applicable stakeholders, which would include end users, program  sponsors, developers, maintainers, trainers, and other affected individuals  or organizations. The program requirements team then solicited input  from these stakeholders to understand their needs, policies, processes,  and operations to begin the requirements definition effort. It identified  some ways a team might begin the process of eliciting requirements from  the stakeholders.", "After collaborating with stakeholders, the stakeholder needs must be  translated into the program requirements, or goals. The guide stated that  the program requirements team should take the inputs from the various  stakeholders and decompose, prioritize, de-conflict, and validate the  needs identified. It clarified that a \u201cgood\u201d requirement was achievable,  testable, clear, concise, technology-independent, feasible, and able to  stand alone.", "The guide grounded all of the requirements elicitation and development  process in the overall contribution to the agency mission, recognizing the  need for general strategic alignment. In particular, the guide noted that  requirements were \u201cmission need\u201d driven as opposed to \u201csolution\u201d driven.  Requirements were developed throughout the life of a program, with the  first formal requirements being the operating requirements documented in  the operational requirements document.", "To ensure that DHS\u2019s mission or strategic goals were key inputs for  decision making, DHS relied, in part, on its enterprise architecture  process. DHS policy for enterprise architecture stated that the enterprise  architecture program provided a vehicle to tie the strategic mission goals  and objectives of DHS to the business processes, information resources,  and technology investments necessary to reach key performance  outcomes. This methodology was intended to integrate IT into the mission  and strategic priorities of DHS, which provided the core foundation for all  subsequent processes. DHS capital planning and investment control  guidance reinforced this fact, stating that the Federal Acquisition  Streamlining Act of 1994 required capital investments to align with  mission and strategic goals.

The final approved software  would then be deployed to the production environment.", "CBP officials noted that the BEE program primarily used Jenkins to  integrate code for both continuous builds and deployment. The Air Exit  systems design document also mentioned the role of Jenkins in  continuous integration and continuous deployment for the project.", "The Traveler Verification Services team incorporated JaCoCo and  FindBugs automated tests as part of the continuous delivery process and  they were run automatically when the code was checked in. Moreover,  the project\u2019s system design document noted that the Traveler Verification  Services team integrated JaCoCo with the Eclipse Integrated  Development Environment as a code coverage inspection tool for unit  testing. Officials also noted that Selenium was used for automating the  testing within the technical environment.", "Ensure the quality of the code being developed  The agency should have policy or guidance for an Agile project on  ensuring the quality of code being developed. This guidance should be  supplemented by defining expectations for code quality and tracking and  monitoring against these expectations. Agile teams should adopt  practices for code quality, such as having a test-driven development, pair  programming, and manual code reviews to supplement automated  testing. Agile teams should incorporate refactoring into code quality  practices and understand the importance of setting aside time for  refactoring.", "DHS guidance recognizes the importance of ensuring code quality as part  of the development and testing process. The SELC Guidebook set an  expectation that code review and testing should be part of the software  development environment. The guide recommended setting up servers  where developers could test code and check whether the developed  application runs successfully with that code. The guide suggested another  level of tests on application reliability to help ensure that the application  did not fail on the production server. The guide stated that the program  manager should ensure that the team takes corrective action for any  hardware and software deficiencies.", "In order to find deficiencies early, DHS guidance identified coding and  testing practices that could help development teams. The Agile instruction  manual cited pair programming as one practice where two programmers  work simultaneously on a single task: one programmer observes and  reviews each line of code as it is written. DHS guidance also identified  test-driven development as a practice that could motivate developers to  write effective code. The Supplemental Guidance for Test and Evaluation  stated that this approach consists of writing test cases that define a  desired improvement, then writing the code to meet the desired  functionality, ensuring that the test passes, and refactoring the code as  necessary.", "Refactoring, or re-coding, without changing the way the application  functions, is an Agile practice that DHS guidance recommends for  correcting deficiencies in the code. The Agile instruction manual stated  that refactoring aims to improve code readability and reduce the  complexity of previously delivered increments of software. It noted that refactoring is important because development teams are focused on  adding the desired functionality with each release and may proceed with  making improvements to the code. Refactoring was cited as one way to  address this accumulation of needed improvements to the code, which  are known as technical debt.", "The Agile instruction manual further emphasizes the importance of setting  aside time for refactoring to address risks associated with technical debt.  The manual states that refactoring a previously developed increment of  software to improve code quality may force a change in the release  schedule. However, if the team does not make these revisions in a timely  manner, the effort required to correct them later tends to increase. The  manual states that this increasing technical debt is a risk factor to be  addressed as soon as feasible. If the technical debt is allowed to  accumulate unchecked, or if the project team loses track of the scope of  its technical debt, the project could suffer from schedule and performance  problems.", "In order to track and monitor the quality of code being developed, the  department incorporated several code quality and testing measures into  the Agile core metrics. Among others, programs executing Agile were  expected to report on the following quality-related metrics after each  iteration:", "Number of critical or major defects fixed.", "Number of critical or major defects in the backlog.", "Number of technical debt issues completed.", "Number of technical debt issues in the backlog.", "However, the department was not tracking and monitoring code quality as  intended. These measures could provide programs and the department  with an understanding of the development team\u2019s ability to address  defects and technical debt. In addition to these metrics, programs are  also expected to report quarterly on the number of outages requiring a  rollback or patch after production deployment.", "The ICE SEVIS program used manual testing to ensure code quality. The  definition of done for the program stated that new code should be peer  reviewed to identify risk to the existing code, assess compliance with  coding best practices, and evaluate refactoring. According to ICE SEVIS  officials, an independent specialist provides internal code reviews and  offers feedback on areas for improvement.", "The ICE SEVIS program also employed automated testing to ensure  code quality. The definition of done required that unit tests cover a  minimum of 85 percent of code. Program officials stated that  vulnerabilities and bugs identified through this process were added to the  backlog and classified as technical debt.", "The program refactored code to address technical debt, but did not set  aside time for refactoring each sprint. According to ICE SEVIS officials,  the development team refactored code as necessary to improve overall  quality but did not set aside time for refactoring unless they were  addressing a consistent issue. ICE SEVIS officials stated that the  development team could propose refactoring code during sprint planning  if there was a specific technical debt they had identified. However,  according to the Scrum master for the program, addressing technical debt  was additional work for the team to take on beyond the user stories they  planned to complete and this additional work incentivized the  development team to prevent the accumulation of technical debt.", "Although DHS allowed Agile programs to tailor the core metrics, ICE  SEVIS submitted some of the code quality-related Agile metrics to the  department. The program included Agile metrics in June 2018  presentation slides for the Acquisition Review Board. For this initial  reporting period, the program reported no critical or major defects in the  backlog and no technical debt issues in the backlog. It also provided a  screenshot of the Agile core metrics reported to DHS via the Investment,  Evaluation, Submission, & Tracking system in February 2019. This  reporting period covered two iterations. The program reported that it fixed  four critical or major defects during the first iteration and did not have any  critical or major defects in the backlog for either iteration. The program  also reported that it completed eight technical debt issues in the first  iteration, out of 14 technical debt issues in the backlog. The program did  not report on the number of outages after deployment as part of the  Acquisition Review Board program review or as part of the metrics  submitted via the Investment Evaluation, Submission, and Tracking  system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff made key  contributions to this report: Michael Holland (assistant director), Mathew  Bader (analyst in charge), Lamis Alabed, Jennifer Beddor, Christina  Bixby, Hannah Brookhart, Chris Businsky, Alan Daigle, Aryn Ehlow,  Nancy Glover, Gina Hoover, Anna Irvine, Hoyt Lacy, Jennifer Leotta,  Alexis Olson, Zsaroq Powe, Martin Skorczynski, Natalie Smith, and  Daniel Spence."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Many of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s IT acquisitions have taken longer than planned or failed to deliver desired results.", "In April 2016, DHS started transitioning to Agile software development to help improve its IT acquisitions.
