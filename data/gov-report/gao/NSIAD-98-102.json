The spacecraft is expected to arrive at Saturn in July 2004 and begin a 4-year period of scientific observations to obtain detailed information about the composition and behavior of Saturn and its atmosphere, magnetic field, rings, and moons. Power for the Cassini spacecraft is generated by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) that convert heat from the natural radioactive decay of plutonium dioxide into electricity. The spacecraft also uses 117 radioisotope heater units to provide heat for spacecraft components. The spacecraft carries 72 pounds of radioactive plutonium dioxide in the RTGs and 0.7 pounds in the heater units. The Department of Energy (DOE) provided the RTGs and their plutonium dioxide fuel, and the Department of Defense (DOD) provided the Titan IV/Centaur rocket to launch the spacecraft.", "According to NASA and JPL officials, most deep space missions beyond Mars, including the Cassini mission, must use RTGs to generate electrical power. The only proven non-nuclear source of electrical power for spacecraft are photovoltaic cells, also called solar arrays. However, as distance from the sun increases, the energy available from sunlight decreases exponentially. Thus, existing solar arrays cannot produce sufficient electricity beyond Mars\u2019 orbit to operate most spacecraft and their payloads.", "Before launching a spacecraft carrying radioactive materials, regulations implementing federal environmental laws require the sponsoring agency, in this instance NASA, to assess and mitigate the potential risks and effects of an accidental release of radioactive materials during the mission. As part of any such assessments, participating agencies perform safety analyses in accordance with administrative procedures. To obtain the necessary presidential approval to launch space missions carrying large amounts of radioactive material, such as Cassini, NASA is also required to convene an interagency review of the nuclear safety risks posed by the mission.", "RTGs have been used on 25 space missions, including Cassini, according to NASA and JPL officials.

Also, federal regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 required NASA to assess the environmental and public health impacts of potential accidents during the Cassini mission that could cause plutonium dioxide to be released from the spacecraft\u2019s RTGs or heater units.  In addition, a directive issued by the Executive Office of the President requires an ad hoc interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel. This panel is supported by technical experts from NASA, other federal agencies, national laboratories, and academia to review the nuclear safety analyses prepared for the Cassini mission.

Under an interagency agreement with NASA, DOE constructed the RTGs for the Cassini spacecraft and assessed the mission risks as required by a DOE administrative order.

According to NASA and DOE officials, the shielding will enable the fuel cells to survive likely types of launch or orbital reentry accidents and prevent or minimize the release of plutonium dioxide fuel. In addition to the shielding, the plutonium dioxide fuel itself is formed into ceramic pellets designed to resist reentry heat and breakage caused by an impact.

To verify the estimated probability of an Earth swingby accident, NASA formed a panel of independent experts, which reported that the probability estimates were sound and reasonable.", "If such an accident were to occur, the estimated health effect is that, during the succeeding 50-year period, 120 more people would die of cancer than if there were no accident. If the spacecraft were to become unable to respond to guidance commands during its interplanetary journey, the spacecraft would drift in an orbit around the sun, from which it could reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere in the future. However, the probability that this accident would occur and release plutonium dioxide is estimated to be one in five million. The estimated health effect of this accident is the same as for an Earth swingby accident.", "Due to the spacecraft\u2019s high speed, NASA and DOE projected that an accidental reentry during the Earth swingby maneuver would generate temperatures high enough to damage the RTGs and release some plutonium dioxide. As a safety measure, JPL designed the Earth swingby trajectory so that the spacecraft will miss Earth by a wide margin unless the spacecraft\u2019s course is accidently altered. About 50 days before the swingby, Cassini mission controllers will begin making incremental changes to the spacecraft\u2019s course, guiding it by Earth at a distance of 718.6 miles.

The studies also noted that, even if the large arrays could have been launched to Saturn on the Cassini spacecraft, they would have made the spacecraft very difficult to maneuver and increased the mission\u2019s risk of failure due to the array\u2019s uncertain reliability over the length of the 12-year mission.

The fiscal year 1998 budget of $10 million for solar array systems exceeds the estimated 30-year average annual funding level of $6 million (not adjusted for inflation).", "According to NASA and JPL officials, solar arrays offer the most promise for future non-nuclear-powered space missions. Two improvements to solar array systems that are currently being developed could extend the range of some solar array-powered spacecraft and science operations beyond the orbit of Mars. New types of solar cells and arrays under development will more efficiently convert sunlight into electricity. Current cells operate at 18 to 19 percent efficiency, and the most advanced cells under development are intended to achieve 22 to possibly 30 percent efficiency. Although the improvement in conversion efficiency will be relatively small, it could enable some spacecraft to use solar arrays to operate as far out as Jupiter\u2019s orbit. Another improvement to solar arrays under development will add lenses or reflective surfaces to capture and concentrate more sunlight onto the arrays, enabling them to generate more electricity. NASA\u2019s technology demonstration Deep Space-1 spacecraft, scheduled for launch in July 1998, will include this new technology.", "Over the long term, limitations inherent to solar array technology will preclude its use on many deep space missions. The primary limitation is the diminishing energy in sunlight as distance from the sun increases. No future solar arrays are expected to produce enough electricity to operate a spacecraft farther than Jupiter\u2019s orbit. Another key limitation is that solar arrays cannot be used for missions requiring operations in extended periods of darkness, such as those on or under the surface of a planet or moon. Other limitations of solar arrays, including their vulnerability to damage from radiation and temperature extremes, make the cells unsuitable for missions that encounter such conditions.", "NASA and DOE are working on new nuclear-fueled generators for use on future space missions. NASA and DOE\u2019s Advanced Radioisotope Power Source Program is intended to replace RTGs with an advanced nuclear-fueled generator that will more efficiently convert heat into electricity and require less plutonium dioxide fuel than existing RTGs.

On the basis of historical experience, NASA and DOE officials said that about one-half of such missions typically obtain funding and are launched. In addition, several planned Mars missions would carry from 5 to 30 radioisotope heater units to keep spacecraft components warm. Each heater unit would contain about 0.1 ounces of plutonium dioxide.", "In accordance with NASA\u2019s current operating philosophy, spacecraft for future space science missions will be much smaller than those used on current deep space missions. Future spacecraft with more efficient electrical systems and reduced demands for electrical power, when coupled with the advanced nuclear-fueled generators, will require significantly less plutonium dioxide fuel. For example, the new nuclear-fueled generator that NASA studied for use on the Pluto Express spacecraft is projected to need less than 10 pounds of plutonium dioxide compared with 72 pounds on the Cassini spacecraft. According to NASA and DOE officials, spacecraft carrying much smaller amounts of radioactive fuel will reduce human health risks because it is anticipated that less plutonium dioxide could potentially be released in the event of an accident.", "NASA and JPL officials also pointed out that planned future missions may not need to use Earth swingby trajectories.
