Three categories of factors contribute to crashes: human factors, roadway environment factors, and vehicle factors. Human factors involve the actions taken by or the condition of the driver of the automobile, including speeding and violating traffic laws, as well as being affected by alcohol or drugs, inattention, decision errors, and age. Roadway environment factors include the design of the roadway, roadside hazards, and roadway conditions. Vehicle factors include any failures that may exist in the automobile or design of the vehicle. Human factors are seen as the most prevalent, according to data, experts, and studies, in contributing to crashes, followed by roadway environment and vehicle factors. Agencies within the Department of Transportation have research projects underway or planned that address the factors that contribute to crashes. For example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are conducting a study on the causes and contributing factors to large truck crashes. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is conducting a 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study and the Drive Atlanta Study. The 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study involves collecting data from vehicles equipped with sensors and cameras to obtain better information on crashes and near misses. The Drive Atlanta Study involves collecting data from 1,100 vehicles equipped with data recorders to develop information about how excessive speed contributes to crashes. In addition, the Transportation Research Board has proposed a broad, 6-year, $180 million research program focused on making significant improvements in highway safety. This study, among other things, would involve installing sensors and other data collection devices on over 5,000 vehicles."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 6.3 million motor vehicle crashes occurred in the United States in  2001, or one crash every 5 seconds.

From 1975 through 2001, annual fatalities decreased from  44,525 to 42,116, or about 5 percent. During the same period, the fatality  rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, a common method of  measurement, dropped from 3.35 to 1.51, or about 55 percent. This  reduction in fatalities was considerable, given the growth in the number of  drivers and vehicles on the road. For example, from 1975 through 2001,  licensed drivers increased from about 130 million to about 191 million, and  the number of registered vehicles increased from about 126 million to  about 221 million. Figure 1 shows the yearly number of fatalities and the  rate of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Injury and property- damage-only crashes also fell, going from about 6.8 million in 1988, the  earliest year of available data, to about 6.3 million in 2001.", "The fatal, injury, and property-damage-only crashes have significant  economic cost. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) recently calculated the economic costs for motor vehicle crashes  in 2000 at more than $230 billion, or the equivalent of over $800 for every  person living in the United States. NHTSA\u2019s estimate of economic costs  includes productivity losses, property damage, medical costs,  rehabilitation costs, travel delay, legal and court costs, emergency  services, insurance administration costs, and costs to employers.", "One of the most significant studies to date on the factors that contribute to  motor vehicle crashes was the Tri-Level Study of the Causes of Traffic  Accidents, conducted in the 1970s by the Indiana University at  Bloomington Institute for Research in Public Safety. Referred to as the Tri- Level study, it investigated how frequently various factors contributed to  traffic crashes. According to NHTSA officials, the Tri-Level study has been  the only study in the past 30 years to collect large amounts of on-scene  crash causation data. To provide researchers with insight into the factors  that contribute to traffic crashes, collision data were collected on three  levels, each providing an increasing level of detail, including 13,568 police- reported crashes; 2,258 crashes investigated by on-scene technicians; and  420 crashes investigated in depth by a multidisciplinary team. The study  assessed causal factors as either definite, probable, or possible. The study  found that crashes were caused by human (or driver-based) factors,  environmental (roadway or weather-related) factors, or vehicle-related  factors. As shown in figure 2, the study concluded that the human factors  were definite or probable causes in about 93 percent of crashes, while  environmental and vehicle factors contributed to about 33 and 13 percent,  respectively. See appendix II for a more detailed discussion of the Tri- Level study.", "NHTSA\u2019s mission is to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses  resulting from motor vehicle crashes. As part of this responsibility, NHTSA  conducts or sponsors research into the causes of motor vehicle crashes.  NHTSA also conducts research on driver behavior and traffic safety to  develop more efficient and effective means to improve safety. Three  principal databases provide information about traffic crashes: the Fatality  Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the Crashworthiness Data System  (CDS), and the General Estimates System (GES). The FARS database  contains information provided by the states on all vehicle crashes that  result in the death of an occupant or nonmotorist within 30 days of the   incident. The CDS database contains information from a detailed sample  of about 4,000 minor, serious, or fatal tow-away crashes, annually. To  obtain this information, teams of trained crash investigators visit the crash  site and collect data on such elements as the damage to the vehicle and  interior locations struck by the occupants. The GES database contains  information from a nationally representative sample of police accident  reports. This is NHTSA\u2019s largest crash database, with information  collected on over 50,000 crashes each year.", "The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA) safety mission is to reduce  highway fatalities and injuries through development and implementation  of a program of nationally coordinated research and technology  innovations. Research is conducted in areas that address FHWA\u2019s highway  safety goals related to roadway departure, intersections, and pedestrians.  FHWA is also conducting research in a number of areas that will partially  focus on crash causation, including rollovers, speed management,  intersection safety, and pedestrian and bicyclist safety. FHWA annually  produces a highway statistics report, which consists of data on motor fuel,  motor vehicles, driver licensing, highway-user taxing, state and local  government highway finance, highway mileage, and federal aid for  highways. FHWA also maintains a database, called the Highway Safety  Information System. The system uses data on crash, roadway, and traffic  variables collected by eight states to analyze a number of highway safety  problems. These analyses range from identifying basic problems, to  identifying the size and extent of a safety issue, to modeling efforts that  attempt to predict future crashes from roadway characteristics and traffic  factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human, Roadway Environment, and Vehicle Factors Contribute to Motor Vehicle Crashes", "paragraphs": ["Motor vehicle crashes are complex events that rarely have a single cause.  For example, it would be challenging to identify a single cause of a crash  that occurred on a narrow, curvy, icy road when an inexperienced driver,  who had been drinking, adjusted the radio or talked on a cell phone. It  would likely be the combined effect of a number of these factors that  contributed to the crash.", "In examining the causes of motor vehicle crashes, a number of experts and  studies identified three categories of factors that contribute to crashes\u2014 human, roadway environment, and vehicle factors. Human factors involve  the actions taken by or the condition of the driver of the automobile,  including speeding and other traffic violations, as well as the effects of  alcohol or drugs, inattention, decision errors, and age. Roadway  environment factors that contribute to or are associated with crashes  include the design of the roadway (for example, medians, lane width,  shoulders, curves, access points, or intersections); roadside hazards (for  example, poles, trees, or embankments adjacent to the road); and the  roadway conditions (for example, rain, ice, snow, or fog). Vehicle factors  include vehicle-related failures and vehicle design issues that contribute to  a crash. In general, human factors are considered to be the most prevalent  factor contributing to crashes, followed by roadway environment and  vehicle factors.

Speeding reduces a  driver\u2019s ability to steer safely around curves or objects in the roadway,  extends the distance necessary to stop a vehicle, and increases the  distance a vehicle travels while the driver reacts to a dangerous situation.", "According to our analysis of NHTSA\u2019s databases, from 1997 through 2001,  speeding was identified as a contributing factor in about 15 percent of all  crashes and about 30 percent of all fatal crashes. In addition, almost 64,000  lives were lost in speeding-related crashes. As shown in figure 3, we found  that for every age category of drivers involved in fatal crashes, males were  more likely than females to be involved in a fatal speed-related crash. In  addition, younger drivers, regardless of sex, are the most likely to be  involved in a speed-related fatality. From 1997 through 2001, 36 percent of  male drivers and 24 percent of female drivers 16 to 20 years old who were  involved in fatal crashes were speeding at the time of the crash. The  percentage of speeding-related fatal crashes decreases with increasing  driver age.", "A 1998 study by NHTSA and FHWA indicates that fatal crashes increased  in states that raised speed limits. When Congress enacted the National  Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-59), which repealed the  national maximum speed limit, the Secretary of Transportation was  required to study the impact of states\u2019 actions to raise speed limits above   55 and 65 miles per hour. The study found that states with increased speed  limits in 1996 experienced approximately 350 more Interstate fatalities  than would have been expected based on historical trends\u2014about 9  percent above expectations. Concurrently, the Interstate fatalities  experienced in states that did not increase speed limits in 1996 were  consistent with pre-1996 trends. The Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety also assessed the effects of speed limit increases. Its researchers  found an increase in fatalities for a 9-month period in 1996 on Interstate  highways and freeways, as compared with the previous 6 years\u2014about 16  percent in 12 of the states that had raised maximum speed limits to at least  70 miles per hour by March 1996. In contrast, occupant fatalities increased  only 4 percent on Interstate highways and freeways in the comparison  group of states that did not raise speed limits. However, both of these  studies are limited because they cover short time periods.", "According to a Transportation Research Board official, studies have  confirmed a direct relationship between speed and crash severity. Once a  crash has occurred\u2014that is, a vehicle has hit another vehicle or a  stationary object\u2014the vehicle undergoes a rapid change in speed. While  the vehicle decelerates rapidly, its occupants continue to move at the  vehicle\u2019s speed prior to impact until they are stopped by striking the  interior of the vehicle, by impact with objects external to the vehicle if  ejected, or by being restrained by a safety belt or an airbag that deploys.", "According to the FHWA Director of the Office of Safety Programs, while  absolute speed clearly relates to injury and fatality outcomes, speeding is  the real issue. The Director pointed out that despite their lower volumes,  almost half of all speeding-related fatalities occur on local or collector  roads\u2014low-speed roads found in residential and business areas. In  addition, the Director said that speed variance is also a factor. When  vehicles driving down a particular roadway are traveling at very different  speeds, the probability of a crash increases. The relative crash- involvement rate increases for vehicles that are traveling above or below  the average speed of traffic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traffic Control Violations", "paragraphs": ["Drivers who fail to follow prescribed traffic control laws also contribute to  crashes. This includes running red lights or failing to stop at stop signs.

Of  those crashes, 59 percent occurred at traffic lights while an additional 28  percent occurred at stop signs.", "A study performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the  Preusser Research Group identified characteristics of red light\u2013running  crashes and the drivers involved. It found that drivers\u2019 noncompliance  with traffic control devices, such as traffic signals and stop signs, is a  major cause of motor vehicle crashes. The study examined the prevalence  of red light\u2013running crashes on a national basis to identify the  characteristics of such crashes and the drivers involved. The study  estimated that almost 260,000 red light-running crashes occurred in 1996,  of which 809 resulted in fatalities. It also found that, as a group, red light  runners involved in crashes were more likely than other drivers to be  younger than age 30, to be male, to have prior moving violations and  convictions for driving while intoxicated, to have invalid driver\u2019s licenses,  and to be reported by police as having consumed alcohol prior to the  crash.", "According to an official from Northwestern University, red light\u2013running  might also partly reflect driver frustration with poor traffic operations. For  example, a driver might feel the need to speed through a red light because  of previous experience of being held at that light too long, or of being  subjected to a series of unsynchronized stop lights. A 1999 study funded by  DaimlerChrysler Corporation surveyed over 5,000 people regarding their  behavior at red lights. The study found that those respondents who  reported speeding up to beat a red light would most often do so because  they were in a rush and wanted to save time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alcohol and Other Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Alcohol and other drugs are contributing factors in many motor vehicle  crashes. It is illegal in every state and the District of Columbia to drive a  motor vehicle while under the influence of, impaired by, or with a specific  blood content of alcohol or drugs. In addition, all states but Massachusetts  have blood alcohol laws that make it illegal to drive with a specified level  of alcohol in their blood. As of January 2003, 17 states had set the  standard at .10 percent blood alcohol content (BAC)\u2014the level at which a  person\u2019s blood contains 1/10 of 1 percent alcohol. The remaining states  have more stringent laws, setting the limit at .08 percent BAC. According  to NHTSA, on average, a 170-pound man reaches .08 percent BAC after  consuming five 12-ounce beers (4.5 percent alcohol by volume) over a 2- hour period. A 120-pound woman reaches the same level after consuming  three beers over the same period.", "In analyzing NHTSA\u2019s databases, we found that from 1997 through 2001,  there were about 76,000 alcohol-related fatal crashes (41 percent of all  fatal crashes), 980,000 alcohol-related injury crashes (10 percent of all  injury crashes), and 2.3 million alcohol-related crashes (7 percent of all  crashes). During this 5-year period, nearly 85,000 people died in alcohol- related crashes. Eighty-six percent of these fatalities occurred in crashes  where the highest recorded BAC was .08 percent or above, while 14  percent occurred in crashes where the highest recorded BAC was between  .01 percent and .07 percent. In addition, we found that male drivers were  more likely to be involved in alcohol-related fatal crashes than female  drivers. Figure 4 shows that, for each age category, there were a greater  number of male than female drivers in fatal crashes that involved alcohol.", "While research has shown that everyone\u2019s driving is impaired at blood  alcohol levels of .10 percent and higher, recent research has shown that  lower levels of alcohol also affect performance. In a study by the Southern  California Research Institute, 168 test subjects were tested at zero BAC;  then at the highest BAC for their drinking classification of either light,  moderate, or heavy drinker; and then at .02 percent BAC intervals, as their  alcohol levels decreased. For this study, the researchers defined  impairment by comparing the subjects\u2019 performance on a given test while  under the influence of alcohol versus their performance on the same test  after being given a placebo. According to the resulting report, alcohol  impaired the driving-related skills for these volunteers at .02 percent BAC,   the lowest tested alcohol level. The magnitude of impairment increased  consistently at BACs through .10 percent, the highest level tested.  According to a Southern California Research Institute official, this study is  significant because it provided important, previously unknown findings  that certain driving-related skills are impaired at any departure from zero  BAC.", "A recent study by Westat examined the relative risk of fatal crash  involvement as a function of the BAC of fatally injured or surviving  drivers. By combining crash data from FARS with exposure data from the  1996 National Roadside Survey, the researchers determined that, in  general, the relative risk of involvement in a fatal passenger vehicle crash  increased steadily with increased driver\u2019s BAC. For example, the study  found that a .02 percent BAC increase among 16-through-20-year-old male  drivers was estimated to more than double the relative risk of a fatal  single-vehicle crash injury. The study also found that among drivers aged  21 through 34, those with a BAC of .03 percent have twice the risk of  fatalities as compared with drivers with zero BAC. Furthermore, among  drivers aged 21 through 34, those with a BAC of .10 percent have over 10  times the risk of a fatality compared with drivers with zero BAC.", "All states restrict driving while under the influence of, being impaired by,  or being incapable of safely driving because of illegal drugs or prohibited  substances in the driver\u2019s body.

For  example, a study by Maastricht University, the Netherlands, indicated that  the combined use of marijuana and alcohol impairs driving performance.  For a small number of subjects who were somewhat frequent users of  marijuana, the study found that either marijuana doses alone or alcohol  alone impaired the subjects\u2019 test-driving performances. However, subjects  who used marijuana in combination with alcohol demonstrated  impairment in several aspects of driving performance. Another study by  Maastricht University also found the combined use of marijuana and  alcohol to produce similar effects on a small, limited group of subjects.  The study showed that under the influence of low doses of either  marijuana or alcohol, the drivers were less able to detect peripheral traffic  and instead focused on the central driving task."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Driver Inattention", "paragraphs": ["Driver inattention occurs when there is a delay in recognition of  information needed to safely accomplish the driving task. Two categories  of driver inattention are distraction and drowsiness. Drivers may become  distracted when they direct their attention elsewhere because of some  occurrence inside or outside of the vehicle. NHTSA defines four categories  of distraction: visual distraction (for example, looking away from the  roadway), auditory distraction (for example, responding to a noise, such  as a ringing cell phone), biomechanical distraction (for example, manually  adjusting the radio volume), and cognitive distraction (for example, being  lost in thought). Many distracting activities that drivers engage in can  involve more than one of these components. Driver drowsiness is also a  type of driver inattention, in that a tired or fatigued driver may exhibit  behaviors typically associated with inattentive drivers.", "Our analysis of 1997 through 2001 data from NHTSA found that, overall,  about 2.5 million drivers of passenger vehicles that were towed away from  crashes were identified as inattentive. Of these, about 1.3 million were  distracted, about 871,000 \u201clooked but did not see\u201d (an aspect of being  inattentive), and about 348,000 were sleepy or asleep. In addition, about  7.6 million drivers were identified as \u201cattentive\u201d at the time of the crash.  We also conducted a more detailed analysis of inattentive drivers. As  figure 5 shows, overall, more drivers between ages 16 and 44 were  involved in inattentive-type crashes than drivers aged 45 and above. More  drivers aged 16 to 20 were inattentive than any other age group.", "We also analyzed NHTSA\u2019s databases to determine specific sources of  distraction. We found that some outside person, object, or event was  identified as contributing to 27 percent of the distractions. Other common  sources of distractions included another occupant in the vehicle, followed  by adjusting a radio, cassette, or CD.", "A recent study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety analyzed 1995  through 1999 NHTSA crash data on driver attention status and sources of  distraction and found that 8 percent of drivers were identified as  distracted, 5 percent as \u201clooked but did not see,\u201d and 2 percent as sleepy  or asleep, while 49 percent of the drivers were identified as attentive at the  time of the crash. The remaining 36 percent were either unknown or had  no driver present. Without the unknowns, the percentage of drivers  identified as distracted increases to 13 percent. The study also identified  specific sources of distraction. Some external person, object, or event  caused almost 30 percent of such distractions.", "Drowsiness and fatigue are also aspects of inattention and can contribute  to crashes. Drowsiness is a basic physiological state, brought about by the  restriction or interruption of sleep. It also results from natural changes in  the body\u2019s level of alertness during each 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.  According to the National Sleep Foundation, our internal body clocks  program us to be sleepy twice a day: first during the early morning hours  between midnight and dawn, and again between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.  For the driver, the main effect of drowsiness or fatigue is a progressive  withdrawal of attention from the road and traffic demands, leading to  impaired performance behind the wheel. Drivers can become so fatigued  that they are slow to perceive risky situations and are unable to respond  quickly enough to avoid a crash. Fatigue can also arise because of  medication or illness.", "According to an official from the National Sleep Foundation, studies have  shown that sleep-deprived individuals are less likely to be able to  concentrate on the task at hand. In addition, as people get tired they  engage in behaviors that lead to other distractions, such as smoking,  drinking or eating, turning up the radio, or employing other \u201ctricks\u201d to try  to stay awake. The official also told us that the foundation\u2019s national polls  and international studies support the perspective that driver fatigue is a  much larger problem than what the federal statistics show. Recently, the  National Sleep Foundation conducted a telephone survey and found that  about 51 percent of the respondents reported that they had driven a car or  another vehicle while feeling drowsy, and about 17 percent had dozed off  while driving within the past year. The study found that male respondents  were more likely than female respondents to say they had driven while  feeling drowsy.

A recent study by the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety showed that the age factor plays out in a more  risky driving style among adolescents. The study, which reviewed and  summarized other research on the risks associated with younger drivers,  found that increased crash risk comes immediately on licensure and drops  very rapidly in the first few months. Compared with older drivers, this  study concluded that young people are more likely to drive at excessive  speeds, follow too closely, violate traffic signs and signals, overtake other  vehicles in a risky manner, allow too little time to merge, and fail to yield  to pedestrians. Risky driving leads young people into hazardous situations,  and inexperience makes it more difficult to cope with such situations. The  researchers also found that driving at night is associated with an increased  risk of serious crashes for young drivers. The driving task is more difficult  for young drivers when it\u2019s dark, and the risky driving that involves  younger drivers, generally associated with recreational activities, is more  likely to occur at night. Fatigue and alcohol are also more likely to  contribute to younger drivers\u2019 crashes during nighttime hours. The study  also found that there is a heightened crash risk when teenage drivers have  passengers in their vehicles. The study found that this increased risk is  present only for teenage drivers, and it increases incrementally with each  additional passenger.", "Older drivers are also at increased risk, because the elderly have higher  rates of fatal crashes per vehicle mile traveled than all but the youngest  drivers. According to a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety, this is largely attributable to their increased fragility. In the study,  fragility started at age 60 to 64 and continued to rise with advancing age. In  addition, a recent study by Dr. Leonard Evans found that given similar  crash severity, older drivers are more likely to sustain fatal injuries than  younger drivers. The author suggested that if populations of 70-year-old  males and 20-year-old males were subjected to the identical mixes of blunt  trauma, the population of older males would sustain over two times more  fatalities. A similar comparison of female populations would yield almost  two times more fatalities for older females. In addition, a literature review  conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute  found that older drivers are more likely to suffer from medical disabilities  that could impair their driving, and they may use medications that could  affect their driving performance. The study also found that with  increasing age, most drivers experience some loss of visual perception and  decreased cognitive and psychomotor functions. For example, a 1988 AAA  Traffic Safety Foundation study tested a small group of volunteers and  found that older adults with less joint flexibility exhibited poorer driving  ability than those with wider ranges of motion.

In general, different  functional road systems are constructed for specific purposes. For  example, Interstate highways are intended for high mobility and therefore  have limited access points, while local roads are designed for increased  access, which can limit mobility. Design principles generally suggest that  as average daily traffic increases, additional design elements should be  adopted that increase safety, including wider lanes, paved shoulders, and  clear zones (areas free of roadside hazards next to the roadway).", "Based on FHWA\u2019s data, we found that fatal crashes were more frequent on  rural roads than on urban roads. In 2001, rural roads handled only about  40 percent of all vehicle miles traveled, yet more than 60 percent of all  fatalities occurred on these roads.

Reduced visibility can occur because of weather-related  events or the presence or absence of natural or artificial lighting.", "Surface conditions. Common road surface conditions that can create  slippery roads are rain, snow, and ice. Slippery road conditions lead to a  loss of friction between a vehicle\u2019s tires and the roadway.

The widely publicized tire separations are a  recent example of an equipment-related failure. Equipment-related failures  can be identified by the manufacturer or by NHTSA, and may result in a  recall. In 2002, NHTSA reported 413 recalls involving over 18 million  vehicles, over 1 million pieces of equipment, about 675,000 tires, and over  1 million child safety seats. NHTSA\u2019s Director of the Office of Defects  Investigations told us that its investigations have identified 143 fatalities  associated with recalls from 1990 through 2000.

In 2001, NHTSA conducted a study that found that 27  percent of passenger cars and 33 percent of light trucks were being driven  with one or more underinflated tires. To reduce this problem, Congress  passed the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and  Documentation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-414), which will require motor  vehicles to be equipped with a tire-pressure monitoring system to warn the  driver if a tire is significantly underinflated. In May 2002, NHTSA issued  part one of a two-part final rule requiring this system.

In  addition, NTSB found that the 15-passenger vans carrying 10 to 15  passengers rolled over in 96 of the 113 single-vehicle crashes (85 percent).  However, they also found that the vans rolled over only 28 percent of the  time, or 69 times out of the 244 single-vehicle crashes, when there were  fewer than 5 occupants in the van. Additional analysis showed that higher  speeds were also strongly correlated with a greater chance of rollovers.  NTSB recommended that 15-passenger vans be rated by NHTSA for  rollover propensity.

We used this database to  present overall information on traffic deaths as well as to provide an  understanding of crashes involving speed, alcohol, age, and vehicle design.  It should be noted that while fatality data is useful in understanding  crashes, other factors, in addition to those involved in causing the crash,  might have contributed to the fatality. This would include such factors as  whether safety belts or other occupant protection measures were used and  operated properly.", "General Estimates System (GES) \u2013 This database is created from a  nationally representative sample of police accident reports completed for  crashes. Other criteria necessary for inclusion in the database are that the  crash must involve at least one motor vehicle traveling on a traffic way,  and that the crash must result in property damage, injury, or death. This  database was created to identify traffic safety problem areas, provide a  basis for regulatory and consumer initiatives, and form the basis for cost  and benefit analyses of traffic safety initiatives. This is NHTSA\u2019s largest  crash database, with information collected on over 50,000 randomly  sampled police accident reports each year. We analyzed the GES data to  provide information on speed, traffic control violations, roadside hazards,  roadway conditions, and vehicle defects. In addition, for the analysis in  which we compared fatalities with other types of crashes (reduced  visibility, vehicle design, age), we combined FARS and GES data.", "Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) \u2013 This database contains  information from a detailed sample of about 4,000 minor, serious, and fatal  crashes annually. The criterion necessary for inclusion in the database is  that at least one passenger vehicle must be damaged severely enough to  require towing from the crash site. Teams of trained crash investigators  visit the crash site and collect data elements such as vehicle crash damage  and interior vehicle locations that the occupants struck. The investigators  also generally locate and interview crash victims and review medical  records to determine the types of crash-related injuries. A goal of this  database includes having the ability to examine the crashworthiness of  vehicles; that is, how vehicles perform in crashes with respect to  protecting their occupants. We used the CDS database to provide  information on crashes involving driver inattention.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, NHTSA officials said that the  FARS, GES, and CDS databases, although providing useful information,  rely on data from police accident reports or on data collected days or  weeks after the crash, making it difficult to obtain causation data.  Therefore, NHTSA relies on the Indiana Tri-Level study data, which is  almost a quarter of a century old. They noted that since the Tri-Level study  was completed, cars, drivers, highways, technology, and lifestyles in the  United States have changed dramatically. As previously discussed, NHTSA  has proposed to develop and conduct a nationally representative survey to  collect on-scene crash causation data\u2014the National Motor Vehicle Crash  Causation Survey. NHTSA officials indicated that these on-scene, real-time  data are needed to best understand crash causation.", "In addition to using these three databases, for some analyses we also  calculated frequency rates using vehicle miles traveled. We used vehicle  miles traveled data from two different sources\u2014the 2001 FHWA Highway  Statistics Series data and the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. For  example, we used FHWA\u2019s vehicle miles traveled data in examining crash  rates by road type. FHWA obtains its data on vehicle miles traveled by  counting the number and types of vehicles passing particular points  around the country. Because FHWA\u2019s statistics do not include data on age  or gender, we used vehicle miles traveled from the 2001 National  Household Travel Survey for some analyses. This survey of about 26,000  households in the United States was conducted from March 2001 through  May 2002. It provides data on personal travel behavior at the national level  to use as a benchmark for a variety of applications. Although the overall  response rate for sampled households was low (41 percent), there are few  other sources for information on U.S. travel patterns. We used the most  recent available data, preliminary release (version 1), to get estimates of  annual vehicle miles traveled for our tables on rates of driver involvement  and types of vehicles involved in crashes.", "We assessed the reliability of FARS, CDS, and GES by reviewing existing  information about the data and performing electronic tests of the data.  There are certain limitations associated with using these databases for our  analysis. For example, the source of the GES data is police accident  reports that are prepared at the scene of the crash. Although the GES has  procedures to ensure that data reflect information in the accident reports,  we did not verify the accuracy of the accident reports themselves. In  addition, since GES, CDS, and the National Household Travel Survey are  based on samples, any estimates derived from these databases are subject  to sampling errors. A sampling error indicates how closely the results of a  particular sample would be reproduced if a complete count of the  population were taken with the same measurement methods.

A severity-increasing factor was defined as a  factor that was neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of the  crash, but its removal from the crash sequence would have lessened the  speed of the initial impact. The causal assessment process for each crash  involved two major steps: first, identifying relevant deficiencies of drivers,  vehicles, and the driving environment that were present in the crash  sequence; and second, assessing the investigation team\u2019s certainty that the  crash would not have occurred had each deficiency been corrected to its  minimally acceptable state.", "In addition, data on Monroe County drivers, vehicles, roads, and crashes  were compared with available national data.
