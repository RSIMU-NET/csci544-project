CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government.", "Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government.", "Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope.", "FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected.", "FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk.", "GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts.

A stated goal  of the act was to provide a competitive environment for the U.S.  commercial space launch industry. The act also provided for, among  other things, government protection against some losses\u2014referred to as  indemnification\u2014while still minimizing the cost to taxpayers. All FAA- licensed commercial launches and reentries by U.S. companies, whether  unmanned or manned and from the United States or overseas, are  covered by federal indemnification for third-party damages that result  from the launch or reentry. According to agency officials, in 2016 FAA  issued five active licenses, which had an average third-party MPL of  about $51 million and ranged from $10 million to $99 million.", "The amount of insurance coverage that FAA requires launch companies  to purchase\u2014the MPL value\u2014is intended to reflect the greatest dollar  amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury  and property damage that can be reasonably expected to result from a  launch or reentry accident. FAA calculates separate MPL values for  potential damages to third parties and the federal government. For each  launch license that it issues, FAA determines MPL values for third parties  with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that  reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which  have no less than a 1 in 10 million chance of occurring. For damages to  the federal government, FAA determines MPL values with the intent of  estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be  expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1  in 100,000 chance of occurring. According to FAA, the agency defines  these probability thresholds to estimate the federal government\u2019s  exposure to losses above the MPL. Agency officials said that the current  probability thresholds are set such that losses are very unlikely to exceed  launch companies\u2019 private insurance and become potential costs for the  government under CSLCA.", "FAA\u2019s process for determining the MPL value for a launch or reentry  license generally includes three elements:  1.  Number of casualties. Estimating the number of third-party  casualties involves adding the number of direct and secondary  casualties that could result from a launch accident. Direct casualty  estimates include serious injuries and deaths. Secondary casualties  include those resulting from fires and collapsing buildings.  2.  Cost of casualties. FAA uses $3 million as an estimate of the  average loss per casualty, which is multiplied by the number of  estimated casualties.  3.  Property damage. FAA applies a predetermined factor\u2014which it  recently changed from 50 percent to 25 percent\u2014to the estimated  cost of casualties to derive estimated losses from property damage.", "The total MPL is equal to the estimated cost of casualties plus property  damage.", "FAA has revised two components of its MPL methodology since our 2012  report. For example, in April 2016, the agency adopted a new method for  estimating the number of casualties, known as the risk profile method.  This method uses different tools to simulate a range of possible scenarios  to create a distribution of potential casualty numbers and the simulated  probability of different levels of casualty numbers. The risk profile method  replaced FAA\u2019s \u201coverlay method,\u201d which was a method it had used since  the early 1990s which the agency said did not work well for launches of  small launch vehicles in remote areas, or for reentries.

Catastrophe modeling, unlike the  single-loss approach, generally estimates losses by using various  tools to simulate tens of thousands of scenarios to create a  distribution of potential losses and the simulated probability of  different levels of loss.", "Second, we reported that FAA had been using an outdated and likely  understated figure of $3 million to estimate the cost of a single  casualty\u2014including injury or death\u2014which Office of Commercial  Space Transportation officials said has not been updated since they  began using it in 1988.", "Third, we reported that the agency\u2019s approach of estimating potential  property damage by adding a flat 50 percent to the estimated casualty  damage could lead to estimates that were too high in some cases.", "Given these weaknesses, we recommended that FAA reassess its MPL  methodology, including assessing the reasonableness of the cost-of- casualty amount and other assumptions used. Because the agency took  actions to assess its MPL methodology, we closed the recommendation  as implemented.", "In March 2017 we reported that FAA had taken steps to address  weaknesses in two of these three areas. Specifically, we reported that  FAA\u2019s adoption of the risk profile method in April 2016 had improved its  estimates of the number of potential casualties associated with a  particular license launch. In addition, we reported that the agency had  revised the factor it uses to estimate losses from property damage in the  MPL calculation from 50 percent to 25 percent. This change has resulted  in property damage estimates that FAA officials believe are still  conservative but more realistic than previous estimates.", "However, in our March 2017 report we also determined that FAA had not  yet addressed weaknesses in the cost-of-casualty amount we had  previously identified; despite the conclusion by a contractor it had hired to  study the cost-of-casualty that it was too low. Agency officials told us that  they had not addressed this weakness because of other priorities. Given  the significance of the cost-of-casualty amount to the MPL calculations,  we recommended that FAA prioritize the development of a plan to  address the identified weakness in the cost-of-casualty amount, including  setting time frames for action, and update the amount based on current  information. In October 2017, FAA officials told us that they had not yet  updated the cost-of-casualty because they have continued to prioritize  completing other work with their limited resources, such as reviewing  launch applications and fulfilling other safety responsibilities. As a result,  our recommendation remains open.", "FAA officials told us that they have identified potential steps to update the  cost-of-casualty amount, including seeking public input on whether and  how to revise the amount, but that they do not expect to make a decision  on whether to make any changes to the cost-of-casualty amount until  June 30, 2018, at the earliest. FAA officials told us that in order to  prioritize the development of a plan to address the identified weakness in  the cost-of-casualty amount they will need to consult with both the  commercial space and insurance industries about the necessity and  implications of any potential increase in the cost-of-casualty amount.  Agency officials said that they plan to do such consultations through  COMSTAC. However, because COMSTAC was just reestablished in  June 2017 after not having been active since November 2016 and new  members had not been approved as of October 2017, the anticipated  decision date of June 2018 could be further delayed.", "As we reported in March 2017, an understated cost-of-casualty amount  can lead to an inaccurate loss calculation, which in turn understates the  amount of insurance a launch company must obtain. This could increase  the potential exposure to the federal government, as the insurance  amount would be less than the potential losses associated with the  launch activity and the property would be inadequately protected.  Because of this potential exposure, we maintain that addressing this  weakness is a priority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Does Not Have Guidance for When to Estimate Property Damage Separately from the Number of Casualties and Which Analytical Tool to Use", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, in our 2012 report we raised concerns about the first  element of FAA\u2019s MPL methodology, which is estimating the number of  potential casualties. FAA officials said that they have implemented two  tools for estimating the number of potential casualties, and that each tool  requires a different level of resources and is more appropriate for different  launch scenarios. The Range Risk Analysis Tool creates physics-based  simulations of possible accidents using launch vehicle data, such as  launch trajectory and types of failures, and assigns each simulated  accident a probability of occurrence based on the failure rates of the  different elements of the launch vehicle. According to agency officials, the  Range Risk Analysis Tool is a comprehensive, high-fidelity tool and is the  most appropriate tool for coastal launch sites, which are often located in  heavily populated areas, and is labor intensive. The Risk Estimator Sub- orbital and Orbital Launch Vehicle and Entry tool, which in contrast to the  Range Risk Analysis Tool, is a medium-fidelity tool that can be used for  low-risk launches, such as launch sites located in very sparsely populated  areas and reentry operations that do not need the use of a high-fidelity  tool. According to FAA, this tool significantly reduces the time required to  estimate the risk from launch and reentry vehicle operations.", "In our 2017 report, we also reiterated that there are cases where the third  element of FAA\u2019s methodology, deriving estimated property damage from  estimated casualties, could lead to misleading MPL calculations.  Specifically, in March 2017 we reported that estimating losses from  property damage as a percentage of losses from casualties could lead to  overestimates. For example, FAA\u2019s contractor found that, if a launch  accident affected a residential area, the agency\u2019s practice of estimating  property damage based on casualties would likely overstate property  damages because residential structures have relatively low values  compared to losses from casualties. We also reported in March 2017 that  in some accidents the number of casualties may be low but property  losses could still be very large, in which case FAA\u2019s estimating property  losses based on casualties would likely understate potential property  damage. For example, a launch vehicle could strike an unoccupied  structure that is very expensive, such as a neighboring launch complex.  Agency officials said that while deriving property losses from casualty  losses is a simpler method that may be an effective use of limited FAA  resources, it could be inappropriate in scenarios where the number of  casualties might be low but property losses could still be very large.", "In October 2017, agency officials said that FAA had not developed  guidance for determining, for a given launch license, which of the  available tools would be most appropriate to estimate the number of  potential casualties, and whether it would be more appropriate to estimate  property losses separately rather than derive them from estimated  casualties. While FAA officials said they believe their current decision  process is adequate and that they do not need more formal guidance at  this time, they also told us that they were in the process of developing  internal guidance on the most appropriate tool to use for future launches.  The officials said that they did not have a projected completion date for  the guidance, primarily because the agency has other priorities and  resource limitations. As noted earlier, these priorities include reviewing  commercial space launch license applications and managing program  safety.", "Federal internal control standards state that, as part of an entity\u2019s risk  assessment component, management should identify, analyze, and  respond to risks to achieving objectives. For example, the standards  state that management should design control activities in response to the  entity\u2019s objectives and risks to achieve an effective internal control  system.", "Without such guidance, FAA could face challenges in ensuring that it is  using the most appropriate method to calculate an MPL for a given launch  and is making the most efficient use of its resources. Such guidance  could become more important as the number of commercial space  launches increases, potentially creating greater demands on its  resources. We have previously reported that the commercial space  launch industry has experienced significant growth in the number and  complexity of launches in the past half-decade.

However, despite changes to the methodology, the  probability threshold that the agency uses to achieve this balance of risk  has been the same since the 1990s, and has not been reviewed for  appropriateness. In addition, while FAA evaluated the effect of its MPL  methodology on the indirect costs of launch companies and the federal  government, it did not similarly evaluate direct costs.
