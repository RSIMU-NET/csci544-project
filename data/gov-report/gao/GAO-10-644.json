Operating through a 5-year contract awarded by the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the WWC reviews education research and disseminates its findings. GAO examined: (1) the extent to which the WWC review process meets accepted standards for research evaluation and how the WWC has responded to recommendations and criticism, (2) how WWC output and costs have changed over time and how its performance is measured, and (3) how WWC products are disseminated and how useful educators find them to be. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed WWC-related documents, analyzed cost and performance data, surveyed all states and a nationally representative sample of school districts, and interviewed IES officials, WWC contractors, researchers, and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO as well as a congressionallymandated panel of experts, found that the WWC's review process, which includes screening studies to determine if they meet WWC criteria, follows accepted standards for evaluating research on the effectiveness of education interventions. WWC is responding to recommendations made by the expert panel to further improve its review and reporting processes. For example, the panel recommended improvements in the way the WWC presents information to readers on the reasons why studies do not qualify for review. The WWC is revising a report template to include a table summarizing which studies met or did not meet WWC criteria for evaluating research. The WWC has also responded to researchers who have criticized the WWC for presenting limited information because its screening criteria exclude some rigorous research designs that may be appropriate for evaluating certain education programs, such as special education. The WWC responded to this criticism by creating new standards that include two additional study designs and by creating a new product, called a practice guide, which includes a wider range of research. WWC's report output and scope increased under the current contract. For example, the WWC increased its production of various reports, introduced new products, and developed new processes for evaluating research. However, IES had a substantial backlog in its product review process from January 2009 to May 2010. The backlog generally decreased the timeliness of WWC reports, with 20 reports being delayed by up to 6 months. To support the increases in output and scope, WWC's costs doubled from the previous contract to the current one. Both contracts designated about 60 percent of costs to production, while the other 40 percent of costs support other tasks, such as communications, dissemination, and process development. IES' performance goals for the WWC primarily relate to the number of reports produced. However, IES has not developed performance measures related to the cost or usefulness of WWC products. Education uses WWC contractors, Regional Educational Laboratories (RELS) and the Doing What Works (DWW) Web site to disseminate information about WWC products; however, awareness and use of the WWC varies among states, districts, teachers, and principals. WWC contractors disseminate product information in various ways including email alerts and presentations. The RELs host events featuring WWC products for state, district, and school officials and DWW provides resources to educators based on WWC products. Based on our survey, officials from 33 of 38 state education agencies that responded to our survey and an estimated 42 percent of school districts have heard of the WWC. Those states and school districts generally used the WWC to a small or moderate extent to inform decisions on effective practices. Based on our survey, states and school districts reported that they would likely increase their use of the WWC if it included a broader array of information or more timely information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IES: develop and implement strategies to avoid backlogs in WWC product reviews; establish performance measures related to costs and usefulness; and improve dissemination efforts to promote awareness and use of the WWC.

We also  reviewed the Clearinghouse\u2019s response to the expert panel and to specific  criticisms in education research literature. To determine how performance  and costs changed over time (objective 2), we analyzed the costs and  productivity of the WWC contractors by reviewing budget, expenditure,  and performance data. For objective 3, we administered a Web-based  survey to state education agencies in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia and a nationally representative sample of school districts;  interviewed IES\u2019s 10 Regional Educational Laboratories; and gathered  nongeneralizeable information from teachers and principals at four  conferences.

In  developing the research review process, the contractors and IES  addressed over 60 technical issues, such as determining what constitutes  an acceptable level of participant loss (attrition) from a study and what  methods should be in place to accommodate common education research  techniques. In addition, initial plans for topic areas and reporting formats  were modified. For example, IES decided to drop one planned topic area  because IES officials determined it to be too broad. The WWC and IES  also spent a substantial amount of time developing and refining a reporting  format to communicate research results to a lay audience.

The WWC definition of interventions includes programs  (such as whole school reform), products (such as a textbook or  curriculum), practices (such as mixed-age grouping), or policies (such as  class size reduction). The process begins with an initial screening of  published and unpublished studies relevant to the intervention being  reviewed. Studies are collected from electronic databases, journals,  conference proceedings, and nominations solicited from the general  public. The studies that pass initial screens are reviewed to determine  whether they provide valid evidence of an intervention\u2019s effectiveness.  Using these studies, the WWC then synthesizes the evidence about the  effectiveness of an intervention and publishes a report describing its  findings. The Clearinghouse categorizes interventions as either having  positive effects, potentially positive effects, mixed effects, no discernable  effects, potentially negative effects, or negative effects (see fig. 1).", "The WWC uses evidence standards to assess the strengths and weaknesses  of a study\u2019s methodology, such as the type of design it uses, the quality of  the study\u2019s data, and the appropriateness of the study\u2019s statistical  procedures. Until recently, the WWC accepted two types of study  designs\u2014randomized experiments and quasi-experimental studies.

For example, the panel agreed that the  minimum qualifications a study must meet in order to be reviewed by the  WWC are appropriate. The panel also found that WWC\u2019s reporting process  is reasonable and that the WWC provides succinct and relevant evidence  on the effectiveness of education interventions. While the panel concluded  that the WWC\u2019s processes are generally appropriate, the panel made  several recommendations to the WWC for continued improvement.

The WWC implemented nine recommendations, in  part by modifying some procedures and creating a procedures and  standards handbook. For example, in response to the panel\u2019s  recommendation that the WWC include a table of study dispositions (e.g.,  whether studies meet WWC evidence standards) at the front of  intervention reports, the WWC is modifying the report template to include  a summary table along with the existing listing of dispositions in the  reference section. The WWC also addressed panel concerns about  technical issues in its review process by making its treatment of study  attrition\u2014the rate at which subjects drop out of a study\u2014more consistent  across topic areas. The panel noted that the WWC\u2019s practice of  determining acceptable attrition levels by topic area led to arbitrary  inconsistencies across the topic areas. In response to the panel\u2019s  recommendation that the WWC reconsider this practice, the WWC took  steps to increase its consistency by developing attrition guidance that  applies to all topic areas.

As a result, according to critics,  educators may accept the WWC\u2019s rating of the intervention\u2019s effectiveness,  even though the evidence behind the rating is limited. One researcher  suggested the WWC emphasize larger studies that span significant periods  of time and set a minimum sample size requirement. According to WWC  staff, such changes would exclude valuable research and prevent the WWC  from providing educators with research-based information about some  interventions. Instead of changing its treatment of sample size and study  duration, the WWC began publishing information on the extent of the  evidence supporting its findings in 2007. The WWC\u2019s \u201cextent of evidence\u201d  rating alerts educators when the WWC effectiveness ratings are based on a  small amount of evidence. As figure 2 shows, 76 percent of interventions  with positive or potentially positive ratings of effectiveness are based on a  small amount of evidence (see fig. 2).", "Further, researchers suggested that the WWC presents misleading  information by rating interventions based on studies in which measures of  student performance closely match the content taught to the intervention  group, but not the control group. In such studies, higher test scores  among the intervention group may not accurately represent the  effectiveness of the intervention more generally. The researchers  suggested that the WWC exclude such measures, or at least report on them  separately. However, the WWC includes these measures because,  according to IES officials, they answer questions about whether different  interventions lead to different content knowledge. The WWC agrees that  there is a concern regarding the reliability of outcome measures that are  overly similar to the intervention, but maintains that WWC procedures  attempt to exclude such measures. In addition, in response to researcher  concerns that tests created by intervention developers may be biased, the  WWC added information to the intervention reports noting whether  outcome measures are based on tests created by the developer.", "Some researchers and education professionals we interviewed suggested  that the WWC produces limited information because its screening criteria  are too restrictive\u2014currently screening out about 90 percent of studies  initially identified as potentially relevant (see fig. 3). Until recently, the  WWC reviewed only two types of study designs\u2014randomized experiments  and quasi-experimental studies\u2014and according to critics, this limited the  amount and type of information available to educators. For example,  staff from one REL noted that educators may not be able to find reviews of the interventions they are using or considering because so few studies  meet WWC standards. Staff from another REL told us that if educators  cannot find relevant and useful information, they may be discouraged from using evidence-based practices. Staff from a third lab noted that the  narrow focus prevents educators from learning from less rigorous but  nonetheless useful research, such as case studies describing an  intervention\u2019s costs and implementa tion requirements.", "The WWC maintains that its screening criteria and study inclusion  standards focus on studies that provide strong evidence of an  intervention\u2019s effectiveness, and lowering these standards could  undermine the validity of the findings reported by the WWC. Although the  Clearinghouse screens out most studies, many of its reports have  identified interventions with positive effects. Data from the contractor  indicate that 58 percent of WWC\u2019s intervention reports identify positive or  potentially positive effects of interventions. While the WWC plans to  continue using its methodological standards for reviewing randomized and  quasi-experimental studies, the Clearinghouse acknowledges that the  emphasis on randomized experiments and quasi-experiments can exclude  useful information on interventions in certain topic areas, such as special  education, that do not lend themselves to these study designs. The WWC  created new standards to include additional study designs.", "The WWC also introduced practice guides in 2007 in response to criticisms  that its intervention reviews exclude too much research and consequently  provide limited information to educators. Written by a panel of experts,  practice guides include recommendations for educators on various topics,  such as reducing high school drop-out rates and reducing behavioral  problems in the classroom. Whereas WWC\u2019s intervention reviews are  based entirely on studies that meet WWC evidence standards, practice  guides also incorporate studies that do not have designs that are eligible  for WWC review, or in some cases, are reviewed and do not meet WWC  evidence standards, and include the views of experts. To develop  recommendations, the practice guide panel reviews available literature  about the particular topic and then meets several times to discuss the  topic. Through consensus, the panel identifies effective practices based on  the evidence.

For example, IES officials  told us identifying and scheduling a sufficient number of qualified,  independent peer reviewers had become increasingly difficult because  several former peer reviewers were now associated in some way with th WWC and therefore were no longer independent. To reduce the delays and eliminate the backlog, IES recently implemented a new database to help  staff track and manage the work of peer reviewers and other WWC-relate tasks.

According to REL  officials and WWC staff, these events sometimes included a WWC staff  member to discuss methodology and panelists who helped develop the  practice guides. RELs also disseminate research from WWC when  responding to educator questions or concerns. Officials from 7 of the 10  RELs told us their respective RELs generally use relevant WWC products  (practice guides and others) when searching for research-based  information to address educator questions.", "In addition, Education\u2019s Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy  Development disseminates information about WWC practice guides on its  DWW Web site, which provides an online library of resources designed to  help educators implement research-based instructional practice. This Web  site uses different formats to present content based primarily on WWC  Practice Guides and provides examples of possible ways educators might  apply WWC research findings. For instance, to help educators implement  the recommendations from the practice guide on dropout prevention, the  DWW Web site features slideshows with examples of supportive academic  environments and interviews with educators and experts on dropout  prevention. In addition, the Web site includes sample materials, such as  lesson plan templates, that provide an example of how to implement  recommendations. The DWW also includes information on the research  behind the recommendations and a link to the WWC Web site and the  individual practice guides. According to IES officials, a recent analysis of  the DWW Web site traffic showed that 49 state Web sites have links to the  DWW Web site, which helps disseminate WWC products further to the  education community.", "We found that 33 of the 38 states that responded to our survey reported  that they had heard of the WWC. Based on our survey results, we estimate  that 42 percent of school districts have heard of the WWC and that the  percentage is greater for school districts that rely to a very large extent on  external sources for information on research-based practices.", "School districts identified several sources of information about the  Clearinghouse, including conferences and Education (see fig. 8).", "While the majority of states have accessed the WWC Web site, we estimate  that only 34 percent of school districts have done so. Specifically, among  the states that responded to our survey, 33 of 38 states reported that they  had accessed the WWC Web site at least once. In addition, 19 of states  reported visiting the Web site at least seven times per year. In contrast,  an estimated 34 percent of school districts accessed the WWC Web site at  least once. Further, we estimate that only 11 percent of school districts  visited the Web site at least seven times per year. States and school  districts that visited the WWC Web site less than seven times per year  most often cited time constraints as the primary reason for their  infrequent use.", "In addition to the WWC, states and school districts use a variety of other  sources of information to identify effective education practices. Most  states and school districts use several broad sources of information, such  as academic journals, education periodicals, and associations of  educators. For example, 37 states reported using academic journals to  identify such practices, and we estimate that about 97 percent of school  districts used academic journals. Overall, more school districts and  states that responded to our survey used the WWC than used other  research synthesis organizations.", "While the WWC also includes teachers and principals in its target  audience, we found that relatively few of the teachers and principals we  contacted at education conferences had heard of the WWC.

Some of the new products aim to  be more responsive to educators and education decision makers by  providing timely information about evidence-based practices relevant to  pressing needs. Such information could help states and districts identify  strategies as they implement educational reform efforts\u2014such as  reforming low-performing schools or improving professional  development\u2014under ESEA and the Recovery Act. For example, WWC  research perspectives, still in development, are intended to help education  decision makers as they address challenges related to spending Recovery  Act funds. However, the development of these products and the release of  other products were delayed, in part, by a substantial backlog in IES\u2019s  review and approval processes. These delays hindered the timely release  of several publications, and some products were released months after  they were completed by the contractor. While IES recently eliminated the  backlog, educators need to be able to rely on the Clearinghouse for timely  and relevant information. According to our survey, many states and school  districts reported that they would likely increase their use of the  Clearinghouse if it released information more quickly.", "While IES has increased annual report production, IES has not established  reasonable production cost ranges or specific cost-related performance  measures related to each product type. Without acceptable per product  cost ranges, it is difficult for IES to assess the reasonableness of costs  associated with certain products, even as IES takes steps to streamline  production. IES\u2019s current study on costs may help IES establish acceptable  cost ranges that could inform IES\u2019s performance measurements related to  the WWC. In addition, such information could inform cost comparisons  between the WWC and other research evaluation organizations or provide  baselines for future contractor work.", "In addition, IES has not established meaningful performance measures  related to product usefulness. Until fiscal year 2010, IES tracked visits to  its Web site and annual report production as a way to measure the  productivity of the Clearinghouse. While these measures were important  to accurately track the WWC\u2019s initial growth, they did not evaluate the  degree to which the products were meeting the needs of educators.  Specifically, IES currently does not have a way to gauge user satisfaction  with WWC products, which is a common practice when developing and  providing new products. Further, while IES currently incorporates some  feedback from the WWC Web site users, to inform future topic areas, it  does not systematically gauge its target audience\u2019s major areas of interest  or concern\u2014such as gathering information on interventions currently  being used or considered in specific school districts or states. IES decides  how to spread its limited resources across the various product types  without directly measuring the extent to which educators use the WWC or  how useful they find the various products to be. Measuring the use and  usefulness of its products could help IES continue to improve content,  develop products, and respond to the needs of educators and  policymakers.", "While some educators and policymakers find WWC products useful, many  other educators are not familiar with the Clearinghouse. IES has spent a  substantial amount of money, time, and effort producing various  summaries of evidence-based practices, which cover both specific  education interventions and general practices. This investment in the  WWC was made in order to inform education professionals at all levels\u2014 from classroom teachers to policymakers\u2014as they make decisions on how  best to educate the nation\u2019s children.

WWC\u2019s  experience to date is that study authors frequently fail to respond  to requests for additional information, and IES officials expect that  many study authors likewise will not respond to requests for  information about funding sources, or may judge that it is not in  their proprietary interest to provide the information. Currently the  WWC only queries authors in cases where the Clearinghouse  needs additional information. Querying all authors and tracking  their responses would increase costs for intervention reports.", "Another potential option is to ask developers, when they are  reviewing the list of studies WWC found during the literature  search for comprehensiveness, to note any studies that they  funded.", "The current version of the handbook gives guidance on standards  for random assignment in simple cases. The next version of the  handbook (forthcoming in 2010) will provide guidance and  examples for multilevel settings, with explicit guidance on  acceptable practice and potential issues with random assignment  in a multilevel setting.  lES asked the WWC to review the search process. The  WWC now takes steps to ensure that search records are  maintained. Each team and the library maintain a record of  conducted searches. More documentation on the process will be  included in the forthcoming revision of the handbook.", "The WWC is undertaking a pilot using five recent evidence reports  in different topic areas. Because WWC screeners are encouraged  to pass to the next stage any study for which they are uncertain  about eligibility, the proportion of eligible studies that are excluded  is the salient error rate (the other source of error is when screeners  include an ineligible study in a review, but this error is then offset  by the review).", "IES officials are not aware of any established standards for  acceptable error rates (there are tradeoffs between making Type I  vs. Type II errors relating to cost), but will examine this issue  further. If the screening error rate is larger than the lES and the  WWC believes is acceptable, IES officials will assess whether  additional training or two screeners is appropriate given the  different costs and benefits of each approach.", "Currently, reference lists for WWC intervention reports include all  studies, both eligible and ineligible, located in the search process.  Ineligible studies are flagged with the primary reason for not  qualifying for further WWC review. Intervention reports do not list  materials such as product descriptions or reviews of products that  are deemed not relevant to the intervention being reviewed.", "To make the number of studies (both eligible and ineligible studies)  more apparent to readers, the WWC will add a text box to  intervention reports located in front of the listing of reports. The  text box will summarize the number of studies that met different  conditions (this approach currently is used for reports in which  none of the studies meet standards). The box will serve the same  purpose as a flow chart but the codes used to describe the final  status for reports will be the same ones currently used in the  citation appendix. The WWC plans to begin including the text box  in reports released in 2010 and thereafter.", "Ideally, the primary source for reanalyses of data would be study  authors. However, as noted above in response to recommendation  2(v), it is common for authors not to respond to the WWC\u2019s  requests for additional information. Reanalyzing the data also  would require additional effort by the authors and would run into  difficulties when studies are dated or are based on data that has  been destroyed to comply with confidentiality or privacy  restrictions.", "The WWC recently undertook a survey of published clustering  estimates. It found that the WWC\u2019s current default clustering  correction is consistent with published estimates for achievement  and behavioral outcomes. The WWC will continue to monitor  research developments on this topic.", "There are, of course, many possible ways to summarize evidence.  Given its intended broad and primarily nontechnical audience, the  WWC\u2019s current approach is designed to be transparent and easily  explained. lES believes that having the WWC conduct its own  analyses to estimate intervention effects, as statistical meta- analyses do, would be inconsistent with these goals.", "However, as an alternative to modifying the WWC\u2019s main approach  for reporting findings, lES is considering having the WWC conduct  supplemental meta-analyses related to specific questions of  interest, and releasing these findings as a separate report that  would complement intervention reports. For example, a report  could analyze whether computer mediated approaches to teaching  reading are more or less effective than approaches that rely solely  on teachers, based on already-released interventions reports.  Having a separate report enables the WWC to continue using its  current transparent approach, while also using statistical  techniques that combine evidence in other ways.", "Topic area protocols are available on the topic area home pages.", "Just after the expert panel\u2019s report, the WWC released its  Procedures and Standards Handbook in December 2008. A  revision currently is under way that will include more detail on the  screening process. See the response to (3) above related to  results of the screening process and the response to (5) regarding  the results of the screening process.  lES agrees that these products need to remain distinct. Practice  guides are on a separate Web site tab that separates them from  intervention reports. The next revision of the handbook  (forthcoming in 2010) will include a chapter describing the practice  guide development process and how it is different from that of the  evidence reports.", "The recently released guide on What Works for Practitioners also  provides more information on reports and practice guides, and the  WWC is preparing a video tutorial that will explain the differences  to users.", "The WWC tries to keep abreast of developments in the field, for  example, by routinely checking materials from the Cochrane  Collaborative when developing new standards or approaches.", "Most recently, the WWC has undertaken the following outreach  efforts to connect with other organizations conducting systematic  reviews:    The WWC sponsored a forum on research methods in  December 2008 that featured speakers from the National  Academy of Sciences, the National Cancer Institute, and the  Cochrane Collaboration.", "In June 2009 WWC staff attended the Cochrane conference on  practice guides in June to learn about state of the art methods in  research synthesis and practice guides.", "The WWC is presenting a workshop on WWC standards at the  upcoming annual conference of the Association of Public Policy  and Management.", "The WWC has also met with six international contacts (from  Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, England, Interamerican Development  Bank, and Trinidad/Tobago) in response to inquiries about how  governments or organizations could implement their own  clearinghouse operations.", "Recently the WWC began a webinar series to disseminate its new  practice guides. The webinar includes researchers and  practitioners in its audience.", "The WWC convened two groups of researchers to develop its  forthcoming standards on single-subject designs and regression  discontinuity designs. It will continue to bring together researchers  as needs for new standards are identified.
