The act also requires the regulators to periodically assess institutions\u2019 community lending performance during examinations and to consider that performance in their evaluations of institutions\u2019 applications for expansion or relocation of their operations. Growing concern about the effectiveness of CRA\u2019s implementation and its regulatory burden on institutions led to the regulators\u2019 major reform effort, which resulted in two major proposed CRA revisions, issued in December 1993 and October 1994, and a final revised CRA regulation in May 1995.", "This report responds to a request from the former Chairmen, House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Subcommittee on Consumer Credit and Insurance asking us to evaluate whether the regulators\u2019 reform efforts would improve compliance with the CRA, encourage institutions\u2019 lending to their entire communities, and reduce unnecessary burden. The former Chairmen also asked us to evaluate the regulators\u2019 implementation of the fair lending laws\u2014the Fair Housing Act (FHA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).

Table 1.1 briefly illustrates the major amendments to CRA since its passage.", "CRA was passed as title VIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.). CRA requires each federal banking regulator to use its authority, when examining institutions, to encourage such institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with the institution\u2019s safe and sound operation. In connection with these examinations, the regulators are required to assess an institution\u2019s record of lending in its community and take it into account when evaluating any type of application by an institution for a deposit facility.", "CRA was amended by FIRREA to require that the regulator\u2019s examination rating and a written evaluation of each assessment factor be made publicly available. FIRREA also established a four-part qualitative rating scale so that the publicly available CRA ratings would not be confused with the five-part numerical ratings given to institutions by the regulators on the basis of the safety and soundness of their operations. These safety and soundness ratings are confidential. In 1991, FDICIA further amended CRA to require public discussion of data underlying the regulators\u2019 assessment of an institution\u2019s CRA performance in the public CRA evaluation. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended CRA to require that the regulators consider activities and investment involving minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions in assessing the CRA performance of institutions cooperating in these efforts. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended CRA to require that institutions with interstate branching structures receive a separate rating and written evaluation for each state in which they have branches and a separate written evaluation of their performance within a multistate metropolitan area where they have branches in two or more states within the area.", "The principle contained in CRA, that institutions must serve the \u201cconvenience and needs\u201d of the communities in which they are chartered to do business consistent with safe and sound operations, is one that federal law governing deposit insurance, bank charters, and bank mergers had embodied before CRA was enacted. The Banking Act of 1935 declared that banks should serve the convenience and needs of their communities. The Bank Holding Company Act, initially passed in 1956, requires FRB, in acting on acquisitions by banks and bank holding companies, to evaluate how well a bank meets the convenience and needs of its communities within the limits of safety and soundness.

The primary purpose of CRA was to prohibit redlining\u2014arbitrarily failing to provide credit to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. FHA and ECOA prohibit lending discrimination based on certain characteristics of potential and actual borrowers. The FHA, passed by Congress in 1968 as title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, among other things prohibits discrimination in residential real estate-related transactions on the basis of an applicant\u2019s race, color, religion, gender, handicap, familial status, or national origin. Such prohibited activities include denying or fixing the terms and conditions of a loan based on discriminatory criteria. The ECOA, passed in 1974, prohibits discrimination with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or the exercise, in good faith, of rights granted by the Consumer Credit Protection Act.", "HMDA was enacted by Congress in 1975 to provide regulators and the public with information so that both could determine whether depository institutions were serving the credit needs of their communities but was expanded over time to detect evidence of possible discrimination based on the individual characteristics of applicants. HMDA established a reporting obligation for depository institutions. Initially, HMDA required depository institutions with total assets of more than $10 million to compile data on the number and total dollar amount of mortgage loans originated or for which the institution received completed applications or purchased during each fiscal year by geographic area and make that data available for public inspection. In 1989, HMDA was amended to require collection and reporting of data on race, gender, and income characteristics of mortgage applicants to provide data to assist in identifying discriminatory lending practices and enforcing fair lending statutes. Amendments to HMDA in 1988 and 1991 expanded the reporting requirements to most mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies and independent mortgage companies not affiliated with depository institutions. In 1992, HMDA was amended to require affected financial institutions to make available to the public, upon request, their loan application registers, which maintain data for loans covered by HMDA.", "Both HMDA and CRA were originally enacted to remedy a perceived lack of lending by institutions to the communities in which they were chartered to do business by the regulators. HMDA was amended in 1989 to include the collection of data on race, sex, and income of applicants for credit to provide indications of possible lending discrimination. In addition, 2 of the 12 assessment factors, factors D and F, in the current CRA regulation address the issue of discrimination to be considered in determining an institution\u2019s CRA rating.

Believing that bank operations had become too complex to be adequately covered by a single group of examiners, the FRB established a special compliance examiner program in 1977, which is responsible for performing compliance examinations separately from safety and soundness examinations. The FRB made the compliance examiner program permanent in 1979. A distinct group of compliance examiners, initially established by this program, has remained in place since 1979 and has grown relative to the number of Federal Reserve member banks.", "FDIC initiated a compliance examiner program in the late 1970s that established a compliance specialty but did not represent a separate career path and did not preclude examiners from also conducting safety and soundness examinations. FDIC did not establish an entirely separate compliance examiner force exclusively responsible for compliance examinations until 1990. FDIC\u2019s compliance examiner program was not fully staffed, however, until the end of 1993. The compliance examiners remained part of FDIC\u2019s Division of Supervision until an August 1994 reorganization that consolidated activities formerly divided between the Division of Supervision and the Office of Consumer Affairs into a single Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs.", "Similar to FDIC, OCC established a compliance examination specialty in the late 1970s. The specialty did not represent a separate career path for examiners and often resulted in examiners spending only a portion of their time doing compliance examinations. Junior examiners were usually responsible for doing compliance examinations. The perceived greater attractiveness of safety and soundness work combined with the safety and soundness crisis in the banking industry during the late 1980s and early 1990s rendered the compliance specialty a low priority.", "OCC began to develop a separate compliance program with a separate compliance examiner career path in 1993. OCC currently has an operating staff of compliance examiners composed of approximately 170 people. An additional 110 people are to be part-time compliance examiners who will be expected to devote a minimum of 20 percent of their time to compliance examinations. OCC believes that devoting at least 20 percent of these examiners\u2019 time to compliance will ensure that they maintain a sufficient level of expertise. This group is to be responsible for compliance examinations of \u201cprogram\u201d banks, banks with $1 billion or more in assets. Banks with less than $1 billion in assets, approximately 70 percent of OCC\u2019s banks, are to continue to be examined by OCC\u2019s nonspecialized examiners.", "Although OTS supervises thrifts, as opposed to commercial banks, it is responsible for assessing compliance with most of the same compliance laws and regulations as the banking regulators. In 1989, OTS established a separate compliance examiner program in which compliance examinations are to be conducted by specially trained, career professional staffs in the OTS regional offices. The original mandate for establishing such a program came from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The passage of FIRREA, which abolished the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and established OTS, slowed the process of establishing the compliance examiner program. The program was fully implemented in 1990 and as of December 1994, OTS had 105 compliance examiners on board.", "Table 1.2 shows the number of institutions subject to examination and the number of compliance examiners for each regulator at year end for the period beginning in 1988.", "The regulators rely primarily on the examination process to ensure that institutions comply with CRA.

These factors were developed as part of the original regulations implementing CRA and have not changed. To allow the examiner sufficient flexibility necessary to weigh the factors and categories consistent with their significance in the context of a particular institution, the regulators have not assigned a relative weighting to the factors. However, regulatory guidance notes that compliance with antidiscrimination laws and regulations, including ECOA and FHA, is a significant factor in reaching the overall CRA rating. Moreover, regulatory guidance issued in 1992 also stresses that examiners are to weigh CRA performance over process, i.e., how well an institution helps meet the credit needs of its community over documentation showing how the institution ensures CRA compliance.", "Financial institutions are to demonstrate their CRA performance under various assessment factors in several ways. For example, an institution is required to assess the credit needs of its community. To show that an assessment was done an institution might document its discussions with members of the community, such as community groups or civic organizations, regarding credit needs of the community. To show that it lends to all parts of its community, an institution might plot its lending data onto a map to show the geographic locations where the institution has extended credit. A sophisticated form of coding loans according to their location is called geocoding.", "The CRA assessment factors are grouped under five performance categories identified in guidance provided by the regulators and published in the Federal Register on May 1, 1990.

Although CRA compliance is not to be the only issue the regulators consider when reviewing applications, it may play a major role.", "Community groups and some members of Congress have described the applications approval process as not being an effective enforcement mechanism for CRA because the regulators do not always deny applications on the basis of an applicant\u2019s poor CRA performance. Table 1.6 shows the number of applications denied on the basis of poor CRA performance since 1989.", "Although they have been criticized for denying few applications on the basis of CRA performance, the regulators defend their records by stating that they consider the denial of an application to be a last resort. FRB and FDIC also approve applications with commitments. An example might include increased lending efforts in targeted neighborhoods. This provides the regulators with better enforcement leverage by explicitly tying an application\u2019s approval to tangible improvement of the applicant\u2019s CRA performance. However, regulatory guidance states that commitments can only remedy specific problems in an otherwise satisfactory CRA record and cannot be the basis for the approval of an application. OCC and OTS do not typically approve applications with commitments but instead prefer to conditionally approve applications, if deemed appropriate. The conditions for such approvals may be similar to commitments; however, the applicant institution must meet the conditions before consummation of the transaction for which it has applied. An example of a condition might be to require an applicant with a \u201cneeds to improve\u201d CRA rating who is seeking to open a branch office to upgrade its rating to \u201csatisfactory\u201d before opening the branch. Table 1.7 shows the number of applications approved with commitments since 1989 by FRB and FDIC and shows the number of applications approved with conditions by OCC and OTS.", "The regulators also pointed out that institutions considering expansion plans are aware of the role CRA plays in the approval process. An institution contemplating expansion would likely make sure that its CRA performance is at least satisfactory or reconsider submitting an application.

Because regulators must consider protests in their approval process, these groups have exercised a measure of leverage over institutions wishing to expand and have added an element to the process beyond the potential for an application denial. In some cases, agreements have been reached between bankers and community groups and then protests have been withdrawn and applications approved. In other cases, the regulators have approved the application after evaluating the protest and determining that it did not warrant a denial.", "Table 1.8 shows the number of applications from 1989 to 1994 that had protests lodged against them and the number of protested applications that were denied.", "To minimize disruptions to the applications process caused by protests, it is the regulators\u2019 policy to encourage and sometimes facilitate meetings between institutions wishing to expand and protestants to help them clarify their areas of dispute and perhaps come to an understanding.

This role was strengthened by amendments to CRA enacted by FIRREA in 1989 and FDICIA in 1991. Applications filed by institutions for expansion are a matter of public record, and the regulators invite public comment when they are considering them. Filing an application has the potential for inviting public comment and possibly protest. CRA examination guidance encourages examiners to contact community groups and other members of the public during examinations, and the regulators are expected to encourage interested parties to submit written comments on an institution\u2019s CRA performance, which are to be included in the institution\u2019s public CRA file. The CRA file is also to be reviewed by examiners during examinations.", "When FIRREA made CRA ratings public and FDICIA required more detail in CRA evaluations, members of the public were provided with more information to use in deciding whether to protest an application or patronize an institution. For example, some local governments have established programs in which they have required the deposit of public funds to be made with only institutions having satisfactory or better CRA ratings.", "Public disclosure of CRA ratings has also made the regulators more accountable by allowing interested members of the public to see how the regulators were rating various institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Regulators Have Used Other Enforcement Mechanisms for CRA Violations", "paragraphs": ["Each of the regulators has taken enforcement actions, such as supervisory agreements, memorandums of understanding, and cease and desist orders, to address CRA violations.

Those institutions were advised in the consent actions that in the event they did not comply, the regulators could take more stringent enforcement actions. The regulators have not taken any more stringent actions thus far. Moreover, in a December 1994 opinion, the Department of Justice determined that the regulators lack authority to use any enforcement mechanism for CRA other than measures taken in the context of an application.", "The extent to which the regulators have used enforcement actions for CRA purposes is unclear because such actions generally include a variety of issues needing institution management attention in addition to CRA issues. FRB reported that 14 of the enforcement actions that it issued in 1993 included provisions related to technical CRA violations.

Opponents of that bill voiced serious concerns that the bill could result in credit allocation based on the volume of deposits coming from certain areas, without regard for credit demand or the merits of loan applications. They argued that the law would therefore disrupt the normal flow of capital from areas of excess supply to areas of strong demand and undermine the safety and soundness of depository institutions.", "Proponents of the bill stated that it was meant to ensure only that bankers did not ignore good borrowing prospects in their communities and that they treated credit worthy borrowers even-handedly. Senator William Proxmire, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said that it would neither force high-risk lending nor substitute the views of regulators for those of bankers. He said that safety and soundness should remain the overriding factor when regulators evaluate applications for corporate expansion. Meeting the credit needs of the community was to be only one of the criteria for the regulators to evaluate when considering applications.", "Since enactment of CRA, the debate has continued. Many bankers still regard CRA as an unwelcome statute that limits their flexibility in business decisions and mandates relatively low-profit lending that could cause safety and soundness problems. Bankers complain that CRA regulations are unclear and burdensome, reducing their competitiveness with other lenders who are not subject to CRA. CRA was among the major complaints by bankers in all major studies of regulatory burden, including our report.We found that bankers\u2019 complaints included CRA-based documentation, reporting, and geocoding requirements as well as lack of recognition of banks\u2019 different characteristics, examination emphasis on form over substance, and a variety of other examination-related issues. In addition, bankers argued that other financial intermediaries, such as insurance and securities firms and credit unions, compete with banks for funds and loans but are not subject to CRA. Bankers said this results in a double standard that puts them at a competitive disadvantage.", "Many community groups, however, have complained that too many institutions are receiving satisfactory CRA ratings without actually lending to their communities. They complained that CRA examinations are more concerned with an institution\u2019s CRA process, while ignoring whether it has engaged in actual lending to its community. In addition, they have complained that while over 90 percent of all institutions receive at least satisfactory CRA ratings, there continue to be large geographic areas that suffer from an inability to obtain credit from these institutions. These groups have called for an examination process that stresses actual lending performance over process. They have also called for better public disclosure of the information and the rationale used to assess institutions\u2019 lending performance.", "Although arguments for and against CRA and various aspects of its implementation have often been presented as belonging to bankers or community groups, it is important to note that there have also been disagreements among members of these groups, further complicating efforts to satisfy all sides of the controversy. The interests of large and small institutions have at times diverged. For example, bankers from small institutions have often been more concerned with regulatory burden associated with documentation requirements of CRA while bankers from larger institutions, which can more easily absorb the expense of documentation requirements, have been more concerned with the role application protests have played in delaying their expansion plans. There have also been instances where some community groups have defended particular institutions that were accused of poor performance by the regulators or other community groups. Some community groups have said they prefer to work with institutions to reach agreements on community needs and how those needs should be met, while others said they rely more on protests to get institutions to make commitments to the community.

He instructed the regulators to make examinations more consistent, improve enforcement to provide more effective sanctions, and reduce the cost and burden of compliance. The four regulators jointly released their proposed revision to the current CRA regulation for comment on December 21, 1993. The proposal would have replaced the current qualitative CRA examination system, including the 12 assessment factors, with a more quantitative system based on actual performance as measured through the use of three tests: the lending, service, and investment tests. A key element of the December 1993 proposal was the \u201cmarket share test,\u201d which would, as part of the lending test, compare an institution\u2019s lending relative to other lenders in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, with its lending in other parts of its service community. Collectively, the regulators received over 6,700 comment letters on the December 1993 proposal from representatives of the banking industry, community groups, Congress, and state and local governments. Reaction to the proposal was mixed and generally polarized based on the interests of the individual or organization commenting.

This proposal reflected comments received on the December 1993 proposal and the regulators\u2019 further internal considerations. While still striving for a system that measured performance and not efforts or processes, the new proposal made revisions to the first proposal that would increase the role of examiner discretion in CRA examinations. For example, the lending test would no longer be based on the market share test. Collectively, the regulators received over 7,200 comment letters on the October proposal.", "In May 1995, FRB, OCC, OTS, and FDIC released the new revised CRA regulations. The final regulations retained, to a significant extent, the principles and structure of the December 1993 and October 1994 proposals but made changes to some details to respond to concerns raised in the comment letters and further regulator consideration.", "The final revised regulation eliminates the previously discussed 12 assessment factors and substitutes a three-part, performance-based evaluation system for institutions that do not qualify as small institutions. The regulation defines small institutions as independent retail institutions with total assets of less than $250 million and holding company affiliates with total assets of less than $1 billion. The revised regulation includes a streamlined examination for small banks and the option for all institutions to have their CRA performance examined according to a regulator-approved strategic plan.", "To take into account community characteristics and needs, the revised CRA regulation makes explicit the performance context against which the tests and standards set out in the proposed regulation are to be applied. This performance context includes consideration of six factors concerning the unique characteristics of the institution under examination and the market in which it operates. To determine a performance context, the regulators are to request any information that the institution has developed on lending, investment, and service opportunities in its assessment area(s). The regulators have stated that they will not expect more information than what the institution normally would develop to prepare a business plan or to identify potential markets and customers, including low- and moderate-income persons and geographies in its assessment area(s). The regulators are to consider this information from the institution along with information from community, government, civic, and other sources to enable the examiner to gain a working knowledge of the institution\u2019s community. The revised CRA regulation gives particular attention to the institution\u2019s record of helping to meet credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities and individuals based on community characteristics and needs.", "In general, the regulators are to rate an institution\u2019s performance under each of the tests, but the lending test rating is to carry more weight than the others. An institution must receive a rating of at least \u201clow satisfactory\u201d on the lending test to receive an overall CRA rating of satisfactory. However, ratings on the other two tests are still to have considerable effect on the overall rating as well.", "The major elements of the regulators\u2019 revised CRA regulations are described as follows: Lending test: The lending test is to entail a review of an institution\u2019s lending record, including originations and purchases of home mortgage, small business, small farm, and, at the institution\u2019s option, consumer loans throughout the institution\u2019s service area, including the low- and moderate-income areas; the proportion of the institution\u2019s lending in its service area(s); the distribution of loans to borrowers of various income levels; the number of loans to small businesses and farms; and the like. If the regulators determine that a substantial majority of an institution\u2019s business is consumer lending, then they are to evaluate this lending as part of the lending test whether or not the institution elects to provide consumer lending data. The regulators are to consider loans to individuals of all incomes wherever they reside. The number, amount, and complexity of an institution\u2019s community development loans are also to be included in the lending examination. The regulators are to consider the lending of affiliates at the election of the institution or if an institution appears to be attempting to inappropriately influence a CRA examination by conducting activities that would be unfavorably evaluated by an examiner in an affiliate.", "Investment test: The investment test is to evaluate an institution\u2019s investments in community development activities. In reviewing these investments, the examiner is to take into account the amount, innovativeness, or complexity of the investment as well as the degree to which it responds to community credit and economic development needs. Institutions with limited investment authority, such as thrifts, are to receive a low-satisfactory rating under the investment test, even if they have made few or no qualified investments, as long as they have a strong lending record. A donation, sale on favorable terms, or rent-free occupancy of a branch (in whole or in part) in a predominantly minority neighborhood to any minority- or women-owned depository institution, or a financial institution with a primary mission of promoting community development, is to be considered a qualifying investment.", "Service test: The service test is to require the examiner to analyze an institution\u2019s systems for delivering retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development services. The examiner is to review, in addition to the branching information, information regarding alternative service delivery mechanisms such as banking by telephone, mobile branches, loan production offices, automated teller machines (ATM), etc., in low- and moderate-income areas and for low- and moderate-income individuals. The evaluation is to also consider the range of services, including noncredit services, available to, and the degree to which those services are tailored for, the various income level areas. The focus of the test, however, is to be on the institution\u2019s current distribution of full-service branches. Alternative systems for delivering retail banking services, such as ATMs, are to be considered only to the extent that they are effective alternatives in providing needed services to low- and moderate-income areas and individuals.", "Data collection, reporting, and disclosure: Data reporting requirements on institutions are to be expanded by requiring that originations and purchases of all small business and small farm loans be collected and reported to the regulator. Each institution is required to collect and maintain for each loan in a standardized, machine readable format; the amount at origination, location, and an indicator whether the loan was to a business with $1 million or less in gross annual revenues. The location of the loan is to be maintained by census tract or block numbering area. Each institution is to report in machine-readable form annually, aggregated for each census tract/block numbering area in which the institution made at least one small business or small farm loan during the prior calendar year, the number and amount of loans with original amounts of $100,000 or less, more than $100,000 but less than or equal to $250,000, or more than $250,000, and the number and amount of loans to businesses and farms with gross annual revenues of $1 million or less. The regulators, rather than the institutions, are to annually prepare individual CRA disclosure statements for each reporting institution and aggregate disclosure statements for each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the non-MSA portion of each state. The regulators are to make both the individual and the aggregate disclosure statements available to the public at central depositories. The aggregate disclosure statements will indicate, for each geography, the number and amount of small business and small farm loans originated or purchased by all reporting institutions, except that the regulators may adjust the form of the disclosure if necessary, because of special circumstances, to protect the privacy of a borrower or the competitive position of an institution. Institutions are also to include the disclosure statements in their public files. In keeping with the lending test, data collection and maintenance are optional for consumer loans, and there are no reporting requirements.", "Streamlined examination for small institutions: Independent banks and thrifts with assets below $250 million and institutions with assets below $250 million that are subsidiaries of holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets are to be evaluated under a streamlined examination method unless an institution affirmatively requests an alternative examination method. The streamlined method is to focus on an institution\u2019s loan-to-deposit ratio, degree of local lending, record of lending to borrowers and geographies of different income levels, and record of responding to complaints. An institution\u2019s fair lending record is also to be taken into account in assigning a final rating. The regulators are to consider an institution\u2019s size, financial condition, and credit needs of its service area in evaluating whether its loan-to-deposit ratio is reasonable. The regulators are to further consider, as appropriate, other lending-related activities, such as originations for sale on the secondary market and community development lending and investment.", "Strategic plan option: Every institution is to have the alternative of submitting a strategic plan to its supervisory agency for approval that was developed with community input detailing how the institution proposes to meet its CRA obligation. The strategic plan option is not to relieve an institution from any reporting obligations that it otherwise has. However, small institutions do not subject themselves to any data reporting responsibilities by electing the strategic plan option.", "Community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions: The regulation is to replace the investment test with a community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. The regulation incorporates into this community development test both community development lending and community development services in addition to qualified investments. Therefore, under the regulation, wholesale or limited purpose institutions are to be subject only to the community development test. Wholesale or limited purpose institutions must be designated as such by the regulators.", "Institutions are to continue maintaining a public file that contains (1) all written comments received from the public during the previous 3 years that comment on the institution\u2019s CRA performance; (2) a copy of the public portion of the institution\u2019s most recent CRA examination; (3) a list of the institution\u2019s branches, their street addresses, and geographic areas to be served; (4) a list of branches opened or closed by the institution during the previous 3 years, their addresses, and geographic areas to be served; (5) a list of services generally offered at the institution\u2019s branches and descriptions of material differences in the availability or cost of services at particular branches; (6) a map of each assessment area showing the boundaries of the area and identifying the geographic areas to be served within the area; (7) and any other information the bank chooses. In addition, large banks are also to include in their public file (1) any consumer loan data that the institution wishes to have considered as part of its CRA examination; (2) the institution\u2019s CRA disclosure statement that it receives from its regulator; and (3) relevant HMDA disclosure statements for the previous 2 years. Small banks are to include their loan-to-deposit ratio for each quarter of the previous year and any additional information that they see fit, including the information required for large institutions if they elect to be evaluated under the lending, investment, and service tests. Institutions that elect to be evaluated under the strategic plan are to include the plan in the public file. An institution that received a less than satisfactory rating during its most recent examination is to include a description of its efforts to improve its performance.", "The revised CRA regulations are to amend the current CRA regulations over time, eventually replacing the existing regulations in their entirety by July 1, 1997.

(3) What challenges do the regulators face in ensuring the success of the reforms and what, if any, actions would help the regulators in facing these challenges? and (4) What initiatives have been taken or proposed to help bankers overcome community lending barriers and enhance lending opportunities, particularly in low- and moderate-income areas?", "We interviewed regulatory officials responsible for bank or thrift examinations to understand and identify the major problems with the current regulatory system used in implementing CRA and to understand the context in which the regulators examine and enforce the law. In addition, we reviewed the legislative history of the CRA to discern its original intent and to see how amendments have changed the law over time. We also collected data from each of the regulators relevant to various aspects of their CRA enforcement. In addition to regulatory officials, we judgmentally selected and interviewed other parties who were located in the areas where we did our work and who are concerned with or active in CRA compliance issues, including bankers, community groups, trade groups, consultants, representatives of the secondary markets, and officials from other federal agencies, including Justice. We also collected data from each of these groups and from Justice regarding CRA examinations and enforcement.

At each of the 40 institutions, to the extent possible, we completed a case study using standardized data collection instruments to gather the impressions and experiences of the bankers and examiners.", "For our case studies, we judgmentally selected institutions that included a variety of asset sizes; business types; and a mix of rural, suburban, and urban institutions. We selected institutions regulated by each of the four regulators and attempted to select institutions with a variety of good and bad CRA ratings. However, we found that institutions that received low CRA ratings from their last compliance examination were less willing to participate in the case studies than those that had fared better. While 11 of the institutions had received a \u201cneeds to improve\u201d rating on their last CRA examination, none had received a \u201csubstantial noncompliance.\u201d The institutions we studied included 10 from each of the four regions; 6 were examined by FRB, 13 by FDIC, 9 by OCC, and 12 by OTS. Nine of the institutions had assets over $1 billion, 13 had assets of less than $1 billion but more than $100 million, and 18 had assets of $100 million or less.", "We also talked to community groups known to be active in each region about their involvement in CRA compliance. In this way, we could identify the positive and negative aspects of the current examination system and verify some of the anecdotal complaints surrounding it. In addition, the case studies afforded us the opportunity to discuss other related issues, such as CRA reform, with a large number of individuals who worked with CRA compliance on a regular basis.", "To determine the extent to which the regulators\u2019 reform proposals would address the problems we identified from work previously described and to identify the challenges the regulators would face in ensuring the success of the reforms, we evaluated a number of proposals for CRA reform that were put forward from several sources, including the proposals released by the regulators on December 21, 1993, and October 7, 1994, and the final revised CRA regulation, released in May 1995. In addition, we reviewed letters submitted by bankers, community groups, and other concerned parties commenting on the regulators\u2019 proposals. We discussed numerous suggestions for improving the CRA examination and enforcement process with participants in our case studies.

Generally, bankers\u2019 concerns about the problems focused on the regulatory burden of compliance, and they sought to reduce that burden. For example, they sought to increase certainty about examination ratings through use of preapproved strategic plans and guarantees (\u201csafe harbors\u201d) that satisfactory and outstanding ratings would protect from CRA protests institutions\u2019 applications to move or expand operations. In contrast, community groups were generally concerned about the lack of accountability on the part of institutions to ensure that they meet their community lending obligations. These groups also sought measures to increase regulators\u2019 accountability through more public disclosure of institutions\u2019 CRA performance and tougher enforcement.

All parties also generally agreed that the examination should be based on the results of those efforts and processes, with emphasis on the institution\u2019s community lending performance.

They advocated that the CRA reform should eliminate this burden by focusing examinations on performance or results.", "However, community group representatives were most concerned that the focus on documentation of efforts and processes had failed to hold institutions accountable for their actual lending and service in communities.

This inconsistency resulted in uncertainty among the affected parties about how institutions\u2019 performance would be evaluated during examinations. Although the affected parties\u2019 underlying concerns and solutions tended to differ, the solutions were all designed in one way or another to reduce, or more clearly direct, examiner discretion to provide greater consistency to the examination process.", "Generally, bankers were concerned about inconsistency in performance examinations because this led to confusion and uncertainty about what actions were necessary to attain a positive rating. As a result of the uncertainty, many bankers believed that institutions were producing unneeded documentation of their efforts. Some bankers sought to reduce this uncertainty through more specific instructions or lending targets from the regulators, thereby getting more definition to what actions count as CRA activities.", "Community groups generally recognized inconsistency as a problem that represented a failure of the regulators to hold institutions accountable for adequately serving all areas of their delineated communities.

The examiners\u2019 latitude in interpreting standards, such as \u201cthe institution\u2019s ability to meet various community credit needs based on its financial condition and size, legal impediments, local economic conditions and other factors,\u201d resulted in examiners focusing on different parts of the guidance. In addition, since 1989, changes to the guidance for CRA examinations occurred more frequently than before and shifted emphasis from institutions\u2019 programs for managing CRA as part of day-to-day activities to the results of their CRA programs.

For example, bankers complained that community groups have used protests to needlessly delay the approval of applications. They noted that a satisfactory or outstanding CRA rating means nothing when a community group mounts a protest against expansion plans. Bankers charged that these groups use protests to further their own agendas regardless of an institution\u2019s lending record.", "Many bankers advocate safe harbors that would protect institutions from protests if the regulators have determined, through the examination process, that their CRA compliance is outstanding.

They pointed out that institutions with no plans for expansion and no fear of adverse publicity from a low CRA rating may not feel the need to commit significant resources to CRA compliance. To strengthen enforcement of the act, community groups have advocated regulator use of more stringent enforcement actions, such as cease-and-desist orders and civil money penalties.

The regulators attempted to clarify how various CRA ratings would affect decisions on applications filed by institutions for expansion or relocation of their deposit facilities. In particular, absent other information regarding CRA performance, the proposal stated that an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating would be given extra weight in reviewing a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating would generally be consistent with approval of the a \u201cneeds to improve\u201d rating would generally be an adverse factor and, absent demonstrated improvement in the institution\u2019s CRA performance or other countervailing factors, would result in denial or conditional approval of the application; and a \u201csubstantial noncompliance\u201d rating generally would be so adverse as to result in denial of the application.", "However, community group comments submitted to the regulators on this measure strongly protested that it constituted a safe harbor, and it was dropped in the October 1994 proposal.

Some concerns of bankers also will likely continue.

Training will be particularly important during implementation, as all CRA examiners will need comprehensive training in new examination standards and procedures that regulators will be issuing. Moreover, accurate and accessible data will continue to be critical for effective results-based assessments.

However, we also found that the regulators\u2019 previous attempts to ensure consistency by revising their examination guidance and training programs have not achieved consistent implementation.", "We found from our case studies that inconsistency resulted in part from examiners having had considerable discretion and assessing institutions differently because they focused on different parts of the examination guidance. These differences were particularly evident in examiners\u2019 assessment of factors that involved the most discretion, such as the factors relating to ascertainment of community credit needs and development of marketing and advertising programs. To illustrate, one of the more problematic factors has been judging the reasonableness of institutions\u2019 delineation of their service communities. Some bankers have been confused about how they should define their service community because they received conflicting direction from examiners. One banker said that he was told by one examiner not to include loan production offices in the bank\u2019s delineated community, but the next examiner told him that the offices should be included. Other bankers were asked by examiners to change the size of their delineated communities and were confused about whether the service area delineation should be based on definitive geographic boundaries, location of deposit facilities, or where the preponderance of loans were located. Under the revised regulations, examiners will spend less time assessing the reasonableness of an institution\u2019s delineated service community. However, examiners will continue to use discretion in determining whether an institution arbitrarily excludes areas, particularly low- and moderate-income areas.", "Both bankers and examiners have cited frequent changes in the focus of examinations as a reason for inconsistency. From the time CRA was enacted in 1977 to 1989, there were not many changes in the way CRA was implemented by the regulators. However, during the period 1989 through 1992, the regulators issued several policy statements with new guidance regarding CRA examinations.", "Among other things, a March 1989 statement focused examinations on the processes and efforts needed by institutions for a well-managed CRA program.", "Guidelines issued in May 1990 focused on implementation of requirements for public disclosure of CRA ratings, written examiner evaluations of institutions\u2019 CRA performance, and examiner use of a new four-tiered descriptive rating system mandated by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).", "A December 1991 policy statement established the need for institutions to analyze the geographic distribution of their lending patterns as a part of their CRA planning process. In March 1992, in an effort to achieve consistency in CRA evaluations, the regulators provided guidance on the inclusion of numerical data in public CRA evaluations, consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).", "Additional guidance provided in June 1992 shifted the focus of CRA examinations to performance or results, rather than the documentation of efforts. Despite the emphasis on performance over efforts, however, the same 12 assessment factors, which were largely process-oriented mixed with some lending measures, continued to be used as tools for measuring performance.", "Although the recent regulatory reforms will once again change the focus of examinations, the comprehensiveness of the reform\u2019s detailed review of the problems in CRA examinations and the overall agreement to focus on performance should help to improve consistency and reduce the need for major changes in the near future.", "Another frequently cited reason for inconsistency in CRA examinations has been insufficient examiner experience and training. Some community groups commented that there is not a sufficient level of expertise within the regulatory community about what constitutes an analysis of a community\u2019s credit needs, what constitutes a loan program that would actually meet credit needs, how time-consuming an analysis would be, and what is adequate performance. Some bankers also commented that examiners need to understand how credit needs can vary based on the characteristics of a specific community, particularly between urban and rural communities, and how institutions may meet community credit needs and their CRA obligations in different ways.", "The experience levels of the examiners have varied considerably among regulators. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has had a separate core of CRA compliance examiners since 1979, while the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) established such cores in 1989, 1990, and 1993, respectively. From 1992 to 1994, FDIC significantly expanded its compliance examination staff to about 300 examiners. From 1993 to 1994, OCC increased its examiner staff dedicated to compliance examinations from 94 to approximately 170 examiners, while about 110 OCC examiners will continue to perform both safety and soundness and compliance examinations. In addition, from 1991 to 1993, OTS increased its separate compliance examination staff from 82 to 105 compliance examiners.", "The amount of examiner training also has varied among regulators and by experience level\u2014ranging from none to advanced training specific to CRA and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Even within regulators, we were told that training availability differed by region or district and that some regulators supplemented classroom training through newsletters or self-study, computer-based courses. Although most examiners in our case studies said they have had instruction on CRA assessments as part of general entry-level training, many examiners commented that much of their training was on the job. Training needs that examiners identified included additional training in the use of HMDA and census data; regular seminars or refresher courses to provide updates and guidance on more advanced training for experienced examiners; more training on fair lending laws and new discrimination detection more focused training on skills such as data collection, computer analysis, and reading property appraisals; training with a focus on lenders\u2019 communities, safety and soundness issues, and new examination techniques; regular conferences or seminars where new and experienced examiners from different agencies can exchange information on examination techniques and experiences; and external training that includes perspectives of lenders\u2019 and community groups.", "The regulators have acknowledged that training is important to the success of the reforms and have indicated their intention to work together to improve examiner training. Some examiners told us that they would welcome more interagency training, which could help improve consistency among regulators. Past attempts to develop interagency training programs have had mixed success. Some regulators explained that interagency training did not always meet their different training needs because some regulators had examiners strictly devoted to CRA compliance examinations, while others had examiners perform both safety and soundness and compliance examinations. Recently, FRB\u2019s interagency training has included the specialized course on HMDA data analysis. Generally, however, each of the regulators has developed its own core CRA examination training programs.", "The magnitude of the changes in the CRA reforms, as well as the resulting increase in examiner responsibilities, created the need for clear guidance and comprehensive training for all examiners performing CRA examinations and thereby implementing the revised CRA regulations. Consistency in training would help to improve examination consistency among all regulators.

Some of the regulators have also acknowledged data quality problems, particularly with HMDA data, and have taken steps to improve the accuracy of HMDA data. However, while examination guidelines include procedures to assess HMDA data accuracy, they do not address the quality of other kinds of data used to assess performance, like other lending data or financial statistics. Moreover, the regulators do not have a uniform policy on what actions should be taken against institutions with poor data quality, and they have not been consistent in the actions they have taken to date.", "Bank management is primarily responsible for ensuring that data provided by the institution are accurate, and examiners are responsible for verifying data accuracy during examinations. Bankers and examiners in our case studies commented that some data problems are due to unclear reporting requirements, difficulties in determining correct geographic codes, incomplete data, and human and technical errors. Among the four regulators, FRB has done the most detailed analysis of HMDA data quality. From March 1993 to February 1994, the Federal Reserve District Banks participated in a survey to determine the quality of HMDA data submitted by state member banks for the year 1992 by cross checking each institution\u2019s HMDA Loan Application Register with its 1992 HMDA data submission. This survey confirmed FRB\u2019s long-standing concerns about HMDA data accuracy during this time period. As a result, FRB required one out of every five banks to resubmit its HMDA data for 1992. The most significant errors found in these examinations involved the loan applicant\u2019s reported income. Over half of all income-related errors were the result of banks reporting income figures from unverified application information. The other half consisted mostly of clerical errors. FRB staff said these high error rates are because, in most institutions, HMDA reporting is done by insufficiently trained clerks, with little review from more senior management. FRB amended the HMDA regulation (regulation C) in December 1994 to help improve HMDA data quality by clarifying and simplifying the reporting requirements.", "OTS officials said they have also taken action to address HMDA data quality problems. For 1992 data, the directors of OTS regional offices sent letters of reprimand to institutions with the worst data quality. For 1993 data, the Financial Reporting Division sent detailed logs of reporting accuracy and timeliness to the regional compliance managers for use in examinations. In addition, an OTS official noted that the regulators\u2019 interagency examination council, through its HMDA Subcommittee, has made recommendations to improve the examination of data quality, which are likely to be reflected in forthcoming revised HMDA examination procedures.", "Poor HMDA data quality was mentioned in some of the examination reports from our case studies. Some of these institutions were required to resubmit their data, while others were not. FRB officials stated that they generally require institutions with a 10 percent or greater error rate to resubmit their HMDA data. Other regulators did not have a specific policy on when resubmissions would be required. The FRB also recently announced that the institutions it supervises will be subject to the same monitoring and enforcement rules that are currently in place for other types of reports, such as Call Reports. Similarly, OTS stated in its comments to this report that it recently adopted guidelines for the assessment of civil money penalties against institutions that submit late or inaccurate HMDA data. Only FDIC has actually penalized institutions for not submitting their HMDA data on time. While these types of actions taken by regulators have helped to increase HMDA data reliability for the affected institutions, they do not ensure uniform or consistent reliability across the industry.", "Current compliance examination procedures include steps to check the accuracy and completeness of HMDA data. Similar data quality checks for any other data used to assess performance would, if effectively implemented, help to ensure that data used in assessments are accurate. For example, procedures could be established that require examiners to check for data deficiencies during examinations.

In addition, the report is also to include an evaluation of a bank\u2019s performance within a multistate metropolitan area where the banks have branches in two or more states within the area. The regulators are not certain if they would be required to review all of an institution\u2019s branches at the same time to complete the CRA examination.

Moreover, some of the regulators have begun testing new procedures to streamline CRA examinations and reduce examination time. While the revised CRA regulations have a goal to reduce bankers\u2019 regulatory burden, they will also clearly increase examiners\u2019 responsibilities. Currently, it is difficult to determine exactly what resources will be needed and how the regulators\u2019 current resources will change over the next 2 fiscal years. Therefore, the regulators will need to closely monitor implementation of the revised regulations and determine if further actions are needed to ensure that examiners can meet their responsibilities within the appropriate time frames.

Another significant barrier faced by bankers is the opportunity cost of community lending. The primary objective of a bank is to maximize profits for its shareholders. To the extent that community lending is believed to be inconsistent with that objective, community lending expenditures represent lost opportunities to achieve greater returns through more profitable activities.

Similar complaints have been made at focus group meetings sponsored by secondary market entities. The secondary market provides the mechanism for existing loans, marketable securities, and other assets to be sold to investors, either directly or through an intermediary. More specifically, the secondary mortgage market represents the national market where residential mortgages are assembled into pools and sold to investors. This market, which originated with such corporations as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, supplies additional liquidity to mortgage lenders.", "The single most important contribution of the secondary mortgage market is the creation of a national market for resale of residential mortgages. This ensures that mortgage originators, regardless of where they are located, have access to pools of capital managed by pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional buyers of mortgage-backed securities. Home buyers are assured an adequate supply of mortgage financing as the secondary market sales provide lending institutions with a constant source of new funds to make more home loans. Banks receive CRA credit for originating loans to particular low-income communities or individuals whether they sell the loans in the secondary market or hold them in their portfolio. Our interviews with bankers disclosed several concerns pertaining to the secondary market underwriting standards that some bankers believed pose a barrier and tend to restrict lending in low- and moderate-income areas. One primary concern was that institutions do not want to deviate from the secondary market standards because they want to be able to sell all their loans to the secondary markets. As one of the regulatory officials noted, if the secondary markets will not accept a loan, an institution is forced to keep the loan in its portfolio and assume the market and interest rate risk for the full life of the loan. Therefore, some institutions look for loans that do not have any nonconforming provisions or any questions about collateral. Other concerns raised included the following:", "A thrift regulatory official noted that one of the secondary market standards that can reduce flexibility is the requirement that no more than 36 percent of the borrower\u2019s salary can be used for loan payments. In an area with high housing costs, such as the San Francisco Bay area, these standards are very limiting. He said many people already pay 40 to 50 percent of their salary for rent and are probably able to continue to pay a high percentage in house payments.", "A bank management official of a large urban Chicago thrift said that Fannie Mae formulas or ratios represent the industry standard; however, he noted that he was not aware of empirical evidence that an applicant who does not meet these ratios cannot service the debt."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initiatives Designed to Address Secondary Market Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Some of the players in the secondary market have begun to recognize the problems associated with the underwriting standards and have initiatives under way that are intended to help alleviate some of these problems.

Congress has encouraged these corporations to support low- and moderate-income loans by setting specific volume goals over a 2-year period, which began in 1993. For example, for all the loans they purchase, 30 percent of the units financed must be for low-and moderate-income borrowers, 30 percent must be located in central cities, and $3.5 billion ($1.5 billion for Freddie Mac, $2 billion for Fannie Mae) must finance loans to low-income and very low-income home buyers.", "In announcing its initiatives in February 1994, Freddie Mac cited the potential effect of these initiatives on mortgage lending in inner cities as well as its efforts to broadly redefine creditworthiness. Officials of Freddie Mac stressed the fact that the clarifications do not represent a lowering of its standards but an effort to dispel misconceptions among originators of mortgage loans. Through meetings with lenders, appraisers, mortgage insurers, and others, the corporation was able to identify more than a dozen underwriting issues that were causing originators to needlessly deny credit in the belief that some particular factor would make a loan ineligible for a Freddie Mac pool. For example, numerous people thought that Freddie Mac did not want to purchase any loans extended to borrowers with one or two 30- or 60-day delinquencies in their credit histories. While recognizing that such a history could indicate a bad risk, Freddie Mac officials said that they now tell lenders that they may focus on the borrower\u2019s history of housing payments as well as consider explanations for the delinquencies.

Consequently, the overall benefits to be gained by the regulators as well as the community may not be as far reaching as they could be under a more systematic, coordinated approach to information sharing.", "Interagency coordination in the use of regulators\u2019 resources can expand or broaden the effectiveness of these resources in helping bankers to understand and implement various initiatives that have proven successful in meeting CRA goals, while providing much needed credit assistance to communities that may require revitalization or redevelopment. To the extent that regulators can apply a systematic, coordinated interagency approach to providing community outreach services that are commonly provided by all regulators\u2014such as community contact information or databases\u2014institutions, community groups, government entities, and others who benefit from such services could be more efficiently served despite the limited resources of regulators."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While some bankers perceive an inherent conflict between safety and soundness and CRA goals and are concerned about the secondary market requirements and/or higher transaction costs and smaller loan amounts associated with CRA lending, others have worked to overcome such barriers through individual and/or collective innovative and creative initiatives. Because lending and community development in low- and moderate-income areas often involve different and more complex methods of financing, successful initiatives tend to require the cooperative efforts and expertise of multiple financial partners.", "Given the recent emphasis on CRA reform and sparked by the need to remove perceived barriers and provide additional compliance incentives, program initiatives have been taken by the secondary market, governments, and Congress to provide financial and other incentives to promote community development and revitalization. The banking regulators have also played a key role in facilitating community lending by providing educational forums and disseminating information to encourage cooperative working relationships among banks and thrifts, other financial entities, community groups, and various government agencies. In this current climate of CRA reform and limited government resources, the regulators\u2019 role of encouraging institutions to meet the needs of all segments of their delineated communities will be a key factor in continuing and expanding upon workable and successful CRA initiatives. Given the differences in resource availability among the regulators, more systematic coordination could help to better utilize limited resources and enhance the regulators\u2019 role in encouraging community development lending.", "The varied positions taken by the affected parties further demonstrate that the debate about how best to achieve the goals of community reinvestment is both complicated and contentious. The approach embodied in the current CRA statute uses the levers of compliance examinations and application approvals to increase community reinvestment lending. The new regulations are an attempt to generate better results with less regulatory burden. However, given the positions of the different parties, it is not clear that the results will fully satisfy all of those parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If the concerns raised by the affected parties should persist even after the regulators have had sufficient time to implement the revised regulations, Congress may want to consider revisiting and revising the CRA statute to clarify its intent and scope, possibly examining alternative strategies for reaching its goals. Such strategies might include incentives to strengthen positive CRA performance by bankers and additional enforcement authority for regulators to discourage negative performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["With regard to the \u201cMatter for Congressional Consideration\u201d FDIC and OCC were concerned that congressional action before sufficient time has passed for full implementation of the revised regulations may be premature, and that further revisions to CRA without feedback on the effectiveness of the revised regulations could undermine their implementation. OTS noted that the agencies have already agreed to conduct a full review of the revised regulations 5 years after they are fully implemented. We agree that the regulators have made extensive efforts in revising the regulations to address the diverse concerns raised about the effectiveness of CRA. Consequently, we modified the matter for congressional consideration to suggest that Congress may want to consider the results from implementation of the revised CRA regulations in its deliberations as to whether the objectives of community reinvestment are being well served through the CRA statute and regulations."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
