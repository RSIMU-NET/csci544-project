Today, private and public sector entities frequently ask individuals for SSNs in order to conduct their businesses and sometimes to comply with federal laws. Although uses of SSNs can be beneficial to the public, SSNs are also a key piece of information in creating false identities either for financial misuse or for assuming an individual's identity. The retention of SSNs in the public and private sectors can create opportunities for identity theft. In addition, the aggregation of personal information, such as SSNs, in large corporate databases, as well as the public display of SSNs in various records accessed by the public, may provide criminals the opportunity to easily obtain this personal information.

We reported early this year that entities such as information resellers, consumer reporting agencies , and health care organizations routinely obtain SSNs from their business clients and public sources, such as government records that can be displayed to the public. These entities then use SSNs for various purposes, such as to verify individual's identity or match existing records, and have come to rely on the SSN as an identifier, which helps then determine a person's identity for the purpose of providing the services they offer. There is no single federal law that regulates the overall use or restricts the disclosure of SSNs by private sector entities. However, certain federal laws have helped to place restrictions on the disclosures of personal information private sector entities are allowed to make to their customers, and certain states have enacted laws to restrict the private sector's use of SSNs. Public sector entities also extensively use SSNs. All three levels of government use the SSN to comply with certain federal laws and regulations, as well as for their own purposes. These agencies rely on the SSN to manage records, verify benefit eligibility, collect outstanding debt, and conduct research and program evaluations. Despite their widespread reliance on and use of SSNs, government agencies are taking steps to safeguard the SSN. For example, some agencies are not using the SSN as the primary identification number. However, given the open nature of certain government records, SSNs appear in records displayed to the public such as documents that record financial transactions or court documents. Current GAO work under way for this subcommittee is focusing on the storage, display, and protection of SSNs in public records. Our preliminary survey data show that the types of records most likely to contain SSNs and be made available to the general public by state government entities are court records, death records, Uniform Commercial Code filings, and professional licensing records. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that responding state offices reported over 35 instances where they had no specific use for collecting SSNs.

Although the Social Security  Administration (SSA) originally created SSNs as a means to track workers\u2019  earnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits, over time the SSN has  come to be used for a myriad of purposes; individuals are frequently asked  to supply personal information, including their SSNs, to both public and  private sector entities. In addition, individuals\u2019 SSNs can be found in a  number of public sources such as records displayed to the public. Given  the uniqueness and broad applicability of the SSN, many private and  public sector entities rely extensively on the SSN sometimes as a way to  accumulate and identify information for their databases, sometimes to  comply with federal regulations, and other times for various business  purposes. The potential for misuse of the SSN has raised questions about  how private and public sector entities obtain, use, and protect SSNs.", "Although Congress has passed a number of laws to protect the security of  personal information, the continued use of and reliance on SSNs by both  private and public sector entities underscores the importance of  determining if appropriate safeguards are in place to protect individuals\u2019  private information or if enhanced protection of individuals\u2019 personal  information is needed. Accordingly, you asked us to talk about how  certain types of private and public sector entities obtain SSNs and what  protections, if any, exist to govern their use. My remarks today will focus  on describing (1) how private sector entities obtain, use, and protect SSNs  and (2) public sector uses and protections.", "To determine how private sector entities obtain, use, and protect SSNs, we  relied on our previous work that looked at how private sector entities  obtain and use SSNs and the laws that limit disclosure of this use. To  determine how the public sector uses and protects SSNs, we also relied on  our previous work that looked at the government\u2019s use and protection of  SSNs. We are currently conducting a survey of state and local agencies to  determine the extent to which SSNs are displayed in public records, the  types of records they are displayed in, and how those records are  maintained. In addition, we are conducting structured interviews of  federal agencies concerning the display of SSNs.", "In summary, entities such as information resellers, consumer reporting  agencies (CRAs), and health care organizations routinely obtain SSNs  from their business clients and from public sources, such as marriage  licenses, paternity determinations, and professional licenses.  Businesses  use SSNs for various purposes, such as to build databases, verify  individuals\u2019 identities, or match existing records. Given the various types  of services these companies offer, we found that all of these entities have  come to rely on the SSN as an identifier, which they say helps them  determine a person\u2019s identity for the purpose of providing the services  they offer. However, certain federal laws have helped to limit the  disclosures of personal information these private sector entities are  allowed to make to their customers. Private sector entities are either  subject to the laws directly, given the nature of their business, or  indirectly, through their business clients who are subject to these laws.  Some states have also enacted laws to restrict the private sector\u2019s use of  SSNs. However, such restrictions vary by state.", "Public sector entities also rely extensively on SSNs. These agencies often  obtain SSNs for compliance with federal laws and regulations and for their  own agencies\u2019 purposes. We found that federal, state, and county  government agencies rely extensively on the SSN to manage records,  verify benefit eligibility, collect outstanding debt, conduct research and  program evaluations, and verify information provided to state drivers\u2019  licensing agencies. Given that SSNs are often the identifier of choice  among individuals seeking to create false identities, these agencies are  taking steps to safeguard SSNs. Yet despite these actions, SSNs appear in  records displayed to the public such as documents that record financial  transactions or court documents.  In our current work for this  Subcommittee, we are looking at the storage, display, and protection of  SSNs in public records.

Through a process known as  enumeration, unique numbers are created for every person as a work and  retirement benefit record for the Social Security program. SSA generally  issues SSNs to most U.S. citizens, and SSNs are also available to  noncitizens lawfully admitted to the United States with permission to  work. SSA estimates that approximately 277 million individuals currently  have SSNs. The SSN has become the identifier of choice for government  agencies and private businesses, and thus it is used for a myriad of non- Social Security purposes.", "The growth in the use of SSNs is important to individual SSN holders  because these numbers, along with names and birth certificates, are  among the three personal identifiers most often sought by identity thieves.  In addition, SSNs are used as breeder information to create additional  false identification documents, such as drivers\u2019 licenses. Recent statistics  collected by federal agencies and CRAs indicate that the incidence of  identity theft appears to be growing.  The Federal Trade Commission  (FTC), the agency responsible for tracking identity theft, reported that  consumer fraud and identity theft complaints grew from 404,000 in 2002 to  516,740 in 2003. In 2003, consumers also reported losses from fraud of  more than $437 million, up from $343 million in 2002.  In addition, identity  crime account for over 80 percent of SSN misuse allegations according to  the SSA. Also, officials from two of the three national CRAs report an  increase in the number of 7-year fraud alerts placed on consumer credit  files, which they consider to be reliable indicators of the incidence of  identity theft. Law enforcement entities report that identity theft is almost  always a component of other crimes, such as bank fraud or credit card  fraud, and may be prosecuted under the statutes covering those crimes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Entities Routinely Obtain and Use SSNs, and Certain Laws Affect The Disclosure of This Information", "paragraphs": ["Private sector entities such as information resellers, CRAs, and health care  organizations routinely obtain and use SSNs.

Of the various public  sources available, large information resellers told us they obtain SSNs  from various records displayed to the public such as records of  bankruptcies, tax liens, civil judgments, criminal histories, deaths, real  estate ownership, driving histories, voter registrations, and professional  licenses. Large information resellers said that they try to obtain SSNs from  public sources where possible, and to the extent public record information  is provided on the Internet, they are likely to obtain it from such sources.  Some of these officials also told us that they have people that go to  courthouses or other repositories to obtain hard copies of public records.", "Additionally, they obtain batch files of electronic copies of all public  records from some jurisdictions.", "Given the varied nature of SSN data found in public records, some reseller  officials said they are more likely to rely on receiving SSNs from their  business clients than they are from obtaining SSNs from public records.  These entities obtain SSNs from their business clients, who provide SSNs  in order to obtain a reseller\u2019s services or products, such as background  checks, employee screening, determining criminal histories, or searching  for individuals. Large information resellers also obtain SSN information  from private sources. In many cases such information was obtained  through review of data where a customer has voluntarily supplied  information resellers with information about himself or herself. In  addition, large reseller officials said they also use their clients\u2019 records in  instances where the client has provided them with information.", "We also found that Internet-based resellers rely extensively on public  sources and records displayed to the public. These resellers listed on their  Web sites public information sources, such as newspapers, and various  kinds of public record sources at the county, state, and national levels.  During our investigation, we determined that once Internet-based resellers  obtained an individual\u2019s SSN they relied on information in public records  to help verify the individual\u2019s identity and amass information around the  individual\u2019s SSN.", "Like information resellers, CRAs also obtain SSNs from public and private  sources as well as from their customers or the businesses that furnish data  to them. CRA officials said that they obtain SSNs from public sources,  such as bankruptcy records, a fact that is especially important in terms of  determining that the correct individual has declared bankruptcy. CRA  officials also told us that they obtain SSNs from other information  resellers, especially those that specialize in obtaining information from  public records. However, SSNs are more likely to be obtained from  businesses that subscribe to their services, such as banks, insurance  companies, mortgage companies, debt collection agencies, child support  enforcement agencies, credit grantors, and employment screening  companies. Individuals provide these businesses with their SSNs for  reasons such as applying for credit, and these businesses voluntarily  report consumers\u2019 charge and payment transactions, accompanied by  SSNs, to CRAs.", "We found that health care organizations were less likely to rely on public  sources for SSN data. Health care organizations obtain SSNs from  individuals themselves and from companies that offer health care plans.  For example, subscribers or policyholders provide health care plans with  their SSNs through their company or employer group when they enroll in  health care plans. In addition to health care plans, health care  organizations include health care providers, such as hospitals. Such  entities often collect SSNs as part of the process of obtaining information  on insured people. However, health care officials said that, particularly  with hospitals, the medical record number rather than the SSN is the  primary identifier.", "Information resellers, CRAs, and health care organization officials all said  that they use SSNs to verify an individual\u2019s identity. Most of the officials  we spoke to said that the SSN is the single most important identifier  available, mainly because it is truly unique to an individual, unlike an  individual\u2019s name and address, which can often change over an  individual\u2019s lifetime. Large information resellers said that they generally  use the SSN as an identity verification tool. Some of these entities have  incorporated SSNs into their information technology, while others have  incorporated SSNs into their clients\u2019 databases used for identity  verification. For example, one large information reseller that specializes in  information technology solutions has developed a customer verification  data model that aids financial institutions in their compliance with some  federal laws regarding \u201cknowing your customer.\u201d We also found that  Internet-based information resellers use the SSN as a factor in determining  an individual\u2019s identity. We found these types of resellers to be more  dependent on SSNs than the large information resellers, primarily because  their focus is more related to providing investigative or background-type  services to anyone willing to pay a fee. Most of the large information  resellers officials we spoke to said that although they obtain the SSN from  their business clients, the information they provide back to their  customers rarely contains the SSN. Almost all of the officials we spoke to  said that they provide their clients with a truncated SSN, an example of  which would be xxx-xx-6789.", "CRAs use SSNs as the primary identifier of individuals, which enables  them to match the information they receive from their business clients  with the information stored in their databases on individuals. Because  these companies have various commercial, financial, and government  agencies furnishing data to them, the SSN is the primary factor that  ensures that incoming data is matched correctly with an individual\u2019s  information on file. For example, CRA officials said they use several  factors to match incoming data with existing data, such as name, address,  and financial account information. If all of the incoming data, except the  SSN, match with existing data, then the SSN will determine the correct  person\u2019s credit file. Given that people move, get married, and open new  financial accounts, these officials said that it is hard to distinguish among  individuals. Because the SSN is the one piece of information that remains  constant, they said that it is the primary identifier that they use to match  data.", "Health care organizations also use the SSN to help verify the identity of  individuals. These organizations use SSNs, along with other information,  such as name, address, and date of birth, as a factor in determining a  member\u2019s identity. Health care officials said that health care plans, in  particular, use the SSN as the primary identifier of an individual, and it  often becomes the customer\u2019s insurance number. Health care officials said  that they use SSNs for identification purposes, such as linking an  individual\u2019s name to an SSN to determine if premium payments have been  made.  They also use the SSN as an online services identifier, as an  alternative policy identifier, and for phone-in identity verification. Health  care organizations also use SSNs to tie family members together where  family coverage is used, to coordinate member benefits, and as a cross- check for pharmacy transactions. Health care industry association officials  also said that SSNs are used for claims processing, especially with regard  to Medicare. According to these officials, under some Medicare programs,  SSNs are how Medicare identifies benefits provided to an individual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Laws Limit the Private Sectors\u2019 Disclosure of Personal Information That Includes SSNs", "paragraphs": ["Certain federal and state laws have placed restrictions on certain private  sector entities use and disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information that  includes SSNs.

As shown in table 1, the laws either restrict the disclosures that  entities such as information resellers, CRAs, and health care organizations  are allowed to make to specific purposes or restrict whom they are  allowed to give the information to. Moreover, as shown in table 1, these  laws focus on limiting or restricting access to certain personal information  and are not specifically focused on information resellers. See appendix I  for more information on these laws.", "We reviewed selected legislative documents of 18 states and found that at  least 6 states have enacted their own legislation to restrict either the  display or use of SSNs by the private sector. Notably, in 2001, California  enacted Senate Bill (SB) 168, restricting private sector use of SSNs.  Specifically, this law generally prohibits companies and persons from  certain uses such as, posting or publicly displaying SSNs and printing  SSNs on cards required to access the company\u2019s products or services.  Furthermore, in 2002, shortly after the enactment of SB 168, California\u2019s  Office of Privacy Protection published recommended practices for  protecting the confidentiality of SSNs. These practices were to serve as  guidelines to assist private and public sector organizations in handling  SSNs.", "Similar to California\u2019s law, Missouri\u2019s law (2003 Mo. SB 61), which is not  effective until July 1, 2006, bars companies from requiring individuals to  transmit SSNs over the Internet without certain safety measures, such as  encryption and passwords. However, while SB 61 prohibits a person or  private entity from publicly posting or displaying an individual\u2019s SSN \u201cin  any manner,\u201d unlike California\u2019s law, it does not specifically prohibit  printing the SSN on cards required to gain access to products or services.  In addition, Arizona\u2019s law (2003 Ariz. Sess. Laws 137), effective January 1,  2005, restricts the use of SSNs in ways very similar to California\u2019s law.  However, in addition to the private sector restrictions, it adds certain  restrictions for state agencies and political subdivisions. For example,  state agencies and political subdivisions are prohibited from printing an  individual\u2019s SSN on cards and certain mailings to the individual. Last,  Texas prohibits the display of SSNs on all cards, while Georgia and Utah\u2019s  laws are directed at health insurers and, therefore, pertain primarily to  insurance identification cards. None of these three laws contain the  provisions mentioned above relating to Internet safety measures and  mailing restrictions.

For example, the Internal  Revenue Code and regulations, which govern the administration of the  federal personal income tax program, require that individuals\u2019 SSNs serve  as taxpayer identification numbers. A number of other federal laws  require program administrators to use SSNs in determining applicants\u2019  eligibility for federally funded benefits. The Social Security Act requires  individuals to provide their SSNs in order to receive benefits under the  SSI, Food Stamp, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Medicaid  programs. In addition, the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986  requires the use of SSNs to identify individuals and established the  Commercial Driver\u2019s License Information System, a nationwide database  where states may use individuals\u2019 SSNs to search the database for other  state-issued licenses commercial drivers may hold. Federal law also  requires the use of SSNs in state child support programs to help states  locate noncustodial parents, establish and enforce support orders, and  recoup state welfare payments from parents. The law also allows states  to record SSNs on many other state documents, such as professional,  occupational, and marriage licenses; divorce decrees; paternity  determinations; and death certificates, and to make SSNs associated with  these documents available for state child support agencies to use in  locating and obtaining child support payments from noncustodial parents.", "Government agencies use SSNs for a variety of reasons. We found that  most of these agencies use SSNs to administer their programs, such as to  identify, retrieve, and update their records. In addition, many agencies also  use SSNs to share information with other entities to bolster the integrity of  the programs they administer. As unique identifiers, SSNs help ensure that  the agency is obtaining or matching information on the correct person.", "Government agencies also share information containing SSNs for the  purpose of verifying an applicant\u2019s eligibility for services or benefits, such  as matching records with state and local correctional facilities to identify  individuals for whom the agency should terminate benefit payments. SSNs  are also used to ensure program integrity. Agencies use SSNs to collect  delinquent debts and even share information for this purpose. In addition,  SSNs are used for statistics, research, and evaluation. Agencies  responsible for collecting and maintaining data for statistical programs  that are required by statute, make use of SSNs. In some cases, these data  are compiled using information provided for another purpose. For  example, the Bureau of the Census prepares annual population estimates  for states and counties using individual income tax return data linked over  time by SSN to determine immigration rates between localities. SSNs also  provide government agencies and others with an effective mechanism for  linking data on program participation with data from other sources to help  evaluate the outcomes or effectiveness of government programs. In some  cases, records containing SSNs are sometimes matched across multiple  agency or program databases.", "Finally, government agencies use employees\u2019 SSNs to fulfill some of their  responsibilities as employers. For example, personnel departments of  these agencies use SSNs to help them maintain internal records and  provide employee benefits. In addition, employers are required by law to  use employees\u2019 SSNs when reporting wages. Wages are reported to SSA,  and the agency uses this information to update earnings records it  maintains for each individual. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also  uses SSNs to match the employer wage reports with amounts individuals  report on personal income tax returns. Federal law also requires that  states maintain employers\u2019 reports of newly hired employees, identified by  SSNs.

For example, the Social Security Administration has  truncated individuals\u2019 SSNs that appear on the approximately 120 million  benefits statements it mails each year.

SSA has formed a task force to address weaknesses in its  enumeration process and has (1) increased document verifications and  developed new initiatives to prevent the inappropriate assignment of SSNs  to noncitizens, and (2) undertaken initiatives to shift the burden of  processing noncitizen applications from its field offices. SSA also helps  prevent the proliferation of false identities through its verification service,  which allows state driver licensing agencies to verify the SSN, name, and  date of birth of customers with SSA\u2019s master file of Social Security  records. Finally, SSA has also acted to correct deficiencies in its  information systems\u2019 internal controls. These changes were made in  response to the findings of an independent audit that found that SSA\u2019s  systems were exposed to both internal and external intrusion, increasing  the possibility that sensitive information such as SSNs could be subject to  unauthorized access, modification, and disclosure, as well as the risk of  fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Records Can Also Be a Source of SSNs", "paragraphs": ["Given the open nature of certain government records, SSNs appear in  these records for a number of reasons.

Our preliminary  survey data show that the types of records most likely to contain SSNs and  be made available to the general public by state government entities are  court records, death records, UCC filings, and professional licensing  records. At the local level, court records and land records are those most  often cited as containing SSNs and being available to the general public.  Preliminary data analysis indicates that identity verification is the most  frequently given reason by both state and local respondents for collecting  or using SSNs that are in records available to the public.

However, restrictions on access or use may make it  more difficult for businesses and government agencies to verify an  individual\u2019s identity. Accordingly, policy makers will have to balance  restrictions on the use of SSNs on the one hand with legitimate needs for  the use of SSNs on the other.", "Although individuals may choose to provide their SSNs to public and  private sector entities to obtain their services, individuals are often  required to have their SSNs in records that may ultimately be displayed to  the public. Such public display of personal information can create  opportunities for identity crimes. Safeguarding SSNs in records displayed  to the public offers an additional challenge because of the inherent tension  between the nature of public records, that is, the need for transparency in  government activities, and the need to protect individuals\u2019 privacy. For  this reason, in prior work, we recommended that Congress convene a  representative group of officials to develop a unified approach to  safeguard SSNs used in all levels of government and particularly those  displayed in public records.

In turn, consumers have the  right to limit some, but not all, sharing of their nonpublic personal  information. Financial institutions are permitted to disclose consumers\u2019  nonpublic personal information without offering them an opt-out right in  the following circumstances:  to effect a transaction requested by the consumer in connection with a  financial product or service requested by the consumer; maintaining or  servicing the consumer\u2019s account with the financial institution or another  entity as part of a private label credit card program or other extension of  credit; or a proposed or actual securitization, secondary market sale, or  similar transaction;   with the consent or at the direction of the consumer;  to protect the confidentiality or security of the consumer\u2019s records; to  prevent actual or potential fraud, for required institutional risk control or  for resolving customer disputes or inquiries, to persons holding a legal or  beneficial interest relating to the consumer, or to the consumer\u2019s fiduciary; to provide information to insurance rate advisory organizations, guaranty  funds or agencies, rating agencies, industry standards agencies, and the  institution\u2019s attorneys, accountants, and auditors; to the extent specifically permitted or required under other provisions of  law and in accordance with the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, to  law enforcement agencies, self-regulatory organizations, or for an  investigation on a matter related to public safety; to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit  Reporting Act or from a consumer report reported by a consumer  reporting agency; in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer, or  exchange of all or a portion of a business if the disclosure concerns solely  consumers of such business;  to comply with federal, state, or local laws; an investigation or subpoena;  or to respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities.", "Financial institutions are required by GLBA to disclose to consumers at  the initiation of a customer relationship, and annually thereafter, their  privacy policies, including their policies with respect to sharing  information with affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.", "Provisions under GLBA place limitations on financial institutions  disclosure of customer data, thus affecting some CRAs and information  resellers. We found that some CRAs consider themselves to be financial  institutions under GLBA. These entities are therefore directly governed by  GLBA\u2019s restrictions on disclosing nonpublic personal information to non- affiliated third parties. We also found that some of the information  resellers we spoke to did not consider their companies to be financial  institutions under GLBA. However, because they have financial  institutions as their business clients, they complied with GLBA\u2019s  provisions in order to better serve their clients and ensure that their  clients are in accordance with GLBA. For example, if information resellers  received information from financial institutions, they could resell the  information only to the extent that they were consistent with the privacy  policy of the originating financial institution.", "Information resellers and CRAs also said that they protect the use of non- public personal information and do not provide such information to  individuals or unauthorized third parties. In addition to imposing  obligations with respect to the disclosures of personal information, GLBA  also requires federal agencies responsible for financial institutions to  adopt appropriate standards for financial institutions relating to  safeguarding customer records and information.

These officials also said that information obtained from a  consumer\u2019s motor vehicle record has to be in compliance with DPPA\u2019s  permissible purposes, thereby restricting their ability to resell motor  vehicle information to individuals or entities not allowed to receive such  information under the law.
