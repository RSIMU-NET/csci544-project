To avoid a failure, members agreed to lower expectations for the meeting. The Hong Kong ministerial resulted in modest agreements on a narrow range of agricultural and development issues. Ministers made little progress on the broader Doha negotiating agenda, including two other U.S. priorities--services and nonagricultural market access. Nevertheless, WTO members renewed their resolve to successfully conclude the Doha Round by the end of 2006 and set new interim deadlines under a compressed schedule to meet that goal. Critical decisions that will determine each member's cuts in tariffs and other barriers were due April 30 and July 31, 2006, but the April 30 deadline will be missed. WTO members continue to profess commitment to accomplish the ambitious agenda set at Doha. However, with nearly all tough decisions put off, the tension between members' original high ambitions and the U.S. TPA timeframe has become acute. Since the Hong Kong ministerial, members have taken concrete steps to help build consensus. Yet, the ongoing impasse on core areas such as agriculture, and the difficult political decisions needed to resolve it, cause many experts to be skeptical.

Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the WTO administers agreed-upon  rules for international trade, provides a mechanism for settling disputes,  and serves as a forum for conducting trade negotiations. WTO membership  has increased since 1995, and there are currently 149 WTO member nations  and customs territories that are diverse in terms of economic development;  these members negotiate individually or as a member of a group of  countries (see table 1 for some of the major country groupings). While the  WTO has no formal definition of a \u201cdeveloping country,\u201d the World Bank  classifies 105 current WTO members\u2014or approximately 72 percent\u2014as  developing countries; 32 of these members are officially designated as  \u201cleast-developed countries\u201d (LDCs). USTR negotiates on behalf of the  United States in WTO negotiations.", "The WTO ministerial conference held in Hong Kong, China, from December  13\u201318, 2005, was the sixth since the establishment of the WTO in 1995.  These ministerial conferences, convened at least every 2 years, bring  together trade ministers from all WTO members. The outcome of a  ministerial conference is reflected in a fully agreed-upon ministerial  declaration. The substance of these declarations guides future work by  outlining an agenda and deadlines for the WTO until the next ministerial  conference. Decisions in the WTO are made by consensus\u2014or absence of  dissent\u2014among all members, rather than by a simple majority. Periodic  \u201cmini-ministerials,\u201d or informal meetings among small groups of selected  WTO members, are often used to advance dialogue on issues.", "At the Hong Kong conference, ministers sought to make progress in the  ongoing multilateral trade negotiations, officially known as the Doha  Development Agenda. Formally launched at the fourth WTO ministerial  conference in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001, the negotiations are the  latest in a series of global trade talks (negotiating rounds) dating back  nearly six decades. They are intended to reduce trade barriers and  facilitate the free flow of commerce throughout the world. A major  objective of the Doha negotiations is development\u2014that is, to help  developing countries realize the economic benefits of trade and enable  them to take advantage of trading opportunities.", "The Doha ministerial declaration established a work program with a  number of negotiating areas and set the goal for concluding the  negotiations by January 1, 2005. Of the 16 current negotiating areas,  market access in agriculture, services, and nonagricultural (industrial)  products (NAMA) are the three U.S. priorities. WTO members set specific  goals for each area and set up various negotiating groups to achieve them.  In agriculture, the Doha work program commits countries to lower barriers  in world agricultural markets and sets forth three pillars for agricultural  trade reform: export competition (subsidies), domestic support (subsidies  and other assistance to farmers), and market access (tariffs). Agriculture  remains the top issue for many participants and has been described as the  lynchpin of the Doha negotiations. Lack of progress in liberalizing  agriculture is partly due to the fact that it was first added to the trading  system in the last (Uruguay) round, which left high subsidies and tariff  barriers in place. Doha negotiations in services aim to ensure increased  transparency and predictability of rules and regulations governing services  and to promote liberalization of service markets. The goal of the NAMA  negotiations is to reduce or eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The  agriculture and NAMA negotiations involve first reaching agreement on  \u201cmodalities\u201d\u2014the formulas, thresholds, dates, and other numerical  benchmarks that members will commit to meet when they revise their  WTO schedules of subsidy and tariff commitments. This guidance then is  translated into national tariff schedules specifying what tariff will be  charged on each product. Members are then \u201cbound\u201d not to exceed these.", "Concluding the round will require simultaneous agreement on all issues,  because WTO members have agreed it will be a package deal (or \u201csingle  undertaking\u201d in WTO parlance). As a result, trade-offs are expected to  occur among issues to accomplish an overall balance satisfactory to all  members. When it is final, the trade agreement will impose legally binding  international obligations on WTO members governing the trade barriers  they are allowed to maintain (such as tariffs) and the trade rules by which  they must abide. Failure to comply is subject to binding dispute settlement  and possible trade retaliation.", "To date, the negotiations have progressed fitfully. Our January 2004 report  explained the factors that caused the September 2003 Canc\u00fan ministerial to  collapse in acrimony and confusion, including sharp North-South  (developed-developing country) divisions on key issues. For example,  developing countries rejected the proposed U.S. and EU reductions in  agricultural subsidies as inadequate, but the United States and the EU felt  developing countries were not contributing to reform by agreeing to open  their markets. Moreover, many developing countries remained dissatisfied  with proposed responses to their demands for special treatment and for  relief from difficulties they were still experiencing in implementing existing  WTO obligations. In 2004, the Doha Round negotiations started again on an  uncertain note; however, political leadership, intensified dialogue, and a  series of conciliatory gestures resulted in WTO members adopting an  agreement on key issues in the negotiations known as the \u201cJuly framework  agreement,\u201d which is credited with achieving sufficient progress on  agriculture to put the global trade talks back on track and reopen  discussion of other issues. The main features of the framework agreement  were to establish key principles for each aspect of global agricultural trade  reform; identify the key elements of negotiations to improve  nonagricultural market access; stress the importance of liberalizing access  to services markets and addressing outstanding development concerns;  and launch negotiations to clarify and improve WTO rules on customs procedures (trade facilitation). WTO members also agreed to hold their  next ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005. However, our last report  noted that, despite the improved negotiating atmosphere, the negotiations  were effectively 2 years behind schedule and considerable work remained  on the numerous issues that would constitute a final agreement. Pursuant  to the Trade Act of 2002, in March 2005, the president requested a 2-year  extension of TPA, and the extension went into effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Progress Since Mid-2004 Causes WTO Members to Recalibrate Goals for Hong Kong", "paragraphs": ["Despite the impetus provided by the framework agreement, the Doha  negotiations moved slowly throughout 2005.

However, limited progress was made  before the Hong Kong ministerial, as the talks stalled in fall 2005 amid  stalemate over fundamental issues on agriculture and NAMA. To avoid  another failed meeting, such as at the last ministerial in Canc\u00fan, Mexico,  expectations for the Hong Kong ministerial were lowered. The agenda for  the meeting shifted from making key decisions on the six core areas to  focusing on narrower initiatives, particularly in agriculture and  development, that could help the talks move forward, if only marginally  (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Technical Progress Achieved but Key Milestones Missed", "paragraphs": ["In early 2005, at a mini-ministerial meeting in Davos, Switzerland, and  subsequently at a February meeting among all WTO members, WTO  members agreed that the goal of the Hong Kong ministerial was to set the  stage for the final phase of the Doha negotiations, which would enable the  round to conclude in 2006. To that end, they agreed to seek to finalize  modalities for both the agriculture and NAMA negotiations at Hong Kong,  and to make significant progress in four other core areas\u2014services, trade  facilitation, development issues, and WTO rules (which covers subjects  such as subsidies, antidumping measures, and regional trade agreements).  Deliverables in these six areas are critical in determining how ambitious  the Doha Round will be in terms of cuts in tariffs, subsidies, and other  barriers to trade, as well as the ultimate balance across member interests  and issues.", "Despite these ambitious goals, the overall pace of the negotiations was  slow throughout most of 2005, and even progress on technical issues was  difficult to achieve. For example, in the agriculture and NAMA talks,  negotiators were able to agree on a preliminary basis to methodologies for  converting specific tariffs into ad valorem equivalents (tariffs based on a  percentage of value), a necessary step before potential tariff reductions  could be calculated and considered. However, reaching this agreement for  agriculture proved to be contentious and occupied the negotiators\u2019 time  through early May, delaying the discussion of more central issues such as  how to make tariff and subsidy cuts. On many issues, negotiators made  incremental progress by narrowing the number of options under  consideration or fleshing out principles or methods without coming to full  agreement. On NAMA, for example, a list of products to be covered by the  negotiations was compiled, but there was disagreement about including  some items, and no agreement on whether the list should be considered  definitive or just a guideline.", "In 2005, WTO members missed the key milestones they had set to keep the  talks on schedule for completion at the end of 2006 (see fig. 2). In the  services negotiations, many WTO members failed to submit offers for  opening their markets to foreign services-providers by a May 2005 deadline.  Just before the ministerial, the services negotiating group chair reported  having 69 initial and 30 revised offers, but 23 members had not yet  submitted any offer. In addition, the chair described many of the offers as  disappointing, because they did not provide new market access or bind  access at existing levels. In development, the negotiating group made little  progress toward a July 2005 deadline to prepare recommendations to  improve special and differential treatment. WTO members also missed an  informal but important milestone to reach agreement in July 2005 on a  \u201cfirst approximation\u201d of the modalities for agriculture, NAMA, and other  issues, which negotiators had hoped to finalize at the Hong Kong  ministerial. As deadlines were missed during the spring and summer of  2005, WTO\u2019s then-Director-General warned negotiators that the talks were  not moving fast enough to reach this goal. In early July, the Director- General stated flatly that \u201cthese negotiations are in trouble,\u201d adding that  WTO members faced \u201ca crisis of immobility\u201d that threatened their ability to  deliver decisions at the Hong Kong ministerial.", "We noted in our last report that U.S. and EU leadership has been essential  to making progress in the WTO trade negotiations and that relations  between their newly appointed trade principals could influence success at  Hong Kong. However, a number of events made the leadership transition  and U.S.\u2013EU relations more difficult in 2005. A gap of several months  occurred between the time when then-current U.S. Trade Representative  Robert Zoellick was nominated Deputy Secretary of State in early January  2005 and when his replacement, Rob Portman, was confirmed in late April  by the Senate as the new Trade Representative. At that time, a U.S.\u2013EU  aircraft dispute was flaring, and influential U.S. congressmen took umbrage  at comments by the new EU Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson,  directed at U.S. policies on cotton subsidies. In addition, some U.S.  negotiators were also occupied with finalizing the Dominican Republic\u2013 Central America\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement and ensuring its  approval by Congress, which was finally secured on July 28, 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries Still Divided over Toughest Issues in Fall 2005", "paragraphs": ["Fundamental divisions among WTO members became very clear in the fall  of 2005 when members found themselves deadlocked over conflicting  market access goals. In October, key members and country coalitions put  forth detailed agriculture proposals that were intended to re-energize the  negotiations and resolve key issues before the Hong Kong ministerial. The  United States; the EU; the Group of 20 (G-20) coalition of developing  countries; and the Group of 10 (G-10)\u2014a coalition of primarily developed  countries that import most of their food\u2014laid out their positions on cutting  agricultural subsidies and tariffs and what they expected in return from  trading partners. The differences among these parties\u2019 positions were  particularly evident in their approaches to market access (see table 2). The  U.S. proposal centered on an offer to cut U.S. domestic farm subsidies  substantially, along with aggressive tariff cuts ranging from 55 to 90 percent  for all developed countries. However, the offer was contingent on higher  subsidy cuts and \u201cambitious\u201d market access improvements by other  countries, particularly the EU and the G-20. Many WTO members received  the proposal as a significant effort to unblock the negotiation, but some  countries were doubtful that the proposed subsidy cuts were as substantial  as billed. The EU proposed smaller agricultural tariff cuts, with more  exemptions for protecting \u201csensitive\u201d products from competition from  imports. This offer was contingent on certain concessions from other  members, notably substantial market opening in NAMA and services from  the more advanced developing countries of the G-20, especially Brazil and  India. The G-20 proposal on agricultural market access, submitted earlier in  the year, was presented as a middle ground, as the suggested tariff cuts for  developed countries fell between the U.S. and EU proposals.", "The EU\u2019s market access offer became the focus of criticism before the  ministerial, as neither the United States nor the G-20 considered it  acceptable. They demanded that the EU cut its tariffs further and reduce  the number of sensitive products that would be exempted from the  standard tariff cuts. USTR noted that the EU\u2019s proposal would allow for  tariff cuts of as little as 20 percent on about four-fifths of EU tariff lines.  Also, according to USTR, the EU could effectively limit competition from  imports, due to the large number of sensitive products it had proposed to  shield from liberalization (about 142 tariff lines). Although the EU revised  its offer at the end of October 2005, it was again quickly rejected as  insufficient.", "The EU held the stance in the Doha Round that its chief gains were to be  found in the industrial and services sectors underpinning its economy.  Specifically, the EU wanted countries such as India and Brazil to offer real improvements in access to their industrial and services markets. EU  members had already agreed to reform the EU\u2019s domestic support  programs and to eliminate export subsidies as part of the framework  agreement and believed they had gotten little in return. In internal  consultations in late October, France warned the EU negotiating team that  it should not overstep its mandate, which in its view was strictly tied to  existing agricultural subsidy spending and the 2003 reform of the EU\u2019s  Common Agricultural Policy, by making concessions in the negotiations  that would not be acceptable to EU member states.", "The stand-off continued, as Brazil and India refused to make improved  NAMA or services offers until the EU made a better agricultural market  access offer. As leaders of the G-20, Brazil and India complained that the  EU wanted developing countries to accept much lower tariffs in NAMA  than it was willing to offer in agriculture\u2014an export area where many  developing countries have a competitive advantage. They insisted that  developed countries\u2019 market access offers in agriculture be proportional to  the market access demanded of developing countries in NAMA and  services. However, the EU said its offer was not only final, but conditional,  and would be withdrawn if demanders persisted in seeking \u201csomething for  nothing\u201d\u2014or in the EU Trade Commissioner\u2019s words, \u201creal cuts by Europe,  paper cuts by others.\u201d", "Despite the intense focus on agriculture, negotiations continued on  industrial goods and services trade, but the knotty conflicts we reported  last year continued to impede their progress. On NAMA, negotiators circled  around the problem of what tariff reduction formula to use, with signs of  potential agreement on a \u201cSwiss\u201d formula that would even out tariff levels by cutting higher tariffs more than lower ones. However, negotiators  could not agree on the type of Swiss formula to use and the selection of  coefficients that would determine the reductions for developed and  developing countries. In addition, the treatment of unbound tariffs was  not settled, and the degree to which developing countries would have the  flexibility to deviate or exempt products from the formula was  controversial. On services, negotiators were stalled over proposals to alter  the bilateral negotiating format, speed the pace of the negotiations, and  encourage greater participation and better market access offers by more  countries. Suggestions included the use of numerical targets, with  members covering a certain percentage of service sectors in their offers,  and a plurilateral negotiating approach whereby groups of countries  collectively present \u201crequests\u201d to other groups of countries for market  access improvements and then the recipient countries reply with market  access \u201coffers\u201d to the demanding countries. However, developing countries  criticized these suggestions as overly prescriptive, and a constraint on their  freedom to opt out of services liberalization or selectively liberalize  sectors.", "The trade facilitation negotiations made good progress throughout the  year, as did the negotiations on rules, but remained at the stage of exploring  proposals versus bridging gaps in positions. Trade facilitation negotiators  put forward a large number of proposals for expediting the movement of  traded goods, and developing countries participated actively. Negotiations  on various trade \u201crules\u201d intensified, with the debate focusing on the divide  between the traditional and new users of trade remedy laws (measures  used to counter unfairly priced and subsidized imports)\u2014including the  United States\u2014and non-users that have called for significant change in  users\u2019 antidumping and countervailing duty regimes. Rules negotiators  conducted in-depth discussions of such proposed changes and narrowed  the list of issues somewhat, according to U.S. officials. While proposals  aimed at U.S. practice remain a concern, U.S. officials report that  proponents had difficulty justifying or gaining consensus for their more  radical proposals. Rules negotiators also considered U.S. proposals to  improve transparency and due process in trade remedy proceedings and  made progress on developing new disciplines on subsidies (including fish  subsidies) and transparency for regional trade agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Goals Lowered for December 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial", "paragraphs": ["The flurry of activity in October gave way to the realization in November  that the gaps between key negotiating positions were still too wide for  negotiators to reach any major decisions by December, and the agenda for  Hong Kong was scaled back. New WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy,  whom members had installed that fall with hopes that his energetic style  might bring negotiators to decisions more quickly, had begun his term by  declaring that his goal for Hong Kong was to take the Doha negotiations  \u201ctwo thirds of the way\u201d to conclusion. By early November 2005, Lamy  concluded that members had not bridged their differences enough to draft  texts with specifics on modalities in the core negotiating areas and urged  members to \u201crecalibrate\u201d their expectations for the ministerial. He  suggested that members focus on what could reasonably be achieved,  rather than risk a failure reminiscent of previous ministerials in Canc\u00fan  and Seattle. The text for a Hong Kong ministerial declaration should thus  try to capture progress or any decisions made since the framework  agreement and provide a range of numbers (or \u201couter parameters\u201d) to  indicate how other decisions had been clarified, if not narrowed down.  Members recognized that no one would be served by presenting the  ministers with an overly full and unresolved agenda. They agreed to focus  on what was achievable, while stressing they remained committed to an  ambitious outcome for the round.", "The agenda for Hong Kong quickly changed to reflect these scaled-back  expectations and focus on several development issues. Lamy called for the  ministerial to deliver on several narrow measures to benefit the 32 LDCs  that are WTO members. In addition, the EU and certain developing  countries voiced the view that an \u201cearly harvest\u201d on development issues  was important symbolically. Immediately before the ministerial, the Group  of 90 (G-90)\u2014a coalition of the African Union; the LDCs; and the African,  Caribbean, and Pacific Group\u2014issued a statement reminding WTO  members that the Doha ministerial declaration had placed the needs and  interests of developing countries at the heart of the Doha Round and that  they expected concrete benefits from Hong Kong. India and other  developing-country coalitions made similar statements. The EU Trade  Commissioner emphasized the importance of making a \u201cdown payment\u201d on  the trade agreement to the poorest countries at Hong Kong. He stated that  the Doha negotiations were a development round and \u201cnot an agricultural  exporters\u2019 round,\u201d leading the U.S. Trade Representative and key members  of Congress to question whether the EU\u2019s efforts to shift the focus to  development were somewhat self-serving.", "The draft declaration text, as transmitted in early December for  consideration at the ministerial, contained few provisions for new  agreements to be made at Hong Kong. The provisions included calling on  ministers to adopt decisions on five LDC proposals and to set new  deadlines for completing modalities and other aspects of the negotiations.  Annexes to the draft text on the six core negotiating areas represented full  agreement by WTO members in only one area\u2014trade facilitation.

However, they did not address the  underlying differences on agricultural market access and made little  progress on other areas in the agriculture negotiations.", "First and most significantly, members agreed to eliminate all forms of  agricultural export subsidies on a parallel basis by 2013. Reaching  consensus on this deadline proved to be difficult, however. The EU, the  largest user of agricultural export subsidies, insisted on progress in  developing parallel disciplines on export credit programs, state trading  enterprises, and other aspects of export competition before agreeing on a  deadline to end export subsidies. On the other hand, the G-20 and other  major agricultural exporters, including the United States, wanted a 2010  deadline for abolishing agricultural export subsidies before turning to other  export competition issues. Heated debate on an export subsidies deadline  continued throughout the ministerial, with Brazil reportedly threatening to  pull out of the talks at one point. The compromise adopted involved a  commitment to eliminate a substantial part of the export subsidies in  phases by the end of 2010 if an agreement enters into force in January 2008.", "Second, negotiators devoted considerable time to discussing whether in- kind food aid distorts international commodities markets, but they failed to  reach consensus on this issue. The EU maintains that in-kind food aid is  trade-distorting and represents a form of export subsidy. At Hong Kong, EU  negotiators sought a commitment from other members to phase out in-kind  food aid and to move toward an international system of cash-only  assistance that would allow countries in need to purchase food from the  most convenient and commercially viable sources. The United States,  however, as the main provider of in-kind food aid, resisted this move,  arguing that in-kind food is often critical in emergencies such as famines  and natural disasters. The ministerial declaration deferred setting  disciplines on food aid until April 30, 2006, in conjunction with the adoption  of overall modalities for agriculture. The ministers did agree to certain  principles, including a guarantee that such disciplines would include a  mechanism, called a \u201csafe box,\u201d to ensure the availability of food for needy  populations in emergency situations.", "Third, negotiators in Hong Kong also addressed the demands raised by a  group of four African countries, known collectively as the Cotton Four   (C-4). Since the Canc\u00fan ministerial, the C-4 countries have sought to bring  attention to the plight of African farmers, who face falling international  prices for cotton and diminishing opportunities in overseas markets. At  Hong Kong, the C-4 countries, supported by others, obtained a commitment  by developed countries to eliminate all forms of export subsidies for cotton  in 2006. This provision, aimed primarily at the United States, coincides with  existing U.S. plans to eliminate cotton export subsidies by that time. The  C-4 also obtained a commitment from developed countries to provide duty- free, quota-free access for cotton exports from least-developed countries  when the agreements resulting from the Doha negotiations are  implemented. Moreover, the C-4 secured a new commitment that the  overall Doha agreement on agriculture would entail deeper and faster cuts  in domestic cotton subsidies relative to cuts in domestic support for  agricultural commodities in general.", "The Hong Kong ministerial declaration reflects more limited progress on  several other agricultural issues. On the domestic support pillar, the  declaration contained a new commitment to ensure that the total of all  trade-distorting domestic support to farmers must be reduced, possibly  involving cuts beyond those agreed to for specific categories of farm  payments\u2014known as \u201cboxes\u201d in WTO parlance. The declaration also  adopted a framework with three levels or \u201cbands\u201d for reducing domestic  farm subsidies, which were based on the amount of financial support  provided by members. The United States would fall in the middle of these  bands, along with Japan, while the EU would be in the top band, and other  countries that provided domestic support to farmers would be in the lowest  band. Members in the higher bands would be expected to make deeper  cuts. Similarly, in the market access pillar, the declaration reflects  convergence on an arrangement calling for four bands for tariff reductions,  with higher cuts for higher tariffs. Finally, the Hong Kong declaration noted  that developing countries will be granted additional flexibility to protect  their domestic agricultural production by self-designating special products  and having access to a volume- and price-based special safeguard  mechanism to protect against import surges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Proposals on Development Issues Were also Adopted at Hong Kong", "paragraphs": ["The Hong Kong ministerial conference also devoted substantial attention to  certain development issues.

Among  these proposals was a controversial initiative to secure duty-free, quota- free access to developed countries\u2019 markets. LDCs, supported by the EU,  had sought complete duty-free, quota-free access for all of their products.  However, the United States opposed this initiative for various reasons,  including the fact that, as proposed, the initiative exceeded the current U.S.  statutory authority, which sets conditions on preferential market access to  protect U.S. commercial interests and to advance certain U.S. policy goals.  U.S. Trade Representative Portman also indicated that numerous  developing countries that do not qualify for LDC status had raised concerns  about being disadvantaged in the U.S. market. In the end, the compromise  called for duty-free and quota-free access for at least 97 percent of tariff  lines of developed countries\u2019 imports from LDCs, and for steps to be taken  to achieve complete coverage thereafter.

Since the talks  resumed in late January 2006, negotiators have been engaged in a flurry of  activities designed to speed up the process and find practical ways to  narrow their differences. These include holding a series of mini- ministerials among small groups of WTO members and intensified bilateral  consultations, setting more interim deadlines, developing questionnaires  and reference papers to advance dialogue, and conducting simulations on  the effects of tariff cuts under various scenarios. In February, Director- General Lamy indicated that these activities represented a needed shift  from general principles to discussion of concrete numbers and text, and  were resulting in a heightened awareness of the need for movement by all  players, in concert, toward a middle ground. At that time, he stated that he  had no indication that agreeing on modalities would not be possible by  April 30, 2006.

Agricultural reform in particular has largely been kept out of  regional agreements and would need to involve the present WTO  protagonists to be meaningful. Some estimates, as reported in a  Congressional Research Service report, indicate that economic gains  could be as high as $574 billion globally and $144 billion in the United  States. Other estimates are more modest. For example, a 2005 World  Bank study projects global gains ranging from $84 billion to $287 billion  annually by the year 2015, while a Carnegie Endowment study predicts  income gains of $40 to $60 billion from what it deems plausible outcomes  of the Doha Round. Although this represents a small share of global and  U.S. income, some economists and development advocates argue that  global trade liberalization\u2014particularly of agricultural products and other  products of interest to developing countries\u2014could still play a role in  promoting economic opportunity and alleviating poverty. For example, the  additional income would equal or surpass aid flows to developing  countries, and leading developing country exporters such as Brazil, India,  China, Thailand, and Argentina would stand to capture sizeable gains.", "Nevertheless, such projected overall gains can mask important differences,  and several authoritative studies suggest that some groups and nations face  potential losses and near-term adjustment costs that merit particular  consideration in the negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clearer Outlines of a Grand Bargain Enable Concerted Effort", "paragraphs": ["Another factor that could facilitate reaching agreement in the negotiations  relates to the outlines of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d (the necessary trade-offs, or  benefits and concessions, among the players) that, according to some  observers, are becoming more apparent.

The  United States, for example, is expected to make further reductions to its  domestic agricultural subsidies and clarify how it will handle  countercyclical payments to compensate farmers for low commodity  prices, and the EU is expected to reduce its domestic agricultural  subsidies and cut agricultural tariffs. In return, large developing countries  such as Brazil, India, and China are expected to lower barriers to  agriculture, industrial goods, and services sufficiently to create new market  opportunities.

In  mid-February, and again in late March, U.S. Trade Representative Portman  remarked that the negotiations have largely lost the momentum generated  by the United States\u2019 October 2005 proposal on agriculture. According to  WTO Director-General Lamy, the United States, the G-20, and the Cairns  Group regard the EU\u2019s market access offer as inadequate. Since Hong  Kong, the EU has held firmly to its position that its October 2005 offer is  serious and that others must first make concrete and commercially  meaningful proposals in areas of interest to the EU before it would even  contemplate improvements in its offer. According to the EU, these would  restore needed \u201cbalance\u201d among the key players\u2019 market access interests.  However, it remains unclear whether the European Commission has the  flexibility to improve its October offer. In fact, a March 2006 memo to the  European Commission signed by 13 of its 25 member nations stated that  the EU\u2019s October 2005 offer \u201cexhausted and may have exceeded\u201d all the  room for maneuver they had on domestic support and market access, and  that even improved offers on NAMA and services would not justify an  improvement. The United States also faces pressure from many WTO  members to improve and clarify its agricultural offer, particularly on  domestic support. Brazil and India, negotiating on behalf of the G-20,  maintain that until there is more movement on agriculture, they will not  negotiate reciprocal concessions on the other core issues\u2014namely NAMA  and services. They also insist that any cuts in NAMA and services must be  proportional to those by developed countries on agriculture and that, in  general, developed countries should cut their tariffs more than developing  countries. As a result, they argue, developed-country demands for across- the-board cuts that harmonize tariff levels across countries and bring  developing-country tariffs below presently applied rates are excessive. A  group of 11 developing countries that includes Brazil and India recently  stressed that they need flexibility to shield products from liberalization so  that they can pursue industrial policies and manage structural adjustment.  A March mini-ministerial among six key players\u2014the EU, the United  States, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and India\u2014failed to yield breakthroughs.

In addition, the political timing of elections  scheduled for 2006 in several countries, including the United States, the  EU, and Brazil, could make concessions at this time even more difficult.", "In the United States, 2006 is a congressional election year, and Congress  already seems to be divided on support for further trade liberalization.  Faced with increasing trade deficits, heightened competition from China,  and workers\u2019 displacement as jobs move overseas, the approval of free  trade agreements has become a difficult proposition. Congressional  deliberations on the Dominican Republic\u2013Central America Free Trade  Agreement in 2005 were extremely contentious, and it passed Congress by  only two votes. U.S. Trade Representative Portman has attempted to  rebuild bipartisan consensus on U.S. trade policy. However, some leaders  in Congress have publicly stated that unless the United States gains  significant market access on agriculture, NAMA, and services\u2014particularly  in the large developed and developing nations that U.S. business groups  have identified as liberalization priorities\u2014they will not agree to a deal.", "Timing is sensitive for other reasons as well. For example, most provisions  of the present U.S. farm bill expire in September 2007, and Congress will  begin work on the legislation to reauthorize U.S. farm programs in 2006.  Congressional leaders want to take into account the framework likely to  emerge from the WTO negotiations when drafting a bill, in part to avoid  exposing farmers to the uncertainty associated with WTO challenges to  U.S. programs. However, some are skeptical that a WTO agreement will be  completed in time and urge the drafting of legislation independent of WTO  negotiations. Other congressional members and some farm organizations  advocate the extension of the current farm bill until the outcome of the  Doha negotiations is clear. In the meantime, certain members of Congress  have urged the administration not to \u201ctie their hands\u201d in drafting a new  farm bill and have asked executive branch agencies to coordinate closely  with congressional committees to ensure that they can work with any  result being negotiated at the WTO.", "Other key players also face political constraints. The EU\u2019s current political  problems range from member states\u2019 rejection of the EU constitution to  violent protests by disaffected immigrants and youths. One expert recently  noted that EU budget negotiations in December did not deliver an  agreement to cut back on the EU\u2019s agricultural support spending, as some  EU members such as the United Kingdom had hoped. Instead, only  agreement to review spending in 2008-2009 was achieved. France, in  particular, has been adamant in its opposition to any further EU  concessions on agriculture in the WTO negotiations, but it is not alone. EU  Commissioner Mandelson has recently affirmed that the EU member states  are united in insisting that all main parties to the talks should be prepared  to offer more to get more in the talks, while stressing that others need to  offer more in areas of interest to the EU. Brazil will hold presidential  elections in the fall of 2006; however, its negotiating strategy is not  expected to change. In its powerful role as leader of the G-20 and as one of  the nations with the most to gain from the negotiations, Brazil is likely to  hold fast to its position that any movement on NAMA and services will be  proportional to (and dependent on) what it achieves in agriculture. India\u2019s  new government has kept its markets open to certain imports, but remains  reticent about commitments to liberalize its agriculture and industrial  markets further; the government\u2019s stance is attributed to the perceived  benefits of retaining \u201cpolicy space\u201d for development, and concerns that its  many small domestic producers would be unable to withstand heightened  competition from China and other foreign nations. Several officials stated  that they believe China\u2019s rise as a manufacturing and export power has  made many nations wary of committing to cut tariffs at the WTO. China, in  turn, has not played a visible role in pressing for liberalization in the Doha  negotiations.", "These political constraints have led some observers and stakeholders to  propose high-level political intervention to break the impasse. Notably,  some trade experts and at least two heads of state have suggested a \u201ctrade  summit\u201d at which national leaders from key countries such as the EU, the  United States, Brazil, and India could meet to make the commitments  necessary in the core negotiating areas and break the impasse. In early  March, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Brazilian President Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva issued a public call for such a WTO summit. On the one  hand, they recognize that this action would require commitment to  strengthening the world\u2019s economy and global trading system at a time  when protectionist tendencies may be on the rise. Yet, they argue that the  risks of letting the Doha talks fail or languish in uncertainty would be  contrary to members\u2019 and the institution\u2019s best interests. U.S. officials offer  mixed reactions to the idea of a \u201ctrade summit\u201d: some think a leaders\u2019  meeting may be desirable if the ministers\u2019 efforts fail, and others question  its usefulness.

Keeping to the deadlines is critical if the  major issues are to be dealt with and necessary steps completed, according  to U.S. and WTO officials. However, the track record for meeting deadlines  in these negotiations is not promising. We noted in our last report that the  talks were unlikely to conclude before December 2006, which would be 2  years after the originally established deadline of January 2005. Indeed,  most interim deadlines in the negotiations have been repeatedly deferred.", "Even if a political breakthrough on agriculture were to be achieved, U.S.  and WTO officials agree that finalizing each country\u2019s schedule of WTO  commitments on agriculture, NAMA, and services would be time- consuming, with little margin for missed deadlines (see fig. 3 for a timeline  of negotiation deadlines in 2006). First, members must make up for lost  time after missing the critical deadline of April 30, 2006, for agreeing to  modalities in agriculture and NAMA. This means they must agree on the  formulas, thresholds, dates, and other numerical benchmarks that  members will be committed to meet when they revise their current WTO  commitments. However, to finalize these commitments, a host of technical  issues fraught with political and practical implications must be addressed.  In February 2006, for example, the chairman of the negotiating group on  agriculture presented a list of 70 questions that he believed would need to  be addressed to complete modalities. In mid-March, a U.S. official told us  that WTO members had been focusing on about 15 modalities issues but  had not come close to compromise on any. In NAMA, meanwhile, the  negotiating chair identified 14 issues in his March 27 report that still need  work to finalize modalities\u2014particularly the tariff reduction formula,  treatment of unbound tariffs, and flexibilities for developing countries. The  list did not include how to interpret the linkage between ambition in  agriculture and NAMA established at Hong Kong, which has since been the  topic of heated debate.", "Second, once modalities are agreed to, the United States and other  members must take a series of important and time-consuming steps to  reach a final agreement. For example, members must draft revisions of  their national tariff schedules to indicate how they intend to meet their  modalities commitments for each product or tariff line. The draft  commitment schedules in agriculture and NAMA are to be completed by  July 31, 2006. A U.S. official told us that only when the draft schedules are  submitted will other members see which products will be liberalized. Then,  a process of verifying schedules, finalizing sectoral agreements, and  bargaining among individual members (known as \u201crequest\u2013offer\u201d) begins.  According to U.S. officials, verification is critical because the modalities  text will allow different interpretations of commitments, and only  countries\u2019 national schedules are legally binding. They said that most  experienced observers agree that this process is vital to achieving intended  results and may require 6 to 8 months to complete. Even if the current  schedule for submitting schedules is met, little time would remain in 2006  to do this work.", "Third, as indicated in table 3, before and after an agreement is finally  entered into, the United States must take certain steps to comply with TPA.  The president must notify and solicit input from Congress and ask the  International Trade Commission (ITC) for an assessment of the  agreement\u2019s likely impact on the U.S. economy and specific industries  before signing an agreement. The agreement itself must be entered into  before July 1, 2007. Once an agreement is entered into, the U.S.  administration would have to draw up an implementing package that would  include implementing legislation and a plan, known as a statement of  administrative action, to carry out the agreement under existing law; this is  likely to be a laborious effort, according to U.S. officials. The  implementation package for the Uruguay Round, for example, filled  hundreds of pages. U.S. officials said the plan must specify how existing  U.S. programs, regulations, and legislation will be adjusted to comply with  WTO commitments. The implementing package, one official noted, must  also contain a series of reports (e.g., an analysis of how the agreement  serves U.S. commercial interests) and a description of how the agreement  meets TPA-mandated negotiating objectives.", "Fourth, a series of other complex and difficult issues that are crucial to  some members may need to be resolved before a final WTO agreement is  possible; however, WTO members have largely postponed dealing with  them until after the core issues are resolved. This sequential approach\u2014 putting off some issues until other issues are decided\u2014puts further stress  on the time available to conclude an agreement. For example, a variety of  developing-country concerns and calls for changes to WTO rules in areas  such as antidumping, trade facilitation (customs reform), and services are  on the agenda; several of these issues may prove intractable. The cross- cutting issue of erosion of preferences illustrates the complexities. A  number of WTO members are small developing countries with economies  dependent on one or two commodity exports. Currently, some of them rely  heavily on the preferential tariff treatment they receive for their exports in  the EU, the United States, and other developed countries. As a result, they  regard reducing worldwide tariffs as a clear threat to their economic well- being. Yet foregoing or delaying the benefits of multilateral liberalization so  these countries can retain their preferred access is not acceptable to many  other WTO nations.

The fact  that all members continue to be engaged in efforts to accomplish this task  is a positive sign; if the political will can be found to accommodate each  others\u2019 ambitions and produce an acceptable \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d then it would  be difficult but not impossible to conclude the Doha Round successfully  within the TPA timeframe. However, the limited progress to date and the  significant amount of work remaining has raised questions about the  feasibility of an ambitious outcome by the 2006 deadline, particularly  without more active leadership from the highest levels. A January poll of  negotiators, policy makers, and experts located in Geneva and key country  capitals revealed that none of the Geneva respondents believe WTO  members will meet their goal for completing the negotiations in 2006 and  only 2 percent of all respondents believed they would meet the April 30  modalities deadline. Moreover, the officials and experts we consulted  believe that by July 2006, it will be clear whether the goal of completing an  agreement within the TPA timeframe can be met. Backloading modalities  on agriculture and NAMA to July would, however, \u201cguarantee failure,\u201d  according to WTO Director-General Lamy. These concerns have led  numerous experts and observers to suggest that there may be different  outcomes, including (1) no results in the round, (2) negotiations continuing  beyond mid-2007 with uncertain results, or (3) conclusion of the round  with modest results within the TPA timeframe. Each involves trade-offs. 1. No results in the round. At Davos in late January, the EU Trade  Commissioner was quoted as stating that so little was being offered by  other countries that the EU would stand to lose next to nothing if the Doha  negotiations failed. (His official remarks since then, however, emphasize  the EU\u2019s commitment to Doha\u2019s success, while stressing the need for  reciprocity.) In February, WTO Director-General Lamy indicated that  without sufficiently ambitious results, there will be no Doha outcome. U.S.  Trade Representative Portman has said the United States is committed to  doing everything it can to bring an agreement together. Yet he added that if  the Doha negotiations are not concluded by the end of 2006, \u201cthere is a real  danger the Doha Round could drift into a long, unpredictable period of  stagnation.\u201d Some analysts and business groups also warn the round has  gone off course for lack of political will, and accepting various premises for  avoiding liberalization; they say that a pause or collapse would be better  than reaching a \u201cbad deal.\u201d Yet a complete collapse of the Doha Round is  generally seen as the least desirable outcome by observers, who believe  that members will try to avoid total failure because so much is at stake. In  addition to forfeiting the economic and welfare gains expected from Doha\u2019s  successful conclusion, WTO Director-General Lamy and numerous  observers warn that failure to achieve agreement may pose risks to the  credibility of the WTO as an effective or even relevant institution. Although  the WTO itself\u2014with its extensive set of binding commitments and vast  coverage in terms of country membership and world trade volume\u2014would  no doubt continue, experts caution that Doha\u2019s failure could strain the  global trading system. For example, Director-General Lamy has expressed  the view that developing countries, particularly the smallest and weakest,  would be among the biggest losers. Others say one potential outcome of a  failed round could be the proliferation of regional and bilateral trade  agreements, further weakening the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d principle\u2014the  concept of equal treatment for all members that is a pillar of the  multilateral trading system. The United States has already announced its  intention to move vigorously in 2006 to negotiate new bilateral and regional  agreements. In fact, some in Congress have encouraged the United States  to pursue bilateral free trade agreements with countries such as Korea, in  part to encourage countries that are resisting liberalization at the WTO to  take notice. Other WTO functions, such as the legitimacy of the dispute  settlement system, also could be weakened. 2. Negotiations continue beyond mid-2007 with uncertain results.  Another possible outcome would be to continue the talks in the hope of a  more robust outcome at a later date. Experts note that past rounds have  taken longer than originally planned, and the last round\u2014which involved  fewer countries\u2014took 7.5 years to complete. However, because of the  importance of TPA for U.S. ratification, it is unclear whether countries  would choose to continue negotiations without TPA or let the negotiations  pause until TPA is extended or renewed. One scenario would be to  continue the negotiations without TPA, with the hope that TPA is  eventually renewed, although congressional observers believe that  extension or renewal of TPA is an uncertain and difficult proposition in the  near term. A second scenario would be to put the negotiations on hold for  an indefinite time until TPA is extended or renewed. Some experts think  that renewal or extension of TPA would probably have a better chance if it  were linked to an extension of the U.S. farm bill or if the Doha negotiations  showed potential of concluding with an ambitious result. Because of these  uncertainties, the difference between outright failure of the round and  continuing or suspending the negotiations may only be clear after some  years have passed.  3. Concluding the round with modest results within TPA\u2019s timeframe.  This scenario would avoid the risks of outright failure and the uncertainty  inherent in continuing the talks beyond mid-2007. However, a modest  outcome may not be acceptable to many WTO members as it may not  include sufficient gains to offset the costs; or\u2014in trade negotiators\u2019  language\u2014the agreement would not result in a \u201cbalanced package.\u201d EU  Trade Commissioner Mandelson stated publicly early in 2006 that the EU  would \u201creluctantly settle\u201d for a minimalist outcome, but WTO Director- General Lamy said a \u201ccheap round is not an option,\u201d and U.S. Trade  Representative Portman quickly rejected \u201cDoha-lite\u201d as falling short of  success and being difficult to promote domestically. In addition, a more  modest package would leave countries with more ambitious goals little  alternative but to pursue other avenues for liberalization, such as bilateral  agreements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["WTO members undertook an ambitious set of goals when they launched  the Doha Development Agenda more than 4 years ago. Our May 2005 report  ended by noting that some of the experts we had consulted were confident  that an ambitious, balanced outcome of the round could be attained\u2014if  2005 resulted in sufficient progress. Other experts warned that hard  decisions were necessary and time was short if an outcome living up to  Doha\u2019s promises were to be achieved. Progress in 2005 through the Hong  Kong ministerial, however, was considerably less than WTO members  hoped. With nearly all tough decisions put off until 2006, the tension  between members\u2019 original high ambitions and the TPA time frame has  become acute. This is evident in the increasing divide between the official  statements of WTO members and the expectations of experts on whether  the round can be completed before TPA\u2019s expiration on July 1, 2007. U.S.  officials often call the Doha Round a \u201conce in a generation opportunity\u201d  because the last global trade round took a decade to launch and complete  and another decade to implement. WTO Director-General Lamy recently  stressed that WTO members will soon face the \u201cmoment of truth\u201d for the  Doha Round. In part for this reason, some observers expressed dismay at  the timing of the president's announcement that he was nominating U.S.  Trade Representative Portman to be Director of the Office of Management  and Budget. At press time, WTO Director-General Lamy had just announced  the April 30 modalities deadline would be missed, necessitating a shift to  continuous text-based negotiations in the coming weeks. He urged  members to deal coolly and constructively with the situation, avoiding  recrimination and showing fresh determination to accelerate progress.   With just over a year left to produce an agreement that qualifies for TPA, it  remains unclear whether the WTO can create an environment where  members perceive it is in their interest to make the significant changes in  their current positions, and other decisions, that cumulatively would fulfill  the vision of the Doha Development Agenda."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the U.S. Trade  Representative, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce,  and the Secretary of State, or their designees.
