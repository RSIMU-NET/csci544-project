In 1987, 30-year Treasury bond rates appeared to have both of these characteristics. However, the Department of the Treasury stopped issuing new 30-year Treasury bonds in 2001. Actuaries and other pension experts have proposed a number of alternative interest rates, including alternatives based on interest rates set in various credit markets--including composite rates for long-term Treasury securities, long-term high-quality corporate bond indices, 30-year rates on securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, 30-year interest rate swap rates--and PBGC interest rate factors based on surveys of insurance company group annuity purchase rates. Each alternative has attributes that may make it more or less suitable as an interest rate for the calculation of current liabilities, PBGC premiums, and lump-sum amounts. Additionally, the relationship of any interest rate to the underlying group annuity purchase rates may change over time and, unless the relationship is periodically evaluated, the Congress may be unable to appropriately respond to those changes. If the alternative interest rate selected to replace the current statutory rate immediately results in a higher interest rate level, which is likely, it would generally lower participant lump-sum amounts, lower minimum employer funding requirements, and reduce PBGC premium revenue. However, if the alternative interest rate produces a lower interest rate level, plan participants would generally receive larger lump sums, some employers would need to increase contributions to their plans, and PBGC may experience an increase in revenue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, groups representing employers with defined benefit plans  expressed concern that low interest rates were affecting the  reasonableness of their pension calculations. Under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and the  Internal Revenue Code (IRC), these calculations affect how much  employers are allowed or required to contribute to their pension plans,  how much employers must pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (PBGC) for federal insurance of the benefits promised by the  plan, and how much plan participants receive when pension benefits are  distributed in a lump sum. When making such calculations, the laws  require that employers use interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds, or  interest rates that are based on 30-year Treasury bond rates. Specifically,  the laws require employers to use    an interest rate from within a permissible range of a 4-year weighted  average of 30-year Treasury bond rates to calculate a plan\u2019s total liability,  termed the plan\u2019s current liability, and to use that calculation to assess its  funding level. If plans are funded below certain thresholds as defined in  the IRC, employers are to determine minimum contribution amounts on  the basis of those assessments. If a plan is fully funded as defined in the  law, employers are precluded from making additional tax-deductible  contributions to the plan.  the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds to assess a plan\u2019s funding level  and, if required, pay an additional premium, termed the variable-rate  premium, to PBGC for federal insurance of their plan\u2019s benefits.  the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds to determine the minimum and  maximum values of lump-sum distributions, and whether a benefit can be  distributed as a lump sum without a participant\u2019s consent. When  determining the minimum lump-sum distribution payable, the 30-year  Treasury rate is the highest rate that an employer can use in making the  calculation.", "Generally, the interest rates specified in the law were intended, within  certain parameters, to reflect the price an insurance company would  charge to take responsibility for the plan\u2019s pension payments. The price  that insurance companies would charge employers for this service reflects  current interest rates, the expected mortality and retirement rates of  participants for the plans they are considering, and the insurance  companies\u2019 expected expenses and required profit. These factors may be  expressed as a single rate, called the group annuity purchase rate, which is  the interest rate underlying the actual group annuity price. In the late  1990s, when fewer 30-year Treasury bonds were issued and economic  conditions increased demand for the bonds, the 30-year Treasury rate  diverged from other long-term interest rates, an indication that it also may  have diverged from group annuity purchase rates. In 2001, Treasury  stopped issuing these bonds altogether, and in March 2002, the Congress  enacted temporary measures to alleviate employer concerns that low  interest rates on the remaining 30-year Treasury bonds were affecting the  reasonableness of the interest rate for employer pension calculations. To  help the Congress decide what, if any, additional measure to take, you  asked us to determine: (1) what characteristics of an interest rate would  make it suitable for determining current liability and lump-sum amounts;  (2) what alternatives to the current interest rate might be considered; and  (3) how using an alternative rate might affect plan participants, employers,  and PBGC.", "To determine the characteristics of a suitable interest rate, we reviewed  pension laws and their legislative history with respect to the calculation of  current liability and lump-sum amounts. We also interviewed Labor,  Treasury, and PBGC officials who might play a role in assessing alternative  interest rates. To identify and examine the advantages and disadvantages  of potential alternative interest rates, we interviewed representatives and  reviewed documents from a number of government, actuarial, pension  plan sponsor, and investment entities. We also compared rates and other  market statistics for suggested alternative debt securities with rates for   30-year Treasury bonds from 1987 to 2002. To determine how alternative  rates might affect employers, plan participants, and PBGC, we created  hypothetical examples, based on discussions with actuaries and pension  consultants, in which we tested the effect of changes in rate levels on  current liabilities and lump-sum payments. We did not assess alternative  methods for specifying interest rates. For example, we did not assess  whether the interest rate for current liability calculations should be  specified as a 4-year weighted average or current market rate.

At a 6-percent interest rate, for example, a promise  to pay $1.00 per year for the next 30 years has a present value of about   $14. If the interest rate is reduced to 1.0 percent, however, the present  value of $1.00 per year for the next 30 years increases to about   $26 because the $26, when invested, will earn the relatively small income  associated with a 1-percent interest rate. Therefore, lower interest rate  assumptions result in higher current liability and lump-sum amounts.", "The interest rate appropriate for measuring the present value of a plan\u2019s  pension liabilities may differ depending on a number of factors, including  the purpose of the measurement. For example, the interest rate  appropriate for measuring the present value of a plan\u2019s pension liabilities  on an ongoing basis may reflect the assumed rate of return that the plan is  expected to achieve on the investment of its assets. On the other hand,  the interest rate appropriate for measuring the present value of that same  plan\u2019s pension liabilities at plan termination may reflect interest rates  implicit in annuity purchase rates.", "Before ERISA, few rules governed the funding of defined benefit plans,  and there were no guarantees that participants would receive promised  benefits. When the pension plan of a major automobile manufacturer  failed in the 1960s, for example, thousands of defined benefit plan  participants lost their pensions. As part of ERISA, the Congress  established PBGC to pay pension benefits in the event that an employer  could not. In addition to establishing PBGC, ERISA and IRC require  employers to make minimum contributions to under-funded plans and  prevent employers from making tax-deductible contributions to plans  exceeding specified funding limits. \u201c. . . the determination of whether an interest rate is reasonable depends on the cost of  purchasing an annuity sufficient to satisfy current liability. The interest rate is to be a  reasonable estimate of the interest rate used to determine the cost of such annuity,  assuming that the cost only reflected the present value of the payments under the annuity  (i.e., and did not reflect the seller\u2019s profit, administrative expenses, etc.). For example, if an  annuity costs $1,100, the cost of $1,100 is considered to be the present value of the  payments under the annuity for purposes of the interest rate rule, even though $100 of the  $1,100 represents the seller\u2019s administrative expenses and profit.

In  1994, IRC was amended to reduce the upper limit of the permissible range  of interest rates from 10 percent to 5 percent above weighted average  rate. The House Report accompanying the bill stated that the 1987  legislation was intended to address the chronic under-funding of pension  plans that had persisted since passage of ERISA. However, when  measuring current liability, plans could decrease contributions by  choosing an interest rate at the high end of the range. According to the  report, the highest allowable interest rate was reduced to 105 percent to  minimize a plan\u2019s ability to decrease its current liability through the choice  of interest rates.", "Additionally, in 1994, IRC was amended to require that employers  determine the minimum value of certain optional forms of benefit, such as  lump sums, using an interest rate no higher than the interest rate for   30-year Treasury bonds. To prevent employers from exceeding the  maximum lump-sum payment specified by law, IRC also required  employers to use an interest rate no lower than 30-year Treasury bond  rates when calculating lump sums for certain highly paid employees.

To  terminate a defined benefit plan, an employer determines the benefits that  have been earned by each participant up to the time of plan termination  and purchases a single-premium group annuity contract from an insurance  company, under which the insurance company guarantees to pay the  accrued benefits when they are due. The insurance company determines  the employer\u2019s premium by analyzing participant demographics and  making assumptions about a number of variables, including:    Interest rates.

Rates reflect current market rates for the securities in  which the company is likely to invest the premium paid by the plan:  generally fixed income securities, such as corporate bonds and mortgage- backed securities, with a relatively low credit risk. Interest rate  assumptions may vary according to a number of factors at plan  termination, including the projected cash flow of the plan and the yield  curve on relevant securities.(See app. II.)

Because insurance companies tend  to invest in long-term corporate debt, these rates may track changes in  group annuity purchase rates. An industry representative said that an  unadjusted average of the indices would reflect insurance company  expenses and other group annuity pricing factors because insurance  companies typically achieve a higher rate of return on investment than is  indicated by high-quality corporate bond rates. For example, investing in  lower-quality bonds and private loans might achieve a higher rate of return  than investing in high-quality corporate bonds. According to some  actuaries, however, the indices would need to be adjusted for insurance  company expenses and other factors before they would reflect the level of  group annuity purchase rates. For example, a study for the Society of  Actuaries said that a long-term corporate bond index rate minus 70 basis  points would reasonably approximate group annuity purchase rates.  However, the ERISA Industry Committee recommended using an average  of corporate bond indices published by four firms as the interest rate  without such an adjustment.

Second, swap contracts typically use the London  Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) as the floating rate, and the LIBOR has a low  credit risk. The overall credit quality underlying LIBOR-based, interest-rate  swap rates is likely comparable to that of high-quality corporate bonds.

The identity of insurance companies surveyed and  included in PBGC factors is not known, raising ambiguity about the extent  to which the PBGC interest rate factors reflect the current broad market  for group annuities. Additionally, PBGC calculations are not reported or  independently reviewed. However, an insurance company representative  said that insurance companies participating in the survey would likely  agree to have that participation reported, and a PBGC official said that  PBGC would not object to an independent review of its methodology for  developing the interest rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternatives Likely to Decrease Lump-Sum Payments, Employer Contributions, and PBGC Revenue", "paragraphs": ["If the alternative results immediately in a higher allowable interest rate,  which is likely for the alternatives we reviewed, using the higher rate  would generally decrease minimum allowable lump-sum amounts and  increase the number of participants whose benefit could potentially be  distributed as a lump sum without their consent, decrease minimum and  maximum employer contributions, and decrease PBGC revenue. The  present value of a participant's benefit and related contribution and  premium requirements would decrease because a higher interest rate  increases the value of today\u2019s dollars, relative to future dollars, and  therefore fewer of today\u2019s dollars should be needed to pay benefits in the  future. However, if the alternative produces a lower interest rate, plan  participants would receive larger lump sums, employers would need to  increase contributions to their plans, and PBGC may experience an  increase in revenue.", "The magnitude of these effects on lump sums, plan funding, and PBGC  premiums would depend on the characteristics of the plan and its  participants and how the rate is specified in the law. Additionally, if the  Congress specifies the interest rate differently for current liability and  lump-sum calculations, as is currently the case, the magnitude of the  impact on each could differ. Furthermore, the effect on current liability  and lump-sum calculations could be phased in over a period of time. In  1994, for example, the law phased in the reduction in the upper limit on  interest rates for current liability calculations from 110 percent to   105 percent over a 5-year period.

On the other  hand, that same 1-percentage point increase in the interest rate would  result in a 36 percent decrease in the lump sums of participants expected  to retire in 40 years.", "Reducing the dollar amount of each lump-sum distribution by using a  higher interest rate may affect the number of employers that offer a lump- sum distribution and the number of participants electing to take a lump- sum distribution. Many employers already offer a lump-sum provision in  their plans; however, if the rate used to calculate lump-sum distribution  amounts were to increase, reducing the amount of each distribution, more  employers may adopt lump-sum provisions in their plans in order to  reduce costs. However, fewer participants might elect a lump-sum  distribution if the value of such payments were to decline relative to the  participant\u2019s annuity benefit.", "Reducing the calculated present value of each participant\u2019s benefit would  also increase the number of participants whose benefit may be distributed  by the plan as a lump sum without their consent.

Such a change may lower  or eliminate the minimum employer contribution, referred to as the deficit  reduction contribution, required by the IRC. Therefore, plans with a  typical distribution of participants would see their liabilities reduced by   12 percent to 15 percent from a 1-percentage point increase in the interest  rate. Figure 7 shows plans that were 80 percent funded would become  more than 90 percent funded and would no longer have to make a deficit  reduction contribution.", "A higher interest rate would also decrease allowable employer  contributions for plans at the full funding limit. The IRC imposes full  funding limitations that limit tax-deductible contributions under certain  circumstances in order to prevent employers from contributing more to  their plan than is necessary to cover promised future benefits. The full  funding limitations established in 1987 and 1994, also known respectively  as the 150-percent current liability limitation and the 90-percent current  liability limitation, are required to be computed using the 30-year Treasury  rate. If the rate with which they are required to be computed were to  increase, more plans would be subject to the full funding limitation and,  therefore, fewer would be allowed to make additional contributions.", "Employer premium payments to PBGC would decrease with the use of a  higher interest rate because their plans\u2019 current liabilities would become  better funded. Generally, ERISA requires plans with assets that are less  than the value of their accrued vested benefits to pay an additional  premium, termed the variable-rate premium. Assuming an increase in the  interest rate, some plans would no longer be subject to the variable-rate  premium because the reduction in their current liabilities would cause  them to reach the full funding limit and therefore become exempt from the  payment.

Rules for using current liability calculations to  determine minimum contributions, full funding limits, and PBGC  premiums are extremely complex. However, in general, with an increase in  the interest rate, some under-funded plans would become adequately  funded, some plans would reach full funding limits, and additional plans  would avoid variable-rate premiums. Additionally, the minimum allowable  value of the lump-sum equivalent of a participant\u2019s annuity benefit would  decline. The magnitude of the decline would depend on the participant\u2019s  age and proximity to the plan\u2019s normal retirement age.", "Each alternative has characteristics that may make it more or less  appropriate as an interest rate. To the extent that policymakers continue  to want the interest rate tied to group annuity purchase rates, the PBGC  interest rate factors have the most direct connection to the group annuity  market. Other than the survey conducted for PBGC, no mechanism exists  to collect information on actual group annuity purchase rates. Although  the PBGC interest rate factors may track group annuity purchase rates  more closely than other rates do, the PBGC interest rate factors are less  transparent than market-determined alternatives. Long-term market rates,  such as corporate bond indices, may track changes in group annuity rates  over time, but they are less directly connected to group annuity rates and  their proximity to group annuity rates is uncertain. In addition, an interest  rate based on some long-term market rates, such as corporate bond  indices, may need to be adjusted downward to better reflect the level of  group annuity purchase rates.", "Finally, the suitability of any interest rate used is likely to change over  time and, unless some entity is given the responsibility for monitoring its  relationship to group annuity purchase rates, the Congress and pension  plans regulatory agencies will have difficulty determining when changes  are needed. The Congress has made several ad hoc adjustments to the  mandatory interest rate for pension calculations and can continue to make  changes to the rate through the legislative process. Given the significant  technical issues associated with such decisions as well as the time it takes  to enact such a legislative change, the Congress could decide to delegate  this authority to the executive branch and establish a process to monitor  the mandatory rate.

This could  be a transparent process consistent with the Administrative Procedures  Act. Under this option, the Congress could either require that the  Committee\u2019s adjustments to the mandated interest rate obtain  congressional approval and be enacted into law or it could provide for  congressional review and disapproval. The disapproval role could be  similar to the role the Congress provides for itself under the Congressional  Review Act. Under the act, federal regulations are held for 60 days to give  the Congress the opportunity to pass a resolution of disapproval. This  process provides the advantages of allowing for more timely adjustments  to the interest rate if needed and providing the Congress with the  opportunity to intervene if it so chooses without requiring direct  congressional involvement for the adjustments to take effect.", "Whether the Congress decides to maintain its current role in setting and  adjusting the mandatory interest rate or delegates this authority to the  executive branch, it should consider establishing a process to better  monitor changes to the rate in relation to group annuity purchase rates.

Figure 9 shows, for  example, two of the better know yield curves, the yield curves for on-the- run Treasury securities and zero-coupon Treasury securities, as of  February 6, 2003.  The yield for on-the-run securities reflects interest rates  for securities that make semiannual interest payments before they mature,  followed by a final payment of interest and principal at maturity.

This reflects the fact that coupon yields are a blend of zero- coupon spot rates, and the term structure of spot rates on February 6,  2003, was upward sloping.", "To determine the present value of plan cash flows using a zero-coupon  yield curve, the spot rates at various maturities may be used as the interest  rates for calculating the present value of cash flows at the corresponding  points in time.

In these cases, a  concept called \u201cduration\u201d may be used to select a single interest rate for all  cash flows in the present value calculation.  Duration measures the  average time that it takes for a security to make all interest and principal  payments, or a pension plan to make all benefit payments, with the time  until each payment weighted by its present value as a percentage of the  total present value of all payments.  The total present value of a security's  payments is its market price and the total present value of a plan's benefit  payments is its current liabilities.
