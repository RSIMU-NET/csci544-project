Increasingly, the clinical information from which hospitals derive the quality data for CMS is stored in information technology (IT) systems. GAO was asked to examine (1) hospital processes to collect and submit quality data, (2) the extent to which IT facilitates hospitals' collection and submission of quality data, and (3) whether CMS has taken steps to promote the use of IT systems to facilitate the collection and submission of hospital quality data. GAO addressed these issues by conducting case studies of eight hospitals with varying levels of IT development and interviewing relevant officials at CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The eight case study hospitals used six steps to collect and submit quality data: (1) identify the patients, (2) locate information in their medical records, (3) determine appropriate values for the data elements, (4) transmit the quality data to CMS, (5) ensure that the quality data have been accepted by CMS, and (6) supply copies of selected medical records to CMS to validate the data. Several factors account for the complexity of abstracting all relevant information in a patient's medical record, including the content and organization of the medical record, the scope of information and the clinical judgment required for the data elements, and frequent changes by CMS in its data specifications. Due in part to these complexities, most of the case study hospitals relied on clinical staff to abstract the quality data. Increases in the number of quality measures required by CMS led to increased demands on clinical staff resources. Offsetting the demands placed on clinical staff were the benefits that case study hospitals reported finding in the quality data, such as providing feedback to clinicians and reports to hospital administrators. GAO's case studies showed that existing IT systems can help hospitals gather some quality data but are far from enabling hospitals to automate the abstraction process. IT systems helped hospital staff to abstract information from patients' medical records, in particular by improving accessibility to and legibility of the medical record. The limitations reported by officials in the case study hospitals included having a mix of paper and electronic records, which required staff to check multiple places to get the needed information; the prevalence of data recorded as unstructured narrative or text, which made locating the information time-consuming because it was not in a prescribed place in the record; and the inability of some IT systems to access related data stored in another IT system in the same hospital, which required staff to access each IT system separately to obtain related pieces of information. Hospital officials expected the scope and functionality of their IT systems to increase over time, but this process will occur over a period of years. CMS has sponsored studies and joined HHS initiatives to examine and promote the current and potential use of hospital IT systems to facilitate the collection and submission of quality data, but HHS lacks detailed plans, including milestones and a time frame against which to track its progress. CMS has joined efforts by HHS to promote the use of IT in health care, including a Quality Workgroup charged with specifying how IT could capture, aggregate, and report inpatient and outpatient quality data. HHS plans to expand the use of health IT for quality data collection and submission through contracts with nongovernmental entities that currently address the use of health IT for a range of other purposes. However, HHS has identified no detailed plans, milestones, or time frames for either its broad effort to encourage IT in health care nationwide or its specific objective to promote the use of health IT for quality data collection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) created a financial incentive for hospitals to submit to the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data that are used to  calculate hospital performance on measures of the quality of care  provided. CMS established the Annual Payment Update (APU) program  to implement that incentive. The APU program requires that participating  hospitals submit these quality data on a quarterly basis in order to avoid a  reduction in their full Medicare payment update each fiscal year. Although  the APU program was originally set to expire in 2007, the Deficit  Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) made the APU program permanent. The act  also raised the reduction and required the Secretary of Health and Human  Services (HHS) to increase the number of measures for which hospitals  participating in the APU program would have to provide data in order to  receive their full Medicare payment update. CMS plans to continue  expanding the number of required measures in future years. Furthermore,  DRA directed the Secretary to develop a plan to implement a value-based  purchasing program for Medicare that beginning in fiscal year 2009 would  adjust payments to hospitals based on factors related to the quality of care  they provide. Such pay-for-performance programs are intended to  strengthen the financial incentives for hospitals to invest in quality  improvement efforts.", "Each quality measure consists of a set of standardized data elements,  which define the specific data that hospitals need to submit to CMS.  Hospitals determine a value for each data element of a measure for  patients\u2014Medicare and non-Medicare\u2014who have a medical condition  covered by the APU program, that is, heart attack, heart failure,  pneumonia, or surgery. The values for the data elements consist of  numerical data and other administrative and clinical information that are  obtained from the medical records of the patients. For example, there are  8 required quality measures for the heart attack condition, one of which is  whether a beta blocker was given to the patient upon arrival at the  hospital. This single measure, in turn, consists of 11 data elements,  including administrative data elements, such as the patient\u2019s date of arrival  at the hospital, and clinical data elements, such as whether the patient  received a beta blocker within 24 hours after hospital arrival (see app. II).  The values entered for data elements are used to calculate hospital  performance on the 21 quality measures that are in effect as of fiscal   year 2007. For a hospital submitting data on all 21 measures, CMS receives  values for a total of 73 unique data elements. For heart attack measures  alone, the 8 measures utilize 35 of the 73 data elements. (Some data  elements are used in more than 1 measure. See app. I for the number of  data elements required for each measure.) Hospitals submit their quality  data electronically, over the Internet, to a clinical data warehouse  operated by a CMS contractor.", "Increasingly, the information in patients\u2019 medical records that provides the  basis for hospital quality data submissions may be stored and accessed in  electronic form in information technology (IT) systems. Currently, many  hospitals record and store such clinical information on patients in a  combination of paper and electronic systems. Over time, hospitals have  added new health IT systems to expand the amount of information that is  stored electronically. In 2005, the Secretary of HHS established the  American Health Information Community (AHIC) to advance the adoption  of electronic health records, after the President called in 2004 for the  widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records within   10 years and appointed a National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology to promote that goal. On August 12, 2005, CMS issued a  regulation for the APU program that stated a goal of facilitating the use of  health IT by hospitals to make it easier for them to collect the quality data  from the medical record and submit them to CMS. In the preamble to the  regulation, CMS said that it intended to begin working toward modifying  its requirements and mechanisms for accepting quality data to allow  hospitals to transfer their data directly from hospital IT systems without  having to first transfer the data into specially formatted files as is currently  required.", "Because the vast majority of acute care hospitals treating Medicare  patients choose to submit quality data each quarter to CMS, rather than  accept a reduced annual payment update, you asked us to examine   (1) how hospitals collect and submit quality data for the Medicare hospital  quality measures, (2) the extent to which IT facilitates hospitals\u2019 collection  and submission of quality data for the Medicare hospital quality measures,  and (3) whether CMS has taken steps to promote the development and use  of IT systems that could facilitate the collection and submission of  hospital quality data.", "To assess how hospitals collect and submit quality data, we conducted  case studies of eight individual acute care hospitals to obtain information  about the processes they used to collect and submit the data. The  hospitals varied on a number of standard hospital characteristics,  including size, urban/rural location, and teaching status (see app. III,   table 1). We visited each case study hospital, and we interviewed the  individuals responsible for collecting and submitting the quality data to  CMS, managers of the hospital\u2019s quality department, and hospital  administrators. To assess the extent to which IT facilitates hospitals\u2019  collection and submission of quality data, we selected the case study  hospitals to include both hospitals with relatively well-developed IT  systems that supported electronic patient records and hospitals with less- developed levels of IT, based on screening interviews done at the time we  selected the case study hospitals. During our site visits, we also  interviewed IT staff involved in the process of collecting and submitting  the quality data. To assess whether CMS has taken steps to promote the  development and use of IT systems that could facilitate the collection and  submission of hospital quality data, we reviewed relevant federal  regulations, reports, and related documents and interviewed CMS officials  and CMS contractors, as well as officials in HHS\u2019s Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Because our  evidence is limited to the eight case studies, it does not offer a basis for  relating any differences we observed among these particular hospitals to  their differences on specific dimensions, such as size or teaching status.  Nor can we generalize from the group of eight as a whole to acute care  hospitals across the country. Where appropriate, we obtained relevant  information about these hospitals from CMS documents and databases;  however, most of our information for these case studies was reported by  hospital officials. Furthermore, although we examined the processes  hospitals used to collect and submit quality data and the role that IT plays  in that process, we did not examine general IT adoption in the hospital  industry. We conducted our work from February 2006 to April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To guide the  hospital staff in the abstraction process\u2014that is, in finding and properly  assessing the information in the patient\u2019s medical record needed to fill in  the values for the data elements\u2014CMS and the Joint Commission have  jointly issued a Specifications Manual. It contains detailed specifications  that define the data elements for which the hospital staff need to collect  information and determine values and the correct interpretation of those  data elements. The Joint Commission also requires hospitals to submit the  same data that they submit to CMS for the APU program (and some  additional data) to receive Joint Commission accreditation.", "In many hospitals, information in a patient\u2019s medical record is recorded  and stored in a combination of paper and electronic systems. Patient  medical records that clinicians record on paper may be stored in a folder  in the hospital\u2019s medical record department and contain all the different  forms, reports, and notes prepared by different individuals or by different  departments during the patient\u2019s stay. Depending on the length of the  patient\u2019s hospital stay and the complexity of the care, an individual patient  medical record can amount to hundreds of pages. For information stored  electronically, clinicians may enter information directly into the electronic  record themselves, as they do for paper records, or they may dictate their  notes to be transcribed and added to the electronic record later.  Information may also be recorded on paper and then scanned into the  patient\u2019s electronic record. For example, if a patient is transferred from  another hospital, the paper documents from the transferring hospital may  be scanned into the patient\u2019s electronic record.", "The patient medical information that hospitals store electronically, rather  than on paper, typically resides in multiple health IT systems. One set of IT  systems usually handles administrative tasks such as patient registration  and billing. Hospitals acquire other IT systems to record laboratory test  results, to store digital radiological images, to process physician orders for  medications, and to record notes written by physicians and nurses.  Hospitals frequently build their health IT capabilities incrementally by  adding new health IT systems over time. If the systems that hospitals  purchase come from different companies, they are likely to be based on  varying standards for how the information is stored and exchanged  electronically. As a result, even in a single hospital, it can be difficult to  access from one IT system clinical data stored in a different health IT  system.", "One of the main objectives of ONC is to overcome the problem of multiple  health IT systems, within and across health care providers, that store and  exchange information according to varying standards. The mission of ONC  is to promote the development and nationwide implementation of  interoperable health IT in both the public and the private sectors in order  to reduce medical errors, improve quality of care, and enhance the  efficiency of health care. Health IT is interoperable when systems are  able to exchange data accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently  with different IT systems, software applications, and networks in such a  way that the clinical or operational purposes and meaning of the data are  preserved and unaltered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hospitals Use Six Basic Steps to Collect and Submit Quality Data, Two of Which Involve Complex Abstraction by Hospital Staff", "paragraphs": ["The case study hospitals we visited used six steps to collect and submit  quality data, two of which involved complex abstraction\u2014the process of  reviewing and assessing all relevant pieces of information in a patient\u2019s  medical record to determine the appropriate value for each data element.

These steps started with identifying the patients for whom the hospitals  needed to provide quality data to CMS and continued through the process  of examining each patient\u2019s medical record, one after the other, to find the  information needed to determine the appropriate values for each of the  required data elements for that patient. Then, for each patient, those  values were entered by computer into an electronic form or template  listing each of the data elements for that condition. These forms were  provided by the data vendor with which the hospital had contracted to  transmit its quality data to CMS. The vendors also assisted the hospitals in  checking that the data were successfully received by CMS. Finally, the  hospitals sent copies of the medical records of a selected sample of  patients to a CMS contractor that used those records to validate the  accuracy of the quality data submitted by the hospital.", "Specifically, the six steps, which are summarized for each case study  hospital in appendix III, table 2, were as follows:  Step 1: Identify patients\u2014The first step was to identify the patients for  whom the hospitals needed to submit quality data to CMS. Staff at three  case study hospitals identified these patients using information on the  patient\u2019s principal diagnosis, or principal procedure in the case of surgery  patients, obtained from the hospital\u2019s billing data. Five case study  hospitals had their data vendor use the hospital\u2019s billing data to identify  the eligible patients for them. Every month, all eight hospitals that we  visited identified patients discharged in the prior month for whom quality  data should be collected. The hospitals identified all patients  retrospectively for quality data collection because hospitals have to wait  until a patient is discharged to determine the principal diagnosis.", "CMS permits hospitals to reduce their data collection effort by providing  quality data for a representative sample of patients when the total number  of patients treated for a particular condition exceeds a certain threshold.  Five case study hospitals drew samples for at least one condition. The data  vendor performed this task for four of those case study hospitals, and  assisted the hospital in performing this task for the fifth hospital.", "Only one of the case study hospitals reported using nonbilling data  sources to check the accuracy of the lists of patients selected for quality  data collection that the hospitals drew from their billing data (see app. III,  table 3). Several stated that they occasionally noted discrepancies, such as  patients selected for heart attack measures who, upon review of their  medical record, should not have had that as their principal diagnosis.  However, the hospital officials we interviewed told us that discrepancies  of this sort were likely to be minor. Officials at three hospitals noted that  hospitals generally have periodic routine audits conducted of the coding  practices of their medical records departments, which would include the  accuracy of the principal diagnoses and procedures.", "Step 2: Locate information in the medical record\u2014Steps 2 and 3 were  in practice closely linked in our case study hospitals. Abstractors at the  eight case study hospitals examined each selected patient\u2019s medical  record, looking for all of the discrete pieces of information that, taken  together, would determine what they would decide\u2014in step 3\u2014was the  correct value for each of the data elements. For some data elements, there  was a one-to-one correspondence between the piece of information in the  medical record and the value to be entered. Typical examples included a  patient\u2019s date of birth and the name of a medication administered to the  patient. For other data elements, the abstractors had to check for the  presence or absence of multiple pieces of information in different parts of  the medical record to determine the correct value for that data element.  For example, to determine if the patient did, or did not, have a  contraindication for aspirin, abstractors looked in different parts of the  medical record for potential contraindications, such as the presence of  internal bleeding, allergies, or prescriptions for certain other medications  such as Coumadin.", "In order for abstractors to find information in the patient\u2019s medical record,  it had to be recorded properly by the clinicians providing the patient\u2019s  care. Officials at all eight case study hospitals described efforts designed  to educate physicians and nurses about the specific data elements for  which they needed to provide information in each patient\u2019s medical  record. The hospital officials were particularly concerned that the  clinicians not undermine the hospital\u2019s performance on the quality  measures by inadequately documenting what they had done and the  reasons why. For example, one heart failure measure tracks whether a  patient received each of six specific instructions at the time of discharge,  but unless information was explicitly recorded in a heart failure patient\u2019s  medical record for each of the six data elements, that patient was counted  by CMS as one who had not received all pertinent discharge instructions  and therefore did not meet that quality measure. This particular measure  was cited by officials at several hospitals as one that required a higher  level of documentation than had previously been the norm at their  hospital.", "Step 3: Determine appropriate data element values\u2014Once  abstractors had located all the relevant pieces of information pertaining to  a given data element, they had to put those pieces together to arrive at the  appropriate value for the data element. The relevance of that information  was defined by the detailed instructions provided by the hospitals\u2019  vendors, as well as the Specifications Manual jointly issued by CMS and  the Joint Commission that serves as the basis for the vendor instructions.  The Specifications Manual sets out the decision rules for choosing among  the allowable values for each data element. It also identifies which parts of  the patient\u2019s medical record may or may not provide the required  information, and often lists specific terms or descriptions that, if recorded  in the patient\u2019s medical record, would indicate the appropriate value for a  given data element. In addition, the Specifications Manual provides  abstractors with guidance on how to interpret conflicting information in  the medical record, such as a note from one clinician that the patient is not  a smoker and a note elsewhere in the record from another clinician that  the patient does smoke. To help keep track of multiple pieces of  information, many abstractors reported that they first filled in the data  element values on a paper copy of the abstraction form provided by the  data vendor. In this way, they could write notes in the margin to document  how they came to their conclusions.", "Step 4: Transmit data to CMS\u2014In order for the quality data to be  accepted by the clinical data warehouse, they must pass a battery of edit  checks that look for missing, invalid, or improperly formatted data  element entries. All the case study hospitals contracted with data vendors  to submit their quality data to CMS. They did so, in part, because all of the  hospitals submitted the same data to the Joint Commission, and it requires  hospitals to submit their quality data through data vendors that meet the  Joint Commission\u2019s requirements. The additional cost to the hospitals to  have the data vendors also submit their quality data to CMS was generally  minimal (see app. III, table 3).", "All of the case study hospitals submitted their data to the data vendor by  filling in values for the required data elements on an electronic version of  the vendor\u2019s abstraction form. Many abstractors did this for a batch of  patient records at a time, working from paper copies of the form that they  had filled in previously. Some abstractors entered the data online at the  same time that they reviewed the patient\u2019s medical records. In other cases,  someone other than the abstractor who filled in the paper form used the  completed form to enter the data on a computer.", "Step 5: Ensure data have been accepted by CMS\u2014The case study  hospitals varied in the extent to which they actively monitored the  acceptance of their quality data into CMS\u2019s clinical data warehouse. After  the data vendors submitted the quality data electronically, they and the  hospitals could download reports from the clinical data warehouse  indicating whether the submitted data had passed the screening edits for  proper formatting and valid entries. The hospitals could use these reports  to detect data entry errors and make corrections prior to CMS\u2019s data  submission deadline. Three case study hospitals shared this task with their  data vendors, three hospitals left it for their data vendors to handle, and  two hospitals received and responded to reports on data edit checks  produced by their data vendors, rather than reviewing the CMS reports.  Approximately 2 months after hospitals submitted their quality data, CMS  released reports to the hospitals showing their performance scores on the  quality measures before posting the results on its public Web site.", "Step 6: Supply copies of selected medical records\u2014CMS has put in  place a data validation process to ensure the accuracy of hospital quality  data submissions. It requires hospitals to supply a CMS contractor with  paper copies of the complete medical record for five patients selected by  CMS each quarter. Officials at five hospitals noted that they check to  make sure that all parts of the medical records that they used to abstract  the data originally are included in the package shipped to the CMS  contractor. Most of the case study hospitals relied on CMS\u2019s data  validation to ensure the accuracy of their abstractions. However, two  hospitals reported that they also routinely draw their own sample of cases,  which are abstracted a second time by a different abstractor in the  hospital, followed by a comparison of the two sets of results (see app. III,  table 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Most Complex Steps Were Locating Relevant Clinical Information and Determining Appropriate Values for Data Elements", "paragraphs": ["The description by hospital officials of the processes they used to collect  and submit quality data indicated that locating the relevant clinical  information and determining appropriate values for the data elements  (steps 2 and 3) were the most complex steps of the six identified, due to  several factors. These included the content and organization of the  medical record, the scope of the information encompassed by the data  elements, and frequent changes in data specifications.", "The first complicating factor related to the medical record was that the  information abstractors needed to determine the correct data element  values for a given patient was generally located in many different sections  of the patient\u2019s medical record. These included documents completed for  admission to the hospital, emergency department documents, laboratory  and test results, operating room notes, medication administration records,  nursing notes, and physician-generated documents such as history and  physicals, progress notes and consults, orders for medications and tests,  and discharge summaries. In addition, the abstractors may have had to  look at documents that came from other providers if the patient was  transferred to the hospital. Much of the clinical information needed was  found in the sections of the medical record prepared by clinicians. Often  the information in question, such as contraindications for aspirin or beta  blockers, could be found in any of a number of places in the medical  record where clinicians made entries. As a result, abstractors frequently  had to read through multiple parts of the record to find the information  needed to determine the correct value for just one data element. At two  case study hospitals, abstractors said that they routinely read each  patient\u2019s entire medical record.", "Experienced abstractors often knew where they were most likely to find  particular pieces of information. They nevertheless also had to check for  potentially contradictory information in different parts of the medical  record. For example, as noted, patients may have provided varying  responses about their smoking history to different clinicians. If any of  these responses indicated that the patient had smoked cigarettes in the  last 12 months, the patient was considered to be a smoker according to  CMS\u2019s data specifications. Another example concerns the possibility that a  heart attack or heart failure patient may have had multiple  echocardiogram results recorded in different parts of the medical record.  Abstractors needed to find all such results in order to apply the rules  stated in the Specifications Manual for identifying which result to use in  deciding whether the patient had left ventricular systolic dysfunction  (LVSD). This data element is used for the quality measure assessing  whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin  receptor blocker (ARB) was prescribed for LVSD at discharge.", "The second factor was related to the scope of the information required for  certain data elements. Some of the data elements that the abstractors had  to fill in represented a composite of related data and clinical judgment  applied by the abstractor, not just a single discrete piece of information.  Such composite data elements typically were governed by complicated  rules for determining the clinical appropriateness of a specific treatment  for a given patient. For example, the data element for contraindications for  both ACEIs and ARBs at discharge requires abstractors to check for the  presence and assess the severity of any of a range of clinical conditions  that would make the use of either ACEIs or ARBs inappropriate for that  patient. (See fig. 2.) These conditions may appear at any time during the  patient\u2019s hospital stay and so could appear at any of several places in the  medical record. Abstractors must also look for evidence in the record  from a physician linking a decision not to prescribe these drugs to one or  more of those conditions.", "The third factor is the necessity abstractors at the case study hospitals  faced to adjust to frequent changes in the data specifications set by CMS.  Since CMS first released its detailed data specifications jointly with the  Joint Commission in September 2004, it has issued seven new versions of  the Specifications Manual. Therefore, from fall 2004 through summer  2006, roughly every 3 months hospital abstractors have had to stop and  take note of what had changed in the data specifications and revamp their  quality data collection procedures accordingly. Some of these changes  reflected modifications in the quality measures themselves, such as the  addition of ARBs for treatment of LVSD. Other changes revised or  expanded the guidance provided to abstractors, often in response to  questions submitted by hospitals to CMS. CMS recently changed its  schedule for issuing revisions to its data specifications from every   3 months to every 6 months, but that change had not yet affected the  interval between new revisions issued to hospitals at the time of our case  study site visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clinical Staff Abstract Quality Data at Most Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["Case study hospitals typically used registered nurses (RN), often  exclusively, to abstract quality data for the CMS quality measures (see   app. III, table 3). One hospital relied on a highly experienced licensed  practical nurse, and two case study hospitals used a mix of RNs and  nonclinical staff. Officials at one hospital noted that RNs were familiar  with both the nomenclature and the structure of the hospital\u2019s medical  records and they could more readily interact with the physicians and  nurses providing the care about documentation issues. Even when using  RNs, all but three of the case study hospitals had each abstractor focus on  one or two medical conditions with which they had expertise.", "Four hospitals had tried using nonclinical staff, most often trained as  medical record coders, to abstract the quality data. Officials at one of  these hospitals reported that this approach posed challenges. They said  that it was difficult for nonclinical staff to learn all that they needed to  know to abstract quality data effectively, especially with the constant  changes being made to the data specifications. At the second hospital,  officials reported that using nonclinical staff for abstraction did not work  at all and they switched to using clinically trained staff. At the third  hospital, the chief clinician leading the quality team stated that the  hospital\u2019s nonclinical abstractors worked well enough when clinically  trained colleagues were available to answer their questions. Officials at the  fourth hospital cited no concerns about using staff who were not RNs to  abstract quality data, but they subsequently hired an RN to abstract patient  records for two of the four conditions.", "Case study hospitals drew on a mix of existing and new staff resources to  handle the collection and submission of quality data to CMS. In two  hospitals, new staff had been hired specifically to collect quality data for  the Joint Commission and CMS.

Officials at the case study hospitals  generally reported that the amount of staff time required for abstraction  increased proportionately with the number of conditions for which they  reported quality data. The hospitals had all begun to report most recently  on the surgical quality measures. They found that the staff hours needed  for this new set of quality measures were directly related to the number of  patient records to be abstracted and the number of data elements  collected. In other words, they found no \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d as they  expanded the scope of quality data abstraction. At the time of our site  visits, four hospitals continued to draw on existing staff resources, while  others had hired additional staff.

Each one had a process for tracking changes in their  performance over time. Based on those results, they provided feedback to  individual clinicians and reports to hospital administrators and trustees.  Because they perceived feedback to clinicians to be much more effective  when provided as soon as possible, several of the case study hospitals  found ways to calculate their performance on the quality measures  themselves, often on a monthly basis, rather than wait for CMS to report  their results for the quarter.", "Officials at all eight case study hospitals pointed to specific changes they  had made in their internal procedures designed to improve their  performance on one or more quality measures. Most of the case study  hospitals developed \u201cstanding order sets\u201d for particular diagnoses. Such  order sets provide a mechanism for standardizing both the care provided  and the documentation of that care, in such areas as prescribing beta  blockers and aspirin on arrival and at discharge for heart attack patients.  Another common example involved prompting physicians to administer  pneumococcal vaccinations to pneumonia patients. However, at most of  the case study hospitals, use of many standing order sets was optional for  physicians, and hospital officials reported widely varying rates of  physician use, from close to 100 percent of physicians at one hospital  using its order set for heart attack patients to just a few physicians using  any order sets in another hospital.", "Case study hospitals also responded to the information generated from  their quality data by adjusting their treatment protocols, especially for  patients treated in their emergency departments. For example, five  hospitals developed or elaborated on procedural checklists for emergency  department nurses treating pneumonia patients. The objective of these  changes was to more quickly identify pneumonia patients when they  arrived at the emergency department and then expeditiously perform  required blood tests so that the patients would score positively for the  quality measure on receiving antibiotics within 4 hours of arrival at the  hospital. Three hospitals strengthened their procedures to identify  smokers and make sure that they received appropriate counseling.", "Hospital officials noted that they provided quality of care data to entities  other than CMS and the Joint Commission, such as state governments and  private insurers, but for the most part they reported that the CMS quality  measures had two advantages. First, the CMS quality measures enabled  hospitals to benchmark their performance against the performances of  virtually every other hospital in the country. Second, officials at two  hospitals noted that the CMS measures were based on clinical information  obtained from patient medical records and therefore had greater validity  as measures of quality of care than measures based solely on  administrative data. Many hospital officials said that they wished that  state governments and other entities collecting quality data would accept  the CMS quality measures instead of requiring related quality data based  on different definitions and patient populations. Hospital officials in two  states reported some movement in that direction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Existing IT Systems Can Help Hospitals Gather Some Quality Data but Are Far from Enabling Automated Abstraction", "paragraphs": ["In the case studies, existing IT systems helped hospital abstractors to  complete their work more quickly, but the limitations of those IT systems  meant that trained staff still had to examine the entire patient medical  record and manually abstract the quality data submitted to CMS.

In general, paper records were less accessible than electronic  records because it took time to find them or to have them transported if  hospitals had stored them in a remote location after the patients were  discharged. Also, paper records were more likely to be missing or in use  by someone else. However, in one case study hospital, an abstractor noted  difficulties in gaining access to a computer terminal to view electronic  medical records. Many abstractors noted improvements in legibility as a  fundamental benefit of electronic records. This advantage applied in  particular to the many sections of the medical record that consisted of  handwritten text, including history and physicals, progress notes,  medication administration records, and discharge summaries.", "Some hospitals have used their existing IT systems to facilitate the  abstraction of information by designing a number of discrete data fields  that match CMS\u2019s data elements. For example, two hospitals incorporated  prompts for pneumococcal vaccination in their electronic medication  ordering system. These prompts not only reminded physicians to order the  vaccination (if the patient was not already vaccinated) but also helped to  insure documentation of the patient\u2019s vaccination status. One hospital  developed a special electronic discharge program for heart attack and  heart failure patients that had data elements for the quality measures built  into it. Another hospital built a prompt into its electronically generated  discharge instructions to instruct patients to measure their weight daily.  This enabled the hospital to document more consistently one of the  specific instructions that heart failure patients are supposed to receive on  discharge but that physicians and nurses tended to overlook in their  documentation.", "The limitations that hospital officials reported in using existing IT systems  to collect quality data stemmed from having a mix of paper and electronic  systems; the prevalence of data recorded in IT systems as unstructured  paragraphs of narrative or text, as opposed to discrete data fields reserved  for specific pieces of information; and the inability of some IT systems to  access related data stored on another IT system in the same hospital.  Because all but one of the case study hospitals stored clinical records in a  mix of paper and electronic systems, abstractors generally had to consult  both paper and electronic records to obtain all needed information. What  was recorded on paper and what was recorded electronically varied from  hospital to hospital (see app. III, table 4). However, admissions and billing  data were electronic at all the case study hospitals. Billing data include  principal diagnosis and birth date, which are among the CMS-required data  elements. With regard to clinical data, all case study hospitals had test  results, such as echocardiogram readings, in an electronic form. In  contrast, nurse progress notes were least likely to be in electronic form at  the case study hospitals. Moreover, it was not uncommon for a hospital to  have the same type of clinical documentation stored partly in electronic  form and partly on paper. For example, five of the eight case study  hospitals had a mix of paper and electronic physician notes, reflecting the  differing personal preferences of the physicians. Discharge summaries and  medication administration records, on the other hand, tended to be either  paper or electronic at a given hospital.", "Many of the data in existing IT systems were recorded in unstructured  formats\u2014that is, as paragraphs of narrative or other text, rather than in  data fields designated to contain specific pieces of information\u2014which  created problems in locating the needed information. For example,  physician notes and discharge summaries were often dictated and  transcribed. Abstractors typically read through the entire electronic  document to make sure that they had found all potentially relevant  references, such as for possible contraindications for a beta blocker or an  ACEI. By contrast, some of the data in existing IT systems were in  structured data fields so that specific information could be found in a  prescribed place in the record. One common example was a list of  medication allergies, which abstractors used to quickly check for certain  drug contraindications. However, officials at several hospitals said that  developing and implementing structured data fields were labor intensive,  both in terms of programming and in terms of educating clinical staff in  their use. That is why many of the data stored in electronic records at the  case study hospitals remained in unstructured formats.", "Another limitation with existing IT systems was the inability of some  systems to access related data stored on another IT system in the same  hospital. This situation affected six of the eight case study hospitals to  some degree. For example, one hospital had an IT system in the  emergency department and an IT system on the inpatient floors, but the  two systems were independent and the information in one was not linked  to the information in the other. Abstractors had to access each IT system  separately to obtain related pieces of information, which made abstraction  more complicated and time-consuming.", "Existing IT systems helped hospital abstractors to complete their work  more quickly, but the limitations of those IT systems meant that, for the  most part, the nature of their work remained the same. Existing IT systems  enabled abstractors at several hospitals to more quickly locate the clinical  information needed to determine the appropriate values for at least some  of the data elements that the hospitals submitted to CMS. Where hospitals  designed a discrete data field in their IT systems to match a specific CMS  data element, abstractors could simply transcribe that value into the data  vendor\u2019s abstraction form. However, in all the case study hospitals there  remained a large number of data elements for which there was no discrete  data field in a patient\u2019s electronic record that could provide the required  value for that data element. As a result, trained staff still had to examine  the medical record as a whole and manually abstract the quality data  submitted to CMS, whether the information in the medical record was  recorded electronically or on paper."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full Automation of Quality Data Collection Is Not Imminent", "paragraphs": ["All the case study hospitals were working to expand the scope and  functionality of their IT systems, but this expansion was generally  projected to occur incrementally over a period of years.

As the case study hospitals continue to bring  more of their clinical documentation into IT systems, and to link separate  systems within their hospital so that data in one system can be accessed  from another, it should reduce the time required to collect quality data.", "However, most officials at the case study hospitals viewed full-scale  automation of quality data collection and submission through  implementation of IT systems as, at best, a long-term prospect. They  pointed to a number of challenges that hospitals would have to overcome  before they could use IT systems to achieve full-scale automation of  quality data collection and submission. Primary among these were  overcoming physician reluctance to use IT systems to record clinical  information and the intrinsic complexity of the quality data required by  CMS. One hospital with unusually extensive IT systems had initiated a  pilot project to see how close it could get to fully automating quality data  collection for patients with heart failure. Drawing to the maximum extent  on the data that were amenable to programming, which excluded  unstructured physician notes, the hospital found that it could complete  data collection for approximately 10 percent of cases without additional  manual abstraction. Reflecting on this effort, the hospital official leading  this project noted that at least some of the data elements required for  heart failure patients represented \u201cclinical judgment calls.\u201d An official at  another hospital observed that someone had to apply CMS\u2019s complex  decision rules to determine the appropriate value for the data elements. If  a hospital wanted to eliminate the need for an abstractor, who currently  makes those decisions retrospectively after weighing multiple pieces of  information in the patient\u2019s medical record, the same complex decisions  would have to be made by the patient\u2019s physician at the time of treatment.  The official suggested that it was preferable not to ask physicians to take  on that additional task when they should be focused on making  appropriate treatment decisions.", "Another barrier to automated quality data collection mentioned by several  hospital officials was the frequency of change in the data specifications. As  noted above, hospitals had to invest considerable staff resources for  programming and staff education to develop structured data fields for the  clinical information required for the data elements. Officials at one  hospital stated that it would be difficult to justify that investment without  knowing how long the data specifications underlying that structured data  field would remain valid."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Sponsored Studies and Joined Broader HHS Initiatives to Promote Use of IT for Quality Data Collection and Submission, but HHS Lacks Detailed Plans, Milestones, and Time Frame", "paragraphs": ["CMS has sponsored studies and joined HHS initiatives to examine and  promote the current and potential use of hospital IT systems to facilitate  the collection and submission of quality data, but HHS lacks detailed  plans, including milestones and a time frame against which to track its  progress.

Data standards create a uniform vocabulary for  electronically recorded information by providing common definitions and  coding conventions for a specified set of medical terms. Currently, an  array of different standards apply to different aspects of patient care,  including drug ordering, digital imaging, clinical laboratory results, and  overall clinical terminology relating to anatomy, problems, and  procedures. The studies also found that existing IT systems did not  record much of the specific clinical information needed to determine the  appropriate data element values that hospitals submit to CMS. To achieve  CMS\u2019s goal of enabling hospitals to transmit quality data directly from  their own IT systems to CMS\u2019s nationwide clinical database, the sets of  data in the two systems should conform to a common set of data  standards and capture all the data necessary for quality measures.

The study also noted that hospitals differed in how they  coded their data, and that even when they had implemented data  standards, the hospitals had used different versions of the standards or  applied them in different ways. For example, the study found wide  variation in the way that the hospitals recorded drug names and laboratory  results in their IT systems, as none of the hospitals had implemented the  existing data standards in those areas.", "In the second study, which was conducted by the Iowa Foundation for  Medical Care and completed in February 2006, CMS examined the  potential to expand its current data specifications for heart attack, heart  failure, pneumonia, and surgical measures to incorporate the standards  adopted by the federal Consolidated Healthcare Informatics (CHI)  initiative. Unlike the first study, which focused on actual patient data in  existing IT systems, this study focused on the relationship of current data  standards to the data specifications for CMS\u2019s quality data. It found that  there were inconsistencies in the way that corresponding data elements  were defined in the CMS/Joint Commission Specifications Manual and in  the CHI standards that precluded applying those standards to all of CMS\u2019s  data elements.

We excluded hospitals  located in a different state from the first hospital selected for that  metropolitan area, so that all of the hospitals under consideration for that  area would come under the jurisdiction of the same Quality Improvement  Organization (QIO).", "To select the second case study hospital from among those available in or  near each of the four metropolitan areas, we applied a procedure designed  to produce a straightforward and unbiased selection. We began by  recording the total number of cases for which each of these hospitals had  reported results on CMS\u2019s Web site for heart attack, heart failure, and  pneumonia quality measures. We obtained this information from the Web  site itself, running reports for each hospital that showed, for each quality  measure, the number of cases that the hospital\u2019s quality performance  score was based on. Since some quality measures apply only to certain  patients, we recorded the largest number of cases listed for any of the  quality measures reported for a given condition. Next we summed the  cases for the three conditions and rank ordered the hospitals in each of  the three MSAs, and the rural hospitals in the fourth metropolitan area,  from most to least total cases submitted. We then made a preliminary  selection by taking the hospital with the median value in each of those  lists. By selecting the hospital with the median number of cases reported,  we attempted to minimize the chances of picking a hospital that would  represent an outlier compared to other hospitals in the selection pool.", "Before selecting the final four case study hospitals, we checked to make  sure that the hospitals did not happen to have an unusually high level of IT  capabilities with respect to electronic patient records. To do this, we  contacted each of the selected hospitals and obtained a description of its  current IT systems. We compared this description to the stages of  electronic medical record implementation laid out by the Healthcare  Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). The HIMSS  model identifies eight stages based on the scope and sophistication of  clinical functions implemented through a hospital\u2019s system of electronic  medical records. According to HIMSS, the large majority of hospitals in the  United States are at the lower three stages. Based on the descriptions of  these stages, we determined that none of the prospectively selected  hospitals had IT systems that exceeded the third stage.", "We collected information about the processes used to collect and submit  quality data from each of the eight case study hospitals through on-site  interviews with hospital abstractors, quality managers, IT staff, and  hospital administrators. We told these officials that neither they personally  nor their hospitals would be identified by name in our report. The site  visits took place between mid-July and early September 2006 and ranged  in duration from 3 to 8 hours. Our data collection at each hospital was  guided by a protocol that specified a series of topics to cover in our  interviews. These topics included a description of the processes used at  each hospital and the financial and staff resources devoted to quality data  collection and submission. We pretested the protocol at two hospitals not  included in our set of eight case study hospitals.", "As part of the protocol, we asked abstractors at each hospital to explain in  detail how they found the information needed to determine the  appropriate values for each of the data elements required for two specific  quality measures: (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or  antiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic  dysfunction (LVSD) for heart failure patients and (2) initial antibiotic  received within 4 hours of hospital arrival for pneumonia patients. We  selected these measures because they covered a number of different types  of data elements, including those involving administration of medications,  determining contraindications, date and time variables, and making  clinical assessments such as whether a patient had LVSD.", "To determine the extent to which IT facilitated these processes at the eight  case study hospitals, we included several topics on IT systems in our site  visit protocol. We asked about any IT systems used by the abstractors in  locating relevant clinical information in patient medical records and the  specific advantages and limitations they encountered in using those  systems. We also asked hospital officials to assess the potential for IT  systems to provide higher levels of assistance for quality data collection  and submission over time. If separate IT staff were involved in the  hospital\u2019s quality data collection and submission process, we included  them in the interviews.", "Where possible, we supplemented the information provided through  interviews with direct observation of the processes used by hospitals to  collect and submit quality data. We asked the case study hospitals to show  us how they performed these processes, and five of the eight hospitals  arranged for us to observe the collection of quality data for all or part of a  patient record. We observed abstractors accessing clinical information  from both paper and electronic records.", "We also obtained pertinent information about the case study hospitals  from CMS documents and contractors. The estimated amount of dollars  that the case study hospitals would have lost had they not submitted  quality data to CMS, presented in appendix III, table 1, was calculated  from data provided in documents made available to all hospitals at the  start of each of the fiscal years. Information on the average number of  patient charts abstracted quarterly by each case study hospital, shown in  appendix III, table 3, was drawn from a table showing the number of  patients for whom quality data were submitted to CMS\u2019s clinical data  warehouse. We obtained that table from the Iowa Foundation for Medical  Care (IFMC), which is the CMS contractor that operates the clinical data  warehouse. The IFMC table provided this information for all hospitals  submitting quality data for discharges that occurred from April 2005  through March 2006. These were the most recent data available.", "The evidence that we obtained from our eight case study hospitals is  specific to those hospitals. In particular, it does not offer a basis for  relating any differences we observed among these individual hospitals to  their differences on specific dimensions, such as size or teaching status.  Nor can we generalize from the group of eight as a whole to acute care  hospitals across the country. Furthermore, although we examined the  processes hospitals used to collect and submit quality data and the role  that IT plays in that process, we did not examine general IT adoption in  the hospital industry.", "To obtain information on whether CMS has taken steps to promote the  development of IT systems to facilitate quality data collection and  submission, we interviewed CMS officials as well as CMS contractors and  reviewed documents including reports on related studies funded by CMS.  We also interviewed officials at the Office of the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology (ONC) regarding the plans and activities of  the American Health Information Community (AHIC) quality workgroup.  In addition, we downloaded relevant documents from the AHIC Web site,  including meeting agendas, prepared presentations, and meeting minutes  for both AHIC as a whole and its Quality Workgroup.", "We conducted our work from February 2006 to April 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Linda T.
