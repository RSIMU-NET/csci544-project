QUERI is VA's central point of focus for research translation and provides a link between ORD, VA program offices, and providers. For example, one QUERI program is studying delivery of an evidence-based treatment for PTSD using telemedicine, specifically, by providing psychotherapy via video to veterans in rural areas. Another program recently adopted a new research translation strategy by establishing a requirement that research proposals for large, multi-center clinical trials include an implementation plan. VA officials said the goal of the new requirement is to encourage researchers to think about research translation from the beginning of a study\u2014and how their work might be translated into practice.", "VA officials from both ORD and the national program offices GAO spoke with described a variety of efforts coordinating on research. Such coordination can help inform research priorities and help program offices incorporate evidence-based practices in developing and rolling out national policies.

The process of  \u201ctranslating\u201d research findings into clinical practice\u2014also known as  \u201cimplementation\u201d\u2014can occur in many ways within VA. For example,  research translation can result in changes to direct patient care (e.g.,  introducing a new diagnostic tool or directing providers to follow a new  treatment protocol), or it can involve broader changes to VA programs  (e.g., implementing a new staffing policy for a particular provider type).  ORD works with other entities within the agency\u2014including those that set  clinical policies\u2014in research translation. Research translation is widely  accepted to be a long process; for example, one study reported that on  average, it takes 17 years for research evidence to reach clinical  practice.

For example, the rehabilitation research service provides \u201ccore  funding\u201d to support 12 research centers focusing on areas such as  limb loss, spinal cord injury, vision loss, and auditory disorders. This  type of funding is competitive, and VA researchers must recompete in  5-year cycles.", "Once research has been completed, the findings can inform additional  research. For example, research findings from a study on tissue could be  used to inform a study done on humans in a controlled clinical setting,  such as a clinical trial, which could in turn inform research that tests the  effectiveness of a particular intervention in a less-controlled community  setting.

The specific outcome might  vary depending on the study or type of research. For example, one body  of VA research has confirmed the utility of an intimate partner violence  screening tool for female veterans in primary care settings. These  findings will be used in developing national guidelines for screening for,  and responding to, intimate partner violence.

ORD officials said  they plan to revisit these priorities about every 5 years, though the  specific initiatives that fall within each priority can change annually. As  an example of how the initiatives within the strategic priorities can  change, ORD officials said that given VA\u2019s plans to implement a new  electronic health records system, the National Research Advisory  Council advised ORD in 2019 to focus on mitigating any unintended  consequences of this transition on research, as part of the strategic  priority on data. ORD officials said that as a result of this input, they  are increasing the intensity and scope of their efforts pertaining to this  transition.", "Cross-cutting clinical priorities, in contrast, focus on predominant  clinical conditions seen in veterans and can change yearly, according  to ORD officials. For example, one current cross-cutting clinical  priority is PTSD. As part of this priority, VA supports research to better  understand the underlying biology of PTSD, refine approaches for  diagnosing this condition, and develop and test new treatments. ORD  officials said they plan to add precision oncology as a new cross- cutting clinical research priority for fiscal year 2021, based on input  from VA leadership.

Rehabilitation service officials noted that their work focuses on  veterans\u2019 disabilities and impairments incurred through military service  but is not limited to service-connected conditions. The officials said that  because VA provides lifetime care to veterans, their research portfolio  addresses events that cause impairment and disability throughout a  veteran\u2019s lifespan, including the aging process. For example, their  research portfolio includes research on medical conditions that veterans  may experience as they age, such as stroke, and chronic conditions like  diabetes and kidney disease.", "As part of their efforts to consider multiple clinical and research needs,  officials from the health services research service told us they are  analyzing their overall research portfolio to determine where more or less  research funding may be warranted. The officials explained that as part of  their strategic planning efforts, they are identifying any areas they have  \u201cunder-invested\u201d in, and any areas that have received significant funding  in the past but might no longer need that degree of investment. Among  other things, they are considering the extent to which research on health  conditions is already being done by other research organizations, such as  NIH. They noted that while addressing chronic diseases is important to  VA and its veteran population, it is possible that research on certain  diseases is being covered by other research partners. In contrast, they  said, there are areas where VA may have a unique ability to contribute to  research because of its nationwide health care system or because it is  ahead of the curve in health care trends, such as in telehealth and in  integrating mental health care into primary care settings. Officials said  their portfolio analysis could result in some \u201cresetting\u201d of research  priorities and funding after the analysis is completed in 2020.", "Looking forward, ORD officials shared examples of approaches they are  taking to boost the agency\u2019s ability to address its research priorities. For  example, ORD officials said there are a limited number of VA researchers  working in certain priority areas, such as suicide prevention, which the  officials said can hinder their efforts to fund new research projects.  Among the efforts to boost the number of researchers working on priority  areas, officials from one research service said they recently began  incorporating their research priorities into the service\u2019s Career  Development Program funding awards. In addition, in 2019, ORD  implemented a new method to spur and track ORD progress in  addressing priorities. According to ORD leadership, as part of this  method, ORD staff will identify the actions and resources needed to  address specific priorities, and meet quarterly with the Chief Research  and Development Officer to review their progress and identify next steps."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ORD\u2019s QUERI Program and Other VA Entities Facilitate Translating Research into Clinical Practice", "paragraphs": ["VA has a variety of efforts to facilitate translating research findings into  clinical practice to improve the care veterans receive.

According to the QUERI director,  QUERI serves as the center of VA\u2019s efforts to translate research into  clinical practice. QUERI\u2019s overall mission is to improve veteran health by  rapidly implementing research findings and interventions into clinical  practice. QUERI is housed within ORD, but funded separately by non- research dollars.", "QUERI facilitates research implementation through activities such as the  National Network of QUERI programs. According to the director of  QUERI, these programs are partnered with VA national program offices,  and they take various practices\u2014often identified or developed through VA  studies\u2014and implement them at the regional or national level. For  example, through its \u201cBridging the Care Continuum\u201d QUERI investigators  focus on improving the health of vulnerable veteran populations, such as  homeless veterans, by implementing a co-occurring mental health and  substance use treatment within multiple VA medical centers. (See text  box for an example of implementation through a QUERI National  Program.) In addition, QUERI funds resource centers with technical  experts who can help promote and review best practices for  implementation.

One example of its efforts is the  telemedicine program, based on VA-funded research demonstrating the effectiveness of using telemedicine outreach for veterans with  PTSD. The Office of Rural Health and the Virtual Specialty Care QUERI partnered to implement this telemedicine program which  provides evidence-based psychotherapy for veterans with PTSD via interactive video either from their homes or at community-based  outpatient clinics, and connects veterans with care managers to coordinate their treatment. According to VA, as of June 2019 the  telemedicine program is being implemented in six states and 1,073 \u201chard to reach\u201d veterans have been engaged via the program.", "In 2019, QUERI published the \u201cImplementation Roadmap,\u201d a new  resource\u2014intended for a variety of users, including researchers,  clinicians, and leadership\u2014to advance research translation at VA and  provide information on how to identify, implement, and sustain evidence- based practices to improve the quality of care for veterans. The Roadmap  outlines the different stages of research implementation, specifically  delineating when research is ready to be implemented into clinical  practice. The QUERI director told us staff created the Roadmap as a  teaching tool to provide guidance on how to implement research at VA  and when to collaborate with QUERI. In addition, the director of QUERI  told us the Roadmap demonstrates the cyclical nature of research and  how implementation is part of a continuous scientific process, not an \u201cend  game.\u201d QUERI officials said that throughout the process of  implementation, new research questions might be generated, which  QUERI can use to inform further investigation or follow up studies.", "ORD\u2019s health services research service funds studies that focus on  direct application of research in clinical practice. ORD\u2019s health  services research service supports research translation by funding  studies focused on how interventions work in \u201creal world\u201d settings and on  implementing VA research findings into clinical practice. For example,  little is known about the quality of non-VA care for sex-specific services  such as mammography, according to VA, despite increasing numbers of  women veterans relying on such care due to limited availability within VA.  One study funded by this research service looked at strategies for  provision, coordination, and quality of oversight of non-VA care for  women, and assessed perceptions and experiences with non-VA care  among women veterans. Among other things, the study found VA sites  providing mammography were more likely to notify women more quickly  of abnormal results than non-VA sites, but non-VA sites were more likely  to meet guidelines for timely follow-up.", "In addition to funding individual research studies through merit review, the  health services research service funds 18 Centers of Innovation (COIN),  each of which focus on one or more areas of research that address  questions significant to clinical and operational partners. For example,  officials from the dual-site COIN in Seattle and Denver, which focuses on  veteran-centered and value-driven care, told us they are participating in a  study co-funded by VA, NIH, and DOD evaluating non-pharmacological  options to treat pain and co-occurring mental health conditions in  veterans with chronic pain; the study will be overseen by VA\u2019s Office of  Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation. According to the  research service officials, the COINs are designed to bring researchers  from multi-disciplinary research teams together to engage in research and  establish partnerships that can affect VA policies, practices, and health  care outcomes. (See text box for an example of research funded by the  health services research service that has been translated into clinical  practice.)", "Example of Research Translated into Clinical Practice across VA: Reducing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections  The Center for Innovation (COIN) in Ann Arbor, Mich., partners with VA clinical, policy, and operations leaders to implement and  evaluate ways to make health care safer, more effective, and affordable for veterans. For example, an investigator from this COIN,  funded in part through a Career Development Award, conducted research on enhancing patient safety by reducing catheter-related  infections. Then, in partnership with another VA researcher, this investigator conducted a study funded by the health services  research service and created a \u201cbundle\u201d of activities to implement in VA hospitals throughout Michigan. This included removing  catheters as soon as possible and increasing the use of recommended infection control practices. VA researchers assisted the  National Center for Patient Safety in implementing the practices, and the success of the \u201cbundle\u201d resulted in its national  implementation in more than 1,000 hospitals. VA reported that catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates decreased by 32  percent in participating general medical and surgical units.", "According to officials from the health services research service, in  addition to funding studies and COINs, the service maintains four  resource centers, which provide support to VA researchers in several  areas, including data, health economics, and dissemination. For  example, the Center for Information Dissemination and Education  Resources circulates research findings through VA newsletters,  cyberseminars, and publications and educates clinicians and researchers  on sharing findings. In addition, the center coordinates meetings and  conferences\u2014such as the service\u2019s joint national conference with  QUERI\u2014which provides an opportunity for VA researchers to present  scientific findings and discuss the implementation of findings into practice.  In 2017, the conference focused on accelerating the adoption and spread  of practices and improving VA\u2019s ability to utilize healthcare data to  enhance care for veterans.", "Officials from the health services research service told us that, starting in  2019, they began implementing two new strategies to increase the impact  of VA research on veterans\u2019 health care. First, the service began a new  effort to bring together and fund consortiums of researchers from multiple  COINs each with a particular focus on implementing evidence-based  practices in a given priority area. VA officials told us that as of October  2019, the health services research service established two consortiums of  researchers to focus on suicide prevention and opioids and pain  management. The service is planning to add two additional consortiums  in 2020 to focus on access to care and telehealth and connected care.", "Second, in 2019 the research service provided additional funding  opportunities for COINs to submit research proposals that include five- year goals for the impact of their research, such as VA policy changes or  spreading the research to additional sites, and yearly milestones for  achieving those goals. Per the request for applications, applicants\u2019  proposals must provide information on how the COINs plan to apply  health services research methods, including implementation research.  According to VA, as of October 2019, 20 proposals had been selected to  receive funding through this new strategy.", "Diffusion of Excellence Initiative aims to encourage practitioner  implementation of research-based practices outside of ORD. VA\u2019s  Diffusion of Excellence Initiative, created in 2015, established an annual  competition\u2014known as VA\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d\u2014to engage employees in  implementing innovative practices that will positively impact veterans.  According to officials from the Diffusion of Excellence Initiative, many of  these practices are based on evidence-based research. Under the  competition, \u201cinvestors\u201d (directors from VA medical centers and VISNs)  make offers on practices that have been successfully implemented in at  least one VA medical center, and the winning investor receives facilitated  implementation support so that the practice can be implemented at the  investor\u2019s medical center. The officials told us that several of these  practices have been identified as exemplary practices and are now being  used nationally across multiple VA health care settings. For example,  they described one such practice, a tooth-brushing routine implemented  for hospitalized veterans to decrease the risk of oral bacteria getting into  the veterans\u2019 lungs, which research had shown could increase their risk of  pneumonia. According to officials from the Diffusion of Excellence  Initiative, the practice decreased hospital-acquired pneumonia by 90  percent at the pilot site, and is being implemented in other VA health care  settings.", "Other VA efforts to facilitate research translation into clinical  practice. In addition to the changes to the existing efforts for facilitating  research translation, VA has recently taken other actions to help ensure  findings from VA research are integrated into practice. In response to  ORD\u2019s current strategic priority to \u201cincrease the substantial real-world  impact of VA research,\u201d the director of ORD established a workgroup to  create \u201cThe Research Lifecycle,\u201d which was published in October 2019.  The lifecycle is a resource that specifies processes to help move research  to direct application in routine clinical care. It describes the research and  implementation process from identifying innovations that align with clinical  priorities to ensuring practices are sustained in clinical care, beyond  research and implementation. For example, one phase of the process  involves evaluating interventions to determine if they are ready to be  implemented into clinical practice. The director of QUERI told us that the  information in the publication is broadly applicable across all ORD  research and that like the QUERI Implementation Roadmap, the  publication reiterates that research is a continuous process rather than a  straight line with an endpoint. In addition to the research lifecycle, an  official from the agency\u2019s Cooperative Studies Program\u2014which funds  large, multi-center clinical trials\u2014told us the program established a new  requirement in 2019 that research proposals include an implementation  plan. The goal of this change is to encourage researchers to think about  research translation from the beginning\u2014and how their work might be  translated into clinical practice, according to the program official.  Researchers planning to conduct these types of clinical trials will have the  opportunity to consult with internal implementation experts to develop  plans to translate the research into clinical practice, according to ORD  officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Officials Described Efforts to Coordinate on VA Research Priority Setting and Translation", "paragraphs": ["VA officials from both ORD and the national program offices we spoke  with described their experiences coordinating on research. Coordination  can help both to inform research priorities to make them most useful and  applicable, and to encourage the translation of research into clinical  practice, which can help VA meet its broader goal of ensuring its research  is benefiting veterans\u2019 health.", "National program offices\u2014such as those for clinical specialties including  mental health or spinal cord injury care\u2014provide input to ORD both on  research priorities and on efforts to translate research findings into clinical  practice within their respective issue areas. For example, officials from  the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention told us that their lead  staff for suicide prevention participated in strategic planning efforts with  ORD to determine a \u201croad map\u201d for current and future research in this  area. This VA program office official described working with ORD to  provide clinical perspective on gaps in research and clinical care related  to suicide prevention, among other things. Given the disproportionately  higher rate of suicide among veterans compared with the civilian  population, such coordination can help maximize VA\u2019s efforts both in  research and in clinical care. Among other things, the road map identifies  remaining questions related to suicide prevention to be addressed by VA  and other researchers, categorized by type of research (e.g.,  epidemiological or intervention).", "Coordination between the research program and national program offices  also can facilitate the conduct of the research itself, encouraging research  that is viable and relevant to be conducted and translated into practice.  For example, ORD leadership told us that program office buy-in on VA  research priorities and efforts can lead to VA clinicians being more willing  and able to participate in VA research. ORD leadership also told us that  ORD has recently begun requesting that researchers engage and  collaborate with relevant program offices during the planning process for  large multi-site clinical trials, including seeking input from program offices  on research proposals. Potential questions for researchers to ask include:  does the relevant program office think the proposal\u2019s topic is clinically  important; is the research proposal feasible; and will it answer a question  that is important from a clinical perspective? According to ORD officials,  because VA funds a small number of these types of trials\u2014which are  intended to provide a definitive answer to a clinical question\u2014researchers  want to be sure the studies are relevant to the needs of the program  offices.", "One specific example both ORD and program office officials provided was  related to their coordination on research on osseointegration\u2014a medical  procedure through which a metal rod is inserted into the bone at the site  of an amputation, allowing a prosthetic limb to be attached through the  skin directly to the remaining bone of the amputated limb. Officials from  the rehabilitation research service told us that they have been working  with program office officials to consider aspects of implementation prior to  beginning a clinical trial, including the availability of the surgical procedure  throughout VA and the types of post-operative care patients would need.  These officials told us that their goal is to ensure the clinical trial is  designed for translation.", "In addition, because national program offices establish policies that affect  the provision of care across VA, program office officials told us that  collaboration with ORD can help them to incorporate evidence-based  practices in developing and rolling out these policies. For example, an  official from the Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders System of Care program  office told us that it incorporated research findings when it revised its  national policy\u2014including a new requirement for all spinal cord injury  centers to have vocational rehabilitation counselors on staff. A program  office official told us that the addition of this requirement resulted from VA  research\u2014led by a researcher clinician\u2014that found that veterans with  spinal cord injuries who received specialized vocational support services  had the best chance of success for job placement and continued  employment. In another example, ORD officials told us that VA  researchers were serving as subject matter experts to the national  program office developing the protocol and clinical guidelines for  implementing intranasal ketamine as a new treatment for certain veterans  with treatment-resistant depression.", "ORD and program office officials described using both informal and  formal approaches to coordinate on research priorities and translation.  For example, program office officials told us about occasional  participation of ORD staff in their regular meetings and calls, as well as  relationships between program office staff and individual researchers.  ORD officials from one service told us that their scientific portfolio  managers serve as a sort of liaison between researchers and clinical  program office partners. These officials told us that because VA\u2019s  research program is intramural, there is an ongoing discussion with  researchers and others within VA in setting research priorities.", "Although VA officials were mostly positive in describing coordination  between the research program and program offices, some officials noted  opportunities for improvement, as well. Specifically, officials from the  three national program offices we spoke with said it would be beneficial to  have a more formal or systematic approach for coordination with ORD.  An official from one national program office said a more systematic  process would be helpful, so that collaboration is not so dependent on  individual relationships or personalities. Officials from another national  program office noted that they considered having one staff person as a  dedicated resource to liaise with ORD, but lacked resources to do so.", "Given limited time and competing priorities for researchers and program  office officials, ORD officials told us that it would be best to focus on  strategic coordination, and noted that some such efforts are underway.  Specifically, ORD leadership acknowledged that it would be helpful for  ORD and program offices to engage more in general\u2014particularly related  to ORD\u2019s research priorities. However, because ORD leadership said it  would not be efficient to have to go \u201cdoor to door\u201d to each individual  program office or VISN to have those discussions, it would be more  helpful to find more strategic ways to engage. For example, ORD  leadership said that ORD\u2019s inclusion in larger annual VHA strategic planning sessions could be a way to facilitate strategic coordination.  Similarly, health services research service officials told us that service\u2019s  new effort to build consortiums of researchers focused together on a  particular priority area may also facilitate coordination between  researchers and clinical program offices, particularly on key topics for VA,  such as suicide prevention and opioids. In addition, ORD leadership told  us that ORD is focusing its efforts on \u201cbig ticket items\u201d\u2014such as larger  studies or clinical trials through the Cooperative Studies Program\u2014where  there can be a big impact through collaboration with program offices,  because a single study generally does not lead to changes in clinical  practice.", "Another mechanism available to facilitate strategic coordination between  the research program and national program offices is ORD\u2019s QUERI\u2014 particularly its Partnered Evaluation Initiatives\u2014through which  researchers partner with national program offices to evaluate specific  initiatives with potentially high impact on VA national policy. For  example, QUERI investigators have partnered with the Office of Mental  Health and Suicide Prevention to evaluate an upcoming initiative to send  \u201ccaring letters\u201d to veterans who have called the Veterans\u2019 Crisis Line and  have been engaged in VA care recently. Caring letters, letters noting that  the veteran is cared about and matters, are an intervention shown to be  effective in reducing suicides in various at-risk populations. In addition,  VA program office officials told us that while most VA program offices  have their own internal program evaluation services, they do not have  sufficient resources to evaluate the effectiveness of all of their programs  and policies, motivating them instead to work with QUERI and ORD. For  example, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention has also  partnered with QUERI on the STAR VA program, to examine non- pharmacological approaches to treating agitation and other issues in  veterans with dementia. Program office officials told us that they can use  the results of these evaluations to influence policy, standard operating  procedures, and treatment in the field.", "In summary, VA is uniquely positioned to implement research into clinical  practice because of the research program\u2019s adjacency to such a large,  integrated health care system. As we have noted, coordination between  the research program and partner entities could help ensure VA-funded  research results in the spread and adoption of evidence-based practices.
