Federal support for Bus Rapid Transit projects may come from several different sources, including the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts, Bus Capital, and Urbanized Area Formula Grants programs, but its use is constrained. Two Bus Rapid Transit projects have received about $831 million in funding commitments from the current New Starts Program. Few additional Bus Rapid Transit projects will likely receive funding commitments under the current New Starts Program, which expires in 2003, because few Bus Rapid Transit projects are ready to compete for funding; many projects are eligible to compete for the $462 million that is projected to remain available for fiscal year 2003; and some types of Bus Rapid Transit projects are ineligible for New Starts funding because projects are required to operate on separate right-of-ways for the exclusive use of mass transit and high-occupancy vehicles. The Bus Rapid Transit systems generally had lower capital costs per mile than did the Light Rail systems in the cities GAO reviewed, although neither system had a clear advantage in operating costs. Precise operating cost comparisons for Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems within and between cities are difficult because of differences among transit agencies, transit systems, and how they account for costs. The performance characteristics also varied widely, with the largest Bus Rapid Transit system ridership about equal to the largest Light Rail ridership. Each program offers various advantages and disadvantages. Bus Rapid Transit provides a more flexible approach than light rail because buses can be routed to eliminate transfers; buses can operate on busways, HOV lanes, and city arterial streets; and the Bus Rapid Transit concept can be implemented in stages. However, transit officials repeatedly said that buses have a poor public image."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each day millions of Americans face traffic congestion as they commute to  work in automobiles.

For example, it is estimated that in 68 urban  areas congestion cost U.S. travelers 4.5 billion hours of delay, 6.8 billion  gallons of wasted fuel, and $78 billion in 1999.  In an attempt to present  buses as a more reliable and effective high-speed transit alternative, a  concept involving the improved use of buses--Bus Rapid Transit--has  emerged.  Bus Rapid Transit includes operating buses on exclusive bus  highways, High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, or improving service on  busier routes on city streets.  Bus Rapid Transit may also include a variety  of technological and street design improvements, including traffic signal  prioritization for buses; exclusive lanes; better stations or bus shelters;  fewer stops; faster service; and cleaner, quieter, and more attractive  vehicles.", "Bus Rapid Transit as a comprehensive transportation option is exemplified  in Curitiba, Brazil.  Curitiba\u2019s Bus Rapid Transit system is an extensive  commuter bus system that includes exclusive busways and a number of  other features designed to increase speed, such as traffic signal  prioritization, rail-like stations with level-floor boarding, and advance fare  collection.  In the United States at least 17 cities are planning to  incorporate aspects of Bus Rapid Transit.  The Department of  Transportation\u2019s Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has begun to  support this concept and expand awareness of new ways to design and  operate high capacity Bus Rapid Transit systems as an alternative to  building Light Rail systems.  Light Rail systems generally are electric trains  that may operate on streets with other traffic.", "You asked us to (1) examine the federal role in supporting Bus Rapid  Transit; (2) compare the capital costs, operating costs, and performance  characteristics of Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems; and (3)  describe the other advantages and disadvantages of Bus Rapid Transit and  Light Rail.", "To address these questions, we identified where Bus Rapid Transit is being  used extensively in the United States and determined how FTA supports  Bus Rapid Transit projects.  In addition, we visited transit agencies in  Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and San Jose to obtain  capital and operating cost information on Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail  systems in those cities.

Bus Rapid Transit is not a single  type of transit system; rather it encompasses a variety of approaches,  including buses using exclusive busways or HOV lanes with other vehicles,  and improving bus service on city arterial streets.  Busways--special  roadways designed for the exclusive use of buses--can be totally separate  roadways or operate within highway rights-of-way separated from other  traffic by barriers.  Busways currently exist in Pittsburgh, Miami, and  Charlotte.  Buses on HOV lanes operate on limited-access highways  designed for long-distance commuters.  Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los  Angeles, and Seattle provide examples of extensive HOV lane use by  buses.  Bus Rapid Transit on busways or HOV lanes is sometimes  characterized by the addition of extensive park and ride facilities along  with entrance and exit access for these lanes.  Bus Rapid Transit systems  using arterial streets may include lanes reserved for the exclusive use of  buses and street enhancements that speed buses and improve service.  Los  Angeles recently instituted a Bus Rapid Transit type of service on two bus  arterial corridors.", "Bus Rapid Transit may also include any of the following features:  Traffic signal priority.  Buses receiving an early or extended green light  at intersections reduce travel time--in Los Angeles, for example, by as  much as 10 percent.", "Boarding and fare collection improvements.  Convenient and rapid fare  collection through prepaid or electronic passes and low-floor and/or  wide-door boarding results in timesavings.", "Limited stops.  Increasing distances between stations or shelters  improves operating speeds.", "Improved stations and shelters.  Bus terminals and unique stations or  shelters differentiate Bus Rapid Transit service from standard bus  service.  (See fig. 2.)", "Intelligent Transportation System technologies.  Advanced technology  can maintain more consistent distances between buses and inform  passengers when the next bus is arriving.", "Cleaner and quieter vehicles.  Improved diesel buses and buses using  alternative-fuels are cleaner than traditional diesel buses.", "Exclusive Lanes.  Traffic lanes reserved for the exclusive use of buses  help buses pass congested traffic.", "Light Rail transit is a metropolitan-electric railway system characterized by  its ability to operate in a variety of environments such as streets, subways,  or elevated structures.

Since Light Rail systems can operate on streets with other traffic, they  typically use an overhead source for their electrical power and boardings  take place from the street or platforms.  According to a transportation  consultant, because Light Rail systems operate in both exclusive and  shared right-of-way environments, they have stricter limits on their length  and the frequency of service than heavy rail systems.", "Light Rail systems gained popularity as a lower-cost option to heavy rail  systems, and a number of cities have constructed Light Rail projects over  the past 20 years.  Since 1980, Light Rail systems have opened in 13  metropolitan areas:  Baltimore, Buffalo, Dallas, Denver, Northern New  Jersey (Hudson and Bergen counties), Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Portland,  Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, St. Louis, and Salt Lake City.

Funding for additional New  Starts projects of all types is constrained--FTA projects little remaining  authority to make funding commitments to new projects and the  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) identified a large  number of projects eligible for funding under the program.  In addition to  the New Starts Program, transit agencies may use other FTA funds, such as  those from the Bus Capital Program and the Urbanized Area Formula Grant  Program, to fund Bus Rapid Transit projects.  However, the Bus Capital  Program grants tend to be relatively small, thus limiting this program as a  significant contributor to large projects.  In addition, some Bus Rapid  Transit projects may qualify for certain types of federal highway funding,  notably Surface Transportation Program and Congestion Mitigation and Air  Quality Improvement funds administered through the Federal Highway  Administration.  Since these funds are provided to state governments, local  transit agencies must compete with many other state needs for these funds.   In addition to providing capital funding, FTA began a demonstration  program in 1999 to highlight the benefits of Bus Rapid Transit.  Under this  program, FTA awarded $50,000 grants to 10 transit agencies to share  information and data on new Bus Rapid Transit projects.

To obtain funds,  a project must progress through a local or regional review of alternatives,  develop preliminary engineering plans, and meet FTA approval of final  design.  FTA proposes New Starts projects to the Congress for funding on  an annual basis based on an evaluation of their technical merits, including  mobility improvements and cost effectiveness, and the stability of the local  financial commitment.

The total New  Starts commitment for these 26 projects is about $8.3 billion, which  includes $4.67 billion for Light Rail, $2.69 billion for Heavy Rail, and $111  million for Commuter Rail projects.", "For a number of reasons, few Bus Rapid Transit projects are likely to be  considered for New Starts funding in the final year of the period covered by  TEA-21.  First, few Bus Rapid Transit projects are ready for funding  consideration.  Only 1 of the 11 projects with pending grant agreements or  in the final design stage is a Bus Rapid Transit project.  Further, of the 31  projects in the preliminary engineering stage that have proposed about $8.3  billion in support from the New Starts program, only 6 Bus Rapid Transit  projects proposing about $490 million are included.  Reasons for the  relatively few projects being ready for funding consideration include the  newness of the Bus Rapid Transit concept and the decisions of local transit  agencies, which are responsible for conducting analyses of various  alternatives and proposing projects for funding.  Second, FTA\u2019s authority to  make new funding commitments for projects of any type will be highly  limited through 2003 if FTA makes the funding commitments proposed in  its fiscal year 2002 New Starts report and funding request.  It projects about  $462 million in remaining commitment authority for the last year of the  current program.  Lastly, some Bus Rapid Transit projects are not eligible  for New Starts funding because projects must operate on separate rights- of-way for the exclusive use of mass transit and high-occupancy vehicles.   While some Bus Rapid Transit projects, such as busways, would fit this  requirement, some would not.  For example, the Wilshire-Whittier Bus  Rapid Transit Service in Los Angeles operates on city streets in mixed  traffic; it is not, therefore, on a separate right-of-way."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Can Use Other Federal Funds for Bus Rapid Transit Projects", "paragraphs": ["Local transit agencies may use other types of federal funds, in addition to  New Starts funds, to build Bus Rapid Transit and other systems.  For  example, transit agencies can apply funds obtained through FTA\u2019s  Urbanized Area Formula Grant program to Bus Rapid Transit and rail  projects.  This program provides capital and operating assistance to  urbanized areas with populations of more than 50,000.  However, areas  with populations over 200,000 may only use the funds for capital  improvements.  For example, in fiscal year 2001, one Bus Rapid Transit  project, Boston\u2019s Silver Line project, planned to use $150 million from the  formula grant program, about $331 million from the New Starts Program,  and $120 million in Massachusetts state bond funds.  In addition, one  commuter rail, one heavy rail, and six Light Rail projects planned to use  about $629 million in formula grant funds, in addition to New Starts funds,  as part of their overall funding.", "An additional potential source for bus system improvements is the Bus  Capital Program, which provides funds to states and local transit agencies  for bus improvements.  This program is characterized by a large number of  relatively small grants.  For example, for fiscal year 2001 the Congress  appropriated about $574.1 million for 314 grants, ranging from $39,000 to  $15.5 million; the largest amounts typically were provided for statewide bus  grants.  While these funds can be combined with funds from other  programs, such as New Starts, they are generally not sufficient to fund a  major Bus Rapid Transit project alone.", "Bus Rapid Transit and other transit projects can qualify for certain types of  federal highway funds administered by the Federal Highway  Administration.  For example, transit agencies have used Surface  Transportation Program and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality  Improvement funds to help pay for transit projects.  Neither of the two Bus  Rapid Transit projects with Full Funding Grant Agreements in fiscal year  2001 planned to use federal highway funds.  Six of the Light Rail projects  with Full Funding Grant Agreements plan to use about $171 million in  federal highway funds.

FTA promotes the Bus Rapid Transit concept with  the slogan \u201cthink rail, use buses.\u201d", "In 1999, the FTA initiated a demonstration program to generate familiarity  and interest in Bus Rapid Transit.  The goal of the program was to promote  improved bus service similar to model systems in Curitiba, Brazil; Adelaide,  Australia; and Ottawa, Canada, as an alternative to more capital-intensive  rail projects.  The program initially provided $50,000 to 10 transit agencies  to share information and data on new Bus Rapid Transit projects.  FTA  wanted the Bus Rapid Transit program to show how using technological  advancements and improving the image of buses would allow buses to  increase ridership and operate with the speed, reliability, and efficiency of  Light Rail.  The grantees in the demonstration program may be eligible for  federal capital funds such as New Starts, Bus Capital, and Urbanized Area  Formula Grant funds.  FTA has held workshops for consortium members  focusing on developing Bus Rapid Transit's component features, such as  vehicles, image, marketing, fare collection, and traffic operations.  (See fig.  4.)", "Some locations participating in the demonstration program have more  extensive elements of a Bus Rapid Transit system than others.  For  example, Miami and Charlotte have busways for the exclusive use of buses,  while San Jose is implementing technological and service improvements  such as signal prioritization on a high-ridership HOV lane arterial corridor.   In Eugene, plans are to purchase buses that will have a train-like  appearance and operate on special bus lanes (see fig. 5).  In Cleveland, an  extensive Bus Rapid Transit project is planned that involves the extensive  reconstruction of Euclid Avenue, including signal prioritization, bus station  structures, and reconstruction of the sidewalks along the corridor.

For 13 cities that  built Light Rail lines, since 1980, capital costs averaged about $34.8 million  per mile, ranging from $12.4 million to $118.8 million per mile, when  escalated to 2000 dollars.  On a capital cost per-mile basis, the three  different types of Bus Rapid Transit systems have average capital cost that  are 39 percent, 26 percent, and 2 percent of the average cost of Light Rail  systems we reviewed.", "Bus Rapid Transit capital costs vary considerably, depending on the type of  system built.  Costs of Bus Rapid Transit projects include the cost of the  roadway\u2014busways or bus lanes, station structures, park-and-ride facilities,  communications and improved traffic signal systems, and vehicles, if  additional or special buses are needed for the project.  Given the variety of  ways in which Bus Rapid Transit may be designed, we classified the  systems into three broad categories: busways, bus-HOV lanes, and Bus  Rapid Transit on arterial streets. Appendixes III and IV provide information  on the Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems that we analyzed.", "Exclusive busways, which are essentially separate highways for buses,  generally had the highest capital cost per mile for those systems we  analyzed, averaging $13.5 million per mile in 2000 dollars.  The capital costs  of nine busways in four cities ranged from $7 million to $55 million per  mile.  The most expensive one was the Pittsburgh West Busway, which  cost significantly more than other busways we analyzed.  However,  according to local transit agency officials, they needed to construct only 5  miles of busway to achieve their goal of rapid transit to the airport because  the buses could exit the busway and use existing highways.  They added  that an alternative Light Rail system would have been longer, cost two to  three times as much to construct and significantly more to operate and  maintain, while attracting essentially no additional passengers.", "Other types of Bus Rapid Transit systems had lower capital costs.  For HOV  facilities where buses used HOV lanes in five cities we reviewed, capital  costs ranged from $1.8 million to $37.6 million per mile.  For bus-HOV  facilities we considered the capital cost of HOV lanes, bus stations, park- and-ride facilities, and additional vehicles.  See appendix I for additional  details.", "Bus Rapid Transit improvements on arterial streets can have the lowest  cost per mile.  For example, Los Angeles completed the Wilshire Boulevard  and Ventura lines at a cost of about $200,000 per mile.  These two lines  operate on major arterial streets, but without a dedicated right-of-way.  The  Bus Rapid Transit improvements included in this cost were signal  prioritization, improved stations, and real-time information systems  informing riders of bus arrival times.  While this type of surface street  treatment was the least expensive Bus Rapid Transit option in the cities we  reviewed, Bus Rapid Transit lines on arterial streets can have higher costs  if they involve more extensive construction, such as building special bus  lanes.  In Orlando Bus Rapid Transit on arterial streets included lane  construction and vehicle costs, and averaged $9.6 million per mile.", "Light Rail systems we reviewed also vary considerably in their capital cost  per mile.  Included in capital costs are the stations, structures, signal  systems, power systems, utility relocation, rights-of-way, maintenance  facilities, transit vehicles, and project oversight. Again, we adjusted the  historic capital cost of the projects to fiscal year 2000 dollars to provide a  better basis of comparison.  For the systems we reviewed the cost per mile  for Light Rail averaged $34.8 million per mile, ranging from $12.4 million to  $118.8 million per mile.", "The higher capital costs per mile for Light Rail systems compared with Bus  Rapid Transit arise from several factors.  First, Light Rail systems contain  elements not required in Bus Rapid Transit systems.  Light Rail systems  typically require train signal, communications, and electrical power  systems with overhead wires to deliver power to trains.  A consultant study  of eight Light Rail lines in five cities (Dallas, St. Louis, Denver, Salt Lake  City, and Portland) found the average costs of these elements to be $2.8  million per mile.  Light Rail systems also require additional materials  needed for the guideway--rail, ties, and track ballast.  In addition, if a Light  Rail maintenance facility does not exist, one must be built and equipped.   Finally, Light Rail vehicles, while having higher carrying capacity than most  buses, also cost more--about $2.5 million each.  In contrast, according to  transit industry consultants, a typical 40-foot transit bus costs about  $283,000 and an articulated, higher capacity bus costs about $420,000.   However, buses that incorporate newer technologies for low emissions or  that run on more than one fuel can cost more than $1 million each.  For  example, the Boston Silver Line low-floor, articulated, compressed natural  gas-hybrid electric buses will cost $1.5 million each according to FTA  officials.", "Another factor that can affect the cost of the systems is the amount and  availability of required right-of-way.  Right-of-way costs are affected by the  design requirements of Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail.  Transit planners  told us that a basic busway required a wider right-of-way than Light Rail.   They estimated a two-lane busway required a right-of-way about 30 feet  wide, compared with 24 feet wide for a double-track Light Rail system.   Regardless of the transportation mode---bus or rail\u2014the basic design has a  major effect on the capital costs.  Specifically, projects that use tunneling  or elevated structures are more expensive than those with surface level  construction.  For example, the Boston South Piers Transitway, a 1-mile  tunnel with three stations built adjacent to the Boston Central  Artery/Tunnel project, has an estimated cost of $601 million.  Tunneling can  be three to six times more expensive than surface construction, regardless  of the type of system\u2014bus or rail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Costs Vary for Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail Systems", "paragraphs": ["We found mixed results when we compared the operating costs for Bus  Rapid Transit and Light Rail in each of the six cities that operated both  types of systems.

We also compared these measures, correcting for vehicle  capacity.  Each measure resulted in somewhat different relative operating  cost levels.", "Part of the reason for the variation in results is that the Bus Rapid Transit  systems in our example cities operate in different ways.  The systems  ranged from arterial bus routes in Los Angeles to freeway express buses on  barrier-separated HOV lanes in Denver, Dallas, and San Diego to exclusive  busways in Pittsburgh.  In addition, the Light Rail systems in these cities  also serve different functions in different ways.  The Light Rail systems  range from local distributor systems sharing downtown city streets with  cars and trucks, as in Dallas and Denver, to commuter-type service along  tracks separated from all other traffic, such as the Los Angeles Green Line.   The route, type of service, size of vehicles, and function of the systems\u2014 long haul commuter service or downtown circulator\u2014each have an impact  on the operating cost.  Greater speed can also lower operating and capital  costs by permitting a bus route or rail line to be serviced with fewer  vehicles.", "Operating costs for Bus Rapid Transit systems included such costs as  driver's salaries, fuel, vehicle maintenance, and maintenance of the busway  or HOV lane.  In Dallas it also includes the cost to move 5.2 miles of road  barriers twice each day to change the direction of an HOV lane that the Bus  Rapid Transit system and other HOVs use as well as the cost to provide  daily enforcement of lane restrictions and motorist assistance.  Light Rail  operating costs include driver's salaries, electricity, and maintenance of the  vehicles and track system.

According to one transit expert, Bus Rapid Transit lines often run  only during the busiest rush hour periods while Light Rail systems typically  offer all-day service, which may in part explain this result.", "Transit operating costs can also be measured on a per passenger trip basis.   Operating cost per passenger trip measures the total annual operating cost  divided by the total annual passenger boardings, regardless of whether the  passenger is transferring from a bus to a Light Rail vehicle, or vice versa.   Thus, it shows how much it costs to carry a person on a trip, regardless of  the length of that trip.  Using this measure, four of six Bus Rapid Transit  routes had lower operating costs per passenger trip than did Light Rail  systems, as shown in figure 9.", "The wide disparities in operating costs and ridership levels are likely due to  the variety of Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems we reviewed.  For  example, our evaluation of Bus Rapid Transit service in Dallas included the  costs to move 5.2 miles of barriers twice a day to allow Bus Rapid Transit  and other HOVs to use the lanes, as well as enforcement and roadway  assistance costs.  In Los Angeles, the Bus Rapid Transit service on the  Wilshire-Whittier line has very high ridership\u2014about as high as the highest  ridership levels achieved by Light Rail lines in the United States.  High  ridership generally reduces the cost per rider.  In contrast, both San Diego  and San Jose have lower Bus Rapid Transit ridership, which contributes to  higher costs per rider.  In addition, vehicle sizes and passenger capacity can  vary greatly between Light Rail and bus vehicles, which can affect vehicle- based comparisons.   The Light Rail systems also have varied functions  that can affect operating costs.

We found that while ridership varied considerably, the largest  ridership on Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems were quite similar.   We also found that speed varied but that Bus Rapid Transit projects in our  review were generally faster.  This was likely due to the nature of the Bus  Rapid Transit systems that we visited; express bus operations or operations  with longer stop spacing have higher speeds.", "We found that ridership on Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail systems varies  widely and depends, in part, on frequency of service, number of stops,  hours of operation, and customer demand.  For example, ridership on 4  busways ranged from 7,000 riders per day to about 30,000 per day and  averaged about 15,600 riders per day.  For 13 bus lines on HOV lanes,  ridership ranged from 1,000 to about 25,000 riders per day, with an average  ridership of about 8,100.  In addition, the ridership on the two arterial street  Bus Rapid Transit lines in Los Angeles was about 9,000 to 56,000 per day,  with an average of 32,500 per day.  The highest Bus Rapid Transit ridership  was on Los Angeles\u2019 Wilshire-Whitter line, which runs buses about every 5  minutes and operates all day.  Light Rail system ridership also varies  widely.  For example, ridership on 18 Light Rail lines ranged from 7,000  riders to 57,000 daily riders and averaged about 29,000 per day.  The largest  Light Rail ridership was also found in Los Angeles on its Blue Line.", "According to a transportation consultant, system speeds generally depend  on characteristics such as the distance between stops, fare-collection  methods, and the degree to which the tracks or roadway are exclusive to  transit vehicles or share right-of-way with cars and other vehicular traffic,  as both buses and Light Rail lines typically do in downtown areas.  In the  cities with both Bus Rapid Transit and Light Rail, Bus Rapid Transit speeds  were higher than Light Rail in five of six cities.  The high-speed Bus Rapid  Transit lines, as shown in figure 10, are generally commuter bus routes that  run much or their entire route on highway HOV lanes.", "Bus Rapid Transit improvements to service such as exclusive bus lanes,  skipped stops, dual bus lanes, and busways each may provide incremental  improvements in vehicle speeds.  Improvements such as bus traffic signal  priority, level boarding onto low-floor buses, schedules based on time  between buses rather than set schedules, fewer stops, and active  management of bus spacing and traffic signal priority from a bus  operations control center, can also each contribute to better service.

Bus Rapid Transit generally has the advantage of (1) having more flexibility  than Light Rail, (2) being able to phase in service rather than having to wait  for an entire system to be built, and (3) being used as an interim system  until Light Rail is built.  Transit operators with experience in Bus Rapid  Transit systems told us that one of the challenges faced by Bus Rapid  Transit is the negative stigma potential riders attach to buses regarding  their noise, pollution, and quality of ride.  Light Rail has advantages,  according to transit officials, associated with increased economic  development and improved community image.  On the negative side,  building a Light Rail system can have a tendency to provide a bias toward  building additional rail lines in the future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bus Rapid Transit Is Generally More Flexible Than Light Rail", "paragraphs": ["Bus Rapid Transit systems operate more flexibly than Light Rail systems.   Bus Rapid Transit can respond to changes in employment, land-use, and  community patterns by increasing or decreasing capacity.  Bus Rapid  Transit routes can also be adjusted and rerouted over time to serve new  developments and dispersed employment centers that may have resulted  from urban sprawl.  For example, an official in San Jose noted that  because of development outside the city center, there are now eight  employment centers that need to be considered in its transit analysis.  On  the other hand, Light Rail lines are fixed and cannot easily change to adjust  to new patterns of housing and employment.  For example, the western  portion of the Los Angeles Light Rail Green Line was built in part to provide  mass transit service for workers in defense production facilities in Los  Angeles.  However, by the time the Green Line opened these facilities had  been closed.  As a result, projected ridership levels were not achieved.", "Although Bus Rapid Transit sometimes uses rail-style park-and-ride lots,  Bus Rapid Transit routes can also collect riders in neighborhoods and then  provide rapid long-distance service by entering a busway or HOV facility.   Transit agencies have considerable flexibility to provide long distance  service without requiring a transfer between vehicles.  This is a significant  benefit, because some research has shown that transit riders view  transferring to be a significant disincentive to using mass transit.  In  contrast, Light Rail systems frequently require a transfer of some type\u2014 either from a bus or a private automobile.  When Light Rail lines are  introduced, transit agencies commonly reroute their bus systems to feed  the rail line.  This can have the effect of making overall bus operations less  efficient when the highest-ridership bus route has been replaced by Light  Rail; the short feeder bus routes can be relatively costly.", "Finally, bus-based systems\u2019 ability to operate both on and off a busway or  bus lane provides Bus Rapid Transit the flexibility to respond to operating  problems.  For example, buses can pass disabled vehicles, while Light Rail  trains can be delayed behind a stalled train or other vehicle on the tracks.   Thus, the impact of a breakdown of a Bus Rapid Transit vehicle is limited,  while a disabled Light Rail train may disrupt portions of the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bus Rapid Transit Operation Can Be Phased in", "paragraphs": ["Bus Rapid Transit systems differ from Light Rail systems in that they  provide greater flexibility in how they can be implemented and operated.   In constructing a Bus Rapid Transit system, it is not necessary to include all  the final elements before beginning operations; it is possible to phase in  improvements over time.  Improvements such as signal prioritization and  low-floor buses, which improve capacity and bus speed, can be added  incrementally.  These incremental changes can have significant effects.  For  example, one Los Angeles Bus Rapid Transit route increased its speed and  cut 10 percent off its schedule time, by installing signal priority for buses to  provide several additional seconds to allow buses to pass through  intersections before the signal changed.  Overall, the line was able to  reduce travel time by 29 percent with all the improvements.

While transit officials noted a public bias  toward Light Rail, research has found that riders have no preference for rail  over bus when service characteristics are equal.", "While environmental benefits have helped justify Light Rail systems, the  gap in environmental benefits between rail and buses may be narrowing.   FTA and bus manufacturers have focused on improving the design of buses  not just to increase their attractiveness, but also to reduce their noise levels  and emissions.  In December 1999, we reported that diesel buses are  becoming much cleaner.  We noted that according to the EPA, emissions  from individual buses declined substantially between 1988 and 1999.   Improvements in diesel technology have resulted in heavy-duty diesel  engines that are more reliable and less polluting than their predecessors.   In addition, we found that newer buses can use alternative fuels, such as  liquefied natural gas, fuel cells, and hybrid technologies, which may have  some beneficial effect on urban air quality as they are adopted into bus  fleets.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, FTA officials said that the poor  image of buses was probably a result of a history of slow bus service due to  congested streets, slow boarding and fare collection, and traffic lights.  Bus  Rapid Transit is essentially designed to eliminate delays and provide faster  service on better vehicles.  FTA believes that the image of buses can be  improved over time through bus service that incorporates Bus Rapid  Transit features.

Several city transit  officials and transit consultants told us that communities see Light Rail as a  mark that a city is \"world-class,\" and could help a city improve its image  and ability to attract economic development.  According to transit agency  officials, because Light Rail systems have permanent stations and routes,  developers are more likely to locate new business, residential, or retail  development along a Light Rail line than along a bus route.  For example,  Dallas transit officials cited $800 million in commercial development along  its Light Rail line.  The Light Rail line itself cost $860 million to build in  1994, so these officials saw the Light Rail line as an excellent investment.   On the other hand, San Jose transit officials noted that while some  residential development had occurred along its Light Rail line, the  expectation is for changes in land use over a longer period of time, perhaps  over 20 years, resulting in a more densely developed corridor.", "Transit officials we interviewed disagreed on the extent that Bus Rapid  Transit could spur economic development.  For example, officials in Dallas  said they had not experienced development near their Bus-HOV stations  that they could trace to the Bus Rapid Transit service.  However, the  Director of the Cleveland Bus Rapid Transit project cited development  already occurring in the Euclid Avenue corridor in anticipation of the Bus  Rapid Transit line.  Here the Bus Rapid Transit line would operate much  like a Light Rail system, with the same kind of fixed route on city streets  and identifiable station structures that allow for transit-oriented  development on Light Rail routes.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, FTA officials said that Light Rail\u2019s  economic development impact comes about, in part, because of the high  capital investment that gives a sense of permanence.  Rail\u2019s economic  development impact at stations also results from a pattern of rail service  where there is excellent service to rail stations but much poorer service  requiring a transfer beyond the stations.  According to FTA officials, most  development attributed to rail service occurs within walking distance of  the rail station.  In contrast, bus service that can leave the guideway and  eliminate the need for a transfer places less emphasis on the stations as a  focus for economic development.
