Section 404 of the Clean Water Act generally prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, which include certain wetlands, without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). To help achieve the goal of no net loss, the Corps can require compensatory mitigation, such as restoring a former wetland, as a condition of a permit when the loss of wetlands is unavoidable. Permittees can perform the mitigation or pay a third party--a mitigation bank or an in-lieu-fee arrangement--to perform the mitigation. GAO was asked to review the (1) guidance the Corps has issued for overseeing compensatory mitigation, (2) extent to which the Corps oversees compensatory mitigation, and (3) enforcement actions the Corps can take if required mitigation is not performed and the extent to which it takes these actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has developed guidance that establishes two primary oversight activities for compensatory mitigation: requiring the parties performing mitigation to periodically submit monitoring reports to the Corps and conducting compliance inspections of the mitigation. However, parts of the guidance are vague or internally inconsistent. For example, the guidance suggests that the Corps place a high priority on requiring and reviewing monitoring reports when \"substantial mitigation\" is required, but it does not define substantial mitigation. Furthermore, one section of the guidance directs district officials to conduct compliance inspections of a relatively high percentage of compensatory mitigation sites, while another section designates these inspections as a low priority, leading to confusion by Corps officials. Overall, the seven Corps districts GAO visited performed limited oversight to determine the status of compensatory mitigation. The Corps required monitoring reports for 89 of the 152 permit files reviewed where the permittee was required to perform compensatory mitigation. However, only 21 of these files contained evidence that the Corps received these reports. Moreover, only 15 percent of the 152 permit files contained evidence that the Corps had conducted a compliance inspection. The Corps districts provided somewhat more oversight for mitigation performed by the 85 mitigation banks and 12 in-lieu-fee arrangements that GAO reviewed. For the 60 mitigation banks that were required to submit monitoring reports, 70 percent of the files contained evidence that the Corps had received at least one monitoring report. However, only 36 percent of the mitigation bank files that GAO reviewed contained evidence that the Corps conducted an inspection. For the 6 in-lieu-fee arrangements that were required to submit monitoring reports to the Corps, 5 had submitted at least one report. In addition, the Corps had conducted inspections of 5 of the 12 arrangements. The Corps can take a variety of enforcement actions if required compensatory mitigation is not performed. These actions include issuing compliance orders, assessing administrative penalties of up to $27,500, requiring the permittee to forfeit a bond, suspending or revoking a permit, implementing the enforcement provisions of agreements with third parties, and recommending legal actions. District officials rarely use these actions and rely primarily on negotiation to resolve any violations. In some cases, GAO found district officials may not be able to use enforcement actions after detecting instances of noncompliance because they have limited their enforcement capabilities. For example, because they did not always specify the requirements of compensatory mitigation in the permits, they had no legal recourse for noncompliance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Wetlands such as bogs, swamps, and marshes support a number of valuable  functions\u2014controlling floods, improving water quality, and providing  wildlife habitat, among other things. Given the value of these functions, the  administration set a national goal in 1989 of balancing the losses and gains  of wetlands to achieve no net loss of wetlands. Each subsequent President  has reaffirmed and expanded this goal to achieve net gains of wetlands in  the long term. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for  processing permit applications from individuals and businesses seeking to  build driveways, houses, golf courses, or commercial buildings or perform  other activities that could degrade or destroy wetlands on their property,  and each year the Corps approves thousands of these permit applications.  The Corps\u2019 decisions are to reflect the national concern for both the  protection and utilization of important resources.", "Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps and the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) regulate activities affecting wetlands. Under  related regulations and guidance issued by these agencies, a permittee is  expected to avoid deliberate discharge of fill materials into wetlands or  other federally regulated waters and then to minimize discharges that  cannot be avoided. If such discharges are unavoidable, the Corps can  require mitigation to compensate for the loss and/or degradation of  wetlands from permitted activities as a condition of issuing the permit.  Such compensatory mitigation could involve (1) creating a new wetland,  (2) restoring a former wetland, (3) enhancing a degraded wetland, or (4)  preserving an existing wetland. Since 1993, the Corps has required such  mitigation on more than 40,000 acres of land per year. Permittees may  perform their own compensatory mitigation, often on or near the project  site, or they may pay another entity to perform mitigation, usually at a  location away from the project site, but generally within the same  watershed. This kind of mitigation, known as third-party mitigation, is  typically performed by mitigation banks or sponsors of in-lieu-fee  arrangements. Mitigation banks are often private for-profit entities with  land in areas where they believe that they can successfully establish  wetlands. These areas include those that have the potential to become  wetlands, previously filled wetlands, wetlands that have been degraded by  invasive plant species, or wetlands that are threatened by development.  After the mitigation banks improve these areas as wetlands, permittees  required to perform compensatory mitigation pay fees to the mitigation  bank to fulfill their mitigation requirements. In contrast to mitigation  banks, in-lieu-fee arrangements are often sponsored by public or nonprofit  entities. Under agreements with the Corps, in-lieu-fee sponsors receive  payments from multiple permittees required to perform compensatory  mitigation. Then, at a later date, the sponsors use these funds to establish  wetlands.", "The Corps is responsible for ensuring that permittees, mitigation banks,  and in-lieu-fee sponsors perform required compensatory mitigation.  However, the Corps historically has not emphasized oversight of such  mitigation activities. In 1988, we reported that the Corps placed a high  priority on issuing permits and did not routinely inspect project sites to  ensure that permittees were in compliance with their permit conditions,  which include any compensatory mitigation that the permittee was  required to perform. More recently, the National Research Council,  environmental groups, and others have raised concerns that the Corps may  not spend sufficient time on oversight to ensure that permittees or third  parties are performing the required compensatory mitigation.", "In this context, you asked us to review the (1) guidance the Corps has  established for overseeing compensatory mitigation, (2) extent to which  the Corps oversees compensatory mitigation, and (3) enforcement actions  the Corps can take if it determines that compensatory mitigation  requirements are not being met and the extent to which it takes such  actions.", "In conducting our work, we selected 7 of the 38 Corps districts that  implement the section 404 program\u2014Charleston, South Carolina;  Galveston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; St. Paul,  Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Wilmington, North Carolina. We  selected these districts because they represent different geographic areas  of the United States and collectively accounted for over two-thirds of the  compensatory mitigation required by individual permits issued in fiscal  year 2003. To identify the guidance the Corps has established for  overseeing compensatory mitigation, we examined Corps documents and  interviewed officials from Corps headquarters, as well as from Corps\u2019  district offices.", "To determine the extent to which the Corps oversees compensatory  mitigation, we reviewed a total of 249 files. We reviewed 152 permit files  issued in fiscal year 2000 where the permittee was responsible for the  mitigation. We selected this time frame because most of the permits we  reviewed were valid for 5 years or less, and sufficient time would have  passed for the permittee to begin work on the permitted project and for the  Corps to have received a monitoring report or conducted a compliance  inspection. We also reviewed files for 85 mitigation banks and 12 in-lieu-fee  arrangements. The mitigation bank and in-lieu-fee arrangement files we  reviewed usually provided data on the mitigation activities for multiple  permittees, and the mitigation conducted can encompass thousands of  acres. While our results cannot be generalized to all 38 Corps districts,  according to a Corps official responsible for managing the program  nationally, our findings would most likely represent program  implementation by other Corps districts. We also interviewed district  officials to obtain additional information on how they oversee  compensatory mitigation.", "To identify enforcement actions the Corps can take if it determines that  compensatory mitigation requirements are not being met and the extent to  which it takes these actions, we examined agency regulations and  documents that outline available enforcement actions, reviewed agency  data on noncompliance cases, and discussed levels of noncompliance and  actions taken with district officials. In addition, we interviewed several  sponsors of mitigation banks and a sponsor of an in-lieu-fee arrangement to  obtain their perspectives on the Corps\u2019 mitigation program.

They are  characterized by three factors: (1) frequent or prolonged presence of water  at or near the soil surface, (2) hydric soils that form under flooded or  saturated conditions, and (3) plants that are adapted to live in these types  of soils. Wetlands are found throughout the United States. They may differ  greatly in their physical characteristics; for example, water may not be  present on the wetland for part of the year or it may be present year-round.  Figures 1 and 2 show two different types of wetlands\u2014a marsh and a  bayou.", "Wetlands provide many important functions for the environment and for  society. For example, wetlands   improve water quality by removing excess nutrients from sources such  as fertilizer applied to agricultural land and municipal sewage and by  trapping other pollutants in soil particles;  reduce the harmful effects of weather events by storing flood waters  and buffering roads and houses from the storm surges caused by  hurricanes; and  provide important habitat for plants and wildlife\u2014more than one-third  of threatened and endangered species, such as the whooping crane and  Florida panther, live in wetlands.", "Over half of the estimated 220 million acres of wetlands in the contiguous  United States during colonial times have disappeared, and many of the  remaining wetlands have been degraded. This loss in wetlands was  primarily caused by agricultural activities and development; significant  wetland loss continued through the mid-1970s. While the economic  pressure to develop wetlands continues today, according to the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, the rate of wetland loss has decreased significantly  over the past 30 years.", "The decrease in the rate of wetlands loss stems from executive actions and  legislation, prompted by an increased recognition of the benefits of  wetlands. In 1977, the first executive order for the protection of wetlands  directed federal agencies to take action to minimize the destruction of  wetlands and to preserve and enhance wetlands\u2019 benefits when carrying  out responsibilities such as managing federal lands and facilities or  providing federally financed construction. Subsequently, in 1989, the  administration set a national goal of no net loss of wetlands to ensure that  these valuable resources are protected.", "The Clean Water Act provides the primary legislative authority for federal  efforts to regulate wetlands and other waters of the United States. The  act\u2019s objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and  biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters. The section 404 program under  the Clean Water Act is the principal federal program that provides  regulatory protection for wetlands. Section 404 generally prohibits the  discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States, which  include certain wetlands, without a permit from the Corps. Responsibility  for issuing these permits is delegated to 38 Corps district offices. The Corps  requires the permittee to first avoid discharges of dredged or fill materials  into wetlands and then to minimize discharges that cannot be avoided. To  replace lost wetland functions, the Corps can require compensatory  mitigation as a condition of issuing a permit when damage or degradation  of wetlands is unavoidable.", "Compensatory mitigation can consist of creating a new wetland, restoring a  former wetland, enhancing a degraded wetland, or preserving an existing  wetland. According to Corps guidance, compensatory mitigation should  generally provide, at a minimum, one-to-one functional replacement for a  lost wetland. When determining the type, size, and nature of  compensatory mitigation to be performed, district officials may consider  factors such as the wetland\u2019s location, the rarity of the ecosystem, water  levels, vegetation, wildlife usage, and the presence of endangered species.  In some cases, the loss of the functions of a certain wetland area may be  offset by either a larger or a smaller wetland area. For example, on an  acreage basis, the ratio should be greater than one-to-one when the lost  wetland functions are high and the replacement wetlands provide lower  functions.", "In the absence of information about the functions of a certain site, acreage  may be used instead to determine the amount of compensatory mitigation  to help achieve the national goal of no net loss. Figure 3 shows land before  and after a wetland restoration project.", "Compensatory mitigation may be performed by permittees or third parties.  Third-party mitigation is typically performed by mitigation banks, which  are generally private for-profit entities that establish wetlands under  agreements with the Corps, or under in-lieu-fee arrangements, which are  often sponsored by public or nonprofit entities. Under mitigation banking  guidance issued in 1995 and in-lieu-fee guidance issued in 2000, mitigation  bank and in-lieu-fee sponsors should have formal, written agreements with  the Corps, developed in consultation with EPA and other resource agencies  such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to provide frameworks for how  the mitigation bank or in-lieu-fee arrangement will operate. According to  Corps guidance, these written agreements should include information on   the mitigation site, including the types of wetlands to be developed, the  conditions of any existing wetlands, and the geographic area; and   site management, such as   monitoring plans and reporting protocols on the progress of the   remedial actions and the parties responsible for performing them if  the mitigation is not successful,  accounting procedures for tracking payments received from  permittees,  performance standards for determining ecological success of the   provisions for long-term management and maintenance.", "The Corps and EPA, which have joint enforcement authorities for the  section 404 program, established a memorandum of agreement allocating  enforcement responsibilities between the two agencies. According to this  agreement, the Corps is the lead enforcement agency for all violations of  Corps-issued permits, while EPA is the lead enforcement agency when  unpermitted activities occur in wetlands. Historically, the Corps has not  emphasized enforcement activities. In 1988, we reported that many Corps  permits were not monitored for compliance with permit conditions, the  Corps districts we visited at that time did not place a high priority on  detecting unauthorized impacts to wetlands, and the frequent lack of  monitoring could result in the loss of valuable wetland resources.

However, the standard operating procedures also designate all  compliance inspections as a low-priority activity, to be performed only if  the goals for other higher-priority work, such as issuing permits, have been  achieved. Furthermore, the guidance states that the degree to which  districts perform lower priority work would affect whether districts  received additional resources. District officials told us that in the past they  were instructed that if they spent too many resources on low-priority  activities, their budget would be reduced. Consequently, a number of  district officials told us that they are unsure of how much time to spend on  compliance inspections. According to officials in one district we visited, for  instance, the number of sites they were inspecting was based on a target  set in the 1991 guidance because the current guidance is not as specific.  Other districts do not have a specific goal for the number of inspections  that district officials will conduct for mitigation activities.

For example, once the Corps  has agreed that a permittee\u2019s mitigation requirements will be satisfied by a  mitigation bank or in-lieu-fee arrangement, the permittee satisfies these  mitigation requirements by submitting the required payment to the third- party sponsor. Federal guidance for mitigation banks states, \u201cit is extremely  important that an enforceable mechanism be adopted establishing the  responsibility of the bank sponsor to develop and operate the bank  properly.\u201d The guidance states that the bank sponsor is responsible for  securing sufficient funds or other financial assurances in the form of,  among other things, performance bonds, irrevocable trusts, escrow  accounts, and letters of credit. In addition, \u201cthe banking agreement should  stipulate the general procedures for identifying and implementing remedial  measures at a bank.\u201d Similarly, federal guidance states that an in-lieu-fee  agreement should contain, among other things, \u201cfinancial, technical and  legal provisions for remedial actions and responsibilities (e.g., contingency  fund)\u201d; \u201cfinancial, technical and legal provisions for long-term management  and maintenance (e.g., trust)\u201d; and a \u201cprovision that clearly states that the  legal responsibility for ensuring mitigation terms are fully satisfied rests  with the organization accepting the fee.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps Districts Rely Primarily on Negotiation", "paragraphs": ["While the Corps may take a variety of enforcement actions, the seven  districts did not take any enforcement actions in fiscal year 2003, the latest  year for which data is available. Instead, district officials primarily rely on  negotiation, a first step in the Corps\u2019 enforcement process, to resolve  noncompliance issues. In keeping with Corps regulations, district officials  told us that, when they find that required compensatory mitigation has not  been performed, they first notify the responsible party and gather relevant  information to better understand the noncompliance case. They then  attempt to negotiate by discussing with the permittees or third parties  available corrective actions and time frames for voluntarily bringing the  work into compliance. For example, at one district, officials told us that  corrective actions by responsible parties could include working with an  environmental organization such as The Nature Conservancy to improve  wetlands or developing a traveling exhibit for local schools to educate  children about the value of protecting wetlands. According to Corps  officials, no additional action is needed generally because responsible  parties are willing to work with the Corps to get back into compliance.", "If district officials do not succeed in voluntarily bringing the responsible  party into compliance, they notify the responsible party in writing, laying  out potential enforcement actions available to the Corps and time frames  for the party to respond to the letter\u2014the next step toward achieving  compliance. District officials told us they generally resort to such actions  to achieve compliance only after negotiation has failed because such  actions usually take more time to implement. For example, one district  official estimated that when the Corps refers a noncompliance case to the  Department of Justice, district officials may be occupied for several  months. Similarly, according to Corps officials, developers prefer to  negotiate with the Corps because it is less time-consuming than pursuing  legal solutions. In addition, use of enforcement actions does not always  ensure that the required compensatory mitigation will be completed. For  instance, Corps district officials told us, while monetary penalties are an  effective tool that draws attention to compliance and enforcement, the  funds collected from assessing these penalties are required by law to go  into the general fund of the federal Treasury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps Sometimes Limits Its Own Enforcement Ability", "paragraphs": ["On occasion, district officials wanting to pursue enforcement actions after  detecting instances of noncompliance may not be able to do so because  they have limited their enforcement capabilities; that is, they have not  specified the requirements for compensatory mitigation in permits and  failed to establish agreements with third parties. In our file review, we  identified several permits that lacked this crucial information about  required mitigation. Both the Chief of the Regulatory Branch and district  officials stress the importance of including specific mitigation information  in permits so that the Corps can take actions necessary to ensure required  compensatory mitigation occurs. However, some of the districts we visited  acknowledged that the lack of enforceable conditions included within a  permit has been a problem and they have efforts under way, such as permit  reviews and standardized permit conditions, to ensure that future permits  are issued with the conditions needed to ensure enforceability. Although a  review process for permit conditions may be a good idea, we found that,  even when a review process was in place in some of the districts we visited,  they still had issued permits with unenforceable conditions.", "In addition, we found that three districts had not established formal  agreements with third parties to document the objectives and  implementation of mitigation banks or in-lieu-fee arrangements, as called  for in federal guidance. Of the 85 mitigation bank files we reviewed, 21 did  not have agreements with the Corps. These mitigation banks were all  located in Minnesota, one of two states with mitigation banks that fall  under the jurisdiction of the St. Paul District Office. According to district  officials, Minnesota had developed state mitigation banking guidelines  before the federal guidelines. Many of the banks in Minnesota were  approved by the state program and partially developed before requesting  Corps approval. Corps officials told us they had decided not to take  additional steps to develop agreements with these mitigation banks.  Currently, district officials issue a letter approving all or a portion of the  state bank for use in the Corps compensatory mitigation program but do  not develop a banking agreement with the bank sponsor. At the time of our  review, district officials realized that the lack of mitigation banking  agreements limited their enforcement ability and, therefore, were  developing banking guidelines to provide more structure for the  establishment of mitigation banks in Minnesota. However, they had not yet  begun to consistently develop such agreements.", "For the in-lieu-fee arrangements we reviewed, the Galveston and New  Orleans districts have not established formal agreements with in-lieu-fee  sponsors. Without such agreements, district officials may not know how  many permittees are using these arrangements to fulfill their compensatory  mitigation requirements. For example, for the arrangements that he was  responsible for monitoring, a Galveston district official could not provide  us with information about the number of permittees using the arrangement  to perform compensatory mitigation, the total amount of payments the in- lieu-fee sponsor had received, or any oversight activities conducted by the  Corps to ensure that the sponsor was performing the required  compensatory mitigation. Before our visit, Galveston district officials were  unaware that their four in-lieu-fee arrangements were not in compliance  with federal guidance and are now attempting to restructure these  arrangements. In addition, a Galveston district official told us the district  will develop such agreements with the sponsors of future arrangements.  With regard to the in-lieu-fee arrangement in New Orleans that did not have  an agreement, officials told us that resource constraints and other  priorities had prevented them from establishing a formal agreement with  the in-lieu-fee sponsor. This arrangement has collected approximately $1  million since its inception in 1994, but district officials could provide no  other information regarding oversight of the arrangement.", "Until the districts establish formal agreements with third-party sponsors,  the Corps does not have sufficient legal recourse if third parties do not  perform required compensatory mitigation because the sponsors have not  reached agreement with the Corps on what penalties and/or corrective  actions will be required to address any problems if the mitigation efforts  are not performed.

The Corps\u2019 priority has been and continues to be processing  permit applications. In 1988 and 1993, we reported that the Corps was  placing little emphasis on its compliance efforts, including compensatory  mitigation, and little has changed. The Corps continues to provide limited  oversight of compensatory mitigation, largely relying on the good faith of  permittees to comply with compensatory mitigation requirements. The  Corps\u2019 oversight efforts have been further hampered by vague and  inconsistent guidance that does not (1) define key terms, (2) specify the  actions Corps staff should take if required monitoring reports are not  received, or (3) set clear expectations for oversight of compensatory  mitigation. Furthermore, district officials have failed to establish  agreements with third-party sponsors that would ensure the agency has  legal recourse if compensatory mitigation is not performed.

We selected these districts  because they represent different geographic areas of the United States, and  they comprised over two-thirds of the compensatory mitigation required by  individual permits issued in fiscal year 2003. The Charleston, Galveston,  Jacksonville, New Orleans, St. Paul, and Wilmington districts were the top  districts nationwide in terms of mitigation required by individual permits.  While the Seattle district is not one of the top 7 districts nationwide, it is  one of the top districts in the western region in terms of required individual  permit mitigation, and we included it to provide geographic coverage. To  determine how much compensatory mitigation was required by permits  issued by each of the 38 districts, we used the Quarterly Permit Data  System data, which we examined and determined to be suitably reliable for  selecting the districts to be included in our review.", "To identify the guidance the Corps has established for overseeing  compensatory mitigation, we examined legislation, federal guidance on  mitigation banks and in-lieu-fee arrangements, Corps regulations, Corps  guidance, and supplemental guidance developed by the districts. We also  met with responsible Corps headquarters and district officials to discuss  the Corps\u2019 guidance on oversight of compensatory mitigation.", "To determine the extent to which the Corps oversees compensatory  mitigation, we reviewed a total of 249 files. We reviewed 152 permit files  issued in fiscal year 2000 where the permittee was responsible for the  mitigation. We selected this time frame because sufficient time would have  passed for the permittee to begin work on the permitted project, as most of  the permits we reviewed were valid for 5 years or less, and for the Corps to  have received a monitoring report or conducted a compliance inspection.  We also reviewed files for 95 mitigation banks (including 10 mitigation  banks approved in 2004), and 12 in-lieu-fee arrangements. The mitigation  banks we reviewed had been approved since the mitigation banking  guidance was established on November 28, 1995. For in-lieu-fee  arrangements, we reviewed the arrangements currently operating at the  seven districts at the time of our site visit. These mitigation bank and in- lieu-fee arrangement files usually provided data on the mitigation activities  for multiple permittees, and the mitigation conducted can encompass  thousands of acres. Owing to the large number of permits and mitigation  banks at some of the districts, we selected a random sample of permit files  at Jacksonville and of mitigation banks at the Jacksonville, New Orleans,  and St. Paul districts. These samples were drawn so that the estimates from  the samples would have a precision margin of about plus or minus 15  percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.
