In April 2018, the U.S. Attorney General issued a memo on criminal prosecutions of immigration offenses, which DHS officials said led to an increase in family separations.", "GAO was asked to review issues related to DHS's processing of family units. This report examines (1) CBP data on apprehended family unit members; the extent to which (2) CBP and (3) ICE developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing family units; and (4) how DHS and HHS share information about UAC.

During this period, CBP data indicated that most apprehensions of family units\u2014about 76 percent\u2014occurred between ports of entry by the U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol). With regard to family separations, from April 2018 through March 2019, CBP data indicate it separated at least 2,700 children from their parents, processing them as unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and transferring them to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "CBP developed some policies and procedures for processing family units but does not have sufficient controls to ensure effective implementation. For example, CBP policy requires that Border Patrol agents and officers track apprehended family unit members and, if applicable, subsequent family separations in agency data systems. GAO's analysis of Border Patrol documents and data indicates that its agents have not accurately and consistently recorded family units and separations. Specifically, GAO examined a nongeneralizable sample of 40 HHS records for children involved in family separations between June 2018 and March 2019 and matched them to Border Patrol apprehensions data for these children. GAO found Border Patrol did not initially record 14 of the 40 children as a member of a family unit (linked to a parent's record) per Border Patrol policy, and thus did not record their subsequent family separation. GAO found an additional 10 children among the 40 whose family separations were not documented in Border Patrol's data system as required by CBP policy during this period. Border Patrol officials were unsure of the extent of these problems, and stated that, among other things, data-entry errors may have arisen due to demands on agents as the number of family unit apprehensions increased. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which Border Patrol has accurate records of separated family unit members in its data system. Further, Border Patrol agents inconsistently recorded information about the reasons for and circumstances surrounding family separations on required forms. Developing and implementing additional controls would help Border Patrol maintain complete and accurate information on all family separations.", "DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is, among other things, responsible for detaining and removing those family units apprehended by CBP. ICE officers are to determine whether to accept or deny a referral of a family unit from CBP for detention in one of ICE's family residential centers, release family unit members into the interior of the United States, or remove family unit members (who are subject to final orders of removal) from the United States. ICE has procedures for processing and releasing family units from ICE custody. However, with regard to family unit separations, ICE relies on a manual process to track separations that occur in ICE custody (generally at one of ICE's family residential centers) and does not systematically record this information in its data system. Without a mechanism to do so, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that parents whom ICE separated from their children and are subject to removal are able to make arrangements for their children, including being removed with them, as provided in ICE's policy for detained parents.", "In 2018, DHS and HHS developed written interagency agreements regarding UAC. However, DHS and HHS officials stated they have not resolved long-standing differences in opinion about how and what information agencies are to share related to the care and placement of those children, including those referred to HHS after a family separation. GAO found that DHS has not consistently provided information and documents to HHS as specified in interagency agreements. HHS officials also identified additional information they need from DHS, about those adults apprehended with children and later separated, to inform their decisions about placing children with sponsors and reunifying separated families, when necessary. Increased collaboration between DHS and HHS about information sharing would better position HHS to make informed and timely decisions for UAC."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to DHS and one to HHS. Among them, CBP should develop and implement additional controls to ensure that Border Patrol agents accurately record family unit separations in data systems.

In July 2019, the Acting DHS Secretary testified that the majority  of individuals apprehended by CBP in fiscal year 2019 were family units  or unaccompanied alien children (UAC). In addition, he stated that CBP\u2019s  U.S. Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations (OFO) were  apprehending increasingly larger groups at and between ports of entry,  straining CBP\u2019s resources to process these individuals.

We also visited ICE family detention facilities, known as family  residential centers, in Dilley and Karnes City, Texas, in February 2019.  During these site visits, we interviewed Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE  officials, observed agents and officers processing families, and toured  CBP and ICE facilities, among other activities. To select these locations,  we reviewed CBP data on Border Patrol and OFO apprehensions along  the southwest border, including family unit apprehensions, and identified  specific locations that had the greatest increase in the number of  apprehensions from fiscal years 2016 to 2017. We also considered the  geographical proximity of multiple CBP and ICE facilities to maximize  observations. Our observations during site visits are not generalizable to  all Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE operations along the southwest border,  but provided us the opportunity to learn more about how policies and  procedures for processing families are conducted and how CBP and ICE  coordinate their efforts.", "In addition, to address all of our objectives, we interviewed DHS and HHS  officials. Specifically, we met with officials from CBP\u2019s Office of the  Commissioner and Office of Chief Counsel, Border Patrol\u2019s Law  Enforcement Operations Directorate and Strategic Planning and Analysis  Directorate, OFO\u2019s Admissibility and Passenger Programs office, ICE\u2019s  Enforcement and Removal Operations and Office of the Principal Legal  Advisor, as well as HHS officials from the offices of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response and ORR.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed record-level data from Border  Patrol and OFO on their apprehensions of individuals determined to be  inadmissible or potentially subject to removal. Specifically, we collected  and analyzed data from fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of  fiscal year 2019, because Border Patrol and OFO began to systematically  collect data on individuals who arrived as part of a family unit in fiscal  year 2016. The second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was the most current  data available at the time of our review. To assess the reliability of CBP  data, we completed a number of steps, including (1) performing electronic  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, such as running  logic tests; (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  systems that produced them, such as relevant training materials for  Border Patrol agents and OFO officers who use agency data systems;  and (3) discussing data entry issues and data limitations with Border  Patrol and OFO officials. We also received demonstrations on the data  systems from Border Patrol and OFO officials at headquarters. We  determined that the Border Patrol and OFO data were sufficiently reliable  to generally describe the number and demographic characteristics of  family units apprehended by CBP along the southwest border. Due to  data reliability issues discussed in the report, we rounded numbers  presented on family separations.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed CBP, Border Patrol, and  OFO policy documents, training materials, and other guidance  documents.

We compared CBP,  Border Patrol, and OFO policies and procedures to Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government related to identifying, analyzing, and  responding to change; designing control activities to achieve objectives  and identify risks; and using quality information to achieve objectives.  We compared Border Patrol processes for tracking family units and family  unit separations against CBP and Border Patrol policy. To evaluate how  Border Patrol recorded its processing of family units apprehended from  June 28, 2018, through March 31, 2019, we also selected a random,  nongeneralizable sample of ORR records for UAC involved in family  separations and compared them to Border Patrol apprehensions data for  the same children.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed ICE policy documents,  training materials, and other guidance documents, including ICE\u2019s  Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit Field Office Juvenile  Coordinator Handbook. We also compared ICE\u2019s processes against  federal internal control standards related to designing information  systems and related control activities to achieve objectives and respond  to risks. To report on family members apprehended by CBP and  detained in ICE\u2019s family residential centers, we reviewed ICE detention  data from June 2014 through fiscal year 2018.

In full  removal proceedings, individuals have the opportunity to present  evidence to an immigration judge to challenge their removal from the  country and apply for various forms of relief or protection, including  asylum. In expedited removal proceedings, the government can order  individuals removed without further hearing before an immigration judge  unless they express the intent to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution  or torture if returned to their home country. Most arriving family units are  eligible to be placed into expedited removal proceedings, with certain  exceptions, according to Border Patrol and OFO officials. A 2015 CBP  policy requires CBP\u2019s agents and officers to record such decisions for  each family unit member in agency data systems.", "Further, Border Patrol agents and OFO officers print copies of the  information they enter into data systems to create a paper file, known as  an \u201cA-file,\u201d for each family unit member they apprehend. One of the key  required DHS forms in the A-file is Form I-213, Record of  Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213). Among other things, this form  captures biographic information and includes a narrative section for  agents and officers to capture details about the circumstances of the  apprehension.

Individuals, including family unit members, placed in expedited removal  proceedings and who express a fear of persecution or torture are  generally subject to mandatory detention under the Immigration and  Nationality Act pending a final credible fear determination. As a result,  Border Patrol and OFO officials stated that its agents and officers typically  determine whether ICE has space in its family residential centers before  processing family units into expedited removal proceedings. From June  2014 through October 2019, ICE, during various periods, operated four  family residential centers in Texas, Pennsylvania, and New Mexico for  family units who may be subject to removal while they await the resolution  of their immigration cases or who have been ordered removed from the  United States.

CBP generally then separated the family unit, and after  processing the children as UAC, CBP transferred them to ORR custody.  According to CBP headquarters officials, the goal of the zero tolerance  policy was to deliver a consequence to those crossing the border illegally  by charging and convicting them of a crime, specifically a criminal  conviction for improper entry, which is generally a misdemeanor. This  could then lead to escalating criminal consequences for subsequent  apprehensions, since noncitizens\u2014in this case, adults in family units\u2014 entering the United States illegally for a second time could be charged  with illegal reentry after removal from the United States, a felony  offense.", "On June 20, 2018, the President issued an executive order directing that  alien families generally be detained together.

In 14 of the 40 selected ORR records,  Border Patrol data indicated the agent had not recorded the child as a  member of a family unit linked to a parent\u2019s record with a family unit  number. Thus, Border Patrol agents had not recorded the subsequent  separation when agents referred the children to ORR as UAC. A Border  Patrol headquarters official stated that it is also likely that some agents  were processing family units separately, rather than linking them with a  family unit number, from May to June 2018 when agents were referring  parents for criminal prosecution in response to the April 2018 zero- tolerance policy.

However, from July 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019,  the number of individuals Border Patrol assessed as part of potentially  invalid family units grew at a faster rate than the number of individuals  apprehended in valid family units.

In at least 10 of those cases,  the family was later determined to be valid and the child reunited with his  or her separated parent, according to ORR officials, as of June 2019.  Anecdotally, ICE headquarters officials stated that there are occasionally  cases in which CBP referred a child to ORR because agents or officers  assessed the family to be an invalid family unit, but ICE or ORR later  determined the family was valid and eligible to be reunified.

However, ICE does  not track how often potentially invalid family units are later assessed to be  valid and reunited, and, therefore, could not provide an exact number of  how often this has occurred. DHS and ICE officials have tracked the  outcomes of some deployments of ICE officers to help CBP assess the  validity of family relationships. Specifically, the Acting Secretary of  Homeland Security testified before the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform in the House of Representatives on July 18, 2019  that CBP agents and officers referred 2,475 family unit members they  suspected had invalid family relationships to go through an additional  assessment by ICE officers who, among other training and skills, have  specialized forensic interviewing skills. The ICE officers assessed 352  of the 2,475 individuals\u2014approximately 14 percent\u2014to be invalid family  members. Additionally, an ICE official also testified before the Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on June 26,  2019, and described a May 2019 pilot that involved voluntary rapid DNA  testing for some individuals. According to this official, 16 of the 84 family  units tested, around 19 percent, proved not to be the parent of the child  with whom they arrived. According to ICE officials, those family units it  determined to have valid family relationships while still in CBP custody,  based on the available evidence, remained together as a family unit and  were not separated.", "On June 27, 2018, the CBP Commissioner issued a policy memorandum  requiring that \u201cfraudulent claims of parental or legal guardianship  relationship\u201d should be \u201cwell-documented to support such claims\u201d;  however, CBP does not have guidance to clarify how agents and officers  are to fulfill that requirement.

ORR officials also stated this information would be  helpful to ORR because it may be relevant to the decisions ORR staff  make for UAC, such as selecting sponsors. ORR intake staff told us that  the documents they receive from CBP accompanying UAC referrals  typically do not contain narrative information about agents\u2019 or officers\u2019  concerns about potentially invalid family relationships.", "While CBP tracks cases on potentially invalid family units in its data  systems, this tracking does not (1) document the circumstances to  support the assessment of invalidity or (2) provide complete and timely  information for ORR and ICE to help them to fulfill their responsibilities,  including to review cases in which CBP initially determined a family to be  invalid but further investigation is needed. Rather, CBP\u2019s data systems  only track the assessment of invalidity by allowing agents to select that as  a reason from a set of options, but do not track the circumstances to  support that assessment.

In addition, OFO headquarters  officials stated that it issued guidance in June 2018 that reiterated CBP\u2019s  policy on potential reasons for family separations. However, as illustrated  in table 8, it is sometimes not clear how separation reasons in Border  Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s data systems align with CBP policy. For example,  Border Patrol\u2019s option for \u201cfamily member prosecuted for other reasons\u201d  does not provide enough information to determine whether Border Patrol  is referring a parent for the prosecution of a felony, as required by CBP  policy.", "Both Border Patrol and OFO have previously changed separation  reasons in agency data systems, and in June 2019 Border Patrol officials  stated they continue to analyze the need for updates. As of October  2019, these officials stated that Border Patrol and OFO do not have any  current plans to update the separation reasons in their data system. CBP  officials who conduct supervisory review of files and approve family  separations rely, in part, on the information agents and officers record in  Border Patrol and OFO data systems, in conducting reviews and sharing  information, according to Border Patrol and OFO officials. Updating  Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s data systems to ensure that options for  separation reasons clearly align with CBP policy could help ensure that  CBP makes decisions about family separations in accordance with CBP  policy and that data CBP collects reflects that."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recording Information about Family Separations on Border Patrol\u2019s Form I-213", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s policies related to family separations do not include written  requirements that agents and officers record a description of the family  separation.

For example, the  criminal history information provided on one parent\u2019s Form I-213  included information about an arrest for kidnapping, but did not  include evidence that the arrest resulted in a conviction, making it  difficult to determine whether the separation aligned with CBP policy  and, in particular, what reason the separation would fall under.", "For nine of the 23 family separations, the separation reason was listed  as the parent\u2019s criminal history on one of the family member\u2019s forms,  but there was missing or inconsistent information on the other family  members\u2019 forms. For example, in one instance, the father\u2019s Form I- 213 indicated he had been convicted of sexually assaulting a 12-year- old child, but there was no separation reason and no information  about the parent\u2019s criminal history provided on the child\u2019s form.", "According to ICE officials responsible for monitoring family separations,  and reunifying family units where necessary, the narrative information on  the Form I-213 is ICE officers\u2019 primary source of information about the  circumstances of a family separation.

Developing and  implementing additional controls to ensure that Border Patrol agents and  OFO officers include a reason for the family separations on the parent\u2019s  and child\u2019s Forms I-213 could help CBP ensure its agents and officers are  separating family units in accordance with CBP policy. For example, an  additional control could be to require the Border Patrol or OFO manager  reviewing the information recorded on the Form I-213 to check that  certain information, such as the specific separation reason with relevant  details, has been included. In addition, without additional guidance on  what specific details Border Patrol agents and OFO officers are to include  in the narrative information about the family separation events on the  parent\u2019s and child\u2019s Forms I-213, ICE and ORR do not have complete or  consistent information to use in determining when it may be necessary to  reunify family units in accordance with the Ms. L. v.

Specifically, ORR officials stated that Border Patrol has not updated its  referral screen to match updates that ORR has made. For example, in  July 2018, ORR added a checkbox in its data system for DHS agencies to  indicate whether a UAC had been separated from a parent, as necessary.  Border Patrol took steps in October 2018 to similarly update its referral  screen, so the indication of a family separation would be automatically  uploaded to ORR\u2019s data system with the referral. However, additional  steps must be taken by ORR for its data system to upload the  information, according to Border Patrol officials. Meanwhile, if ORR staff  see some indication of a family separation in the Border Patrol referral  form, such as in a narrative text field, ORR staff will typically add that  information to the records in their data system manually.

ICE litigation, ORR  officials stated that they need to know enough details about (1) family  separations or (2) situations in which CBP had concerns a family  relationship was invalid, to determine whether there are any family  units potentially eligible for reunification. If DHS and HHS determine  that a parent will be reunified with a child, ORR is responsible for (1)  verifying the validity of the family relationship and (2) determining  whether the parent is fit or poses a danger to the child, according to  ORR officials. For family unit reunifications, ORR has relied, in part,  on the determinations made by DHS when the family was separated,  according to these officials. However, ORR officials stated the  information DHS provides about family separations is generally limited  or provided inconsistently, often without enough detail for ORR to  assess whether the family unit may be eligible for reunification. For  example, the referral might state a family separation is due to the  parent\u2019s criminal history, but ORR must follow up with ICE to specify  the charge, determine whether the adult was convicted, or learn the  date of the event.", "In addition, ORR may conduct family reunifications in accordance with  ORR policies and procedures in other situations. For example, there  have been cases in which families were separated, but DHS later  dropped criminal charges against a parent it planned to prosecute, or  a parent has completed a hospitalization that required the parent to be  separated from his or her child. According to ICE policy, when ICE is  removing a parent from the United States, that parent has the right to  determine whether a minor child will be removed with him or her. ORR  officials stated that, according to ORR policies and procedures, if the  child is to be removed with the parent, ORR must assess whether (1)  the family relationship is valid and (2) whether the parent presents a  danger to the child. However, ORR officials stated that if this  information was not provided at the time of referral, they must reach  out to ICE officials to collect it. Further, ORR headquarters officials  stated that ICE has removed adults from the United States who  wished to be removed with their child or children in ORR custody,  before ORR could complete its assessment. However, neither ICE nor  ORR could determine exactly how often that had occurred or in  exactly what time frame these removals had occurred.", "DHS and HHS officials provided different perspectives on these  information sharing challenges not covered within existing interagency  agreements. ORR takes additional steps to collect information from ICE  and CBP that ORR is not routinely receiving at the time of referral. This  can extend the time that children spend in ORR custody, according to  ORR officials. If ORR staff conducting intake duties have questions about  UAC and any accompanying adults, ORR headquarters officials told us  they typically first contact the local CBP officials who processed the  apprehension.", "In April and August 2019, ORR officials said that some Border Patrol  sectors are more responsive than others and that limited and inconsistent  information sharing by DHS about separated children has led to delays in  placement and release decisions for UAC. ORR staff also reach out to  ICE\u2019s field office juvenile coordinators or ICE headquarters officials  responsible for juvenile and family management. For example, ORR and  ICE headquarters coordinate on a weekly basis via email to assess  whether family separations are in compliance with federal court orders in  the ongoing Ms. L. v. ICE litigation. Specifically, since February 2019,  ORR and ICE have shared a spreadsheet tracking UAC who may have  been involved in a family separation, according to ORR and ICE  headquarters officials. Further, ICE officials said they gather additional  information, such as more details about the reason for a family separation  from the Form I-213 or by reaching out to CBP officials. They provide  some of this information to ORR, as ICE officials noted that they  recognize ORR needs such information to assist in its decision-making for  UAC. ICE headquarters officials noted that they have found ways to  provide more detailed information to ORR without sharing sensitive law  enforcement information. It is through this vetting process that ICE and  ORR assess potential family separations to reach a confirmed number of  cases and the reasons for them, according to ICE and ORR officials.", "ORR headquarters officials stated that, from their perspective, it would be  more efficient if CBP or ICE provided this information directly into ORR\u2019s  data system at the time of referral, where possible, rather than sharing a  spreadsheet via email. Specifically, ORR headquarters officials stated  that they have experienced delays in releasing a child to a sponsor due to  missing information about a parent or the inability to notify a parent in ICE  detention about sponsorship decisions. By contrast, Border Patrol and  OFO headquarters officials noted concerns about sharing sensitive  information with ORR, particularly for adults apprehended with UAC.  Border Patrol officials stated, for example, that Border Patrol does not  share sensitive law enforcement information with a third party such as  ORR.", "According to ICE headquarters officials, sometimes ICE officers conduct  additional research after a child is referred to ORR, such as if CBP was  unable to collect certain information before making a separation  decision. ICE officials stated that, for their purposes, the current  information sharing procedures in place are sufficient, but noted that ICE  has added staff resources to keep up with the demands of current  information sharing procedures. Specifically, until May 2019, there was  one ICE headquarters official, 2in the juvenile and family management  unit, responding to all of ORR\u2019s requests, and that ICE added another  staff person to assist in responding to ORR\u2019s requests. As of October  2019, there were no plans to discuss further these information sharing  concerns, according to ORR, CBP, and ICE officials.", "Leading practices of high-performing organizations include fostering  collaboration both within and across organizational boundaries to achieve  results. Further, agencies should work together to establish a shared  purpose and goals; develop joint strategies or approaches that  complement one another; and ensure the compatibility of policies,  procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries. We  have previously reported that written agreements, such as a  memorandum of understanding or interagency agreements, can help  facilitate collaboration by articulating roles and responsibilities, among  other things. These types of written agreements are most effective when  they are regularly updated and monitored, as we reported in 2012.", "While issuing the April 2018 memorandum of agreement and July 2018  Joint Concept of Operations were important steps toward addressing the  weaknesses we identified in our 2015 report, additional actions are  needed to fully address our recommendation and increase the efficiency  and improve the accuracy of the interagency referral and placement  process for all UAC. In addition, further DHS and HHS collaboration about  information sharing methods and ways to enhance interagency  agreements would better position ORR to make informed and timely  decisions for UAC, including those separated from adults with whom they  were apprehended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the number of CBP apprehensions of family units has risen markedly  in recent years, DHS has developed policies and procedures for  processing family units. For example, since 2015 CBP has introduced  policies and procedures for collecting information about family units,  which has increased the data it collects, including on family separations.  However, DHS continues to face challenges in ensuring that it accurately  and consistently tracks information about family units, including those it  separates. Specifically, CBP training includes definitions of and guidance  for processing family units that are inconsistent with CBP policy. Issuing  updated training materials with correct definitions of and guidance for  processing family units would help CBP ensure that its agents and  officers are accurately tracking family units and, where applicable, family  separations. In addition, CBP has policies and procedures related to  concerns about the validity of a family unit, but it does not have written  requirements about what information on these cases Border Patrol agents  and OFO officers are to record. Without additional guidance about what details CBP agents and officers are to record on the required Form I-213,  these cases will not be well documented, as required by CBP policy.  Further, ICE and ORR officials do not have sufficient information to make  decisions for the adults and children involved, including determining when  reuniting valid family units is necessary.", "CBP has developed policies and procedures related to family  separations, but additional controls would help Border Patrol and OFO  ensure that information about these cases is accurately and consistently  captured. By developing and implementing additional controls for tracking  family separations\u2014such as requiring checks during supervisory review  that separations were documented properly\u2014Border Patrol could better  ensure it has accurate information about these cases, consistent with  CBP and Border Patrol policies. Further, some of the options for  separation reasons in Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s data systems do not  fully align with CBP policy. Without updating the reasons agents and  officers have available to select from, CBP is not well positioned to  determine whether its officials are separating family units for reasons  consistent with CBP policy.", "In addition, during our review of selected Forms I-213 for a sample of  separated family units, we found that agents did not always include the  reason for the separation or include a detailed description of the  circumstances of the case. Developing and implementing additional  controls to check that Border Patrol agents document family separations  and why they occurred on family unit members\u2019 Forms I-213 could help  Border Patrol ensure its agents are separating family units in accordance  with CBP policy. Additionally, without additional guidance on what specific  information about the circumstances of the family separations Border  Patrol agents and OFO officers are to include on the parent\u2019s and child\u2019s  Forms I-213, ICE and ORR do not have sufficient information to  determine, among other things, when family reunifications are required.", "During our review of ICE\u2019s policies and procedures for processing family  units, we found that it does not systematically track the family units it  separates in its data system. By updating its data system to do so, ICE  would be better able to ensure that separated parents, who are subject to  removal, are able to make arrangements for their minor child or children,  including being removed with them, consistent with ICE policy.", "While DHS and HHS have developed written interagency agreements  related to the transfer and care of UAC, as we recommended in 2015, we  found that information sharing gaps between the two agencies remain. As  such, continuing their efforts to address our prior recommendation to  jointly develop and implement a documented interagency process for all  agencies involved in the referral and placement of UAC could help DHS  and HHS increase the efficiency and improve the accuracy of these  processes for UAC. Moreover, additional DHS and HHS collaboration  about information sharing would help provide ORR with additional  information, including about accompanying adults, to make informed and  timely decisions for UAC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of nine recommendations, including six to CBP and  one each to ICE, DHS, and HHS. Specifically:  The CBP Commissioner should issue updated Border Patrol and OFO  training materials that reflect the correct definition of a family unit and  guidance for recording that information. (Recommendation 1)", "The CBP Commissioner should provide written guidance to Border Patrol  agents and OFO officers about what narrative information should be  recorded on the child\u2019s and the accompanying adult\u2019s Forms I-213 to  document cases in which CBP determines that a parent\u2013child relationship  may be invalid. (Recommendation 2)", "The CBP Commissioner should develop and implement additional  controls to ensure that Border Patrol agents accurately record family unit  separations in its data system. (Recommendation 3)", "The CBP Commissioner should update Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s data  systems to ensure data captured on family unit separation reasons clearly  align with CBP policy.

For example, in response to several of our  recommendations that CBP provide additional or revised guidance and  training to agents and officers, DHS stated that Border Patrol issued a  memo in January 2020 to clarify what information agents are to record for  family unit members, potentially invalid family units, and subsequent  separations, if applicable. DHS also described planned updates to OFO  data systems to automatically record certain information in family unit  members\u2019 Form I-213, such as the names and identifying information of  all family members apprehended together. Regarding our  recommendation that CBP should update Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s data  systems to ensure the options for family separation reasons clearly align  with CBP policy, DHS provided documentation of guidance that OFO and  Border Patrol issued about data system updates. DHS requested that we  consider the recommendation implemented. We will review the  information and documents DHS provided to assess the extent to which  CBP fully addressed this recommendation. Regarding our  recommendation that ICE develop and implement a mechanism to track  its separations in its data system, DHS stated that ICE has efforts  underway to enable ICE officers to track separations and reunifications in  its data system throughout ICE\u2019s immigration enforcement process.", "DHS and HHS also both concurred with our recommendations that the  agencies collaborate to address information sharing gaps identified in this  report, and described plans to coordinate and reach agreement on  information sharing practices.

We also visited  ICE family detention facilities, known as family residential centers, in  Dilley and Karnes City, Texas in February 2019. Specifically, in Tucson,  Arizona we visited Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson sector headquarters and  OFO\u2019s Tucson Field Office headquarters and the Nogales port of entry. In  the San Diego, California region, we visited Border Patrol\u2019s San Diego  sector headquarters and Imperial Beach station and the San Ysidro port  of entry. In the Rio Grande Valley, Texas region, we visited CBP\u2019s Central  Processing Center, Border Patrol\u2019s McAllen station, and the Hidalgo and  Brownsville ports of entry. In the San Antonio, Texas region, we visited  ICE\u2019s San Antonio field office headquarters, South Texas Family  Residential Center, and Karnes County Residential Center. During these  site visits, we interviewed Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials, observed  agents and officers processing families, and toured CBP and ICE  facilities, among other activities. To select these locations, we reviewed  CBP data on Border Patrol and OFO apprehensions along the southwest  border, including family unit apprehensions, and identified specific  locations that had the greatest increase in the number of apprehensions  of individuals from fiscal year 2016 to 2017. We also considered the  geographical proximity of multiple CBP and ICE facilities to maximize  observations. Our observations during site visits are not generalizable to  all Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE operations along the southwest border,  but provided us the opportunity to learn more about how policies and  procedures for processing families are conducted and how CBP and ICE  coordinate their efforts.", "In addition, to address all of our objectives, we interviewed DHS and HHS  officials. Specifically, we met with DHS officials from CBP\u2019s Office of the  Commissioner and Office of Chief Counsel; Border Patrol\u2019s Law  Enforcement Operations Directorate and Strategic Planning and Analysis  Directorate; OFO\u2019s Admissibility and Passenger Programs office; ICE\u2019s  Enforcement and Removal Operations (including the Juvenile Family and  Residential Management Unit, Field Operations, Alternatives to  Detention, and Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis) and ICE\u2019s Office  of the Principal Legal Advisor. We also interviewed HHS officials from the  offices of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and  Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).", "To address our first objective and describe what CBP data indicate about  the numbers and characteristics of family units who have been  apprehended along the southwest border, we reviewed record-level  apprehensions data from CBP\u2019s Border Patrol and OFO for individuals  determined to be inadmissible or potentially subject to removal. We  collected data for fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal  year 2019 because Border Patrol and OFO began to systematically  collect data on individuals apprehended as part of a family unit in fiscal  year 2016. The second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was the most current  data available at the time of our review. We used \u201cnumber of  apprehensions\u201d rather than the \u201cnumber of individuals or family unit  members\u201d as the unit of analysis we reported because an individual may  have been apprehended multiple times in the same year. The data we  report on apprehensions of family unit members include individuals in  family units CBP later separated (for reasons other than concerns about  validity of the family relationship) from April 19, 2018, when Border Patrol  and OFO began collecting data on family separations, through the first  two quarters of fiscal year 2019. The record-level data we analyzed are  current as of the date Border Patrol or OFO provided it to us. Specifically,  Border Patrol data for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 are current as of  January 2019; Border Patrol data for the first two quarters of fiscal year  2019 and selected fields for all fiscal years are current as of April 2019.  OFO data for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 are current as of February  2019; OFO data for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019 are current  as of June 2019.", "We grouped the ages of apprehended children in family units (e.g. ages  0\u20134, 5\u201311, and 12\u201317) according to key agency and court documents.  While most of our analysis was conducted on the apprehensions of  individuals in family units, we were also able to analyze the composition  of family units (i.e., as a group rather than individuals) apprehended by  Border Patrol. Specifically, Border Patrol uses a \u201cfamily unit number\u201d to  link the records of adult(s) and children processed as a family unit. As a  result, we analyzed whether the family unit was headed by an adult male  or adult female and how many children were in the family unit. We could  not conduct a similar analysis for the family units apprehended by OFO,  because OFO does not assign family units unique identifying numbers to  link family members in its data system. As a result, we were unable to  report on the composition of family units that OFO encountered.", "As part of our analysis of CBP data, we determined the number of family  unit members Border Patrol and OFO data indicated as separated from  April 19, 2018 through March 31, 2019. We selected this time frame  because Border Patrol began to systematically collect data on family  separations in its data systems on April 19, 2018, and the second quarter  of fiscal year 2019 was the most current data available at the time of our  review. Our analysis of the reasons for family separations is based on  the data recorded by agents and officers in Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s  data systems. During the period of our review, Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s  data systems included options for agents and officers to choose from to  explain the reason for the separation, including, for example, \u201cfamily  member prosecuted \u2013 criminal history\u201d and \u201cfamily member prosecuted \u2013  other reasons.\u201d These reasons, and the numbers of separations for each  reason, reflect CBP data and may not match the information about  separations (including numbers of, reasons for, and timeframes of  separations) that DHS reported to a federal court in response to related  litigation, such as Ms. L. v. ICE. According to court filings, the information  provided in response to that litigation was based on a manual review of  multiple federal datasets and reflect categories as required by the  litigation.", "We excluded family separations indicated in CBP data as temporary from  our analysis. We also reported separately on the number of adults and  children who were apprehended together, but whom CBP assessed to  have potentially invalid family relationships and thus processed  separately, as CBP does not consider these family separations. To  assess the reliability of CBP data, we completed a number of steps,  including (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness, such as running logic tests; (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the systems that produced them, such as  relevant training materials for Border Patrol agents and OFO officers who  use agency data systems; and (3) discussing data entry issues and data  limitations with Border Patrol and OFO officials. We also received  demonstrations on the data systems from Border Patrol and OFO officials  at headquarters. The limitations and determinations of reliability for the  Border Patrol and OFO data are discussed in more detail below.", "Border Patrol data. We identified a small number of Border Patrol  apprehension records that had the same date of apprehension and  unique identifier, known as the \u201cA-number.\u201d It is possible that these  apprehension records represented one apprehended individual that  Border Patrol agents processed as two apprehensions. These records  constituted less than 1 percent of the almost 2.4 million apprehension  records we analyzed. We included these apprehension records in our  analysis because Border Patrol considers them unique apprehensions  and because their small number does not materially affect our analysis.", "We did not include a small number of records (less than 1 percent of  apprehensions of family unit members) that had a family unit number but  did not meet CBP\u2019s definition of a family unit in our analysis of records of  family unit members. For example, a small number of family unit member  records did not include a date of birth, so we could not determine whether  the individual was an adult or child (i.e., under or over the age of 18  years).", "For our analysis of the reasons for family separations, we found a small  number (18) of Border Patrol records that included more than one  separation reason, so we could not distinguish which reason led to a  permanent family separation. Thus, we excluded these records from our  analysis of the reasons for family separations.", "According to Border Patrol headquarters officials and documents, in  situations in which only one of the adults in a two-parent family was  separated, the child or children would remain with the other adult as an  intact family unit (and the child would not be designated a UAC and  transferred to the custody of ORR). As such, in these situations, we  included the separated adults in our reported numbers of separated  family unit members, but did not include associated remaining family units  in our analysis of separated family units.", "We found 18 records for family units that included one adult and one  child, with one of the family unit members separated. According to Border  Patrol\u2019s procedures, in the event a family separation occurs, both family  unit members are to be processed in the data system as \u201cseparated.\u201d We  included these records in the number of family unit members, but did not  include them in our analysis of separated family unit members, as it was  unclear from the records whether or not the family unit was separated.", "We identified data reliability issues with Border Patrol\u2019s data on family  separations, as described in our report. When reporting these data, we  rounded down to the nearest increment of five, and described relevant  data using modifiers such as \u201cat least\u201d because of possible missing  information. This enabled us to report on the Border Patrol data that we  determined were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "OFO data. For the OFO data, we excluded approximately 11 percent of  all apprehension records (including single adults, UAC, and parents and  children that arrived as part of a family unit) from our analyses because  we could not confirm an A-number, for those apprehensions. Among the  apprehension records missing an A-number, 44 percent were cases in  which OFO officers paroled the individuals and, according to OFO  officials, officers are not required to assign an A-number to these  individuals. In addition, 47 percent of the records with a missing A- number were cases that involved individuals withdrawing their  applications for admission into the United States, in which OFO officers  have discretion whether or not to assign an A-number. According to OFO  officials, additional records with missing A-numbers may be due to human  error during data entry or problems with the data system saving this  information in the database that OFO used to pull the data. Finally, we  collapsed 153,025 apprehension records into 71,986 apprehension  records because we determined that they were duplicate records for the  same individual and the same apprehension, based on factors such as A- number, birth date, and date and time of apprehension.", "As a result, we determined that we could not present precise figures for  analyses that include OFO data and instead provided approximations  throughout the report. We rounded all data and figures on OFO  apprehensions, including where OFO\u2019s data inform CBP-data and figures,  down to the hundreds place. As an exception, for the much-smaller number of OFO family separations, as compared with total  apprehensions, we rounded the figures by increments of five, and  described relevant data using modifiers such as \u201cat least\u201d because of  possible missing information. This enabled us to report on the OFO data  that we determined were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "With the previously described modifications, we determined that the  Border Patrol and OFO data were sufficiently reliable to generally  describe the number and demographic characteristics of family units  apprehended by CBP along the southwest border.", "To address the second objective, on the extent to which CBP has  developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing  family units\u2014including how CBP defines family units, assesses the  validity of family relationships, and determines whether family separations  are warranted\u2014we reviewed CBP, Border Patrol, and OFO policy  documents, training materials, and other guidance documents in effect  from October 2015 through December 2019. For example, we reviewed  CBP\u2019s 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and  Search policy, as well as Border Patrol\u2019s data system processing  guidance and Border Patrol and OFO policies and procedures on how  agents are to record family separations in agency data systems, among  other documents. We compared CBP, Border Patrol and OFO policies  and procedures to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government related to identifying, analyzing, and responding to change;  designing control activities to achieve objectives and identify risks; and  using quality information to achieve objectives. We also compared  Border Patrol definitions for family units, and processes and guidance for  tracking family units, invalid family units, and family unit separations  against CBP and Border Patrol policy.", "To evaluate how Border Patrol recorded information for family units  apprehended from June 28, 2018 through March 31, 2019, we also  selected a sample of ORR records for UAC involved in family separations  and compared them to Border Patrol apprehensions data for the same  children. Specifically, we selected a small, random, nongeneralizable  sample of 40 ORR records for UAC involved in family separations. We  then matched all 40 selected records to Border Patrol apprehensions  data, using unique identifiers. Our findings are not generalizable due to  the size of our sample, so we cannot use our findings to assess the  magnitude of the issues we identified in Border Patrol data. We limited  the records from which we selected our sample to those ORR records  that included an A-number, a unique identifier, for the adult separated  from the child in ORR custody, since Border Patrol tracks its separation  reasons in the adult\u2019s records. Finally, we compared this information with  CBP\u2019s October 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention,  and Search policy, which states that family separations must be  documented in the appropriate data systems. We also assessed  information against federal internal control standards, which call for  management to identify and use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives and address risks, among other control activities.", "To describe how Border Patrol agents document the reasons for and  circumstances of each family separation case, we reviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of the DHS Form I-213, Record of  Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213), which is a form that agents  are required to complete for each individual CBP apprehends.  Specifically, Border Patrol provided us with Forms I-213 for the adults and  children involved in the three most recent instances of family separation  from June 28, 2018 through March 30, 2019, in each of Border Patrol\u2019s  nine sectors along the southwest border. Two of the sectors only had one  family separation during that period, so we reviewed the forms for a total  of 23 family separations. We reviewed a sample of Forms I-213 prepared  by Border Patrol agents, as Border Patrol separated approximately 95  percent of the family separations indicated in CBP data during the period  we reviewed. We did not review a sample of Forms I-213 prepared by  OFO officers, given the relatively smaller number of families separated by  OFO. In addition, we reviewed a sample of forms for cases of family  separations only, and did not review forms for cases in which Border  Patrol determined the family relationship was invalid because Border  Patrol officials told us that they do not record information about  assessments of invalid family relationships on the Form I-213. Finally, we  compared this information with a 2015 CBP policy that states that family  separations must be documented in the appropriate data systems; a June  2018 CBP policy that includes potential reasons to warrant family  separations; and federal internal control standards, which call for  management to identify and use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives and address risks, among other control activities.", "To address the third objective, and examine the extent to which ICE has  developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing  families apprehended along the southwest border, we reviewed ICE  policy documents, training materials, and other guidance documents. For  example, we reviewed ICE\u2019s Juvenile and Family Residential  Management Unit Field Office Juvenile Coordinator Handbook, ICE\u2019s  Family Residential Standards, ICE\u2019s data system training manual, and  ICE\u2019s detained parent policy. We compared ICE\u2019s processes against  ICE policies and procedures and federal internal control standards, which  call for management to design the entity\u2019s information system and related  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.", "ICE data. To report on family members apprehended by CBP and  detained in ICE family residential centers, we reviewed ICE detention  data from June 2014, when ICE opened its first family residential center  on the southwest border, through fiscal year 2018, the most current data  available at the time of our review. The data for all fiscal years is current  as of May 2019, when ICE provided us with record-level data to analyze.", "To assess the reliability of ICE\u2019s data, we completed a number of data  reliability steps, including (1) performing electronic testing for obvious  errors in accuracy and completeness, such as running logic tests; (2)  reviewing existing information about the data and the systems that  produced them, such as relevant training materials for the ICE officers  who use them; and (3) discussing data entry issues and data limitations  with ICE officials. We also received demonstrations on ICE\u2019s data system  from officials at headquarters. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to describe the numbers and demographic  characteristics of family members who were apprehended by CBP and  detained by ICE at one of its family detention facilities.", "Additionally, we collected and reviewed data on the families whom ICE  separated from July 2018 through September 2019. We selected this time  frame because July 2018 is when ICE began to require its field offices to  report all instance of family separations to headquarters, which tracks the  information on a spreadsheet, and September 30, 2019, the end of the  fiscal year. We reported the total number of family separations from the  spreadsheet, but could not independently verify the number of  separations in ICE\u2019s spreadsheet because ICE does not track family  separations systematically in its data system. As a result, we reported the  total number of family separations, according to ICE, for context to  demonstrate that most family separations occur when family units are in  CBP custody.", "To describe how DHS shares information with HHS about UAC, including  those involved in family separations, we reviewed DHS and HHS  interagency agreements, including the April 2018 information sharing  memorandum of agreement and July 2018 Joint Concept of Operations.  Additionally, we interviewed DHS and HHS officials at headquarters and  DHS officials at locations along the southwest border. We compared the  information we gathered with DHS and HHS interagency agreements,  which provide expectations for interagency information sharing and  procedures for the care and custody of UAC. We also compared DHS  and HHS information sharing practices to leading practices for  collaboration among federal agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to February 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
