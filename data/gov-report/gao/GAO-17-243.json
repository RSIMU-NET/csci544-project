Some stakeholders raised concerns about setting a precedent\u2014future transfers could affect the Federal Reserve's independence and, consequently, autonomy in monetary policymaking. Dividend payments to 85 banks decreased by nearly two-thirds (first half of 2016 over first half of 2015), but GAO found no shifts in Reserve Bank membership as of December 2016.

Only one-half  of the stock subscription is paid to the Reserve Bank upon joining the  Federal Reserve and the remainder is subject to call and payable on  demand by the Reserve Bank. Membership, and thus stock ownership, in  the Federal Reserve is required of all nationally chartered banks, while  state-chartered banks may become members if they opt to and meet  certain requirements.

The Glass bill proposed creating up to 15 Reserve Banks and the  Board of Governors. The Reserve Banks were modeled after  clearinghouses or \u201cbanker\u2019s banks\u201d and some European central banks in  that they would be funded by selling stock shares to commercial banks. In  particular, the design adopted for the Federal Reserve was federated,  with independent Reserve Banks overseen by the Board of Governors.", "Under the bill, each Reserve Bank was required to have minimum capital  to begin business. According to a past historian of the Federal Reserve,  proponents in Congress of a central bank did not want to fund it, but  needed to raise cash for capital and gold to back Federal Reserve notes  that would serve as the national currency. The original proposal required  member banks to purchase stock equal to 20 percent of their paid-in and  unimpaired capital, with one-half paid on joining the Reserve Bank and  one-half callable from the member bank. The Senate and conference  committees agreed to change the capital of the Federal Reserve to 6  percent of member banks\u2019 capital and surplus rather than 20 percent of  capital alone as provided in the Glass bill.

One of the early proposals  for a central bank was written in 1910 by Paul Warburg and included  dividends on central bank stock of 4 percent. The original Federal  Reserve Act proposed by Representative Glass provided for a dividend  rate of 5 percent. Glass stated in his report on the 1913 bill that 5 percent  represented the normal rate of return from current bank investments  \u201cconsidering the high character of the security offered.\u201d Debate in the  Senate and conference committee resulted in a 6 percent dividend rate  on Reserve Bank stock. This rate was comparable to those of European  central banks of the time.", "Based on our interviews with a past Federal Reserve historian, one of the  rationales for creation of the 6 percent dividend rate was to compensate  member banks for the opportunity costs of the capital they invested in the  Reserve Bank stock. National banks and state-chartered banks that  chose to join the Federal Reserve were required to purchase the stock  and therefore could not invest this capital in other instruments that might  earn a higher return. Also, the 6 percent dividend rate included a risk  premium associated with the stock of this new institution. While the  Reserve Banks are seen as safe today, during the debates over the  Federal Reserve Act there was worry that they would fail, particularly  smaller Reserve Banks in rural regions of the country that had less initial  capital. However, concerns were raised about making the dividend rate  so attractive that member banks would pull too much bank capital away  from the local community. Lastly, the dividend was intended to help  induce state-chartered banks to join the Federal Reserve. As noted  earlier, state-chartered banks were not required to join the Federal  Reserve and purchase Reserve Bank stock and therefore would not be  subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve. As a result, a low  percentage of state-chartered banks initially joined the Federal Reserve  and there was a gap in the Board\u2019s knowledge of the safety and  soundness of the banking system. Thus, the 6 percent dividend rate was  intended as an incentive for state-chartered banks to voluntarily join the  Federal Reserve.", "To examine the comparative value of a dividend rate of 6 percent since  the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, we examined rate of return  information on Treasury and certain corporate bonds. (See appendix I for  information about our data sources and methodology.)

Returns for each of the instruments (medium-grade corporate bond data  were recorded from the mid-1940s) were consistently above 6 percent  from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, and peaked around 1980 at  about 16 percent. Returns for each of the bond categories above are now  below 6 percent. In addition, we reviewed U.S. stock data and found total  returns to average about 6.5 percent over more than a century.

However, according to  current and former Federal Reserve officials we interviewed, the nature of  the transfer of funds, which were added to Treasury\u2019s General Fund and  used as an offset to make up a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, raises  questions about the possibility of future transfers. They also raised  questions that the cap could negatively affect the Federal Reserve\u2019s  independence in monetary policy decision making by rendering it  dependent on Treasury for recapitalization in the event that total Reserve  Bank capital is depleted.", "The FAST Act, which authorized the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal year  2016 through fiscal year 2020, requires that the aggregate of the Reserve  Banks\u2019 surplus funds not exceed $10 billion and directed that amounts in  excess of $10 billion be transferred to Treasury\u2019s General Fund. The  excess of Reserve Bank surplus over the $10 billion limitation as of the  December 4, 2015, enactment date of the FAST Act was $19.3 billion,  which was transferred to Treasury on December 28, 2015. The $19.3  billion transferred from the surplus account was part of $117 billion in  earnings the Federal Reserve transferred to Treasury in 2015. The FAST  Act transferred a total of $70 billion from Treasury\u2019s General Fund to  make up a projected shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund through fiscal  year 2020. In addition to its annual remittances, the Congressional  Budget Office estimates that the Federal Reserve\u2019s transfers to Treasury  will be increased by a total of $53.3 billion from 2016 to 2025 as a result  of capping the surplus account balance at $10 billion.", "As we found in our 2002 report on the surplus account, reducing the  Federal Reserve capital surplus account creates a one-time increase in  federal receipts, but the transfer by itself will have no significant long-term  effect on the federal budget or the economy. Because the Federal  Reserve is not included in the federal budget, amounts transferred to  Treasury from reducing the capital surplus account are treated as a  receipt under federal budget accounting but do not produce new  resources for the federal government as a whole. The surplus account  cap reduces future Reserve Banks\u2019 earnings because the Reserve Banks  would hold a smaller portfolio of securities. As a result, the cap reduces  their transfers to Treasury in subsequent periods. Since the one-time  transfer from the Federal Reserve also increases Treasury\u2019s cash  balance over time, Treasury would sell fewer securities to the public and  thus pay less interest to the public. Over time, the lower interest  payments to the public approximately offset the lower receipts from  Federal Reserve earnings.", "According to Board of Governors officials, the cap on the surplus account  had little effect on Federal Reserve operations as of December 2016, and  the chances of the cap impeding operations in the long term appear to be  small. This is because Federal Reserve operations are funded before  remaining excess funds are transferred to the surplus account. In  addition, if Reserve Bank earnings during the year are not sufficient to  provide for the costs of operations, payment of dividends, and maintaining  the $10 billion surplus account balance, remittances to Treasury are  suspended. A deferred asset is recorded in the Federal Reserve\u2019s  accounts to represent the amount of net earnings a Reserve Bank will  need to realize before remittances to Treasury resume. In our September  2002 report, we found no widely accepted, analytically based criteria to  show whether a central bank needs capital as a cushion against losses or  how the level of such an account should be determined. However,  according to Board of Governors officials, if a central bank exhausts its  capital cushion or its capital position is negative, realized losses that  result from asset sales or draining of monetary liabilities would further  exacerbate the capital deficiency.", "According to Federal Reserve officials and academics we interviewed,  transferring Federal Reserve funds to address a budgetary shortfall might  lead the public and financial markets to question if the Federal Reserve  was independent from the executive and legislative branches. In their  view, if these actions set a precedent, the public and financial markets  might conclude that the central bank was not conducting monetary policy  aimed solely at achieving the monetary policy objectives set forth in the  Federal Reserve Act (price stability, maximum employment, and  moderate long-term interest rates in the United States). Instead, some  might believe that the Federal Reserve had been directed to take policy  actions that would help fund government spending.", "Whether transferring funds from the Federal Reserve to address  budgetary shortfalls should be viewed any differently than the annual  remittances is debatable. Congress has transferred money from the  surplus account to Treasury\u2019s General Fund on other occasions, most  recently with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000 that directed  the Reserve Banks to transfer to Treasury additional surplus funds of  $3.752 billion during fiscal year 2000. These transfers are deposited in  Treasury\u2019s General Fund and available for appropriation and use for  general support of the government. Nevertheless, Federal Reserve  officials, an industry association, and some commercial banks we  interviewed believed the requirement to transfer funds from the surplus  account, which many see as specifically intended to support the Highway  Trust Fund, was different and set a worrying precedent. In particular,  Board of Governors officials stated that prior transfers from the Reserve  Banks to Treasury did not place a cap on the amount of the surplus  accounts that could be retained by the Reserve Banks.", "Several academic experts with whom we spoke noted that countries with  independent central banks have strict provisions against transfers of  central bank funds by the legislative branch. However, as long as rules  regarding the transfer of central bank earnings to the government are  clearly defined, such transfers are consistent with best practices  associated with central bank financial independence. As we discuss  later, concerns may arise if subsequent transfers reduce the capital  surplus to zero, which could lead to dependence on Treasury for capital  integrity. Since capital integrity is required to support monetary policy  autonomy, reliance on Treasury could diminish the independence of the  Federal Reserve. As we discuss later in this report, there are ways to  preserve Federal Reserve independence under varying capital structures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dividend Rate Modification Raises Potential Implications but Has Had No Immediate Effect on System Membership", "paragraphs": ["The FAST Act\u2019s modification of the Reserve Banks\u2019 stock dividend rate  for large member banks from 6 percent to a rate pegged at the lesser of 6  percent or the 10-year Treasury rate, which was below 6 percent in June  2016, increased federal receipts and reduced revenues for large member  banks, but has had no immediate effect on Federal Reserve membership.

Four  of the 6 large member banks stated that they would likely act to recoup  this lost revenue. For example, some mentioned employee layoffs and  increased fees on consumers as potential options to recoup the lost  revenue. Two large member banks noted that the dividend rate  modification was made at a time when these institutions were adjusting to  changes in the regulatory and financial environment, and incorporating  the revenue cut made adjusting to these changes even more  challenging. However, these factors also make it difficult to link the  dividend rate modification to any specific effects on employees or  consumers.", "Most of the member and nonmember banks we interviewed argued that  the selection of the 10-year Treasury note as a benchmark for the  dividend rate does not appropriately compensate member banks. Several  commercial banks noted that the decision to use the 10-year Treasury  note did not account for the illiquidity of Reserve Bank stock (it cannot be  traded while 10-year Treasury notes can). They added that this illiquidity  should be accounted for by the addition of a premium to the rate paid on  Reserve Bank stock (an illiquidity premium). Additionally, several  commercial banks reported that shifting from a fixed dividend rate to a  floating rate determined during the month when dividends are paid  increased the uncertainty surrounding their business decisions.", "Several commercial banks also stated that they would have preferred that  the dividend rate modification were considered on its own merits rather  than utilized to help pay for transportation projects. The American  Bankers Association stated in a comment letter on the interim final rule  implementing the dividend rate modification that the change represented  a breach of contract between the Federal Reserve and member banks  and amounted to \u201can unconstitutional taking of member banks\u2019 property  without compensation.\u201d It further stated that the \u201cTakings Clause of the  Fifth Amendment provides that \u2018private property\u2019 shall not \u2018be taken for  public use, without just compensation\u2019\u201d and the dividend rate change was  in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

However, as of December 2016 there was no evidence that  banks had dropped their Federal Reserve membership as a result of  lower dividend payments. According to data provided by the Board of  Governors and Reserve Banks, membership in the Reserve Banks  dropped by about 2 percent (46 banks) from December 31, 2015, to June  30, 2016. The Reserve Banks generally attributed this drop to normal  attrition and consolidation in the industry. This decrease is consistent with  the general decline in the number of banks supervised by the Federal  Reserve from 2010 through 2015 (as shown in fig. 2).", "FDIC officials stated in May 2016 that they had seen no impact of the  dividend rate modification on state-chartered member and nonmember  banks.

Furthermore, of the 14 member  banks with which we spoke, including 6 banks with assets of more than  $10 billion, none indicated that they would drop Federal Reserve  membership as a result of the dividend rate modification.

Banking  associations that we interviewed said that the capital contribution for the  stock places a burden on member banks. Specifically, the capital is  illiquid and cannot be used as collateral, so it represents a significant  opportunity cost to member banks. Despite the cost associated with the  capital requirement, 11 of the 17 banks we interviewed indicated that the  capital requirement is either not an important factor or only somewhat of  an important factor in their decision on Federal Reserve membership.  More frequently, familiarity with their Reserve Bank as a supervisor was  more important to their decision to join the Federal Reserve.", "The three scenarios are not an exhaustive representation of possible  modifications to the structure of the Federal Reserve, nor does our  analysis account for all of the potential consequences of such  modifications. Our discussion of the implications of each scenario should  not be interpreted as a judgment on how or whether the Federal Reserve  should be restructured.

Furthermore, the discussion of the impacts  of the three scenarios is limited without identification of the exact  replacement structures, which is beyond the scope of this study.

As discussed previously, the stock purchase requirement  reflects the desire of the founders of the Federal Reserve to strike a  balance between control by commercial banks and government control of  the Federal Reserve. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Reserve Banks  were established as corporate entities after national banks subscribed to  the minimum amount of Reserve Bank stock. Therefore, a structural  change could result if Congress decided to retire the stock and the  corporate structure of the Reserve Banks were not preserved. The  corporate structure, which includes a board of directors to oversee  operations, enables the Reserve Banks to maintain a degree of autonomy  from the Board of Governors. Furthermore, the stock ownership  requirement enables the Federal Reserve to maintain financial  independence from the federal government because it allows the Reserve  Banks to maintain a capital base that is not funded at the discretion of the  government. Retirement of Reserve Bank stock could have implications  for the autonomy of the Reserve Banks, the independence of the Federal  Reserve, and the operations of the Reserve Banks, all of which would  warrant consideration.", "Diminished Reserve Bank autonomy. One of the policy goals of the  Federal Reserve\u2019s structure is to provide Reserve Banks with a degree of  autonomy or regional authority in relation to the Board of Governors.  Eliminating Reserve Bank stock would have implications for this goal.  According to Reserve Bank officials, all else being equal, retirement of the  stock coupled with elimination of the current corporate structure of the  Reserve Banks could result in removal of Reserve Bank boards of  directors or limit the benefits currently provided by their participation. The  existence of the boards of directors is tied to member banks\u2019 equity  ownership in their regional Reserve Bank. Specifically, this action could  limit the diversity of views in monetary policy by weakening the link to  regional input in FOMC discussions. Reserve Bank officials said that  Reserve Bank boards serve an important function in the Federal Reserve,  including providing important business advice and perspectives to the  Reserve Banks. In our 2011 report on Federal Reserve governance, we  found that directors of the Reserve Bank boards provide a link to the  regions that the Reserve Banks serve, and give information on economic  conditions to the Reserve Bank presidents who may use it to inform  FOMC discussions about regional conditions.", "With the loss of member bank equity ownership and the absence of  Reserve Bank boards, advisory boards or advisory councils are  mechanisms that could be used to serve the same function. However,  according to Reserve Bank officials and directors, this approach might not  be as effective as a formal corporate board. They said that, as appointed  directors of a Reserve Bank board, they have a fiduciary responsibility to  perform their duties and place the interests of the Reserve Bank and the  nation ahead of personal interests. They noted that it may be difficult to  attract high-caliber members to an advisory council or board in a different,  more removed relationship. However, we found in our 2011 report that  existing Reserve Bank branch boards and advisory councils are  sometimes a source of director candidates for the Reserve Banks.  Reserve Bank officials and directors also said that the level of  commitment and engagement from members of an advisory board or  council would be less than that of directors of a formal corporate board.  Many different mechanisms could be employed to mitigate the effects of  eliminating Reserve Bank boards, but without further analysis on specific  mechanisms it is difficult to determine whether those mechanisms would  be feasible.", "Reserve Bank officials, academics, and banks said that another potential  consequence of retiring Reserve Bank stock and eliminating the  incorporated entities could be diminished Reserve Bank autonomy in  relation to the Board of Governors. For example, retirement of Reserve  Bank stock could result in eliminating the current corporate structure, and  one structural option that we examined was to convert the Reserve Banks  into field offices of the Board of Governors\u2014that is, Reserve Banks would  become part of a federal agency. Reserve Bank presidents currently are  appointed by and accountable to Reserve Bank boards of directors.  Some officials we interviewed believed that Reserve Bank presidents  might feel less comfortable voicing dissenting opinions in FOMC meetings  if they were leading field offices directly accountable to the Board of  Governors. Therefore, a loss of autonomy could limit the diversity of  views in FOMC meetings. More importantly, it could concentrate power  and influence within the Board of Governors\u2014for example, by centralizing  FOMC decision making in the hands of the Board of Governors. The  diversity of economic views that Reserve Bank presidents bring to FOMC  meetings is illustrated by dissenting votes at FOMC meetings from July  1996 to July 2016. In that time, Reserve Bank presidents cast 80  dissenting votes while members of the Board of Governors cast 2  dissenting votes.", "Some academics with whom we spoke pointed out that eliminating the  Reserve Bank stock purchase requirement could remove the perception  of undue influence from member banks. For example, such perceptions  might be removed if member banks (shareholders) no longer vote on  Class A and B directors of Reserve Bank boards. We previously reported  that the requirement to have representatives of member banks on the  Federal Reserve Bank boards creates an appearance of a conflict of  interest because the Federal Reserve has supervisory authority over  state-chartered member banks and bank holding companies.", "Conflicts of interest involving directors historically have been addressed  through both federal law and Federal Reserve policies and procedures,  such as by defining roles and responsibilities and implementing codes of  conduct to identify, manage, and mitigate potential conflicts. Federal  Reserve officials said that the Board of Governors already restricts  Reserve Bank directors\u2019 participation in banking supervision and,  therefore, a field-office structure would address perception, not practice.  For example, Reserve Bank directors cannot access member banks\u2019  confidential supervisory information. Any application of a Class A  director\u2019s financial institution that requires Federal Reserve approval may  not be approved by the director\u2019s Reserve Bank, but instead is acted on  by the Secretary of the Board of Governors. Class A directors cannot be  involved in the selection, appointment, or compensation of Reserve Bank  officers whose primary duties involve banking supervision. And Class B  directors with certain financial company affiliations are subject to the  same prohibition. Class A directors are also not involved in the selection  of the Reserve Bank President or First Vice President.", "To the extent that Congress values the benefits conferred by the current  structure characterized by the balance of power and Reserve Bank  autonomy, mechanisms would need to be devised to provide assurance  these benefits remained if the Reserve Bank stock were retired. Eight of  the 14 member banks that we interviewed said that Reserve Bank  autonomy is either important or very important. For example, one bank  stated that Reserve Bank autonomy is \u201chyper\u2013important\u201d because it  creates a system of checks and balances, limits politicization of monetary  policy, and ensures that viewpoints from across the nation are  considered. Five of the member banks that we interviewed said that the  structural option of converting the Reserve Banks to field offices would  diminish the Reserve Banks\u2019 autonomy and some said that the change  would harm connections to the local communities. But only 1 of the 14  member banks with which we spoke said that they would be likely or very  likely to drop membership if the Reserve Banks became field offices of  the Board of Governors.", "Diminished Federal Reserve financial independence. One of the  policy goals of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s structure was to provide it  with independence within the federal government. As noted earlier,  financial independence supports monetary policy autonomy, which  research has shown is important to low levels of inflation. Eliminating  Reserve Bank stock, without a mechanism to re-establish financial  autonomy, would have implications for this goal. The Reserve Banks\u2019  income is generated primarily through interest on their investments and  loans and through fees received for services provided to depository  institutions. Reserve Bank officials said that historically the Federal  Reserve has received enough income to fund its operations and therefore  would be able to capitalize itself. According to the Federal Reserve, if  losses were incurred remittances to Treasury would be suspended and a  deferred asset would be recorded that represents the amount of net  earnings a Reserve Bank would need to realize before remittances to  Treasury could resume. Therefore, Reserve Banks do not need capital to  fund operations. However, operating without a capital base could  exacerbate negative perceptions that the Federal Reserve is insolvent.  Alternatively, Treasury could capitalize the Federal Reserve through  Treasury-owned stock, which would allow the Reserve Banks to maintain  a corporate structure but would result in a central bank dependent, in  part, on government funding.", "Depending on how it is structured, dependence on Treasury for  capitalization could diminish the financial independence of the Federal  Reserve. In particular, Federal Reserve independence would be  diminished if recapitalization (in the event of capital base depletion) were  at the discretion of Treasury. One academic we interviewed said that the  $10 billion surplus cap introduced under the FAST Act increased the  likelihood of the depletion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital. Some  academics have written that if Treasury capitalized the Federal Reserve,  Congress could include provisions for automatic recapitalization of the  Federal Reserve in the event that its capital were depleted and provide  stronger capital buffers by increasing the surplus account cap. These  provisions would preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve by  removing the discretion of Treasury in recapitalizing the Federal Reserve.  Moreover, according to research, 8 of 166 central banks are capitalized,  in whole or in part, by private shareholders. The remaining 158 central  banks, some of which are considered to be highly independent, are  capitalized by their governments.", "None of the 17 member and nonmember banks that we interviewed said  they would be likely or very likely to change their membership status if  Reserve Bank stock were permanently retired. The banks said that the  stock ownership is not a major factor in membership considerations.  Member banks cited familiarity with and reputation of their regulator,  consistency of regulation across the holding company, and their bank  structure as the most important factors for making a membership  choice.", "Hindered ability to conduct Reserve Bank operations. The Federal  Reserve Act authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to act as depositories  and fiscal agents of the United States government, at the direction of the  Secretary of the Treasury. Eliminating Reserve Bank stock could have  implications for the Reserve Banks\u2019 ability to perform these functions,  depending on how the Reserve Banks\u2019 structures and authorities were  revised. For example, converting the Reserve Banks to field offices could  preclude them from conducting critical banking functions, and the  activities they could undertake as fiscal agents for the government if they  were to become government entities are unclear. Banking activities  conducted by the Reserve Banks, including executing monetary policy  through open market operations and providing short-term loans to  institutions, are essential to the functioning of the Federal Reserve.", "Some Reserve Bank officials said that without the stock, the Reserve  Banks would no longer be corporations and might not be able to conduct  certain banking activities, depending on how the replacement structure  and authorities were configured. If the Reserve Banks were to become  field offices of the Board of Governors, they would no longer be able to  perform certain activities related to their function as Treasury\u2019s fiscal  agent because the Board of Governors currently is not authorized to  provide these services. Some also said that having the Board of  Governors act as Treasury\u2019s fiscal agent could present a conflict of  interest. However, other Reserve Bank officials said that the current  corporate structure could be maintained without the stock, but would at  least require legislation amending the Federal Reserve Act to allow  continuing conduct of banking activities. Reserve Bank officials noted that  Treasury directs the Reserve Banks, as fiscal agents, to conduct auctions  on its behalf and it is unclear whether Treasury could direct another  federal agency to do so. Reserve Bank officials also pointed out that the  Reserve Banks hold accounts for foreign central banks and it is unclear  whether the federal government could hold an account for another  government. As discussed earlier, capitalization by Treasury would allow  the Reserve Banks to maintain their current corporate structure, through  Treasury-owned stock. This could preserve the ability of Reserve Banks  to conduct banking operations; however, as discussed earlier, this  involves many issues that would need to be considered.", "Eliminating the current corporate structure and converting the Reserve  Banks into field offices of the Board of Governors could lead to more  centralized functions, which could further improve the net efficiency of  Reserve Bank operations. However, Reserve Bank officials said that  innovation often comes from having private-sector voices on their boards.  Moreover, Reserve Bank officials said that despite their autonomous  structure they have been able to achieve efficiencies in their operations  by consolidating certain activities such as retail payment (check and  Automated Clearing House) processing, which is conducted through the  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; wholesale payment operations (Fedwire  funds and securities services) and open-market operations, which are  primarily conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or  information technology and payroll services, which are primarily  conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Voluntary ownership of Reserve  Bank stock could take many forms.

Reserve Bank officials stated that if  voting rights remained with stock ownership, not membership, and if stock  ownership among member banks were low, then the votes to elect board  members would be concentrated in just a few banks. Some Reserve  Bank officials said that the concentration of votes could lead to undue  influence from a few banks. We previously found that, under the current  mandatory stock ownership structure, member bank voter turnout was  often low during some Reserve Banks\u2019 elections.

This scenario  would make the entire 6 percent purchase requirement callable, so that  member banks would not have to contribute any capital to the Reserve  Banks on joining the Federal Reserve. This modification would allow the  Reserve Banks to keep their current corporate structure and preserve  their ability to conduct banking operations. The change would also  eliminate the dividend payment to member banks since the capital  associated with the Reserve Bank stock would no longer be paid-in, so  there would no longer be a basis to pay member banks a dividend.  Similar to the scenario of retiring the stock or making its purchase  voluntary for members, the Reserve Banks\u2019 capital base would be  reduced\u2014in this case, to the amount of capital held in each Reserve  Bank\u2019s surplus account.", "Reserve Bank officials and some academics said that Reserve Banks can  operate without a capital base but, as discussed previously this could  cause a public perception problem. Specifically, Reserve Bank officials  said that if Reserve Banks incurred losses and called in capital from  member banks, the call could send a signal to the broader markets that  the Reserve Banks were insolvent. In turn, this perception could lead to  negative ripple effects throughout the economy. That is, Reserve Bank  officials said that situations in which Reserve Banks would incur losses  and need to call capital likely would be situations of economic stress for  banks. If banks could not quickly raise sufficient funds to meet the  Reserve Bank\u2019s capital call, their lending capacity could fall and a credit  crunch could follow. Calling in capital from member banks at such a time  could have a procyclical effect; that is, the call would exacerbate financial  distress experienced by the member banks.", "Reserve Bank officials added that because of the potentially severe  systemic effects such a capital call would be highly unlikely. Officials  pointed out that the Reserve Banks have never called in the 3 percent  capital at member banks and that Reserve Banks currently do not have  procedures for calling the 3 percent capital held at member banks. As  discussed earlier, if losses were incurred remittances to Treasury would  be suspended. If the Reserve Banks incurred losses over multiple periods  and their capital base were depleted, then the method for recapitalization  would need to be addressed (which, as discussed earlier, involves many  issues that would need to be considered).", "Based on our interview responses, most banks would be unlikely to  change their membership status as a result of making the entire capital  contribution callable. All three of the nonmember banks that we  interviewed said that they likely would not become members or would be  only somewhat likely to become members in response to this change.  Member banks likely would not drop membership as a result of this  modification because, as some banks noted, it removes a potential barrier  to membership (paying in 3 percent of capital)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve, OCC,  and Treasury for review and comment.

See appendix  II for a selected bibliography of literature we reviewed. We interviewed a  past Federal Reserve historian and selected academics. We also  conducted a literature search on rates of return on selected investment  products. We specifically identified the following data sources:", "Roger Ibbotson, 2013 Ibbotson SBBI Classic Yearbook: Market  Results for Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation1926\u20132012 (Chicago, Ill.:  Morningstar, 2013).\u2014We reviewed information describing the rates of  return for a number of basic asset classes including large company  stocks, small company stocks, long-term corporate bonds, long-term  government bonds, intermediate-term government bonds, and  Treasury bills.

Our data reliability assessment  included reviewing the methodologies employed by the authors of each  source and cross-checking certain data from the sources against each  other. First, we analyzed return data on investment-grade and medium- grade corporate bonds, and Treasury bonds. We selected these  instruments for comparison with Reserve Bank stock because they  generally present low risk of default and have relatively long maturity  periods. Corporate bonds can be classified according to their credit  quality. Medium-grade corporate bonds can indicate a strong capacity to  meet financial commitments but also can still be vulnerable to a changing  economy. Investment grade corporate bonds are considered more likely  than noninvestment grade bonds to be paid on time and have lower  investment risk. Treasury bonds are obligations by the U.S. government  and are considered to have low investment risk.", "Second, we analyzed return data on interest rates based on commercial  paper and certificates of deposit, and the federal funds rate. We selected  these return data for analysis because they are common measures of the  value of money in the markets. Commercial paper consists of short-term,  promissory notes issued primarily by corporations that mature in about 30  days on average, with a range up to 270 days. A certificate of deposit is a  savings account that holds a fixed amount of money for a fixed period of  time, such as 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years, and in exchange, the issuing  bank pays interest. The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the  U.S. financial market and is the interest rate at which depository  institutions trade federal funds with each other overnight.", "We determined not to include rate of return information on stocks and  agency mortgage-backed securities. Stock is a more volatile investment  product than Reserve Bank stock, with wide variation in prices from year  to year. In addition, stock is a relatively liquid investment product  compared to Reserve Bank stock, which cannot be sold or otherwise  posted as collateral. Agency mortgage-backed securities are debt  obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage  loans, most commonly on residential property. We found that agency  mortgage-backed securities generally return higher yields than Treasury  bonds, but not as high as corporate bonds, which have higher risk.", "Therefore, by discussing Treasury and corporate bonds, we are  illustrating a complete range of possible returns.", "To assess the potential implications of capping the aggregate Reserve  Banks\u2019 surplus account, we reviewed past GAO, Congressional Research  Service, and Congressional Budget Office reports and Federal Reserve  financial documents on the status of the surplus account. We interviewed  Federal Reserve officials, including from the Board of Governors and the  Reserve Banks; former members of the Board of Governors who had  written about the changes in the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation  Act (FAST Act); academics who had written extensively about the Federal  Reserve; other federal bank regulators, including the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC); and, banking industry associations. To assess the  potential implications of modifying the Reserve Bank stock dividend rate,  we reviewed Board of Governors financial documents as of June 30,  2016, for dividend payment information. We conducted structured  interviews with 17 commercial banks (including 14 member and 3  nonmember banks) to obtain their perspectives on the dividend rate  modification and if it would affect their membership decisions or status.  We selected commercial banks for these interviews to ensure  representation for all size categories and primary federal banking  regulator, using data from SNL Financial. We assessed the reliability of  the data by reviewing information about the data and systems that  produced them, and by reviewing assessments we did for previous  studies. We determined that the data we used remain sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To assess the potential implications of modifying the stock ownership  requirement, we reviewed academic literature on the structure and  independence of central banks. We also interviewed selected academics  and economists who had written extensively on central bank  independence; the chairpersons of all the Reserve Banks\u2019 boards of  directors, who may not be affiliated with commercial banks; officials from  FDIC and OCC; and banking industry associations. In the structured  interviews with selected commercial banks described above, we also  sought to learn what factors might influence the banks\u2019 choice to become  a member of the Federal Reserve, and whether potential modifications to  the Reserve Banks\u2019 stock ownership structure would affect their choice.  We presented three scenarios (of changes to the stock ownership  requirement and therefore the Federal Reserve\u2019s structure) in the  interviews to which respondents could react and discuss implications. The  scenarios are illustrative and do not represent all of the ways in which the  Federal Reserve structure might be altered nor does our analysis account  for all of the potential consequences of stock ownership modifications.  Furthermore, our discussion of the range of consequences is limited to  the respondents\u2019 responses and the strategy in the interview, without  knowledge of the mechanisms that could be put in place to retain the  benefits of the current structure or mitigate any negative effects of the  changes.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to February  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
