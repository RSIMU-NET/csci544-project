The overall goal of the initiative is to contribute to universal education for all by using school meals to attract children to school, keep them attending once they enroll, and improve learning. An estimated 300 million children in  developing countries are chronically undernourished, and many of them  are among an estimated 120 million who do not now attend school. At the same time, the president announced a 1-year, $300-million pilot food for education program to be administered by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) to jump-start the proposed global effort. The pilot\u2019s objectives are to use school meals to improve student enrollment,  attendance, and performance. Under the program, the United States is using the authority of section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 to  donate surplus agricultural commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation\u2019s (CCC) inventory for use in existing as well as new and  expanded school feeding and preschool nutrition projects in developing  countries.

As a  result, our observations on the pilot program concern its design and  implementation through December 2001 and do not assess the in-country  phase of the program. To address the issues outlined above we met with  and reviewed information from U.S. government officials at the  Departments of Agriculture and State, as well as the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), the Office of Management and  Budget, and the White House. We also gathered information from and met  with officials of the U.N.

In April 2000, the \u201cWorld Education  Forum\u201dmet in Dakar, Senegal.  Delegates from 181 nations adopted a  framework for action committing their governments to achieve quality  basic education for all\u2014including ensuring that by 2015, all children\u2014  especially girls, children in difficult circumstances, and those from ethnic  minorities\u2014have access to completely free primary education of good  quality.", "Also in early 2000, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Food Agencies in Rome  proposed that the United States, within the U.N. framework, take the lead  in organizing a worldwide  school lunch program. The purpose would be  to provide a meal every day for every needy child in the world.  Doing so,  the ambassador said, would attract children to school and keep them there  under conditions in which they are able to learn and grow. The United  States would pay 25 percent of the cost, and other donor nations would pay  the rest.  The United States would benefit, since Americans produce more  food than they can eat or profitably sell and since most of the U.S.  contribution would be in the form of agricultural commodities and thus  would strengthen the market for cereal grain, dairy products, and livestock.  According to the ambassador, other farm surplus countries such as France,  Canada, and Australia would benefit as well.", "In late May 2000, President Clinton met with the ambassador to discuss the  idea and asked senior advisers to prepare an analysis of how the United  States might participate. In early July 2000, the advisers reported that all  relevant agencies recommended that the president announce a U.S. pilot  program to support the international community\u2019s goal of achieving  universal access to basic education by 2015 and the U.N.\u2019s 10-year \u201cGirls\u2019  Education Initiative\u201d to help poor countries eliminate gender disparities in  educational access. The advisers recommended spending approximately  $300 million in the first year on the pilot program, with levels in subsequent  years dependent upon factors such as the extent of international  participation and the continued availability of CCC funding.  At the  Okinawa Summit on July 23, 2000, the president announced the Global  Food for Education Initiative and the pilot program.", "According to the White House press release, which was issued the day the  program was announced, the purpose of the pilot program is to improve  student enrollment, attendance, and performance in poor countries.

Partners include WFP and various cooperating  sponsors. Among the latter are 13 PVOs and 1 foreign government  (Dominican Republic).  As of mid-December 2001, USDA had finalized  agreements for 21 of 25 PVO projects, 26 of 27 WFP projects, and 1 project  with the Dominican Republic. The recent total estimated cost for all of the  pilot projects was $227.7 million, allocated as follows: WFP projects, $92.5  million; PVO projects, $121.1 million; and the government of the Dominican  Republic, $14.1 million. The total cost is $72.3 million less than the  originally planned $300 million initiative.

There is considerable evidence that school feeding  programs can increase enrollment and attendance if the programs are  targeted at the right communities or populations.  Evidence of the  effectiveness of school feeding programs in improving learning is  somewhat more mixed, possibly because of difficulties isolating factors  associated with increased learning, the quality of studies assessing such  relationships, or the quality and settings of such programs. Programs are  more likely to have a positive result on enrollment, attendance, and  learning when they are integrated with a facilitative learning environment  and appropriate health and nutritional interventions. Community  participation and parental involvement also promote these objectives.  Taking steps to ensure that programs will be sustainable when donor  assistance is no longer available is important for ensuring long-term  effectiveness. At the same time, school feeding programs are costly and  may not be cost effective, relative to other possible interventions. (Apps. IV  and V provide results from selected studies on these issues.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Targeting the Right Population Can Improve Enrollment and Attendance", "paragraphs": ["Evidence indicates that school feeding programs can improve school  enrollment and attendance if they target the right population. In general,  studies and experts point to the importance of targeting programs on low- income communities that lack a secure supply of food and have relatively  low rates of school enrollment and attendance. When school feeding  programs do improve enrollment and attendance, their contribution is  primarily through a transfer of income (the food) to families. School  feeding programs may not have much of an impact if children are staying  away because the distance to school is too far to walk, parents perceive the  quality of the education to be low, or children are disabled. Providing  national coverage to all children is usually not cost effective. Targeting  high-risk communities is preferable to targeting individual children within  schools, which could lead to competition among students and parents,  dilution of nutritional impact through food sharing, and insufficient  community support. (See app. IV for results from selected studies on the  use of targeting to improve the effectiveness of school feeding programs.)", "According to several experts and practitioners, school feeding programs  can also help reduce the educational gender gap\u2014where the proportion of  school-age boys attending school significantly exceeds that for school-age  girls. Many studies have shown that the inability of households to cover  direct and indirect costs of education results in fewer girls attending  school. This inequity exists partly because parents perceive less value in  educating girls, there is greater demand for girls\u2019 labor at home, and girls  are more affected by issues of school location and security. Yet some of the  highest returns to education and other development investments derive  from girls\u2019 education.

These packages typically  contain some combination of interventions to (1) reduce the opportunity  costs of sending girls to school; (2) improve the quality and relevance of  education; (3) increase access to close, safe schools equipped with basic  infrastructure; (4) educate parents and communities about the benefits of  girls' education; and (5) establish supportive national policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facilitative Environment Needed for Effective Learning", "paragraphs": ["A group of experts and practitioners who convened at USAID headquarters  in October 2000concluded that little learning is likely to occur without a  facilitative learning environment, where teachers engage children in  stimulating learning tasks, provide frequent feedback and encouragement,  and are equipped with motivational textbooks and other learning  materials. A facilitative learning environment also requires a suitable  physical environment and minimal school supplies. Unfortunately, most  schooling in the developing world is far from this kind of environment.Teaching is frequently of poor quality and is poorly supported; and the  curriculum often has little relevance to rural life, making formal schooling  unconnected with the needs of rural communities. Thus, most developing  countries require investments in teacher training; basic supplies (books,  blackboards, desks, and chairs); a suitable physical environment; and other  learning materials. Furthermore, many school systems in developing  countries are dysfunctional, characterized by dispersed or displaced  populations (as a result of conflict or natural calamities), limited basic  infrastructure, and endemic child malnutrition. Many experts and  practitioners also conclude that food for education programs must take  place within the context of broad, national education reform programs that  focus on essential inputs to education and learning, such as teacher  development, curriculum reform, and student assessment.

Meanwhile, using  enriched foods or complementing commodities in school feeding programs  with locally available vitamin and mineral-rich foods is an effective route to  alleviating the complex micronutrient deficiencies that schoolchildren in  developing countries often suffer. At the same time, school feeding  programs designed to capture both nutritional and educational gains need  to invest in adequate water and sanitation at schools, since poor water and  sanitation give rise to infectious diseases, including parasites, which  adversely affect schoolchildren\u2019s enrollment, attendance, and learning.

These costs may be difficult for national governments to  absorb and thus adversely affect long-term program sustainability.", "Estimates of the average cost of school feeding programs vary considerably  (see app. V). According to WFP, the average cost per student of its  development school feeding projects in 2000 was 19 cents per day, or $34  for a 180-day school year (see app. V). Programs costing $34 per pupil per  school year are substantial when compared with what many developing  countries spend on education.  For example, in 1997 public expenditures of  19 least-developed countries for both pre-primary and primary education  averaged only $20 per pupil, according to UNESCO.  Average public  expenditures of five southern Asian countries were reported at $40 per  pupil.", "According to many experts, national ministries of education in developing  countries should not be encouraged to take on school feeding at the  expense of other educational inputs. Few national governments are  committed to school feeding programs over the long term, they said. In  addition, many governments and education ministries already are  struggling to maintain barely functioning education systems; may not be  equipped, financially or technically, to assume the additional burden of  food distribution; and do not have the financial resources to sustain feeding  programs after donor support is withdrawn. These experts say that  getting local communities involved from the beginning and giving them  ownership of school feeding programs greatly increase the chances for  long-term program sustainability.  According to WFP, its guidelines for  school feeding programs require both national governments and local  communities to provide a significant amount of resources and  infrastructure.", "There are potential detrimental impacts if school feeding programs are not  effectively implemented. For example, where adequate infrastructure is not  available, increased attendance may lead to overcrowding and actually  reduce educational achievement for existing students, while providing  minimal benefit to new students.  In some developing country  circumstances, the school day is only a few hours. In such cases, time  taken to prepare a meal may further limit an already inadequate period of  instruction. In addition, if volunteers are not available to provide labor,  teachers may be required to undertake this task at the expense of  instructional time. Since school feeding is a highly visible income transfer,  it may also be used for political purposes by actors in the recipient country.  If school feeding programs are relatively ineffective, they may result in  resources being taken away from better performing programs.", "According to several experts, in particular situations, school feeding  programs may not be as cost effective in promoting learning as other  possible approaches, such as establishing maternal child health and early  childhood development programs or providing alternative nutritional and  educational interventions (see app. V)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pilot Program Did Not Adequately Incorporate Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["The pilot program has not provided reasonable assurance that lessons from  previous school feeding and food for education programs have been  integrated into approved pilot projects.

In fact, about one-third of  the approved PVO agreements were not signed by the end of September  2001. In addition, the change presented problems for some PVOs because it  required them to monetize increased quantities of commodities within  recipient countries to recover some of their costs, and there were limits on  the commodity tonnage that could be monetized effectively.  Some PVOs  were also upset because all of WFP\u2019s operating expenses, including  headquarters\u2019 costs, were funded by CCC cash payments.  Legislative relief  in the form of limited CCC funding was provided to PVOs in late July 2001;  at that time, only 4 PVO agreements had been signed.

All 21 proposals contained provisions that  required reporting on the number of meals served, enrollment and  attendance levels (including female attendance), and establishment of  infrastructure relevant to sustaining the feeding program, such as PTAs and  community groups.  However, less than half of these agreements indicated  a requirement for baseline data; and a majority of the agreements did not  specify performance targets for enrollment, attendance, and female  attendance. None of the agreements included reporting requirements for  educational performance.

According to USDA and WFP  officials, WFP conducted the surveys in a sample of schools for all of its  projects before the end of 2001 and before the food aid was distributed. In  addition to collecting basic information on the feeding program, the  survey sought detailed baseline and subsequent performance data on school  enrollment and attendance (broken down by boys and girls and grade  level); the number of certified and uncertified teachers in the school; the number of classrooms; certain baseline information on community and parental involvementand health and nutrition issues;  and whether the school had other ongoing programs related to effective  school feeding programs and if so, the name of the donor providing the  program.", "The survey also called for the use of focus groups to collect views on the  likely reasons why eligible children did not enroll and enrolled boys and  girls did not attend school during a year.", "The survey instrument indicates WFP\u2019s interest in upgrading monitoring  and evaluation of its feeding programs, since previous efforts revealed  some weaknesses.

In August  2001, it convened a working group of USDA officials and USAID  consultants with expertise in monitoring and evaluation methodologies to  discuss the issue. The group recommended use of local school or  government records for collecting data on enrollment and attendance, but  it was against collecting quantitative data on indicators for measuring  educational progress (such as reduced dropout rates, retention and/or  completion, and promotion to the next grade) and level of community  participation and infrastructure development.  For the latter variables, it  recommended information be collected through a combination of focus  groups and structured interviews with school staff and parent and  community groups.", "In fall 2001, USDA decided to use the WFP survey instrument for the  cooperating sponsors\u2019 projects and, like WFP, apply the survey in a sample  of the schools in each project. According to USDA officials, doing so would  allow collection of comparable data, provided USDA\u2019s sampling strategy  was properly designed. USDA also decided to contract with about 20 local  national monitors (approximately 1 per country) to collect the data and 5  regional coordinators to manage the monitors. In late December 2001,  USDA officials told us they planned to add a few more questions to the  survey to address concerns about whether some of the projects were well  targeted. They also said the surveys would be conducted in early 2002.", "USDA officials told us that they ultimately decided not to measure change  in school learning. They said that from the beginning of the pilot, USDA,  WFP, and PVOs were concerned about the ability to effectively evaluate  and judge an increase in student performance under a 1-year pilot program.  Research that tries to demonstrate improvements in academic achievement  is lengthy and requires a long-term approach, they said. USAID officials  with whom we spoke were also critical of the short time allowed for  running the pilot program.

USDA uses an international  consultative process\u2014the Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus  Disposal (CSSD)\u2014to keep the pilot program\u2019s food aid from interfering  with commercial exports.  The process involves notification of various  categories of food aid donations, prior consultation with other exporters,  and establishment of Usual Marketing Requirements (UMR) to ensure that  food aid recipients maintain a normal intake of commercial imports in  addition to the food aid they receive. According to the CSSD, in recent  years several factors reduced the effectiveness of the UMR approach,  including (1) lack of uniformity in the compliance period (fiscal year, crop  year, and calendar year); (2) fewer food aid operations covered by the UMR  because many transactions are exempt; (3) a rise in UMR waivers for  countries facing difficult economic situations; and (4) delays in collecting  trade data, which make establishment of 5-year average commercial  imports as a benchmark for current import levels unrealistic.  USDA  officials acknowledged that some countries have expressed concerns that  GFEI might adversely affect commercial exports but said they have not  received any specific complaints about the U.S. pilot\u2019s food exports.", "To address disincentive effects of food aid on local production, the United  States requires all proposed food aid projects to submit an analysis  showing the recipient has adequate storage facilities and that food aid will  not disrupt domestic production and marketing.

All  cooperating sponsors concluded that the amount of food for their projects  was so small it was unlikely to significantly affect local production. But  their analysis of data on local market conditions was generally based on  production of identical commodities. For example, if wheat was not grown  in the recipient country, sponsors concluded there was no disincentive to  importing and monetizing wheat\u2014without considering whether the  amount of imported wheat would affect price or demand for locally  produced substitute commodities.  Cooperating sponsors did not  adequately verify that the commodities were in demand and would not  compete with local markets, other commercial export programs, and other  donor imports.", "USDA officials told us that cooperating sponsors are responsible for  analyzing the potential disincentive effects of their projects. They said  USAID no longer has agricultural officers stationed overseas and now  USDA has to rely on PVOs\u2014which have on-the-ground, in-country staff\u2014to  determine whether the food aid will adversely affect recipient country  markets.

The PVOs provide  more detailed financial reporting, in part, because a large portion of the  commodities they receive are to be monetized in country to cover foodand other expenses.

We found that WFP had not met its obligation  to provide USDA with an accounting for past Section 416(b) program  donations by providing detailed actual cost data.  As a result, USDA is not  in position to know whether its advances to WFP, on the basis of initial cost  estimates, are consistent with actual project costs and to what extent the  project objectives are being achieved within the approved budget  estimates. A similar situation exists with USAID-funded donations to WFP.

However, USDA began the GFEI pilot quickly and did not  require potential implementing partners to provide important information  on the linkages to these other interventions. Since most of the pilot\u2019s  funding is targeted for the school meals, it is unclear whether these other  important factors that contribute to effective programs are adequately  addressed. In addition, USDA has not effectively managed the pilot in part  because of its lack of expertise and resources for food for education  development programs. It has not set specific targets or desired  performance levels for enrollment and attendance in its agreements with  most of its implementing partners.

In 2000, WFP fed 83 million people in 83  countries, including most of the world\u2019s refugees and internally displaced  people.  It shipped 3.5 million tons of food; received $1.75 billion in  donations; and had operational expenditures of $1.49 billion (provisional  figures).", "WFP provides three basic kinds of food aid:  (1) emergency assistance to  cope with the adverse food effects of natural disasters, civil conflict, and  war; (2) protracted relief or rehabilitation aid to help people rebuild their  lives and communities once the causes of emergencies recede; and (3)  development assistance that aims to make communities food secure so  they can devote time, attention, and work to escaping the poverty trap.  When WFP was founded, its food assistance primarily focused on  development, and for years development projects accounted for more than  two-thirds of its expenditures. However, during the past 15 years, WFP has  become increasingly involved in responding to humanitarian emergencies.  According to WFP officials, WFP devoted 28 percent of its resources to  development in 1997, 18 percent in 1999, and only 13 percent in 2000.", "WFP relies entirely on voluntary contributions to finance its projects.  Governments are the principal source of funding, but corporations,  foundations, and individuals also contribute. Donations are made either as  cash, food (such as grains, beans, oil, salt, and sugar), or the basic items  necessary to grow, cook, and store food\u2014kitchen utensils, agricultural  tools, and warehouses.  Since it has no independent source of funds, WFP\u2019s  Executive Board has mandated that all food donations, whether in cash or  in-kind, must be accompanied by the cash needed to move, manage, and  monitor the food aid.", "WFP has been running school feeding programs for nearly 40 years.  In  1999, it operated 76 school feeding projects in 48 developing countries.  These included 33 emergency or protracted relief projects that had 5.28  million beneficiaries and 43 development projects that had 5.85 million  beneficiaries. Thus, total beneficiaries were 11.13 million.  In 2000, WFP  operated 68 projects in 54 countries, with a total of 12.27 million  beneficiaries.  According to WFP, the total expenditure for its school  feeding operations in 2000 was approximately $421 million. About $239  million was for development projects focused on school feeding, and the  remainder was for school feeding components of emergency or protracted  relief and recovery operations.", "WFP welcomed President Clinton\u2019s July 23, 2000, announcement of the  $300 million pilot program to launch a universal school feeding program,  noted that it had been working closely with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.  Food Agencies in Rome to assist in the creation of such a program, and  expressed the hope that the initiative would become a permanent feature  of the global community of nations. A few days later, WFP\u2019s executive  director, in testimony before a U.S. Senate committee, said a global  program needs to be managed by a global organization and WFP, as the  food aid arm of the U.N., was uniquely qualified to manage the initiative.", "Regarding its role in implementing a global program, WFP has said that  much could be done to strengthen the education system in many  developing countries.According to WFP, this a highly complex task, one  for which food aid is not the most effective resource. WFP\u2019s approach will  be to use food aid where the food is needed. WFP does not propose to  monetize food commodities to fund related educational support activities.  WFP will monetize only to effect an exchange between donated  commodities and locally grown foods when this is cost effective and does  not have an adverse effect on local markets. At the same time, WFP  recognizes that while school feeding can bring children to school and help  them learn while they are there, school feeding does not ensure qualified  teachers, books and supplies, or a suitable curriculum. According to WFP,  this is the role of national governments, often supported by international  organizations or Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO); and the  relationship between improvements in an education system and a national  system of school feeding is one that must be managed by governments.", "However, within the broad framework of government cooperation, WFP  said, it is eager to work with other operational partners and experienced in  doing so."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Underfunding of Projects", "paragraphs": ["WFP told us that many of its school feeding projects have shortfalls.Funding for all components of approved projects, including current school  feeding programs, depends on the level of contributions received.

An unstable  resourcing situation often compels project managers to temporarily adjust  the on-site ration size or the number of food distribution days, rather than  reducing the number of beneficiaries, it said. When under-resourcing is of a  more permanent nature, the project plan is revised and a formal change in  the beneficiaries occurs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WFP\u2019S Approach to Certain Key Factors Associated with Effective School Feeding Programs", "paragraphs": ["WFP has developed several documents that describe its policies for  establishing school feeding programs and which guide the project  development and approval process for all WFP school feeding activities.The following is a brief summary of some of the points presented in these  documents, or provided directly to us by WFP in response to questions that  we provided to the agency, regarding certain key factors associated with  their school feeding programs.", "Targeting\u2014The focus of WFP\u2019s world school feeding initiative is on  feeding preschool and primary school age children. On an exceptional  basis, food aid activities designed to encourage girls to continue their  education beyond primary school will be considered. Some fundamental  issues to be examined in determining the problems to be addressed are  (1) enrollment and dropout rates in primary education broken down by  gender, region and sociocultural groups, to the extent possible, and  factors explaining these rates; (2) extent of, and factors contributing to,  short-term hunger; (3) average distances walked by the students, who  will be covered in the school feeding activity, between their homes and  their school; and (4) cultural practices affecting enrollment/attendance,  especially of girls.", "As a general rule, targeting within school feeding projects will be  conducted at the level of geographic areas, with no selection of  individual pupils within schools. The only exception for this may be  when the effectiveness of an incentive for a particular category (e.g.,  girls) can be demonstrated. According to WFP, it requires at least 50  percent of its resources in education to be targeted for girls, and WFP  has been very successful in achieving this requirement.", "WFP has a vulnerability analysis and mapping unit (VAM) to identify  people most vulnerable to hunger and to target their needs. According to  WFP, VAM uses state of the art satellite imagery of rainfall and crop  conditions, as well as monitoring of food prices in local markets. WFP  has VAM sub-units in more than 50 developing countries. According to  WFP, this system is also used in targeting its school feeding programs.", "Facilitative learning environment\u2014WFP told us that it does not require  a facilitative learning environment to be in place  or provided as part of  its programs, but such an environment is highly desired and encouraged.  According to WFP, the presence of school feeding in schools helps bring  attention to other school conditions (e.g., classrooms, materials,  sanitary facilities, teachers, curricula, and health conditions) and, in  turn,  helps WFP and its partners to bring attention to problems and  attract other needed resources.", "Safe water and sanitation\u2014WFP guidelines say basic water supply and  sanitation standards must be met if food is to be safely stored and  prepared for school feeding, and safe water supply should be available  on the school premises at all times. WFP provides detailed information  on optimal and minimal standards for a safe water supply and sanitation  at schools. However, WFP told us it does not require safe water and  sanitation facilities to be in place in order to implement school feeding  in a given school and, as a rule, does not provide water and sanitation  facilities. However, WFP said, it  does work with the national and local  governments and with other U.N. agencies, donors, and  nongovernmental organizations who have the appropriate skills and  resources to \u201ctrigger\u201d action where the lack of such facilities is a  problem.", "Deworming treatments\u2014According to WFP guidelines, WFP will  generally support deworming in a school feeding program when more  than 50 percent of the children have intestinal parasites. Treatment is  with a single dose of the proper medicine, up to three times a year, and  should be combined with improved sanitation and safe water supply, as  well as health education on prevention. In April 2001, WFP told us that it  did not yet have complete information regarding which of its school  feeding programs had already initiated deworming activities (due to  decentralized decision-making and no prior requirements for reporting  such information). However, WFP said it did know that most or all of its  school feeding operations in Latin America and the Caribbean and two  or more in Asia had at least implemented limited deworming activities.  WFP estimated that by the end of 2001, it would have initiated  deworming in its school feeding programs in 15 or more countries, in  partnership with WHO and the World Bank, and assisted, in part, by a  Canadian grant. WFP said that it hopes to achieve deworming activities  in most or all GFEI, as well other WFP school feeding operations. WFP  also noted that national, regional, or local governments may require  deworming to be in place.", "Micronutrient supplementation\u2014WFP guidelines note that school  feeding can be a vehicle for micronutrients in countries where school  children are affected by and/or at high risk of developing micronutrient  deficiencies. WFP provides information on micronutrient deficiencies  that have been shown to affect school attendance and performance,  recommended levels of intake of these micronutrients for 3- to 12-year  old children, and guidance on how to use them in school meals. WFP  told us that micronutrient supplementation is most often handled as an  additive to the commodities that are distributed. In cases where the  commodities that arrive are not fortified, WFP most often works locally  to fortify the food or seeks other remedies. WFP collaborates with  groups that have expertise and resources to bring to bear, especially  UNICEF, WHO, a Canadian micronutrient initiative, and certain NGOs.  WFP noted that national, regional, or local governments may require  micronutrient supplementation to be in place.", "Health and nutrition education\u2014WFP told us that this is not strictly  required in all WFP school feeding operations. However, such activities  are highly encouraged, are frequently planned and implemented, and  will be further strengthened through collaboration with appropriate  partners and coworkers on the ground. WFP noted that national,  regional, or local governments may require health and nutrition  education to be in place.", "Community and parental participation\u2014WFP told us that community  and parental participation are not strictly required in all WFP school  feeding operations. However, WFP said, such activities are highly  encouraged,are frequently planned and implemented, and are and will  be further strengthened through collaboration with appropriate partners  and coworkers on the ground. WFP noted that its data indicates that as  girls\u2019 enrollment and attendance increases, so does parental  participation. WFP also noted that national, regional, or local  governments may require parental involvement to be in place.", "Education for All\u2014WFP expects recipient governments to have  demonstrated a commitment to Education for All.", "Sustainability\u2014WFP requires that plans be in place for eventual take- over of a feeding program by recipient countries. WFP generally insists  that programs be supported by national governments and local  communities and that resources and infrastructure be provided as  counterpart contributions. However, WFP will consider providing  school feeding activities in some emergency and protracted relief  situations where full government support is not possible. In addition, for  low income countries, it is probably necessary to provide most or all of  the food commodities, technical assistance, and equipment.", "According to a WFP official, sustainability depends on the economic  status of the recipient country. There are countries where the national  government has been able to take over a program. However, in the  poorest, least developed countries, he said, sustainability is only  possible where there is substantial community involvement. In many  least developed countries, government expenditure on the education  sector often represents up to 30 percent of the national budget; it is  difficult enough for such countries to maintain the physical  infrastructure and teachers. For least developed countries,  sustainability is a long-term process. A realistic estimate is 10 to 15  years, he said.", "Monitoring and Evaluation\t WFP officials told us that there had been some problems in the past, but  WFP is working hard to overcome them for both the U.S. pilot program and  its other school feeding activities. As an example of problems, collection of  baseline date had varied, depending on the country, the specific goals of the  school feeding activity, and the resources available. Principal performance  indicators that WFP tended to use were increased enrollment and  attendance, reduced dropout rates, and improved performance (such as  number of students who had completed primary school the previous year  and gone on to higher education). WFP had looked at these indicators,  especially as they relate to girls\u2019 education, and had been able to report  some notable successes. However, WFP had only done that in isolated  cases/countries. Therefore, WFP intends under GFEI to standardize the  indicators and upgrade its monitoring and evaluation systems so as to be  able to regularly collect and report comparable and up-to-date data for its  school feeding operations. WFP also said that data collection and analysis  in developing countries is challenging and requires additional resources  and capacity building of national counterpart staff.", "WFP\u2019s guidelines for its new World School Feeding Initiative require a  baseline monitoring study to establish the situation prior to the onset of the  initiative, followed by periodic updates as a program is implemented. To  this end, WFP developed a detailed survey instrument for collecting  baseline information on its GFEI-funded projects. The survey was pilot- tested in August 2001, and WFP conducted the surveys in a sample of  schools for all of the U.S. pilot program projects before the end of 2001  (details of the survey instrument are discussed in the letter).", "In addition, according to WFP, during 2001, it  developed and successfully  pilot-tested a new system of collecting key monitoring data on a timely  basis directly from the schools involved in its feeding programs. The  system involves school staff entering key data directly into devices,  installed at the schools, that transmit the data via satellite to a data  collection center in France, using the ARGOS satellite system (that is  jointly managed by the governments of France and the United States).  Country data is then reported from the data collection center to the  country\u2019s relevant ministry of education and to WFP. WFP is seeking  donors to fund implementation of the system.", "WFP also conducted a major, global survey of national school feeding  programs (not specific projects) between May and December 2001. The  survey collected information on countries\u2019 school feeding programs and  related information on their demography; education system;  nongovernmental program assistance; health-related education services at  school; and evaluations, studies, and surveys about school feeding and  related topics. According to WFP, the survey provides a focal point for  school feeding information, which WFP will use to promote dialogue with  governments and nongovernmental organizations concerning the use of  food aid for education and related issues. WFP will also use the data to  produce special reports and identify country specific needs and coordinate  partnerships between countries with experience in school feeding and  those in need. WFP is posting country-specific results on its Web site. WFP  is seeking donors to fund installation of the system in its schools.", "Regarding evaluations, WFP\u2019s central evaluation office generally does not  conduct separate evaluations of the school feeding projects that WFP  assists. (Occasionally separate evaluations of school feeding projects are  undertaken if specifically requested by the executive board.) WFP  mandates that evaluations of its country programs be conducted about  every 4 years, on average. The evaluations are submitted to WFP\u2019s  Executive Board for review.

Cost differences can be due to a variety  of factors, such as differing program objectives, type of food served, and  costs in transporting the food to the country and, once there, to its final  destination.", "In April 2001, WFP officials told us they estimated the current average cost  of WFP school feeding programs ranged between about $22 to $27 per  student, for a 180-day school year.  They said WFP did not have precise  figures available on the average costs of its school feeding programs  because it has not required data to be reported in the specific category of  school feeding. Many large projects have a school feeding component, they  noted, but are not entirely devoted to school feeding. Subsequently, in July  2001, WFP issued a paper that reported the average cost of its school  feeding development projects in 2000 at 19 cents a day (or $34.20 for a 180  day program).", "We prepared a separate estimate of the cost of school feeding programs  using some WFP guidelines and cost factors and other data. According to  WFP, the recommended daily school feeding ration for full-time primary  school students can range between 600 to 2,000 calories, depending on  whether schools are half day, full day, or boarding. For day school, the  recommended acceptable range is between 1,200 to 1,500 calories (i.e., 60  to 75 percent of the daily energy requirements of school-age children). The  guidelines also indicate that a minimum of 10 percent of calories should be  obtained from consumption of edible fats. In addition, the guidelines for  day schools recommend that school feeding programs provide 28 to 36  grams of protein; 13 to 17 grams of fat; and no more than 300 grams of  cereals, 30 grams of pulses, and 15 grams of vegetable oil.", "We analyzed the nutritional value of typical food aid commodities and  determined that the least costly mix of commodities\u2014consisting of corn  and vegetable oil--that met the above requirements for primary day schools  would cost 3.72 cents per child per day (based on USDA valuations of the  commodities for 2001). If this diet were supplied for 180 days, the food  alone would cost approximately $6.69 per child. On the basis of overall  WFP costs for its various food aid programs in 1998 to 1999, we estimated  that administrative, storage, and transportation costs would result in an  additional cost per child (for a 180-day school meal program) of $7.70.  The  total average cost of this diet would be $14.39 per student. When factoring  in the nutritional requirements of school-age children to include other  essential elements, such as vitamins, micronutrients, and minerals, we  found the lowest-cost, most nutritionally-complete recipe would cost  $29.67 per child ($13.80 for the food and $15.87 for administrative and  transportation costs.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Situations Where Other Approaches May Be More Cost Effective", "paragraphs": ["According to a number of experts, school feeding programs may be less  cost effective than other possible approaches, such as establishing  maternal child health and early childhood development programs and  providing alternative nutritional or educational interventions.", "According to a USAID official, if nutrition is the problem, maternal child health and  preschool feeding programs are more cost effective than school feeding programs. If  education is a major weakness, investments in educational reform, teacher training, and  learning facilities are more cost effective.", "In 2001, a USAID contracted evaluation of its school feeding program in Haiti, covering  the period 1996 to 2000, was completed. (The program was primarily a school feeding only  operation; however, some resources were devoted to food for education activities.) The  report concluded there is no causal connection between school feeding and improved  educational performance. Other factors such as school quality and parental variables, have a  more direct influence on educational outcomes, it said. The report found the food for  education approach to be very promising, provided that food is used as leverage to improve  school quality. The report recommended USAID consider devoting all of the school feeding  resources to food for education activities. However, USAID decided to phase out school  feeding activities over a 3-year period. According to a USAID official, Haiti was loosing too  many kids before they ever got to school. As a result, USAID concluded it would be more  cost effective to employ the resources in a maternal and child health program. increase the likelihood that children will be healthy when they reach school  age.", "Table 12 provides an estimate of the cost effectiveness of nutrition-related  interventions for a typical developing country, in terms of the return on  each program dollar spent, as reported by the World Bank.  (Impact is  estimated in terms of wages rather than learning per se.) As shown in table  12, school feeding has one of the lowest return ($2.80) of the 11  interventions.  Interventions with the highest returns on each program  dollar spent are iron fortification of flour ($84.10), vitamin A  supplementation for all children under age 5 ($50), nutrition education  ($32.30), and iodized salt ($28).", "In a study of the cost effectiveness of 40 educational interventions in Latin  America, the authors surveyed a panel of 10 world experts on educational  research and practical attempts at educational reform in the region, as well  as 30 Latin American planner/practitioners working primarily in education  ministries. Of the 40 interventions, 4 were variations on school feeding  programs. None of the school feeding options were identified as being  among the top 10 interventions for increasing learning, taking account of  the estimated likelihood of adequate implementation (see table 13). The  school feeding options were ranked between 23 and 34 in terms of  increasing learning and between 34 and 40 when cost effectiveness was  also considered.", "According to Beryl Levinger, an expert on school feeding and food for  education programs, there are children in developing countries that can  effectively and efficiently benefit from school feeding programs. Short- term hunger is a genuine problem, and school feeding is one way to get and  keep children enrolled in school, she said. At the same time, success in  improving school enrollment, attendance, and learning is context driven,  and many external factors can affect and interfere with these outcomes,  she said.  Therefore, according to Levinger, one needs to assess the total  picture and identify the most important needs and best solutions for  addressing them. For example, if the quality of education in a particular  community is low and resources are limited, it is possible that resources  could be better spent on improving education than addressing short-term  hunger. As learning tasks become more interesting, she noted, learning  goes up. Levinger estimated that providing motivational textbooks and  other learning materials and training teachers in active learning methods  would cost roughly about $5 per pupil per year. For an additional $2, she  said, one could also provide some micronutrient supplementation and  deworming treatments.", "Multiple studies of treatments for intestinal parasite infections, through  iron supplementation and regular deworming, have shown benefits of  lower absenteeism and higher scores on tests of cognition or school  achievement at a cost of about $1 per child per year. This is considerably  less costly than school feeding programs that average $34 per child per  year. However, we are not aware of any studies that assess and compare  the relative impacts of programs that only treat for parasite infections to  programs that provide a school meal.", "In April 2000, the World Health Organization, the U.N. Educational,  Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the U.N. Children\u2019s Fund, and the  World Bank proposed a strategy for Focusing Resources on Effective  School Health (FRESH) to give a fresh start to improving the quality and  equity of education and promoting the Education for All goal. They noted  that poor health and malnutrition are important underlying factors for low  school enrollment, absenteeism, poor classroom performance, and early  school dropout. The agencies identified a core group of activities that they  said captured the best practices from their programming experiences, were  highly cost-effective, and a starting point to which other interventions  might be added as appropriate. The agencies recommended that the  following basic components of a school health program be made available  together, in all schools: (1) health related school policies; provision of  safe water and sanitation; (3) skills based health, hygiene, and nutrition  education; and (4) school based health and nutrition services.", "Regarding the latter component, the agencies said schools can effectively  deliver some health and nutritional services provided that the services are  simple, safe, and familiar and address problems that are prevalent and  recognized as important within the community. For example, they said,  micronutrient deficiencies and worm infections may be effectively dealt  with by infrequent (6-monthly or annual) oral treatment. As another  example, they said changing the timing of meals, or providing a snack to  address short-term hunger during school\u2014an important constraint on  learning\u2014can contribute to school performance.", "In commenting on a draft of portions of this report, WFP officials said there  has been no more cost-effective approach identified than school feeding for  the combined objectives of increasing enrollment, attendance, and  performance in developing countries--especially in areas of food insecurity.

This cost is the largest except for the commodities themselves and is  estimated to be roughly one-third of the overall pilot program.  In the case  of urgent and extraordinary relief requirements, CCC may also pay the  partners for internal transportation, storage, and handling (ITSH) expenses  but not for nonemergency development assistance, which is the principal  type of aid provided by the pilot.

Local currency proceeds generated from the sale of section 416(b)  commodities can be used to finance most of the sponsors\u2019 operating  costs\u2014as long as they are specifically approved by USDA in program  agreements.  Monetization is generally how the PVOs and government  sponsors recover their operating costs.  Furthermore, these sponsors\u2019  budgets and provisions for financial statement and monetization reporting  as well as limitations on budget adjustments without prior USDA approval  are incorporated into the program agreements.", "USDA\u2019s treatment of WFP on these matters differs from that of PVOs and a  government sponsor. USDA pays cash to WFP for all of these costs,  including headquarters\u2019 administrative expenses.  In doing so, it relies on  section 5(d) of the CCC Act.  This section provides authority for CCC to  expend funds in connection with disposal of surplus commodities if such  expenditure is required to aid in removing the surplus. WFP\u2019s general  policy, as approved by its executive board, is not to monetize commodities.  Thus WFP requires cash to cover its expenses.  In addition, WFP operates  under a \u201cfull cost recovery\u201d policy, which requires that the country making  a donation cover its full cost.  According to USDA\u2019s Office of General  Counsel, if USDA wants to dispose of surplus commodities through WFP, it  may pay associated costs using section 5(d) authority.", "Specifically, USDA costs incurred in connection with providing  commodities to WFP under the GFEI program are governed by an  agreement between CCC and WFP that covers matters related to donation  of commodities furnished under section 416(b) during calendar years 2001  and 2002.  Under this agreement, CCC agreed to pay WFP not only ocean  transportation but other authorized expenses incurred by WFP in  connection with distribution of commodities donated to it.  Collectively,  these other authorized expenses include internal transportation, storage  and handling, direct support costs, other direct operational costs, and  indirect support costs, up to the maximum amount approved by CCC.For the GFEI program, these costs amounted to about $35 million.", "When USDA requested sponsor proposals for the GFEI pilot program in  September 2000, it said CCC cash funds might also be available to cover  expenses related to implementing activities supported with commodities  acquired under section 5(d) of the CCC Charter Act.  USDA delivered the  same message in a meeting with PVOs to discuss the planned pilot  program.  As a result, most PVOs submitted proposals that were based on  receiving cash to cover some of their expenses. However, in January 2001,  USDA informed PVOs with approved proposals that cash would not be  available to them. Although USDA said it was prepared to adjust  approved sponsors\u2019 proposals to permit greater monetization of  commodities to cover costs, the USDA reversal posed a few problems.  First, monetized commodities cannot be used to cover the sponsors\u2019 direct  U.S. headquarters\u2019 administrative expenses. Second, depending on the  situation in a recipient country, additional monetization of commodities  might risk disrupting commercial sales.  Representatives of one PVO told  us the organization had submitted proposals for two countries where it was  not possible to monetize commodities; therefore, without cash to cover its  expenses, the PVO could not go forward. Several PVOs were also upset  because they felt that USDA was providing preferential treatment to WFP.", "USDA noted that its long-standing policy for section 416(b) projects was  not to provide cash to PVOs unless the country is deemed urgent and  extraordinary. It further said that PVOs and WFP were treated differently  because they were fundamentally different in nature and in how they  acquired their funding.  USDA said that whereas PVOs are operated  privately and have access to other funding sources, WFP is governed and  funded only by its donor nations and thus not subject to or constrained by  the limitations of the section 416(b) regulations.  These reasons  notwithstanding, USDA did not explain why it had earlier indicated an  intention to provide cash to the sponsors.", "USDA\u2019s policy reversal led to delays in USDA\u2019s negotiating agreements for  implementing approved proposals for a number of PVO projects.  Some  PVOs were not satisfied with the policy change and made their views  known to members of Congress.  Subsequently, in July 2001, the Congress  approved legislation (P. L. 107-20) that included a provision authorizing  USDA to approve use of CCC funds up to about $22.9 million for financial  assistance to sponsors participating in the pilot program.  Funds could be  used for internal transportation, storage, and handling of commodities, as  well administrative expenses deemed appropriate by the secretary of  agriculture.  As a result of the congressional action, USDA agreed to  consider renegotiating agreements that it had already concluded with some  of the PVOs if they so desired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Top Food Aid Donating Countries", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides details on the top food aid donating countries in  recent years.

According to  USDA, GAO evaluated USDA against an unrealistic standard\u2014  performance\u2014rather than the objectives of enrollment and attendance.  In addition, USDA said, a much longer time frame would be required to  address all of the factors mentioned in the report (examples cited  include teacher training, infrastructure, learning materials, health and  nutrition programs, and community involvement). We disagree with  USDA\u2019s statements for two reasons. First, our conclusion is that school  feeding programs are more likely to improve enrollment and  attendance, as well as learning, if they are carefully integrated with  other key factors and interventions. Second, we conclude that the pilot  program could have been improved by determining in advance which  proposals were for communities where key factors were already in  place or would be addressed during the projects themselves.", "2.", "USDA disagreed with our statement that USDA lacked expertise in  managing development and humanitarian assistance such as food aid.  We have revised  that statement to specify expertise in food for  education development programs. At the same time we note that a  recent USDA study of its food aid monetization programs cited  difficulty evaluating the programs\u2019 impacts because of limited  personnel resources, high staff turnover, and increasing demands to  implement large food aid programs. In addition, the limited presence of  overseas agricultural attaches has adversely affected USDA\u2019s ability to  oversee some of its sponsors\u2019 monetization projects, the study said.  USDA\u2019s Inspector General has also expressed concern about this  matter.", "3.", "USDA said it believes that GAO\u2019s comparisons between the proposals  and the recommended program elements understate the quality of the  GFEI programs, since the proposal is only the beginning text of a  negotiated contractual process. We focused on the proposal process to  determine to what extent USDA secured information for judging and  selecting proposals that offered greater promise of improving school  enrollment, attendance, and learning.", "4.\t Regarding differences in the treatment of PVOs and WFP, USDA  reiterated (as discussed in our draft report) that the United States sits  on the WFP Executive Board, which approves all projects.  However,  executive board approval does not mean that the United States may not  have concerns about a particular project. As USAID advised, even when  the United States concurs with an executive board decision to approve  a project, the United States frequently states its concerns or  reservations about the feasibility or sustainability of program activities  and, according to USAID, has done so in the case of school feeding  projects. USDA also said it is confident that the information submitted  by WFP contains the required information listed in the Federal Register  notice or the regulations governing USDA food assistance programs.  However, WFP did not have to address requirements of the Federal  Register notice; the notice did not require as much information as we  believe would have been useful for evaluating proposals; and USDA\u2019s  416(b) regulations did not include specific information requirements  for assessing food for education programs.  5.\t USDA indicated agreement with our finding that analysis of the  disincentive effects of food aid projects should include the impact of  commodity donations on alternative food commodities. USDA said  doing so could improve analyses and be a goal for future projects. At  the same time, USDA said it stands by the pilot project assessments  that significant market disruptions will not occur\u2014even though such  analysis was not conducted.", "Our report notes that cooperating sponsors are responsible for analyzing  the potential disincentive effects of their projects and that USDA does not  independently verify the results of such analyses.  In addition, we noted  that USDA officials acknowledged that because PVOs want to provide the  food aid, these organizations may not be completely unbiased in preparing  analyses of disincentive effects. In its letter, USDA said the latter statement  is correct but in the opposite direction suggested by GAO. According to  USDA, PVOs are going to more rigorously analyze the food needs of an  area, because program success depends upon community support, which is  not going to occur if markets are disrupted. We agree that the latter is one  possible interpretation of the statement and therefore removed the  statement from the letter."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Gezahegne Bekele, Janey Cohen, Stacy  Edwards, Mary Moutsos, and Rolf Nilsson made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
