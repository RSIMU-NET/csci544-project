Survey response rates ranged from 69 percent for Medicare Advantage contractors to 80 percent for Medicaid agencies.

Among those that completed GAO's survey, more than 90 percent of Medicare contractors and state Medicaid agencies and 63 percent of TRICARE contractors reported some domestic outsourcing in 2005. Typically, survey groups reported engaging from 3 to 20 U.S. vendors (commonly known as subcontractors). One federal contractor and one state Medicaid agency reported outsourcing services directly offshore. However, some federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies also knew that their domestic vendors had initiated offshore outsourcing. Thirty-three Medicare Advantage contractors, 2 Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) contractors, and 1 Medicaid agency indicated that their domestic vendors transfer personal health information offshore, although they did not provide information about the scope of personal information transferred offshore. Moreover, the reported extent of offshore outsourcing by vendors may be understated because many federal contractors and agencies did not know whether their domestic vendors transferred personal health information to other locations or vendors. In responding to GAO's survey, over 40 percent of the federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies reported that they experienced a recent privacy breach involving personal health information. (The frequency or severity of these breaches was not reported.) By survey group, 47 percent of Medicare Advantage contractors reported privacy breaches within the past 2 years, as did 44 percent of Medicaid agencies, 42 percent of Medicare FFS contractors, and 38 percent of TRICARE contractors. TMA and CMS differ in their requirements for notification of privacy breaches. TMA requires monthly reports on privacy breaches from its TRICARE contractors and follows up with contractors that report recurring lapses in privacy. While CMS requires Medicare FFS contractors to report privacy breaches within 30 days of discovery, such oversight is lacking for privacy breaches that may occur with personal health information held by state Medicaid agencies and Medicare Advantage contractors, as CMS does not require reports of privacy breaches from these entities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Private firms that contract with federal agencies, as well as state Medicaid  agencies, play a lead role in administering three of the nation\u2019s largest  public health insurance programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and the  Department of Defense\u2019s TRICARE program. These federal contractors  and state Medicaid agencies carry out the day-to-day operations of their  respective health programs by performing a variety of services, such as  enrolling people into these programs, processing claims for payment, and  operating call centers to assist enrollees. In conducting these activities, the  federal contractors and state agencies have access to databases containing  personal health information\u2014such as an individual\u2019s medical diagnosis,  type of provider visited, or use of health care services\u2014on the more than  100 million Americans covered by these programs.", "The federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies may contract with  other companies\u2014called vendors\u2014to perform specific services routinely  or to supplement their staff in times of peak demand.

In 2004, patient survey data from a  California medical center were inadvertently made available to other  patients. The vendor originally responsible for developing the survey had  outsourced this task to another vendor, which in turn developed the  survey in such a way that allowed patients to view other patients\u2019 medical  information. Similarly, in 2003, a downstream vendor located outside of  the United States threatened to disclose personal health information in an  attempt to secure payment for her transcription services. Before this  incident, officials at the U.S. medical center responsible for the patients\u2019  information were not aware of the full extent to which their local medical  transcription company had subsequently outsourced its services to other  vendors.", "This report focuses on privacy issues associated with outsourcing services  involving the use of personal health information in the administration of  Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE.

Specifically, state Medicaid agencies,  Medicare Advantage, and TRICARE contractors that act either as health  plans or providers are covered entities under the HIPAA Privacy Rule,  while Medicare FFS contractors and the remaining TRICARE contractors  are considered business associates to CMS and TRICARE, respectively, in  their capacity as program contractors. Requirements under the HIPAA  Privacy Rule also apply to certain downstream vendors that receive  personal health information from federal contractors and state Medicaid  agencies through outsourcing arrangements.", "In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, U.S. law includes a number of  statutes that provide privacy protections, and some of them are applicable  only to federal agencies and their contractors. The Privacy Act of 1974, for  example, places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of  privacy information. Furthermore, the Federal Information Security  Management Act of 2002 generally concerns the protection of personal  information in the context of securing federal agencies\u2019 information, and  requires agencies to develop information security programs that include  contractors.

For example, one  Medicare Advantage contractor reported outsourcing to a Midwest vendor  a contract to scan paper claims and create and store electronic records.  The vendor, which has multiple domestic and several international  locations, performs these services in Mexico. In another case, a Medicare  Advantage contractor reported using its wholly owned subsidiary to  provide claims data entry services.

For example, a Medicare Advantage contractor reported  using a domestic subsidiary to provide claims data entry services. This  subsidiary, in turn, engages in downstream outsourcing with an  independent vendor located in India, where the data entry services for the  Medicare Advantage contractor are performed. Medicare Advantage  contractors were not the only respondents to report such downstream  outsourcing relationships.

The Privacy Rule  further specifies certain contract elements, including the conditions and  safeguards for uses and disclosures of personal health information. To  ensure that these conditions and safeguards also apply to downstream  vendors, the Privacy Rule requires a firm\u2019s or individual\u2019s business  associates to agree in writing that any subcontractor to which they  subsequently transfer personal health information will also contractually  agree to the same set of safeguards.", "At the same time, however, privacy experts point out that differences in  national data privacy laws may influence the significance of a firm\u2019s  contracts with its vendors. Countries differ in the scope of their data  privacy laws, with some offering broader data privacy protections than  those available in the United States and others with essentially no legal  protections for data privacy. For example, personal data transferred to a  member country of the European Union (EU) would have to be handled in  a manner consistent with the European Commission\u2019s Data Protection  Directive, which is generally considered to require more comprehensive  data protection than does the United States. By contrast, India has no law  that establishes protections for personal data.", "When a U.S. firm does business with a vendor in a country with relatively  weak or narrow data privacy protections, experts noted that the contract  between the outsourcing firm and the vendor can be used to help ensure  data privacy. In the United States, vendors could be held liable according  to the terms of their contract with the covered entity, which they are  required to have by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. To make certain that data are  similarly protected when outsourcing to a country with weaker privacy  protections, experts indicate that the contract should be used to specify, in  detail, the vendor\u2019s privacy practices and the right to terminate the  contract in the event of a privacy breach. The contract also may specify  which country\u2019s laws will be applied to resolve disputes that arise under  the contract, which has implications for both interpretation and  enforcement of the contract.", "When considering the implications of foreign privacy laws on data  transferred offshore, another factor to consider is the legal status of the  vendor.

Describing his organization\u2019s informal approach, the privacy officer for a  large provider group explained that he consults with other clients of the  vendor about their level of satisfaction and considers the vendor\u2019s long- term stability and reputation. In contrast, the chief privacy officer for a  large information technology company described her firm\u2019s formal process  for evaluating potential vendors. Using written risk-rating criteria, her  firm\u2019s legal and procurement departments evaluate potential vendors\u2019  privacy practices.

In other cases,  outsourcing firms may find it impractical or may not have sufficient  resources to monitor each of their vendors.

CMS also indicated that the HHS Office of Inspector General will be  assisting the agency in assessing the adequacy of the Medicare Advantage  contractor\u2019s systems for securing personal health information. In addition,  CMS stated that it sent privacy reminder notices to the FFS contractors  and selected other CMS contractors that handle beneficiaries\u2019 personal  health information. Although the administration of the new Medicare Part  D outpatient prescription drug benefit was outside the scope of our work,  CMS noted that its new requirements for reporting privacy breaches will  also apply to the contractors that implement this benefit.", "CMS pointed out that the Social Security Act requires that state Medicaid  agencies limit the use and release of personally identifiable information to  purposes directly related to administering the state\u2019s Medicaid program.  We included a reference to relevant provisions of the Social Security Act  in the background section of this report.", "Finally, CMS indicated that it has added language to its FFS contracts that  would require contractors and subcontractors to obtain written approval  from CMS prior to performing work at locations outside of the United  States. In further discussion, agency officials clarified that CMS will be  including this contract language in future Medicare FFS contracts. Thus,  the revised language will take effect over the next several years as the  current Medicare FFS contracts are competed and awarded to entities  called Medicare administrative contractors (MACs). CMS noted that 4 of  the 23 MAC contracts have been awarded to date; the agency plans to  complete its transition to the new MAC contracts by the end of fiscal year  2009.", "DOD concurred with our report findings and provided a technical  comment which we incorporated.", "We have reprinted the letters from CMS and DOD in appendixes II and III.", "We will send copies of this report to the Administrator of CMS, the  Secretary of Defense, appropriate congressional committees, and other  interested parties.

In this report we (1) examined the extent to which the  Medicare and TRICARE federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies  outsource\u2014domestically or offshore\u2014services involving the use of  personal health information; (2) identified measures recommended by  privacy experts for safeguarding outsourced personal information and  examined use of these measures by the federal contractors and state  Medicaid agencies; and (3) determined whether the federal contractors  and state Medicaid agencies have experienced privacy breaches and  whether the federal agencies that oversee Medicare, Medicaid, and  TRICARE require notice from them when privacy breaches occur.", "To determine the extent of service outsourcing, use of recommended  practices, and experience with privacy breaches, we surveyed the federal  contractors and state Medicaid agencies responsible for performing many  of the administrative tasks associated with the day-to-day operations of  Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. In August 2005, we sent our survey to  all 56 state Medicaid agencies, 252 Medicare Advantage contractors, 59  Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) contractors, and 11 TRICARE contractors.  The federal contractors included in our survey were all those that held  contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Defense\u2019s  TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) to participate in these programs at  the national level, as of January 2005. In some cases, a firm could have  more than one contract. For example, the 59 Medicare FFS contracts  included in our study were held by 42 firms in January 2005. In these  instances, we sent the firms a separate survey for each of their contracts  with the federal agencies. Consequently, for analysis and reporting  purposes, we considered each contract separately. Survey response rates  ranged from 69 percent (Medicare Advantage contractors) to 80 percent  (state Medicaid agencies). (See table 7.)", "Survey questions addressed whether the federal contractor or state  Medicaid agency outsourced services during 2005\u2014domestically or  offshore\u2014that involved the use of personal health information. We asked  the federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies that used outsourcing  to provide the total number of domestic and offshore outsourcing  agreements. To obtain information about downstream outsourcing, we  asked respondents whether each of their three largest vendors further  transferred personal health information, and if so, to which country.", "For most survey items, we did not independently verify information  provided by respondents. However, we performed quality checks, such as  reviewing survey data for inconsistency errors and completeness. When  necessary, we contacted survey respondents to obtain clarification before  conducting our analyses. Our analysis of respondents and nonrespondents  in each survey group, on variables such as entity size, type, and geographic  location, did not identify substantial differences, suggesting that the risk of  respondent bias is low. Among the survey items we reported on, we did  not find substantial variation in item response rate. Based on these efforts,  we determined that the survey data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To identify privacy practices recommended by industry experts to protect  personal information from inappropriate disclosure when outsourcing, we  reviewed relevant literature on privacy practices, domestic outsourcing,  and offshore outsourcing. Our review included perspectives from the  health care and financial business sectors, including syntheses of best  practices. Using a structured interview guide, we then interviewed privacy  experts to identify commonly recommended business practices for  protecting the privacy of personal information when outsourcing. We  selected individuals to interview based upon literature they published on  the topics of outsourcing and privacy protections and through referrals  from other experts. We interviewed experts representing industry,  consumer, and regulatory perspectives. We did not independently evaluate  the feasibility, potential cost, or effectiveness of implementing experts\u2019  recommended practices. Survey questions asked whether federal  contractors and state Medicaid agencies routinely use these expert- recommended practices. We did not review to what extent the practices  used by the federal contractors and Medicaid agencies comply with  existing statutory and administrative requirements.", "Through the survey, we also asked the federal contractors and state  Medicaid agencies to report on their experience with privacy breaches  during the previous 2 years. To obtain information on federal agencies\u2019  requirements for notification of privacy breaches experienced by the  federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies, we interviewed officials  at TMA and CMS\u2014the federal agency with oversight responsibility for  Medicare and Medicaid. We asked agency officials to provide us with  summary data on the number and type of privacy breaches reported by  federal contractors and state Medicaid agencies during 2004 and 2005. We  did not provide a definition of privacy breach in the survey. We also  examined the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its  implementing regulations, but did not assess compliance with them or  with other federal laws and regulations. In addition, we reviewed  information on data privacy laws in selected countries that are  destinations for offshore outsourcing. We conducted our work from  October 2004 through July 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Rosamond Katz, Assistant  Director; Manuel Buentello; Adrienne Griffin; Jenny Grover; Kevin Milne;  and Daniel Ries made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
