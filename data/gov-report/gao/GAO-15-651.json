In 2005, the United States  and Norway renewed the memorandum of understanding that governs  the prepositioning of MCPP-N equipment. MCPP-N is part of DOD\u2019s  overall prepositioning program, whereby each of the military services  prepositions stocks such as combat vehicles and repair parts worth  billions of dollars at strategic locations around the world. Both afloat and  ashore, prepositioning enables DOD to field combat-ready forces in days,  rather than the weeks it would take if stocks had to be moved from the  United States to the locations of conflicts. Since 1991, equipment stored  in Norway as part of MCPP-N has been withdrawn and relocated within  the geographic areas of either U.S. European Command or of U.S. Africa  Command to support a variety of efforts, such as training and exercises,  humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and contingency operations.  Since 2005 the Marine Corps has spent about $117.6 million to support  MCPP-N, which is its only land-based prepositioning program. Over the  same period of time, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence has contributed  approximately $94.5 million in support of the program. Since 2012 the  Marine Corps has been transforming MCPP-N from an engineering and  transportation capability to a Marine Air Ground Task Force capability,  which includes combat vehicles and other tactical equipment, to enhance  its relevance to DOD\u2019s combatant commands.

These  principal end items included tanks, amphibious armored vehicles, light  armored vehicles, trucks, and tractors. Marine Corps officials estimated  during this period that more than 3,000 principal end items were  withdrawn from MCPP-N in support of various training and exercise  events, and more than 2,000 principal end items were withdrawn in  support of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, officials  estimated more than 150 principal end items were withdrawn to support  other contingency operations within the European Command\u2019s  geographic area, ranging from supporting a Special Purpose Marine Air  Ground Task Force in Spain to providing humanitarian assistance in  Turkey and the Republic of Georgia. Marine Corps officials estimated that  about 50,000 non-principal end items such as sandbags, rations, tents,  and cots were withdrawn from MCPP-N over the same period to support  various training and exercises as well as contingency operations in  Europe, Africa, Iraq, and Afghanistan. In addition, Marine Corps officials  reported that MCPP-N equipment was used to provide humanitarian and  disaster relief assistance in response to a major earthquake in Turkey in  2011 and wildfires in Russia in 2010. Further, Marine Corps officials  stated that the same equipment used for training in cold weather  environments could also support DOD\u2019s Arctic Strategy for potential  military operations in the Arctic regions, although officials stated that the  Marine Corps has conducted no such operations to date.", "In January 2012 the Commandant of the Marine Corps issued planning  guidance that called for MCPP-N to be able to support a Marine Air  Ground Task Force. Subsequently, the Marine Corps began its effort to  change the mix of equipment found at MCPP-N storage facilities. This  change occurred as a response to DOD\u2019s efficiency initiatives, to  strengthen the effectiveness of MCPP-N, and to bolster the Marine Corps\u2019  prepositioning capabilities. In addition, as a result of the Department of  the Navy\u2019s decision to discontinue in 2012 a maritime prepositioning ship  squadron located within the Mediterranean, the U.S. European Command  has heightened its reliance on MCPP-N to support its prepositioning  requirements. The Marine Corps guidance specifically calls for MCPP-N  to be able to support a force of approximately 4,500 Marines to respond  to the first 2 weeks of combat at the mid-intensity conflict level of the  range of military operations, and to support theater security cooperation  activities. Marine Corps officials stated that the equipment set at MCPP-N  is intended to provide the capabilities to enable a Marine Corps force to  respond to any type of crisis or operation globally, and thus MCPP-N is  not assigned to any specific combatant command.", "To ensure that MCPP-N effectively meets the Marine Corps\u2019 needs and  better aligns with combatant command strategic and theater-specific  operational requirements, the Marine Corps annually updates the mix of  equipment found at MCPP-N storage facilities in Norway.

However,  officials at the Office of the Deputy Commandant for Installations and  Logistics told us that while Marine Corps components maintain source  data or calculations, the components are not required to include this  information as part of their cost estimate submissions. In addition, the  Marine Corps does not track the variances between planned and actual  costs to demonstrate the accuracy of its cost estimates and how the  program is changing over time. We, therefore, could not assess whether  the estimates were properly adjusted for inflation, nor could we check the  results for accuracy. Without access to cost estimate details, the accuracy  of the estimates cannot be determined.", "We found that the cost estimates partially met the well-documented  characteristic in that the documentation provided by the Marine Corps  does not include the source data used to develop the cost estimates for  the program objective memorandum process. The documentation does  not reflect the calculations performed or the estimating methodologies  used by the Marine Corps, and does not describe the step-by-step  process used to develop the estimate. Without well-documented cost  estimates that include calculations and estimating methodologies, the  Installations and Logistics office cannot provide complete answers to  questions about the development of cost estimates or explain the reasons  behind changes to the estimates over time.", "We found that estimates did not meet the characteristic for credibility.

However, this method used by the Installations and Logistics office to  determine the accuracy of the components\u2019 and subordinate commands\u2019  assumptions cannot easily be replicated by an independent party. Such  cross-checks of major cost elements can reveal whether applying a  different cost-estimating method produces similar results. Without  credible cost estimates, the Installations and Logistics office may not be  able to determine the level of risk, uncertainty, or confidence associated  with achieving proposed budget estimates.

Officials stated, however, that identifying  all costs associated with the transformation would prove difficult because  they do not track all funding sources that support MCPP-N, such as  transportation costs, which are tracked through a separate budget  account. However, we found that they did identify some costs needed to  support the transformation. For instance, officials identify costs of about  $750,000 for fiscal year 2016 to employ three U.S. contractors in Norway  to manage cryptographic equipment as part of a caretaker detachment.  They also stated that between fiscal years 2012 and 2013 about $2  million was apportioned from another prepositioning program source to  procure support items such as ancillary gear, lubricants, and batteries to  operate and sustain new equipment supporting the Marine Air Ground  Task Force.", "We also found that there was no standardized structure for collecting  costs at a level of detail necessary to demonstrate that estimates are  acceptable and reflect justification of resources. While Marine Forces  generally are required to submit budget requests in a specific template to  the Marine Corps\u2019 Logistics Plans and Operations Branch, Blount Island  Command is not required to use any template. Further, the cost- estimating documentation provided within the program objective  memorandum submission did not include specific details on all factors  and assumptions influencing costs, such as inflation indexes and potential  costs arising from the purchase of parts to support new equipment sets  such as tanks, amphibious assault vehicles, light armored vehicles, and  communication capabilities.

Once the Norwegian staff have assigned an equipment storage  location\u2014the designated cave and the equipment\u2019s location within that  cave\u2014they transfer the key data elements that can be added to the  Marine Corps system to an interim database known as the \u201cChange Log.\u201d  Norwegian officials explained that one of their former staff created the  Change Log feature in the Norwegian system in January 2014 to provide  a mechanism whereby Norwegian staff could resolve discrepancies in the  inventory data between the Marine Corps and Norwegian systems, in  consultation with the Marine Corps contractors. The contractors receiving  data from the Change Log are responsible for reviewing and validating  the submitted equipment\u2019s cave location and other inventory data before  updating the record in the Global Combat Support System - Marine  Corps.", "According to Norwegian officials, the Change Log has been instrumental  in reducing the backlog of data discrepancies from more than 3,000 in  January 2014 to fewer than 800 in November 2014. They explained that  these discrepancies between the Marine Corps and Norwegian systems  developed largely due to the changing mix of equipment prepositioned at  MCPP-N to support a Marine Air Ground Task Force capability.  Norwegian officials also reported mismatches in equipment serial  numbers in both systems. They stated that as a result of such problems,  a physical check of the serial number is often required to reconcile the  data discrepancies between the two systems. Norwegian officials  indicated that having its maintenance personnel provide additional  information (documentation and photographs) to reconcile inventory data  between the two systems negatively affects Norwegian maintenance  operations because they have limited time maintenance resources.", "The Change Log serves as an application control for information entering  the Global Combat Support System - Marine Corps. Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government state that an application  control should be installed at an application\u2019s interface with other systems  to ensure that all inputs are received and that valid outputs are correct  and properly distributed. The Change Log constitutes a computerized  \u201cedit\u201d built into the interface that helps the Marine Corps to review the  format, existence, and reasonableness of the data from the Norwegian  system before it enters the Marine Corps system.", "While the Change Log demonstrates an application control to mitigate  data discrepancies between the two information management systems, it  does not represent a long-term solution. Marine Corps and Norwegian  officials anticipate that data discrepancies will continue to occur whenever  there is a change in the cave location of equipment\u2014such as when it  returns to a cave after maintenance, a training exercise, humanitarian  relief effort, or contingency operation\u2014and also when it enters a cave for  the first time, due to decisions to upgrade or change the mix of  preposition equipment. Until the Global Combat Support System \u2013 Marine  Corps is modified to include a warehousing application and can replace  the Norwegian system, Marine Corps and Norwegian officials will  continue to rely on two information management systems that generate  ongoing data discrepancies and related data reliability challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marine Corps\u2019 Annual Quality Assurance Inspection Process Does Not Include a Review of the Norwegian Equipment Information Management System", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps\u2019 Blount Island Command conducts an annual quality  assurance inspection to monitor, measure, and analyze data to ensure  the effectiveness of MCPP-N. This inspection includes an assessment of  the condition of the equipment and of the maintenance processes, along  with a review of the inventory. However, the quality assurance inspection  does not include a review of the Norwegian Equipment Information  Management System, which serves as one of the key reporting systems  for managing inventory data. Performing such a review would be  consistent with Marine Corps regulations and federal internal control  standards and would constitute a key step toward mitigating potential  weaknesses in the Norwegian Equipment Information Management  System.", "The data standards for information systems supporting Marine Corps  prepositioning are provided in Marine Corps Order 3000.17 and state that  data must be accurate and timely, must provide visibility of prepositioning  materiel to planners at all levels, must be maintained to standards at the  source of generation, and must be standardized for both afloat and  ashore prepositioning programs. The Marine Corps Order also  references the Marine Corps Technical Manual for MCPP-N, which states  that Blount Island Command is responsible for developing and  administering the Quality Assurance Program, and that the Quality  Assurance Program shall include a review of shelf life items, scheduled  maintenance and inventory cycles, and the adequacy of reporting  systems.  In addition, the Blount Island Command Quality System  Manual states that Blount Island Command retains the overall  responsibility for exercising sufficient control for processes performed by  external organizations that provide logistics support for MCPP-N.", "Federal internal control standards also indicate the need for a quality  assurance review of the Norwegian system. According to those  standards, information systems have two main types of control  activities\u2014general and application controls. General controls are the  policies and procedures that apply to all or a large segment of an entity\u2019s  information systems and facilitate their proper operation, to include  system development and maintenance, security, management, logical  and physical access, access security, and contingency planning.  Application controls are incorporated directly into computer applications to  achieve validity, completeness, accuracy, and confidentiality of  transactions and data during application processing. According to the  standards for internal controls, general and application controls over  computer systems are interrelated. General controls support the  functioning of application controls, and both are needed to ensure  complete and accurate information processing. If general controls are  inadequate, application controls are unlikely to function properly and  could be overridden.", "A quality assurance review can entail reviewing selected general and  application controls within the information system through activities such  as:  reviewing operating and database management systems; assessing security controls that protect the system and network from  inappropriate access or unauthorized use; and performing tests on the system to ensure that it has the proper edit  checks to review the format, existence, and reasonableness of data.", "Further, the Local Bilateral Agreement for MCPP-N, which serves as an  internal working document between Blount Island Command and the  Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization and outlines roles and  responsibilities for each organization, identifies Blount Island Command  as being responsible for completing annual quality assurance inspections  on the maintenance and storage of equipment managed by the  Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization. Blount Island Command  officials stated that their annual quality assurance review does not focus  on information systems, and they further noted that the Norwegians\u2019  system is foreign-owned and therefore not within their jurisdiction. The  Local Bilateral Agreement does not specifically require the Marine Corps  to conduct a review of the Norwegian System. However, as a working  document the agreement is regularly updated and can be amended to  incorporate additional provisions such as allowing the Marine Corps to  conduct a quality review of the Norwegian system.", "The Norwegian Equipment Information Management System provides the  Marine Corps with capabilities not currently available in its own system,  such as the ability to track equipment calibration and a warehousing  function, but Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization officials stated  that they recognized their system has certain vulnerabilities. For example,  during our review of their information system we observed several  weaknesses, including minimal documentation on the system, the lack of  formal training and procedures for staff performing data entry, and the  reliance on a single person, a retired Norwegian staff member, for the  system\u2019s technical programming and maintenance needs. To address  known data entry problems, Norwegian officials are considering a  proposal that would limit the number of data entry points into the  Norwegian system from three locations to one centrally managed  location. However, Norwegian officials stated that they had not conducted  an overall quality assurance review of the information system, thus raising  further questions as to its potential vulnerabilities.", "Although the current Local Bilateral Agreement does not contain guidance  and instructions for conducting an assessment of the Norwegian  Equipment Information Management System, the Marine Corps is  responsible for ensuring that the Norwegian system is providing accurate  data on the inventory for stored assets being managed at MCPP-N.  Further, Marine Corps officials stated that they rely on the Norwegian  system to carry out data management functions discussed above.  Without performing a quality assurance review of the Norwegian system,  MCPP-N is at risk for incurring potential vulnerabilities in its inventory  data. If the Marine Corps does not provide a quality assurance review of  the Norwegian system, it may not be able to determine whether inventory  data are complete, accurate, reliable, and reasonably free from error, so  as to ensure that equipment is readily available to support the combatant  commanders\u2019 requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps is transforming MCPP-N\u2019s posture from an engineering  and transportation capability to a balanced Marine Air Ground Task Force  capability that supports both the U.S. European and U.S. Africa  commands\u2019 operational requirements to obtain prepositioned equipment  sets capable of supporting crisis response operations and theater security  cooperation activities.

We also reviewed GAO\u2019s prior work addressing DOD\u2019s management and  reporting of prepositioning. We collected and reviewed a theater posture  plan and contingency plans obtained from the U.S. European Command  and U.S. Africa Command on their strategic and operational  requirements, including the need for a Marine Air Ground Task Force  capability. We also collected documentation from the Marine Corps  containing the type and mix of equipment required to support a Marine Air  Ground Task Force. Further, we reviewed the combatant command plans  to determine the extent to which they rely on prepositioned equipment to  meet theater-specific requirements. We also collected and reviewed unit  after action reports and briefings that provided an evaluation of the  equipment obtained from MCPP-N for training and annual exercises, and  to understand how the equipment met their needs. We collected  documents from the Norwegian Armed Forces on Norway\u2019s role and  relationship with MCPP-N and visited several cave sites in Norway to  observe U.S.-owned equipment stored in support of the Marine Air  Ground Task Force. We focused our review on ground equipment stored  at MCPP-N because the program is transforming the equipment set from  an engineering and transportation to a Marine Air Ground Task Force  capability.

We obtained a copy of the Marine Corps\u2019  program objective memorandum program review briefings from fiscal  years 2015 through 2019 and conducted an analysis to determine how  each cost element associated with budget estimate data was calculated  by examining the basis of the budget estimates and assessing the  strength and quality of the supporting budget documentation provided.", "We verified that the parameters used to create the budget estimates were  valid and applicable by posing formal questions and conducting  interviews with officials in the Deputy Commandant for Installation and  Logistics, Logistics Plans and Operations Branch, to understand their  methodology for developing budget estimates, and determining whether  other sources were available for cross-checking those estimates. We  verified that calculations were correct for each cost element, and verified  that elements were accurately summed up to arrive at the overall budget  estimate. We assessed whether the budget estimates were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes and met GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide for best practices, and the four general  characteristics of a reliable cost estimate\u2014accurate, credible, well- documented, and comprehensive. Each characteristic consists of several  individual assessments. We assessed each characteristic by assigning  each individual assessment a numerical rating: Not Met = 1, Minimally  Met = 2, Partially Met =3, Substantially Met = 4, and Met = 5. We took the  average of the individual assessment ratings to determine the overall  rating for each of the four characteristics. The resulting average became  the overall characteristic assessment as follows: Not Met = 1.0 to 1.4,  Minimally Met = 1.5 to 2.4, Partially Met = 2.5 to 3.4, Substantially Met =  3.5 to 4.4, and Met = 4.5 to 5.0. A cost estimate is considered reliable if  the overall assessment ratings for each of the four characteristics are  substantially or fully met. If any of the characteristics are not met, are  minimally met, or are partially met, the cost estimate does not fully reflect  the characteristics of a reliable estimate. We recorded the results of our  analysis and found that the budget estimates partially met the accurate,  well-documented, and comprehensive characteristics, and that they did  not meet the credible characteristic of a reliable estimate. Because the  budget estimates did not meet all of the characteristics of a reliable cost  estimate, we considered them not to be fully reliable.", "To determine the extent to which the Marine Corps has quality assurance  procedures in place to monitor the management of MCPP-N, we reviewed  the May 2009 United States Marine Corps Technical Manual on Logistics  Support for MCPP-N, the 2013 Local Bilateral Agreement between  Blount Island Command and Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization,  and the 2012 Blount Island Command ISO 9001:2008 Quality System  Manual.
