As we have previously reported, funded benefits protect the future viability of an enterprise such as USPS by not saddling it with bills later after employees have retired. Further, since USPS retirees participate in the same health and pension benefit programs as other federal retirees, if USPS ultimately does not adequately fund these benefits, and if Congress wants these benefits to be maintained at current levels, funding from the U.S. Treasury, and hence the taxpayer, would be needed to continue the benefit levels. Alternatively, unfunded benefits could lead to pressure for reductions in benefits or in pay.", "Congress faces difficult choices and tradeoffs to address USPS's financial challenges.

USPS is a critical part  of the nation\u2019s communication and commerce, delivering 154 billion  pieces of mail in fiscal year 2015 to about 155 million delivery points, and  with more than 620,000 employees. USPS, however, faces a serious  financial situation and does not have sufficient revenues to cover its  expenses, putting its mission of providing prompt, reliable, and efficient  universal services to the public at risk. USPS continues to incur deficits  that are unsustainable. Moreover, at the end of fiscal year 2015, USPS  had about $125 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt, most of which were  for retiree health and pension benefits. USPS continued to have $15  billion in outstanding debt\u2014the statutory limit. These unfunded liabilities  and debt are a large and growing financial burden, increasing from 99  percent of USPS revenues in fiscal year 2007 to 182 percent of revenues  in fiscal year 2015. Unfunded benefit liabilities are the estimated amount  USPS has not sufficiently set aside to cover the benefits earned by its  current and retired employees that are attributable to service already  rendered. USPS also recorded a net loss of $5.1 billion in fiscal year  2015\u2014its ninth consecutive year of net losses. In July 2009, we added  USPS\u2019s financial condition to our list of high-risk areas needing attention  by Congress and the executive branch; USPS\u2019s financial condition  continues to deteriorate and remains on our high-risk list. As our high- risk report stated, we have previously included strategies and options for  USPS to generate revenue, reduce costs, increase the efficiency of its  delivery operations, and restructure the funding of USPS pension and  retiree health benefits.

This testimony is based primarily  on reports and testimonies we issued in the past 5 years and that  examined USPS\u2019s financial condition, including its liabilities. The reports  and testimonies cited in this statement contain detailed information on the  methods used to conduct our work. For this testimony, we updated USPS  financial information with results from fiscal year 2015, which ended  September 30, 2015. We also used estimates, prepared by USPS and  the Congressional Budget Office, of retiree health and pension payments  that USPS would be legally required to make in fiscal year 2017.

As a  result, USPS has lost a total of $56.8 billion since fiscal year 2007.", "The continued deterioration in USPS\u2019s financial condition is due primarily  to two factors.  1.  Declining mail volumes: USPS continues to face decreases in mail  volume, its primary revenue source, as online communication and  e-commerce expand. While remaining USPS\u2019s most profitable  product, First-Class Mail volume in particular has significantly  declined in recent years. For example, while total mail volume  declined 27 percent from its peak in fiscal year 2006 (including a 1  percent decline in fiscal year 2015), First-Class Mail volume has  declined to a greater extent\u201440 percent since its peak in fiscal  year 2001 (with a 2 percent decline in fiscal year 2015).", "USPS reported that the most significant factor contributing to the  decline in First-Class Mail volume is the continued migration  toward electronic communication and transaction alternatives\u2014a  migration USPS expects to continue for the foreseeable future.  USPS added that the decline in First-Class Mail was exacerbated  by the Great Recession that the National Bureau of Economic  Research reported as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009.  In the long run, USPS faces the risk of increasing diversion of mail  to electronic alternatives and the possibility of future economic  downturns that could negatively affect mail volumes. USPS has  reported that although increased shipping and package volume  has offset some of the declines in mail volume, this volume has a  smaller profit margin than First-Class Mail. USPS will need to be  efficient in its processing and delivery of packages to capitalize on  growth in that market.  2.  Growing Expenses: While mail volume has declined, USPS\u2019s  operating expenses have been rising. USPS reported that its key  operating expenses grew in fiscal year 2015\u2014notably salary  increases for unionized employees, as well as additional work  hours, in part due to a 14.1 percent growth in shipping and  packages, which are more labor intensive to process. Despite  efficiency initiatives such as consolidation of 36 mail-processing  facilities in 2015, total employee work hours increased, and the  size of USPS\u2019s career workforce increased slightly in fiscal year  2015\u2014the first increase in the size of the career workforce since  fiscal year 1999. Compensation and benefits comprise close to 80  percent of total USPS expenses. Thus, expenses will further grow  if increases in salaries and work hours continue. According to  USPS, increases in compensation and benefits costs (primarily  from increased wages) will add $1.1 billion in additional costs in  fiscal year 2016.", "As previously discussed, USPS\u2019s unfunded liabilities and debt have  become a large and growing financial burden, increasing from 99 percent  of USPS revenues at the end of fiscal year 2007 to 182 percent of  revenues at the end of fiscal year 2015 (see table 2 in app. I for more  detail). At the end of fiscal year 2015, USPS\u2019s $125 billion in unfunded  liabilities and outstanding debt represented a $7.4 billion increase from  the previous year.", "In addition, reduced mail volumes and growing expenses have  contributed to USPS\u2019s inability to fully meet its requirement to prefund  retiree health benefits. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act  (PAEA) established the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund and  required USPS to begin prefunding health benefits for its current and  future postal retirees, with annual payments of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion  from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, followed by actuarially determined  prefunding payments beginning in 2017 and every year thereafter. As of  the end of fiscal year 2015, USPS\u2019s liability for retiree health benefits was  about $105.2 billion and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund  balance was $50.3 billion, with a resulting unfunded liability of $54.8  billion. USPS has not made a prefunding payment since fiscal year 2011,  with a total of $28.1 billion in missed payments. These missed payments  represent about half of USPS\u2019s total losses since fiscal year 2007. Even  without the annual prefunding requirement, however, USPS would have  still lost $10.8 billion during this time period. USPS has stated that it  expects to miss its required prefunding payment of $5.8 billion due at the  end of fiscal year 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS Will Remain Unlikely to Fully Make Required Retiree Health and Pension Payments", "paragraphs": ["USPS will remain unlikely to fully make its required retiree health and  pension payments in the near future. Beginning in fiscal year 2017,  USPS\u2019s payments will be restructured as it will no longer be required to  make fixed prefunding payments, but will be required to start making  annual payments based on actuarial determinations of the following  component costs: a 40-year amortization schedule to address the unfunded liabilities for  postal retiree health benefits,  the \u201cnormal costs\u201d of retiree health benefits for current employees,  and a 27-year amortization schedule to address the unfunded liabilities for  postal pension benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System  (CSRS).", "These payments are in addition to annual payments USPS is already  required to make to finance its pension benefits under the Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS), which consists of a 30-year  amortization schedule to address any unfunded liabilities, and the normal  costs of FERS benefits for current employees. USPS will find it very  difficult to make all of these required payments given its financial  condition and outlook. As table 1 below shows, in fiscal year 2017, USPS  will be required to make an estimated total of $11.3 billion in payments for  retiree health and pension benefits under CSRS and FERS\u2014about $4.6  billion more than what USPS paid in fiscal year 2015 for these benefit  programs.", "In addition to declining mail volumes and increased expenses, USPS\u2019s  ability to make its required payments for these retirement programs will  be further challenged due to:", "Expiration of a temporary rate surcharge: USPS reported that it  generated $2.1 billion in additional revenue during fiscal year 2015  and $1.4 billion in additional revenue in fiscal year 2014 as a result of  a 4.3 percent \u201cexigent\u201d surcharge that began in January 2014.  However, USPS expects this surcharge to be discontinued around  April 2016, when the surcharge is expected to have contributed $4.6  billion in total additional revenue. USPS expects its additional revenue  from the exigent surcharge to be about $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2016,  with no additional revenue in fiscal year 2017, as the surcharge will  have expired. USPS recently reported that the expiration of the  exigent surcharge will have an adverse impact on its future operating  revenue and liquidity, and that its actions to increase efficiency,  reduce costs, and generate additional revenue may be insufficient to  meet all of its financial obligations or to carry out its strategy.", "No new major cost-savings initiatives planned. USPS has no current  plans to initiate new major initiatives to achieve cost savings in its  operations.", "USPS officials recently told us that it is not yet known whether USPS will  have sufficient financial resources to make all or a portion of its legally- required payments for retiree health and pension benefits at the time that  they become due. USPS further reported that without structural change to  its business model, absent legislative change, it expects continuing  losses and liquidity challenges for the foreseeable future.", "Large unfunded liabilities for postal retiree health and pension benefits\u2014 which were $78.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015\u2014may ultimately  place taxpayers, USPS employees, retirees and their beneficiaries, and  USPS itself at risk. As we have previously reported, funded benefits  protect the future viability of an enterprise such as USPS by not saddling  it with bills later after employees have retired.

Alternatively, unfunded benefits  could lead to pressure for reductions in benefits or in pay. Thus, the  timely funding of benefits protects USPS employees, retirees,  beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the USPS enterprise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Faces Difficult Choices to Address USPS\u2019s Financial Condition", "paragraphs": ["USPS\u2019s financial situation leaves Congress with difficult choices and  trade-offs to achieve the broad-based restructuring that will be necessary  for USPS to become financially sustainable. USPS\u2019s ability to make its  required retiree health and pension payments requires a decrease in  expenses or increase in revenues, or both. As we have previously  reported, USPS\u2019s actions alone under its existing authority will be  insufficient to achieve sustainable financial viability; comprehensive  legislation will be needed. Congressional decisions about how to  address the following issues will shape USPS\u2019s future role, services,  operations, networks, and ability to adapt to changes in mail volume. In  making these decisions, Congress could consider, among other things,  the following factors.", "The level of postal services and the affordability of those services:  USPS\u2019s growing financial difficulties combined with vast changes in  how people communicate provide Congress with an opportunity to  consider what postal services will be needed in the 21st century.  Specifically, Congress could consider what postal services should be  provided on a universal basis to meet customer needs and how these  services should be provided. Congress also could consider trade-offs  in reducing the level of postal services, such as providing USPS with  the authority to reduce the frequency of letter mail delivery, to enable  USPS to reduce its expenses. A key factor in any consideration to  reduce postal services would include potential effects on postal  customers, mail volumes, and employees. In particular, Congress  could consider the quality of postal service\u2014such as the frequency  and speed of mail delivery and the accessibility and scope of retail  postal services\u2014in considering any service reduction. In January  2015, for example, USPS revised its standards for on-time mail  delivery by increasing the number of days for some mail to be  delivered and still be considered on time. However, under the revised  delivery standards, the percentage of mail delivered on time declined  for many types of mail, such as First-Class Mail and Periodicals.  USPS attributed declines in delivery performance to operational  changes it implemented in January 2015 coupled with adverse winter  weather.", "Compensation and benefits in an environment of revenue pressures:  Key compensation and benefits costs have increased and continue to  increase for USPS employees, while demand for USPS\u2019s main  revenue source, mail and First-Class Mail in particular, has declined  and continues to decline. Further, the exigent rate increase mentioned  above is expected to expire in April 2016. To put USPS\u2019s situation into  context, many private sector companies (such as automobile  companies, airlines, mail preparation and printing companies, and  major newspapers) took far-reaching measures to cut costs (such as  reducing or stabilizing workforce, salaries, and benefits) when the  demand of their central product and services declined. However,  although USPS also has taken a range of cost-cutting measures,  USPS has stated that its strategies to increase efficiency and reduce  costs by adjusting its network, infrastructure, and workforce and to  retain and grow revenue are currently constrained by statutory,  contractual, regulatory, and political restrictions. For example, USPS  does not administer its employees\u2019 pension, health, and workers\u2019  compensation benefits programs, and postal rates are regulated by  the Postal Regulatory Commission, with rate increases for most mail  limited by an inflation-based price cap. Most USPS employees are  covered by collective bargaining agreements with four major labor  unions which have established salary increases, cost-of-living  adjustments, and the share of health insurance premiums paid by  employees and USPS. When USPS and its unions are unable to  agree, the parties are required to enter into binding arbitration by a  third-party panel. There is no statutory requirement for USPS\u2019s  financial condition to be considered in arbitration. Considering USPS\u2019s  poor and deteriorating financial condition and the competitive  environment, we continue to believe\u2014as we reported in 2010\u2014that  Congress should consider revising the statutory framework for  collective bargaining to ensure that USPS\u2019s financial condition be  considered in binding arbitration.", "USPS\u2019s dual role of providing affordable universal service while  remaining self-financing: As an independent establishment of the  executive branch, USPS has long been expected to provide  affordable, quality, universal delivery service to all parts of the country  while remaining self-financing. USPS and other stakeholders have  considered a range of different business models to address USPS\u2019s  financial difficulties. For example, USPS\u2019s 2002 Transformation Plan  included a range of alternatives from a publicly-supported model to a  business model with a corporate structure supported by shareholders.  An alternative business model, if any, would need to address the level  of any costs that would be transferred from USPS, which is financed  by postal ratepayers, to the federal government, which is funded by  taxpayers. In addition, if Congress requires eligible postal retirees to  participate in Medicare, as USPS has previously proposed, it should  consider the tradeoffs for the federal budget deficit and Medicare\u2019s  financial condition, as well as the implications for affected  employees.", "Finally, a fully functioning USPS Board of Governors is needed to support  USPS\u2019s ability to carry out its critical responsibilities. USPS\u2019s 11-seat  Board of Governors is required by law to have a quorum of six members  in order to take certain actions. Because two Governors left the Board in  December 2015 due to term limits, the Board currently consists of only  one Governor (who will not be able to serve past December 2016), the  Postmaster General, and the Deputy Postmaster General. Certain powers  are reserved to the Governors. USPS has reported that although the  inability of the Board to constitute a quorum does not inhibit or affect the  authority of the Governors in office from exercising those powers, it is not  apparent how those powers could be exercised if there were no  Governors. According to USPS, the critical responsibilities reserved to the  Governors are setting postal prices, approving new products, and  appointing or removing the Postmaster General and the Deputy  Postmaster General. USPS has stated that in the event no Governors are  in place, these critical duties may not be able to be executed, potentially  leaving USPS without the ability to adjust its prices as needed, introduce  new products, or appoint or replace its two most senior executive officers.", "In conclusion, USPS management, unions, the public, community  leaders, and Members of Congress need to take a hard look at what level  of postal services residents and businesses need and can afford.
