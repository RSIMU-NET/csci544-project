Police departments in the United States commonly use  CCTV to, among other things, deter, detect, and investigate crime and  control crowds. Since September 11, 2001, law enforcement has also  begun to use CCTV to combat terrorism. In particular, both the  Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) and  the National Park Service\u2019s United States Park Police within the  Department of the Interior have used CCTV systems to monitor certain  public spaces under their jurisdictions in Washington, D.C.

Specifically, civil liberties  advocates have raised issues concerning CCTV\u2019s potential impact on  individual privacy as well as the potential for inappropriate use of CCTV  systems and the mishandling of CCTV images. In addition, these advocates  expressed concern about using the technology when its effectiveness for  law enforcement use has not been proven. Civil liberties advocates  propose that controls are needed to help ensure the protection of  individual privacy and the proper use of CCTV systems. The American Bar  Association (ABA) and other organizations have developed guidelines for  CCTV users that address some of the issues raised by civil liberties  advocates through the use of management controls. These include  developing written operating protocols, establishing supervision and  training requirements, providing for public notification, and requiring  periodic audits.", "This report responds to a request from former Representative   Constance A.

CCTV systems typically involve a dedicated  communications link between cameras and monitors. Digital camera and  storage technologies are rapidly replacing traditional analog systems. A  CCTV system involves a linked system of cameras able to be viewed and  operated from a control room.", "CCTV systems have evolved considerably over time and tend to fall into  three different generations. The first generation consisted of wide-angle,  fixed cameras (referred to as shoe boxes) that were targeted to crime  hotspots. The second generation consisted of cameras that could be  moved using a joystick in the control center focused on specific events or  people, zooming in for closer scrutiny. The third generation uses both  types of cameras with the additional capabilities to include software such  as facial recognition or license plate recognition. Relatively new features  in CCTV technology that enhance its power and scope include night vision  cameras, computer-assisted operations, and motion detectors. A camera  that is integrated with a motion detection system would, for example,  enable alerted law enforcement staff in a control room to remotely  investigate potential security incidents such as a terrorist placing a  package in an isolated location. Most CCTV systems are actively  monitored by security or law enforcement personnel in a centralized  setting, or they can be passively taped for future viewing if needed (such  as in the event of a robbery).", "The private sector began using CCTV in the early 1960s, first in banks, and  later in commercial buildings. By the 1970s, CCTV was deployed in  hospitals, all-night convenience stores, and many other commercial areas.", "The private sector also began to use CCTV in retail stores to monitor for  shoplifters and in hotels to help secure the safety of their guests. CCTV  technology advanced during the 1980s with the introduction of video  recorders, and even more in the 1990s with the introduction of digital  technology. CCTV is also used in public safety-related applications across  the United States, including traffic control, special events, public  transportation, and public schools.", "CCTV use by law enforcement to fight crime and terrorism is an evolving  application of the technology. According to a number of reports, CCTV can  benefit law enforcement in many ways. A survey of law enforcement  agencies conducted by the IACP found that CCTV was useful in areas such  as investigative assistance and evidence gathering. The survey identified  other law enforcement benefits from CCTV use such as reducing time in  court for officers, protecting police officers against claims of police  misconduct, and using recorded images to train officers. A report by  RAND noted that proponents of video and similar types of surveillance  claim that it prevents crime by deterrence, especially when overt  surveillance activities remind potential criminals of police presence and  observation. The same report also states that, if an area under surveillance  becomes a crime scene, the surveillance can both alert police to the need  for an operational response and/or provide evidence for subsequent  criminal investigation and prosecution. A study commissioned by the SIA  also stated that CCTV has the ability to enhance law enforcement  capabilities by enabling officers to be deployed in areas that require more  traditional police work (such as foot patrols where officers can interact  with individuals), enabling the CCTV cameras to be used for general  surveillance.", "In the context of law enforcement surveillance activities, a common  conception of privacy stems from criminal cases interpreting the Fourth  Amendment of the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment protects people  from unreasonable searches and seizures. According to the Supreme  Court, if the person under surveillance has a reasonable expectation of  privacy, the Fourth Amendment applies, and a warrant is generally  required to conduct a lawful search. Conversely, if the person under  surveillance does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Fourth  Amendment does not apply, and no warrant is required for police  surveillance. Applying these principles, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals  upheld the use of surveillance cameras placed on a public street without a  warrant on grounds that \u201cactivity a person knowingly exposes to the  public is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection, and thus, is not  constitutionally protected from observation.\u201d", "While there is generally no reasonable expectation of privacy under the  Fourth Amendment for activities visible to the public, the ACLU and EPIC  have argued that the use of surveillance systems to monitor public spaces  may nevertheless infringe upon freedom of expression under the First  Amendment. There does not appear to be any federal case law interpreting  whether police use of video surveillance devices may infringe upon First  Amendment rights. However, ACLU and EPIC believe that CCTV might  \u201cchill\u201d protesters from demonstrating in public spaces such as on the  National Mall and elsewhere in D.C. knowing that their images might be  captured on police recordings. There is also concern that CCTV cameras  equipped with enhanced features, such as zoom capabilities, may give  police the ability to read and record the print on political fliers being  distributed in public places and to identify individuals engaged in political  speech, which, in their view, undercuts the ability of citizens to engage in  anonymous free speech.", "ACLU and EPIC officials said that they would like to see controls in place  to help guard against improper use of CCTV systems and the mishandling  of CCTV images. In addition, ACLU officials said that controls directing  the use of CCTV should contain specific provisions for protecting CCTV  images that include whether CCTV images are being recorded, under what  conditions, and how long the recordings are retained, as well as criteria  for access to CCTV images by the government or the public. An EPIC  official also said that controls should address access, storage, and  disclosure of records.", "In the UK, CCTV and video surveillance have been used extensively. As of  2002, about 75 cities were using CCTV to monitor urban centers, and  approximately 95 percent of all local governments were considering its  use as a law enforcement tool. In 1990, according to the UK Home Office,  the UK had approximately three CCTV systems operated by local  governments comprised of about 100 cameras. By the end of 2002, Home  Office officials estimated that the UK had approximately 500 CCTV  systems operated by local governments comprised of about 40,000  cameras. Nonlaw enforcement staff generally operate the CCTV systems in  the locations we visited in the UK. In most cases, the systems were set up  to address street-type crimes such as robbery, car theft, harassment, and  public drunkenness. The UK CCTV systems that we observed had control  rooms that were operational 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and all  maintained digitally recorded images. The UK Home Office provided  funding for 684 CCTV systems as of October 2002, though not all were  operational at the time. Home Office officials said that the level of funding  per location has ranged from about $50,000 to $12 million to implement  CCTV in town centers, parking garages, and residential areas.", "During the 107th Congress, a Senate bill was introduced that would have  established a commission to evaluate the use of investigative and  surveillance technologies, including surveillance cameras, to meet law  enforcement and national security needs in the manner that best preserves  individual privacy.

An official said that since the late 1960s  and early 1970s, the borough had experienced an increase in street-type  crime, which stemmed from structural unemployment and the existence of  a known but relatively small criminal element. Most crime involved  robbery, car theft, harassment, public drunkenness, drug trafficking, and  hooliganism. Officials said that the public felt unsafe doing everyday  things like walking down certain streets or shopping in certain areas.  Therefore, officials said that it was easy to sell CCTV to the borough  council, because the borough had one of the highest burglary and auto  theft rates in the UK, and the public perceived CCTV to be an effective  response to the crime.

For example, if an assault is  observed they notify the police, if trash is left on the street they notify the  trash collectors, or if a car were behaving erratically they would call the  traffic department. Officials told us that this type of approach is the  success of CCTV because it helps to focus on what the problem is and  what the solution is. They also said that usually it is not just CCTV that is  the solution, but the intelligence from CCTV that can be used to solve the  problem.", "The city of Sheffield has been utilizing CCTV, operated by the city council,  since about 1997.

Although this city\u2019s CCTV system is similar in application to  the others we visited, the distinction is that this city has a more \u201cjoined up\u201d  concept, whereby all area stakeholders that have CCTV systems (city,  train, mall) can forward camera images to other stakeholders\u2019 systems to  provide a more integrated view of the area. Officials explained that, if  needed (bomb scare or terrorist act), the central control center can take  control of any camera in the integrated system, or the command/control  function can be shifted to one of the other two centers. The police can also  be fed the images real-time from the central control center instead of  viewing images later to assemble evidence. Operators can more easily  follow criminals or criminal activity from one camera/system to the next.  This is important, as these officials noted that the area has two of the UK\u2019s  top 20 terrorist targets (a six-lane bridge that is a vital economic link to the  north, and one of the UK\u2019s largest shopping malls). If called on a crime,  however, this city\u2019s cameras can be focused to those areas. At the time of  our review, officials said that the actual linkage between the three control  centers (city, train, mall) was to occur in the near future.", "Officials in Sheffield consider the linkage to other CCTV control centers as  essential to the future success of CCTV.
