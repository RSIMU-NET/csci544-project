To obtain expert advice on these issues, FCC often calls upon its federal advisory committees, comprised mostly of members from industry, private consulting, advocacy groups, and government. These committees must follow the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which sets requirements on the formation and operation of such committees. Because of Congressional interest in how FCC receives advice from outside experts, this report provides information on (1) FCC's current advisory committees, (2) the extent to which the committees follow applicable laws, (3) how FCC makes use of the committees' advice, and (4) the non-FACA advisory groups that FCC has established."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seven federal advisory committees established at its discretion that address various telecommunications issues. FCC officials, committee members, and other stakeholders we contacted generally believed FCC's advisory committees operated effectively. In forming and operating advisory committees, FCC must follow FACA and related regulations, which require, among other things, that committee membership is balanced in terms of points of view represented and that committee activities are transparent to the public. While FCC follows applicable requirements, GAO found that committee members are not always clear about their expected role on the committees--that is, the type of advice that FCC expects them to provide. FCC designates all of its committee members as \"representatives,\" meaning they are appointed with an expectation that they will provide advice reflecting the views of a company, organization, or other group. However, approximately 22 percent of responding committee members did not say they provided representative advice. Further, some committee members are affiliated with universities or consulting firms that may not have an obvious telecommunications viewpoint. If committee members are expected to primarily provide their own expert opinion, they are expected to be impartial and may be more appropriately appointed as special government employees. Such members are subject to ethics rules administered by the Office of Government Ethics, including conflict-of-interest reviews. While FCC is not required to implement the advice or recommendations of its advisory committees, FCC has taken actions based on these committees' recommendations. Overall, GAO found FCC officials tended to be more satisfied with how FCC implements the committees' recommendations than other stakeholders, including committee members themselves. For example, of the committee members who responded to a GAO survey, only 54 percent were satisfied with the extent to which FCC takes the committees' advice into account when developing policy. Further, three trade groups we contacted said that the advisory committees' advice and recommendations have little influence on FCC actions. In addition to its seven federal advisory committees, FCC considers five advisory groups as exempt from FACA requirements, including two \"joint boards,\" two \"joint conferences,\" and the Intergovernmental Advisory Committee. FCC was mandated to establish the joint boards and created the joint conferences at its discretion. Since the joint boards and joint conferences are considered exempt from FACA, they function differently from FCC's federal advisory committees. FCC created the Intergovernmental Advisory Committee, which it also considers exempt from FACA, to address telecommunications issues affecting state, local, and tribal governments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has regulatory and  oversight authority over an array of issues and industries including  telephone, broadcasting, wireless devices, and international  telecommunication and satellite services.

To augment that process, the  Commission often calls upon experts and stakeholders for advice through  federal advisory committees. For example, FCC\u2019s federal advisory  committees have provided advice and recommendations on emerging  technologies, consumer interests, and other industry challenges.", "The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) sets requirements regarding  how agencies establish federal advisory committees and how the activities  of the committees are conducted. Because of your interest in how FCC  receives advice from experts and stakeholders, you asked us to provide  information about FCC\u2019s current federal advisory committees and other  FCC advisory groups that do not operate under FACA. Specifically, this  report provides information on (1) FCC\u2019s current federal advisory  committees and how they operate, (2) the extent to which FCC\u2019s federal  advisory committees follow applicable laws and regulations, (3) how FCC  uses federal advisory committee advice and recommendations, and (4)  what advisory groups FCC has established that are not characterized as  FACA committees and how such groups operate.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed FACA and related regulations. We  also interviewed federal officials from FCC, the General Services  Administration (GSA), and the Office of Government Ethics. We obtained  views on the operations and effectiveness of federal advisory committees  from FCC officials, including all five commissioners, several bureau chiefs,  the deputy committee management officer, the designated agency ethics  official, and the designated federal officers for each of the federal advisory  committees. To obtain the perspectives of stakeholders outside of federal  government, we asked 12 trade and interest group representatives for their  views about the quality and usefulness of the advisory committees\u2019 work.  We also interviewed the committee chairmen for FCC\u2019s current seven  advisory committees and collected information from current committee  members in March through June 2004 using a Web-based survey. We  designed the survey to obtain committee members\u2019 views on various  aspects of committee operations and effectiveness. We obtained completed  questionnaires from 200 committee members for a response rate of 71  percent. To determine if committee operations had changed over time, we  also interviewed a small sample of committee members who served on  FCC advisory committees chartered in 1998 or 1999 and asked them  questions very similar to those we asked in our survey of current members.  Finally, we interviewed non-FACA advisory committee members and  obtained documentation and legislation relating to the formation of FCC\u2019s  joint boards, joint conferences, and the Intergovernmental Advisory  Committee. We conducted our work between November 2003 and  September 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Congress included measures in FACA intended  to ensure that advisory committees responded to valid needs, that the  committees\u2019 proceedings were as open as feasible to the public, and that  Congress was kept informed of the committees\u2019 activities. FACA articulates  certain principles regarding advisory committees, including broad  requirements for balance, transparency, and independence. For example,  regarding the requirement for balance, FACA requires advisory committees  to have membership fairly representing an array of viewpoints and  interests. FACA also requires agencies to announce committee meetings in  advance and in general, to hold open meetings. FACA also sets forth other  requirements for advisory committee formation, their operations, and how  they provide advice and recommendations to the federal government. For  example, FACA stipulates that Congress, the President, or federal agencies  are authorized to establish federal advisory committees. Some federal  advisory committees are created by an agency at the direction of a statute,  but all other agency-created advisory committees are commonly referred to  as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d federal advisory committees. The Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) has established a maximum number of discretionary  federal advisory committees that each agency could establish, which varies  by agency. Additionally, the subcommittees of a federal advisory  committee are generally exempt from following FACA requirements if they  report to a parent advisory committee. Alternatively, if a subcommittee  provides advice and recommendations directly to a federal agency, it is  required to comply with FACA requirements.", "FACA does not require agencies to implement the advice or  recommendations of their federal advisory committees; advisory  committees are by design advisory. For regulatory agencies governed by  the Administrative Procedures Act, such as FCC, the relationship between  consideration and implementation of a federal advisory committee\u2019s advice  and recommendations is complicated because those agencies must follow  certain rules and processes in their rulemaking efforts. Consequently, while  an advisory committee\u2019s advice and recommendations may form the basis  for a regulatory agency\u2019s notice of proposed rulemaking, factors beyond  the advisory committee\u2019s advice may play a role in determining what action  an agency ultimately takes.", "GSA, through its Committee Management Secretariat, is responsible for  prescribing administrative guidelines and management controls applicable  to federal advisory committees governmentwide. While GSA does not  approve or deny agency decisions about creating or managing advisory  committees, GSA has developed regulations, guidance, and training to help  agencies implement FACA requirements. GSA also created and maintains  an online FACA database (available to the public at  www.fido.gov/facadatabase), which contains information about each  federal advisory committee, including committee charters, membership  rosters, budgets, and, in many cases, links to committee meeting schedules,  minutes, and reports.", "Not every advisory committee or group that provides advice or  recommendations to an agency is subject to the requirements prescribed in  FACA. To be subject to FACA, a discretionary committee or group must  have been created to provide advice or recommendations for the President  or one or more agencies or officers of the federal government. Groups  assembled only to exchange facts or information with federal officials are  not federal advisory committees, nor are certain groups made up of only  state or local officials. FACA explicitly exempts some committees from its  requirements, and certain other groups are exempt under other statutes.  For example, in some instances the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of  1995 exempts advisory committees that are composed wholly of federal,  state, local, or tribal government officials. Groups that are exempt from  FACA are not required to comply with the procedural and transparency  provisions of the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC\u2019s Federal Advisory Committees Address a Variety of Technical and Operational Issues, and Stakeholders View the Committees as Functioning Effectively", "paragraphs": ["FCC established seven discretionary federal advisory committees to  examine a range of technical and operational telecommunications issues.

All of  FCC\u2019s advisory committees are chartered for a 2-year period.  Recommendations for forming federal advisory committees at FCC can  come from a variety of sources. For example, two designated federal  officers said that problems in the telecommunications industry, such as  widespread telecommunications outages and telephone numbering  shortages, were the impetus behind the creation of two committees. When  considering which advisory committees to establish, FCC said that the  Commission\u2019s committee management officer\u2014the agency official  responsible for managing and overseeing the advisory committees\u2014 evaluates the usefulness and mission of a potential committee to ensure the  benefits of establishing the committee are clear. While the committee  management officer determines which advisory committees are to be  established, the opinions of FCC\u2019s Chairman are taken into consideration.

Another  committee chairman told us that the advisory committee process is an  effective venue for both FCC and industry to participate in the agency's  rulemaking process. He further stated that FCC receives a lot of talented  advice at little cost, which is important because, in his view, FCC lacks  adequate technical expertise. Another committee chairman said that FCC  staff do not have the level of expertise that exists on the advisory  committee and could not afford to hire such experts.", "FCC officials we contacted, including bureau chiefs and designated federal  officers, also told us that the advisory committee process generally  functions well.

Further, he commented that FACA requirements help  FCC ensure that committee operations remain transparent and accessible  to the public. According to another bureau chief, advisory committees  provide a unique opportunity for the top experts in important technical  fields to provide FCC with the benefits of their knowledge in a  nonadversarial context. One FCC designated federal officer said his  committee works tremendously well, with a lot of talented people working  to achieve the committee\u2019s objectives.

Further, the  trade group representatives generally believe FCC's advisory committees  address current and important telecommunication issues and that  members have sufficient knowledge to address committee issues.  However, three trade group representatives told us that the advisory  committee process was ineffective because FCC does not always  implement the committees\u2019 advice.

In particular, committees must (1) be in the public interest and  related to the agency\u2019s area of responsibility, (2) have a charter, (3) have a  designated federal officer, and (4) have balanced membership.", "Public interest: FACA requires the agency establishing an advisory  committee to find that the committee is in the public interest and related to  the agency\u2019s area of responsibility. According to GSA, agencies must  provide a statement that their advisory committees are in the public  interest and essential to agency business in their justifications submitted to  GSA for establishing an advisory committee. FCC provided such a  statement to GSA for all of its advisory committees.", "Charter: FACA requires all committees to have a charter that contains  specific information, including the committee\u2019s scope and objectives, a  description of duties, the period of time necessary to carry out its purposes,  the estimated operating costs, and the number and frequency of meetings.  All of FCC\u2019s advisory committees are operating under charters that met the  specific requirements.", "Designated federal officer: The act requires agency heads to appoint a  designated federal officer for each committee to oversee the committee\u2019s  activities, call the meetings of the committee, approve the agendas, and  attend the meetings. Each of FCC\u2019s advisory committees has a designated  federal officer who abides by these requirements.", "Balanced membership: FACA also requires that the membership of  committees be fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented. Our  survey of committee members as well as discussions with FCC officials  indicated that most stakeholders believed the committees had balanced  membership. For example, all of the FCC bureau chiefs and designated  federal officers we contacted, as well as the committee chairmen, said they  believe committee membership is balanced. Further, 88 percent of the  committee members who responded to our survey agreed that members  represent divergent points of views. FCC commissioners were more split  on this issue. FCC\u2019s Chairman and one commissioner stated that the  committees are adequately balanced while two others stated the  committees are not always inclusive of varied interests. Of the trade and  interest groups we contacted, five said they believed the advisory  committees had balanced membership. For example, one trade group  representative said FCC tries to be very inclusive with the committees\u2019  membership, and another said FCC goes out of its way to ensure the  committees are balanced. However, six of the trade group representatives  we contacted did not believe the advisory committees were balanced. Of  those with this view, four said that the committees had too many industry  representatives, one said the committees did not have enough consumer  representation, and one said the committees lacked geographical and  ethnic diversity.", "According to FCC\u2019s Chairman, the Commission has gone to great lengths to  ensure advisory committee membership is fairly balanced regarding the  points of view represented and the functions performed. He stated that the  advisory committees\u2019 members represent a broad array of service and  equipment providers of all sizes, as well as trade organizations and  members of the academic community. Information regarding committee  membership contained in the FACA database and that we collected from  FCC\u2019s designated federal officers indicates that FCC attempted to draw  committee membership from many facets of the telecommunications  industry. For example, FCC reported that members for one advisory  committee represent large and small telecommunications consumers, local  and interstate carriers, state regulators, equipment and software  manufacturers, satellite companies, cable companies, Internet service  providers, wireless companies, and research organizations. According to  FCC, members for another advisory committee were selected to represent  a broad and balanced viewpoint, with members from nonprofit consumer  and disability advocacy organizations, industry, underserved populations,  Native Americans, and private citizens. Membership for another advisory  committee is completely open\u2014meaning any interested party can  participate in committee activities.", "Membership designation: While membership must be balanced, federal  agencies generally have a reasonable amount of discretion to appoint  members to serve on committees. Agencies also have discretion to  determine what type of advice the advisory committee members are to  provide. Members of advisory committees may be appointed as  \u201crepresentatives,\u201d which means they are providing \u201cstakeholder advice\u201d or  advice reflecting the views of the entity or interest group they are  representing (such as industry, labor, or consumers). Committee members  may also be appointed as \u201cspecial government employees,\u201d which means  the agency appoints them with the expectation that they will provide  advice on the basis of their best judgment. The Office of Government  Ethics distinguishes between special government employees and  representative members. Committee members appointed as special  government employees who are not representative members are expected  to be impartial and are subject to conflict-of-interest rules administered by  the Office of Government Ethics. Committee members designated merely  as representative are viewed by the Office of Government Ethics as having  been appointed to represent a particular and known viewpoint, and thus  are not subject to the same ethics review. Consistent with guidance  provided by the Office of Government Ethics, GSA officials told us that  GSA cannot control how agencies designate their members, but they  generally said that if an agency is looking for a committee member to  provide his or her expert advice, the member should be designated as a  special government employee; if the member is to provide the views of an  outside entity, the member should be designated as representative.", "FCC has designated all current members of its federal advisory committees  as representatives. The FCC official who is responsible for determining if  proper designations are made\u2014the designated agency ethics official\u2014told  us he discusses member designations with the committees\u2019 designated  federal officers, but he generally does not review any documents to  determine what type of advice the member is expected to provide. The  ethics official said that it is a long-standing tradition at the Commission to  appoint all members as representative. The ethics official also told us there  is an emphasis at FCC for members to provide the representative positions  of groups, given the nature of the industry, which makes the representative  designation more appropriate.", "FCC\u2019s designation of all committee members as representatives suggests an  expectation that all of the members would contribute the opinion of the  organization, company, or institution that they represent. However, we  found that for some members it is unclear what interests they should be  representing on the advisory committees because they do not directly work  within the telecommunications industry. Rather these members\u2014who  comprised almost 13 percent of our survey respondents\u2014are affiliated  with universities or private consulting companies. Of the six survey  respondents who work for universities, five reported that they only provide  their own expert advice and not advice that represents the position of a  particular group. Similarly, nearly half of those who work in private  consulting reported that they only provide their own expert advice.  Additionally, we found that\u2014even for those members who do work for  entities within the telecommunications industry\u2014there might be confusion  for some of them about the type of advice they were expected to provide to  the committee. About 13 percent of the respondents who work for private  businesses reported that they do not view themselves as providing  representative advice, despite being designated by FCC as representative  members. All told, only 78 percent of the survey respondents said they  provide the opinion of the organization, company, or institution that they  represent. A majority of the 22 percent of respondents who did not view  their advice as representative said that they provided advice based on their  own expert opinion.", "These results suggest two points regarding the designation of members and  their understanding of their advisory roles. First, if certain members\u2014such  as those affiliated with universities or who work in private consulting\u2014 were appointed to provide their best professional judgment rather than the  representative position of a particular group, they might be more  appropriately appointed as special government employees. If members are  so designated, they would be subject to the Office of Government Ethics  rules for special government employees. Second, some members who FCC  has designated as representatives do not believe they are contributing the  advice of the organization, company, or institution that they were selected  to represent. As such, these members may not fully understand what role  they were appointed to play on the advisory committee.", "In our recent report on federal advisory committees, we recommended  that GSA issue guidance stating that agencies should specify in the  appointment letters to committee members whether they are appointed as  special government employees or as representatives. We further  recommended that for those appointed as representative members, the  entity or group that they are to represent should be noted in the letter. GSA  and the Office of Government Ethics provided formal statements to us that  outline actions they have taken and plans they are developing to address  our report recommendations. For example, the Office of Government  Ethics issued additional guidance, dated July 19, 2004, which discusses the  distinction between representative committee members and special  government employees. GSA officials told us that they consulted with the  Office of Government Ethics and modified their training on the matter of  representative versus special government employee designations.", "We found that for its advisory committees, FCC was already generally  telling members that they were to provide representative advice on behalf  of their employer in their appointment letters. However, for those members  affiliated with universities, law firms, or consulting firms who are told to  provide advice on behalf of such entities, the underlying viewpoint on  telecommunications issues that the member is expected to represent is not  clear because such institutions generally do not have an obvious viewpoint on telecommunications issues. While FCC may have selected these  individuals to represent particular telecommunications viewpoints, those  viewpoints are not specifically stated in the appointment letter. That is,  naming the institution to be represented might not always make clear the  viewpoint to be represented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Guide Many Aspects of Advisory Committee Operations", "paragraphs": ["Regarding advisory committee operations, FACA generally requires  committee meetings to be open to the public.

With  some exceptions, the meetings are to be open to the public, and agencies  are to prepare meeting minutes and make them available to interested  parties. During our review, we found that FCC provided adequate notice of  meetings, held open meetings and prepared minutes in accordance with the  act for all of its advisory committees.", "Support services: FACA and GSA regulations specify that agencies should  provide support services for their committees. According to the designated  federal officers, FCC typically provides meeting facilities and  administrative and logistical support for the committees. At the time of our  review, most of the designated federal officers, as well as the deputy  committee management officer, said the committees had sufficient  resources to effectively conduct committee operations. While each  advisory committee has a budget, we found the funds were allocated for  FCC staff, both professional and administrative. FCC does not pay any  travel-related costs for committee members to attend meetings. As shown  in table 1, the majority of committee members surveyed were satisfied with  the support provided by FCC.", "Communications: GSA regulations also state that agencies should (1) seek  feedback from advisory committee members on the effectiveness of  committee activities and (2) communicate to committee members on a  regular basis how their advice has affected agency programs.

In response to our survey of  committee members, we received 10 comments indicating there is limited  communication between FCC and the advisory committees.
