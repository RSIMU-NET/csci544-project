TFI's mission is to integrate intelligence and enforcement functions to (1) safeguard the financial system against illicit use and (2) combat rogue nations, terrorist facilitators, and other national security threats. In the 5 years since TFI's creation, questioned have been raised about how TFI is managed and allocates its resources. As a result, GAO was asked to analyze how TFI (1) implements its functions, particularly in collaboration with interagency partners, (2) conducts strategic resource planning, and (3) measures its performance. To conduct this analysis, GAO reviewed Treasury and TFI planning documents, performance reports, and workforce data, and interviewed officials from Treasury and its key interagency partners."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TFI undertakes five functions, each implemented by a TFI component, in order to achieve its mission. TFI officials cite the analysis of financial intelligence as a critical part of TFI's efforts because it underlies TFI's ability to utilize many of its tools. They said that the creation of OIA was critical to Treasury's ability to effectively identify illicit financial networks. To achieve its mission, TFI's five components often work with each other, other U.S. government agencies, the private sector, or foreign governments. Officials from TFI and its interagency partners cited strong collaboration in many areas, such as effective information sharing between FinCEN and the Justice Department (Justice). Officials differed, however, about the quality of interagency collaboration involving international forums. Treasury officials who led this collaboration stated that it runs smoothly and that they were unaware of any significant concerns, while Justice and State officials reported declining collaboration and unclear mechanisms to enhance or sustain it. While TFI and some of its components have conducted selected strategic resource planning activities, TFI as a unit has not fully adopted key practices that enhance such efforts. For example, TFI and its components have produced multiple strategic planning documents in recent years, but the objectives in some of these documents are not clearly aligned with resources needed to achieve them. As a result, it may be unclear whether TFI has sufficient resources to address its objectives. Also, though TFI has undertaken some workforce planning activities, it lacks a process for performing comprehensive strategic workforce planning. Thus, it is unclear whether TFI is able to effectively address persistent workforce challenges. Also, TFI has not yet developed appropriate performance measures, changing their number and substance each year. Though TFI's current measures fully address many attributes of effective performance measures, they do not cover all TFI core program activities. TFI officials acknowledge the need for improvement and have worked since 2007 to develop one overall performance measure to assess TFI. Yet questions remain about when TFI will implement its new measure and whether it will effectively gauge TFI's performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While the globalization of finance and trade has the potential to enhance  economic prosperity and stability across the world, some individuals,  organizations, and countries that pose a threat to U.S. national security  have exploited worldwide financial channels.

Subsequently, Congress passed the Intelligence  Authorization Act for 2004, which established Treasury\u2019s Office of  Intelligence and Analysis (OIA).  OIA is a member of the Intelligence  Community, as defined under Executive Order 12333, as amended. The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 identified the  Secretary of the Treasury or his or her designee as the lead U.S.  government official to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to  continue to convene an interagency working group on FATF issues. TFI\u2019s  mission is to marshal Treasury\u2019s policy, enforcement, regulatory, and  intelligence functions in order to safeguard the U.S. financial system from  abuse and sever the lines of financial support to international terrorists,  WMD proliferators, narcotics traffickers, money launderers, and other  threats to U.S. national security.", "The formation of TFI combined both existing and new units of Treasury.

Figure 1 shows TFI\u2019s current organizational structure.", "To achieve its mission, TFI components often work with the following:    Other U.S. government agencies. For instance, OFAC works with State  and Justice, among others, to designate individuals and organizations  under 21 separate sanctions programs. TFFC also works with State,  Justice, and other agencies in developing and advocating a U.S. position in  international forums related to money laundering and illicit financing. In  addition, TEOAF works with State and Justice to administer sharing of  large case forfeiture proceeds with foreign governments, pursuant to  international treaties, whose law enforcement personnel cooperated with  U.S. federal investigations.", "Other TFI components. For example, OIA provides information to OFAC  to assist in making decisions regarding whether to pursue designations of  individuals and organizations. For completed designations, OIA also works  with OFAC to declassify intelligence information for public dissemination.", "Private sector. For example, in its role as the Secretary\u2019s delegated  administrator of the BSA, FinCEN regularly interacts with the private  sector, including the financial sector.

TFI and other U.S.  agencies participate in several international organizations intended to  strengthen the international financial system so that it cannot be exploited  by criminal networks. Two examples are the FATF and the Egmont  Group. TFFC leads the U.S. delegation to the FATF, while FinCEN leads  U.S. participation in the Egmont Group. According to TFI officials, U.S.  participation in such organizations provides a unique opportunity to  engage with international counterparts in the effort to develop  international standards and a framework for countries to implement legal  regimes that protect the international financial system from abuse.", "TFI also uses international forums to advance the U.S. agenda in areas  such as nonproliferation. For example, according to TFI, it has been  working closely with other G-7 countries to determine what steps can be  taken to isolate proliferators from the international financial system  through multilateral action. For instance, according to TFI officials, they  are working with State to encourage the more than 85 countries that  participate in the Proliferation Security Initiative to use financial measures  to combat proliferation support networks.", "In addition to playing a leadership role in these organizations and forums,  TFI officials report that they are also working to expand these  organizations\u2019 membership so as to broaden the reach of international  financial standards. For example, as of March 2009, FinCEN was  sponsoring 12 countries\u2019 membership in the Egmont Group, including  Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Yemen. According to FinCEN  officials, the addition of such new members will greatly strengthen  FinCEN\u2019s ability to obtain valuable information related to the activities of  illicit financial networks.", "Improving international partners\u2019 capacity. As part of TFI, FinCEN has  made engagement with foreign FIUs in the detection and deterrence of  crime one of its strategic objectives. To accomplish this objective, FinCEN  has undertaken a variety of efforts to strengthen the global network of  FIUs. For example, according to FinCEN officials, they engage in a variety  of cooperative efforts with other FIUs aimed at fostering productive  working relationships and best practices. In addition, according to TFI  officials, they participate in mutual evaluation studies, as part of its  participation in the FATF, to identify measures to improve other FATF  members\u2019 regulatory regimes related to combating money laundering and  terrorist financing. For example, in fiscal year 2008, the FATF performed  six mutual evaluations; the United States delegation, led by TFFC, sent  representatives to serve as assessors for four of these mutual evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing Financial Intelligence", "paragraphs": ["TFI officials cite OIA\u2019s analysis of financial intelligence as a critical part of  TFI\u2019s efforts because it underlies TFI\u2019s ability to utilize many of its tools.

They said that the  creation of OIA was critical to TFI\u2019s ability to effectively identify these  illicit financial networks. As a member of the broader intelligence  community, OIA performs analysis of intelligence information related to  national security threats with a view toward potential action and  utilization of tools available to TFI.  Staff in other TFI components and TFI  management then use this intelligence analysis to draft papers to  implement such strategies or actions.", "In addition, TFI utilizes intelligence analysis to assess the impact of the  actions it takes. For example, according to the Under Secretary for TFI,  intelligence analysts have assessed the impact of previous financial  actions taken to address the national security threat posed by North  Korea.

The BSA includes a variety of  reporting and record-keeping requirements that provide useful information  to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. For example, pursuant to the  BSA, Treasury (FinCEN) requires financial institutions to report  suspicious financial activities relevant to a possible violation of law. Such  suspicious activity reports (SAR) are then analyzed by FinCEN and made  available to the law enforcement and regulatory communities.  In 2007,  financial institutions filed nearly 1.3 million SARs, which federal, state,  and local law enforcement agencies use in their investigations of money  laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.", "The BSA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, also grants Treasury  additional authorities, which are delegated to FinCEN, to combat money  laundering and terrorist financing. For example, Section 311 of the USA  PATRIOT Act amended the BSA to provide an additional tool to safeguard  the U.S. financial system from illicit foreign financial institutions and  networks. According to TFI officials, Section 311 is an important and  extraordinarily powerful tool, as it authorizes Treasury to find a foreign  jurisdiction, foreign financial institution, type of account, or class of  transaction as being of \u201cprimary money laundering concern.\u201d Such a  finding enables Treasury to impose a range of special measures that U.S.  financial institutions must take to protect against illicit financing risks  posed by the target.

For example, according to TFI  officials, they use the authorities under the International Emergency  Economic Powers Act and Executive Order 13224 to designate those who  provide support to terrorists, freezing any assets they have under U.S.  jurisdiction and preventing U.S. persons from doing business with them.

According to TEOAF, in  fiscal year 2008 it received more than $500 million in total forfeiture  revenue; the majority, after net expenses, came from forfeitures processed  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Internal Revenue  Service\u2013Criminal Investigation. Second, according to the Director of  TEOAF, the revenue derived from such forfeited assets can be used to  fund federal law enforcement activities, including initiatives directed at  further combating illicit financing networks. For example, in fiscal year  2008, TEOAF provided approximately $1 million in funding to Immigration  and Customs Enforcement to provide training to international partners.

Many of the tools TFI utilizes to combat national  security threats involve multiple agencies reviewing the proposed action.  For example, according to Treasury officials, they consult with officials  from State, Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security on  decisions to designate individuals or organizations that support terrorism.  In addition, other tools, such as advocating actions to strengthen the  international financial system through the FATF, benefit from the  expertise and input from collaboration with a variety of agencies,  including State, Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the  Department of Homeland Security, and others. Prior GAO work has  identified several practices that can enhance and sustain such interagency  collaboration. One such practice is establishing compatible policies,  procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries.", "Another practice is developing a mechanism for monitoring, evaluating,  and reporting on the results of collaborative efforts.", "Officials at TFI and other agencies said that they generally are satisfied  with the quality of interagency collaboration. TFI\u2019s interagency partners  report close, collaborative relationships in many situations. For example,  State officials told us that they have strong working relationships with  officials in almost all TFI components. They highlighted their  collaboration with TFI during the designation process and suggested that  it is generally effective. These officials commented that if State has  information from its embassies abroad that indicates that a specific  designation would be particularly damaging to U.S. foreign policy  interests, they relay this information to Treasury and discuss alternative  approaches. State officials added that the designation process operates  effectively, even when agencies may have disagreements over a particular  designation, because the National Security Council leads a process to  coordinate terrorism designations. It serves as an impartial arbiter that  prevents any single agency from exerting too much influence. In addition,  Justice officials described a strong working relationship with FinCEN  regarding asset forfeiture and money laundering issues. Specifically, they  recounted effective communication and information sharing. For example,  Justice officials told us that FinCEN has granted Justice access to BSA  data, thus allowing Justice to perform its own analyses for law  enforcement purposes. Additionally, Justice officials said that FinCEN has  helped them utilize its network of international contacts at other  countries\u2019 FIUs.", "However, TFI\u2019s interagency partners have expressed concerns regarding  collaboration in other areas. For example, in September 2008, we reported  that State and Justice expressed concerns regarding Treasury\u2019s  consultations with them when implementing Section 311 of the USA  PATRIOT Act. In addition, TFI and other agencies\u2019 officials differed  about the effectiveness of interagency collaboration for the function of  building international coalitions, particularly when participating in the  international forums of the FATF and FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRB).  On the one hand, TFFC officials suggest that interagency collaboration  regarding the FATF and FSRBs has been highly effective over the past 5  years and that Treasury\u2019s ability to effectively lead the U.S. delegation has  been greatly strengthened by the participation of a wide variety of  regulatory, law enforcement, and other agencies. The Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes added that during  this time, there have been no major disagreements between agencies  regarding the positions the United States should take in such international  forums. TFI officials also stated that interagency collaboration runs  smoothly and that they were unaware of any significant concerns  regarding the quality of interagency collaboration.", "Officials from State and Justice, however, indicated that the quality of  interagency collaboration regarding the FATF and FSRBs has declined  substantially over the past 5 years. These officials expressed two types of  concerns regarding TFI\u2019s collaboration with other agencies regarding  participation in international forums: (1) the exclusion of non-Treasury  personnel in key situations and (2) the extent to which TFI makes  unilateral decisions regarding the U.S. government position.", "With regard to TFI\u2019s exclusion of non-Treasury personnel in key situations,  TFI and other agencies differ. State and Justice officials cited several  examples of situations they believe undermined U.S. effectiveness at  combating illicit financing networks. For example, according to State  officials, a State official who has taken the necessary training has not been  allowed to participate as a member of the U.S. team conducting FATF  mutual evaluations. According to these officials, this results in the  exclusion of senior staff with significant experience and expertise that  could benefit the evaluation teams. In response, TFFC officials indicated  that they have included other agencies in the mutual evaluation process.  For example, they indicated that officials from Justice and other agencies  participated in at least six mutual evaluations from 2004 through 2009.  According to TFI, it encourages and attempts to facilitate such  participation by other agency officials who have attended the necessary 1- week training course and whose agencies will pay for their travel to  foreign countries to conduct and defend their evaluations.", "Additionally, Justice officials stated that when TFI allows other agencies  to review and comment on U.S. policy proposals related to anti-money  laundering and counterterrorist financing, it consistently provides too little  time for review. Specifically, Justice officials told us that TFI regularly  provides agencies 24 hours to review and provide comments on policy  proposals, which may make it impossible for agencies to conduct an  appropriate review and effectively excludes them from the process.  According to TFI officials, they distribute materials as soon as possible;  for FATF materials this occurs within 24 hours of receiving them, though  they acknowledge that they often are provided short deadlines by the  FATF Secretariat. According to TFI officials, they sometimes request an  extension of the deadline or submit the U.S. response late in order to  obtain interagency views.", "With regard to concerns about TFI\u2019s unilateral decision making, TFI and  other agencies also differed. State and Justice officials cited a situation  related to the U.S. position on how to treat the European Union (as a  single entity or as separate countries) for the purposes of cash-smuggling  regulations. According to State and Justice officials, during interagency  meetings prior to the FATF working group session at which the issue was  to be discussed, a consensus U.S. position was developed. However, State  and Justice officials said that at the FATF plenary meetings, Treasury  officials advocated a position that was different from the consensus U.S.  position agreed to in advance of the meeting. A Treasury official told us  that the agency did not deviate from the consensus position agreed to  before the meeting.", "Justice, State, and Treasury officials said that there is no guidance  specifying how the interagency process should operate to develop U.S.  positions in advance of FATF meetings. Specifically, there is no guidance  regarding the process or time frames for circulating or approving U.S.  policy statements to be made at international meetings to discuss anti- money laundering and counterterrorist financing issues. In addition, there  is no formal mechanism for monitoring, evaluating, or reporting on the  results of agencies\u2019 collaborative efforts.", "According to State and Justice officials, the inconsistent quality of  interagency collaboration may undermine some efforts to combat illicit  financing networks through international forums. State officials suggested  that the exclusion of non-Treasury personnel may mean that expertise  available within the U.S. government is not effectively utilized, thus  potentially weakening the United States\u2019 ability to influence international  partners\u2019 actions. In addition, they suggested that unilateral action by  Treasury in international forums may cause confusion among international  partners regarding the nature of the U.S. position on key issues. On the  basis of comments they received from foreign officials, Justice and State  officials concluded that such confusion might weaken the United States\u2019  ability to influence the activities of international partners.  TFFC  responded that it has not observed any confusion among its international  partners in FATF regarding the U.S. position on key issues.", "Justice and State officials did not raise similar concerns concerning  FinCEN\u2019s collaboration when participating with them on issues related to  the Egmont Group. In contrast, Justice officials expressed some criticisms  of more recent collaboration with OFAC on issues such as information  sharing.  OFAC responded that it has regular contact with Justice with  respect to enforcement matters and that the two agencies have an ongoing  dialogue regarding information sharing.

However, two reasons suggest why the  results of the budget process do not necessarily reflect TFI\u2019s strategic  priorities. First, there are many other factors that affect the budget  process that are unrelated to TFI\u2019s priorities. The amount of resources TFI  seeks is integrated into a larger Treasury budget request, which may entail  modifying TFI\u2019s request. Congress, then, may choose to provide more or  less than the amount of resources to TFI that Treasury requested. Second,  the annual budget process reflects priorities only for a given year, unlike  strategic plans, which are intended to be multiyear documents and thus  reflect longer-term priorities.", "Further, the linkage between the resources allocated to each TFI  component and its workload is unclear. Estimated workload measures for  each of TFI\u2019s components show a growth in workload since 2005, but it is  unclear how this growth relates to resource increases. For example, one  measure of FinCEN\u2019s workload\u2014the number of SARs it must analyze\u2014 has increased 50 percent and the number of employees in FinCEN has  increased 3 percent. In addition, TEOAF has seen an 83 percent increase  in the value of seized assets it manages and the number of FTEs has grown  10 percent.

Additionally, OIA  experienced a more than 500 percent increase in intelligence taskings  from 2006 to 2008 and has received a 200 percent increase in FTEs.  Finally, TFFC estimates that its workload related to developing policy  papers, legislative and rulemaking papers, trips, and public outreach  events increased between 100 and 200 percent from 2005 to 2009; its FTEs  grew nearly 80 percent from 2005 to 2008.", "According to TFI officials, their ability to allocate resources to their  highest priorities is constrained in some circumstances. The Under  Secretary and other TFI officials identified activities related to Iran and  North Korea as persistent priorities. However, OFAC officials noted that in  spite of the importance of Iran- and North Korea-related activities, they  must expend a significant amount of resources on implementing the Cuba  embargo. With regard to acting on specific licensing requests for exports  and travel to Cuba, according to OFAC officials, they have little flexibility  under the law. OFAC is required to process all license applications that it  receives. For 2005 through 2008, this amounted to more than 200,000  licensing actions\u2014more than 95 percent of which related to the Cuba  program. In 2008 alone, OFAC responded to nearly 60,000 licensing  requests related to the Cuba travel program. OFAC officials characterized  this situation as a resource burden.", "In contrast, according to OFAC officials, they have some flexibility  regarding how they enforce the Cuba sanctions program, for example,  through the assessment of civil penalties for violations. According to  OFAC officials, for many years (through 2005), OFAC assessed a large  number of civil penalties related to the Cuba travel regulations. As  violations of these regulations have a relatively small financial penalty  associated with them, the average penalty amount was relatively low.  Since 2006, according to OFAC officials, they have consciously utilized the  flexibility they are allowed in order to dedicate their enforcement  resources to higher-value areas (e.g., those related to trade with Cuba,  Iran, and North Korea). As a result, the number of penalties assessed  annually related to the Cuba sanctions program has dropped significantly,  from 498 in 2005 to 46 in 2008. At the same time, the average value of  OFAC\u2019s civil penalties for violations of all sanctions programs has  increased significantly, from approximately $2,400 in 2005 to nearly  $31,000 in 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TFI Has Not Taken a Comprehensive Approach to Strategic Workforce Planning", "paragraphs": ["Despite efforts by some components, TFI management has not yet  conducted comprehensive activities to address the key principles of  strategic workforce planning.

Prior GAO work has identified key principles to assist agencies in  conducting strategic workforce planning. Among these principles are (1)  involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing the strategic workforce  plan, and (2) monitoring and evaluating the agency\u2019s progress toward its  human capital goals and the contribution that human capital results have  made toward achieving programmatic results.", "According to TFI officials, some TFI components have taken the initiative  individually to perform some strategic workforce planning activities.  Specifically, as a Treasury bureau, FinCEN has an internal human  resources group that, among other things, performs some strategic  workforce planning activities. For example, according to FinCEN officials,  they undertook an effort to identify mission critical occupations, which  resulted in designating three positions as mission critical. As a result,  FinCEN developed plans to address human capital challenges related to  these occupations and regularly reports to Treasury\u2019s Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Chief Human Capital Officer  on its progress. In addition, OIA has taken a variety of steps to address  human capital challenges. For example, according to OIA officials, to  address challenges in recruiting and retaining intelligence analysts, OIA  cataloged the human capital flexibilities available to provide recruiting and  retention incentives. As a result, OIA officials indicated that they have  identified and are now able to utilize a variety of human capital  flexibilities, such as student loan repayment to attract and retain staff and  the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholarship Program to pay for the continuing  educational needs of its analysts.", "Nonetheless, TFI management has not yet conducted comprehensive  activities to address the key principles of strategic workforce planning for  TFI as a whole. TFI top management has not set the overall direction and  goals of workforce planning or evaluated progress toward any human  capital goals.

According  to an official from Treasury\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Human Resources and Chief Human Capital Officer, the office has  provided targeted workforce planning assistance to OIA and, in spring  2009, began discussing how they could assist TFI in broader workforce  planning efforts. In particular, they cited the need to conduct an overall  workforce analysis and succession planning.", "According to TFI\u2019s Senior Resource Manager, TFI\u2019s workforce planning  mainly occurs as a component of the annual budget preparation process.  As a part of this process, individual components can request additional  staff resources for priority initiatives they identify. TFI management then  evaluates these individual proposals and determines what will be included  in TFI\u2019s budget request.", "Without the benefit of comprehensive strategic workforce planning to  assist in identifying solutions, it is unclear whether TFI will be able to  effectively address persistent workforce challenges.

While some TFI  components have assessed the training needs of their staff, there has been  no similar TFI-wide effort. Without such an assessment, it is unclear  whether TFI staff are being prepared to address the challenges posed by  illicit financing in the future.", "Obstacles to hiring intelligence analysts. According to officials from OIA  and Treasury\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human  Resources and Chief Human Capital Officer, OIA continues to be at a  competitive disadvantage relative to other agencies in the Intelligence  Community regarding recruiting. Specifically, according to Treasury  officials, most other agencies in the Intelligence Community can hire  intelligence analysts into the excepted service, thus bypassing the need for  competitive selection of candidates.

Our analysis could not  link TEOAF\u2019s measure to broader agencywide goals related to removing or  reducing threats to national security.", "Core program activities. Seven TFI measures do not sufficiently cover  core program activities. For example, OFAC has three main  responsibilities related to the administration of sanctions: (1) issuing  licenses, (2) designation programs, and (3) enforcement through civil  penalties.

For example, we identified the following  concerns:    Objectivity and reliability of survey-based measures. OIA has developed  surveys to measure the timeliness, relevance, and accuracy of its  intelligence support, all-source analysis, and security and  counterintelligence. The survey respondents are internal customers of  OIA\u2019s products within Treasury such as the Deputy Secretary, Under  Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and senior  staff. The objectivity of the surveys is not clear given that respondents\u2019  answers may be biased because they have a vested interest in the  outcome, as it is a reflection on their performance. The reliability of the  measures is also questionable, as only between 7 and 13 internal  customers\u2014rather than external customers in the Intelligence  Community\u2014will be asked to complete the survey. TFI believes that while  there is no perfect method for evaluating OIA\u2019s performance, the surveys  are an effective means for Treasury policymakers to assess OIA\u2019s  performance. They also noted their plan to survey customers in other parts  of the Intelligence Community in 2010.", "Lack of validation for some components\u2019 self-assessment-based  measures. Some components\u2019 performance measures rely exclusively on  self-assessments by component managers and lack external verification.  For example, TFFC has 4 measures for which management will compile  supporting information and assign a high, medium, or low rating for  TFFC\u2019s performance in that area. Treasury and TFI acknowledge (but have  not yet addressed) a lack of a process to independently verify TFFC\u2019s self- assessment.

According to TFI, to calculate the  composite measure, individual components\u2019 results will be averaged into a  single TFI measure.

As a result, additional opportunities  for improvement exist. First, despite the critical role interagency  collaboration plays in many of TFI\u2019s functions and general approval by key  interagency partners, such collaboration may not be as effective as it could  be in certain respects. TFI and some of its interagency partners had  strikingly different perceptions about the quality of collaborative efforts  involving multilateral forums. Lacking clearly documented policies and  procedures for collaboration in this area, interagency partners were  unsure how to resolve their differences. Without a mechanism to monitor  and report on the results of such interagency collaboration, TFI officials  were generally unaware that differences existed or what impact they might  be having, and thus saw no need to take steps to understand or address  them. Second, TFI management has not clearly aligned its resources with  its priorities. Without clear, consistent objectives and an understanding of  how resources are aligned with them, it may be unclear to Congress, TFI\u2019s  interagency partners, or even TFI staff what TFI\u2019s priorities are and  whether TFI has sufficient resources to address them. In addition, while  some components have undertaken workforce planning activities, TFI  management has yet to implement a comprehensive strategic workforce  planning process for TFI as a whole. As a result, TFI may be at risk of not  having the workforce required to address future national security threats.  Finally, TFI\u2019s performance reporting has been uneven. Though TFI has  been working to improve its ability to effectively measure its performance  as a unit, TFI has not yet developed a set of performance measures that  embody the attributes of successful performance measures.
