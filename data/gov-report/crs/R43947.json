", "This report provides data based on a count of staff listed in House telephone directories published since 1977. Like most sources of data, telephone directory listings have potential benefits and potential drawbacks. Telephone directories were chosen for a number of reasons, including the following: ", "telephone directories published by the House are an official source of information about that institution, and are widely available; presumably, the number of directory listings closely approximates the number of staff working for the House; while arguably not their intended purpose, the directories provide a consistent breakdown of House staff by internal organization at a particular moment in time; and the directories afford the opportunity to compare staff levels at similar moments across a period of decades.", "At the same time, however, data presented below should be interpreted with care for a number of reasons, including the following:", "There is no way to determine whether all staff working for the House are listed in the chamber's telephone directories. If some staff are not listed, relying on telephone directories is likely to lead to an undercount of staff. It is not possible to determine if those staff who are listed were actually employed by the House at the time the directories were published. If the directories list individuals who are no longer employed by the House, then relying on them is likely to lead to an overcount of staff. The extent to which the criteria for inclusion in the directories for the House have changed over time cannot be fully determined. Some editions of the House's directories do not always list staff in various entities the same way. This may raise questions regarding the reliability of telephone directory data as a means for identifying congressional staff levels within the House over time. Some House staff may have more than one telephone number, or be listed in the directory under more than one entity. As a consequence, they might be counted more than once. This could lead to a more accurate count of staff in specific entities within the House, but multiple listings may also lead to an overcount of staff working in the chamber. Chamber directories may reflect different organizational arrangements over time for some entities. This could lead to counting staff doing similar work in both years in different categories, or in different offices. A random sample of House Member offices used to develop an estimate of Member office staff working in Washington, DC, and discussed in greater detail below, may or may not be representative of the entire population of House Member offices. The extent to which the sample is representative of the population from which it is drawn will determine the accuracy of the estimated data for House Member offices.

Since 1975, the House has limited the number of full-time staff working in a Member's office to 18 permanent employees; in 1979 up to four FTEs who may work part time were authorized. As a consequence, among all congressional entities, House Member office staffing is the least likely to show a high degree of variability. For each year, a random sample of 45 Member offices was drawn in proportion to the distribution of Member offices in the Cannon, Longworth, and Rayburn House office buildings in 2014. Staff telephone data from those offices were counted and assumed to be in Washington, DC, if they were listed as working in the Cannon, Longworth, or Rayburn buildings, and outside of Washington, DC, if they were not. The average number of staff working in Washington, DC, and in district offices was computed. Those data were multiplied by the number of Member offices to derive an estimate of the number of staff employed in personal offices who work in House Member offices.

Some note that as organizations such as governing institutions develop, they identify needs for expertise and develop specialized practices and processes.
