Included in these measures was the creation of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was tasked to develop and submit a plan to Congress containing deficit reduction to total at least $1.2 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. However, because the committee did not report out recommendations, the BCA's automatic spending reduction process was triggered. This process is set to begin on January 2, 2013.", "Both President Obama and some Members of Congress have offered proposals for repealing or modifying the automatic spending reductions. The President's FY2013 Budget Proposal eliminates the automatic spending reductions for all nine years and replaces them with alternative measures to reduce the deficit. The largest of these proposals include allowing the 2001/2003/2010 tax cuts for singles making over $200,000 and households making over $250,000 to expire; savings generated from changes to Medicare, Medicaid, agriculture, and other mandatory programs; and placing caps on spending on Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Together, this proposal totals $2,221 billion more in deficit reduction than what would be achieved by the BCA's automatic spending reduction process between FY2012 and FY2022.", "The Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012 (H.R. 5652), agreed to by the House on May 10, 2012, would cancel the sequester of approximately $98 billion in discretionary defense, discretionary non-defense, and mandatory defense FY2013 funding scheduled to take place on January 2, 2013; would lower the current FY2013 cap on discretionary budget authority set by the BCA of $1,047 billion to $1,028 billion; and would cut other mandatory non-defense programs. If enacted, this measure would reduce the deficit by $262 billion more than what would be achieved by the BCA's FY2013 automatic spending reductions over the FY2012 to FY2022 period. A similar proposal, the Spending Reduction Act of 2012 (H.R. 6684), was also passed by the House on December 20, 2012.", "Representative Chris Van Hollen offered a substitute amendment to H.R. 5652. His proposal would replace the entire FY2013 sequester with a series of revenue increases and spending reductions. If enacted, this measure would reduce the deficit by $30 billion more than what would be achieved by the BCA's FY2013 automatic spending reductions over the FY2012 to FY2022 period. This measure was not made in order by the House Rules Committee.", "On September 13, the House passed the National Security and Job Protection Act (H.R. 6365), introduced by Representative Allen West, by a vote of 223-196. The act cancels the FY2013 sequester on discretionary defense, discretionary non-defense, and mandatory defense contingent upon enactment of H.R. 5652, or an alternative measure that would achieve outlay reductions equal to those to be achieved by the FY2013 sequester in those categories. This legislation was determined by CBO to not have a budgetary impact.", "In addition to the measures proposed above to replace the BCA's automatic spending cuts, President Obama signed into law the Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 (H.R. 5872) on August 7, 2012. This legislation requires OMB, in consultation with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, to submit a detailed report within 30 days of enactment containing information on how the BCA's FY2013 automatic spending reductions will affect each non-exempt program, project, and activity.

However, because the committee did not report out recommendations and therefore no deficit reduction plan became law by January 15, 2012, the BCA's automatic spending reduction process was triggered. This automatic spending reduction process, set to begin on January 2, 2013, would reduce federal outlays over the next decade unless legislation is enacted to prevent it.", "The BCA specified a reduction of $1.2 trillion in cuts to budgetary resources over a nine-year period, with $216 billion (or 18%) of the total reduction to be achieved via savings on debt service costs. This amount was stipulated in the BCA itself. The remaining $984 billion is to be divided equally across each of the nine years, resulting in annual cuts of approximately $109 billion. Approximately $55 billion of these annual reductions will affect defense spending and $55 billion will affect non-defense spending.", "Some in Congress have objected to the mechanism by which spending would be cut in these years and have proposed alternatives to these reductions. However, in order to modify the deficit reduction process contained in the BCA, Congress and the President would have to enact legislation to cancel or replace the automatic reductions.", "This report provides information on the levels of deficit reduction if the BCA's automatic cuts are implemented as under current law and contrasts that with the alternative proposals offered by some Members of Congress and President Obama.

These cuts will affect the remainder of FY2013 and will occur unless Congress and the President act to cancel the cuts. Between FY2014 and FY2021, the dollar amount of the cuts will remain the same, though the cuts will be implemented in a different way. In those years, the reductions to mandatory spending will be implemented via a sequestration process, while the reductions to discretionary spending will be made via a lowering of the discretionary spending caps, effectively leaving it up to Congress to decide, via the appropriations process, how the cuts would be implemented under the new, lowered caps. Because Congress retains control over how the discretionary spending cuts in later years (FY2014-FY2021) will be implemented, they can choose to target specific programs, rather than have the more non-discriminatory cuts made via the sequester. The automatic reductions will total $1.2 trillion over the FY2013-FY2021 period. Cuts to discretionary programs as a result of the automatic spending reduction process would be in addition to the cuts to discretionary programs resulting from the BCA discretionary caps.", "Based on estimates issued by OMB and CBO, Table 1 shows the reductions in spending to different portions of the budget in dollar terms and percentage terms from this process. Because large portions of the budget are exempt from the BCA's automatic reduction process, the effects on non-exempt programs are much larger than if the same reductions were spread over all programs (i.e., there were no exemptions). For example, total spending (gross outlays) would be reduced by about 2.5% in FY2014, but, as shown in Table 1 , CBO estimates the automatic process would reduce discretionary caps for defense by 9.8% and non-defense by 7.4% in FY2014. It would also reduce non-exempt mandatory outlays by 2% for Medicare, as stipulated by the BCA, and, CBO estimates, by 7.4% for other non-defense, non-exempt mandatory accounts in FY2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Table 2 shows how the deficit reduction from the BCA and various replacement proposals (discussed later in more detail) will be distributed across discretionary and mandatory spending categories. The amount of deficit reduction shown in Table 2 differs from the amount of the reduction in budgetary resources because the deficit is measured as the difference between outlays and revenue. There is a lag in the time a cut to budgetary resources would result in a reduction in outlays. Due to the provisions of the BCA, no changes are made to revenue in the automatic process under that law; however, some proposals to replace the automatic cuts recommend raising revenues to achieve the desired deficit reduction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals to Replace the FY2013 Sequester", "paragraphs": ["Some Members of Congress have offered proposals for repealing or modifying the automatic spending reductions before they go into effect.

In addition to providing some details on the level of the reductions themselves, the report made several other important points. First, it mentioned that the estimates contained in the report were preliminary and, as stipulated by the STA, were based generally on the assumption that FY2013 appropriations are funded at the FY2012 level. Therefore, both the percentage reduction and resulting dollar amount of the reductions within specific accounts as listed in the report are likely to change if the sequester were to be implemented on January 2, 2013. Second, the classifications of certain accounts as exempt or non-exempt had not yet been determined; federal administrative expenses being one example. Once final determinations are made, any changes to the size of the sequestrable base would alter the size of the reductions. Third, OMB also stated that it was unable to show the amount of the reductions at the PPA level due to the time constraints imposed by the STA. Therefore, the reductions in the report are shown at the budget account level, which often can contain several PPAs.", "In addition to the STA, the BCA requires OMB to submit a report containing information regarding the calculations and reductions required under the automatic process, including the FY2013 sequestration, on January 2, 2013, and with the President's budget submission each year thereafter. No other reporting requirements are included in the BCA itself. ", "However, OMB has issued responses to questions raised by Members of Congress regarding certain sequestration implementation issues. In a May 25, 2012, letter to House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, OMB's Acting Director Jeffrey Zients wrote that the Administration had determined, reiterating from an earlier letter, all programs administered by VA, including Veterans' Medical Care, were exempt from sequestration. In a June 15, 2012, letter to House Committee Chairman Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Mike Rogers, Mr. Zients wrote that the Administration has \"identified no statutory basis for generally exempting OCO funds from sequestration.\" Finally, on July 31, 2012, Zients sent a letter to Speaker Boehner notifying him of President Obama's intent to exempt military personnel accounts from the FY2013 sequestration."], "subsections": []}]}}
