{"id": "RL33330", "title": "Community Development Block Grant Funds in Disaster Relief and Recovery", "released_date": "2012-11-01T00:00:00", "summary": ["In the aftermath of presidentially declared disasters, Congress has used a variety of programs to help states and local governments finance recovery efforts, among them the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Over the years, Congress has appropriated supplemental CDBG funds to assist states and communities to recover from such natural disasters as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes. In addition, CDBG funds supported recovery efforts in New York City following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; in Oklahoma City following the bombing of the Alfred Murrah Building in 1995; and in the city and county of Los Angeles following the riots of 1992. In response to those calamities, CDBG funds were made available for short-term relief efforts, mitigation actions, and long-term recovery, and to provide housing and business assistance, infrastructure reconstruction, and public services.", "The Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) resulted in the largest appropriation of CDBG funds for disaster relief and recovery in the program's history. Since December 2005, Congress has provided $19.85 billion in CDBG disaster-related assistance to the five states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) affected by the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. This included $11.5 billion in CDBG assistance appropriated in the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2006, P.L. 109-148; $5.2 billion in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery Act of 2006, P.L. 109-234; and $3 billion (exclusively for Louisiana's Road Home Program) appropriated in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2008, P.L. 110-116.", "The 110th Congress appropriated $6.8 billion in CDBG funds to be used to respond to presidentially declared disasters occurring in 2008. This included $300 million appropriated under the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. 110-252, and $6.5 billion included in the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, P.L. 110-329.", "In general, CDBG disaster relief acts passed since 2005 have included provisions that limit the amount a state could use for administrative expenses to 5%; allow a state to seek waivers of program requirements, except those related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review; prohibit the use of funds for activities that were reimbursable by or made available by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Army Corp of Engineers; and require each state to develop and HUD to approve state recovery plans", "As a condition for the receipt of CDBG disaster recovery assistance, states are required to submit quarterly reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on all awards and use of funds. The acts do not prescribe the form these quarterly reports are to take nor the content they are to include, except for identifying and rationalizing the use of sole source contracts.", "The 111th Congress approved a supplemental appropriations act for 2010, H.R. 4899, which was signed by the President on July 29, 2010, as P.L. 111-212. The act provided an additional $100 million in CDBG funds to help states and communities undertake disaster recovery activities in presidentially declared disaster areas affected by severe storms and flooding during the period from March 2010 through May 2010. Most recently, the 112th Congress also considered and passed legislation (P.L. 112-55) appropriating $400 million in supplemental CDBG disaster assistance for disasters occurring in 2011. This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The CDBG program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is the federal government's largest and most widely available source of financial assistance to support state and local government-directed neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities. These formula-based grants are allocated to more than 1,100 entitlement communities (metropolitan cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and urban counties), the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the insular areas of American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Grants are used to implement plans intended to address local housing, neighborhood revitalization, public services, and infrastructure needs, as determined by local officials with citizen input.", "Due to the block grant nature of the program, local and state officials exercise a great deal of discretion in determining which combination of eligible activities (in 25 categories) to undertake when developing their community development plans. Eligible CDBG activities include historic preservation; real property acquisition, demolition, site preparation and disposition; economic development and job creation, including assistance to for-profit entities and establishment of revolving loan funds; housing assistance, including rehabilitation loans and grants; public service activities, including job counseling and employment training; and assistance to not-for-profit entities, including community development corporations and faith-based institutions.", "Any of the eligible activities undertaken by a community must address at least one of the program's following three national objectives:", "principally benefit low and moderate income persons; aid in eliminating or preventing slums or blight; or meet particularly urgent community development needs because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the public.", "It is this third program objective\u2014meeting an urgent threat\u2014that allows CDBG funds to be used to assist in disaster response activities.", "The program's authorizing statute requires each state and entitlement community to allocate 70% of its CDBG funds to activities that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income persons. In response to previous disasters, HUD has waived this provision in order to allow a community to address an urgent threat to the safety of residents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDBG Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The CDBG program has been used frequently by the federal government to respond to natural and manmade catastrophes (for a list of CDBG disaster recovery appropriations see the Appendix ). In general, Congress has provided increased flexibility and allocated additional CDBG funds to affected communities and states to help them respond to and recover from presidentially declared disasters. This includes allowing communities to reprogram CDBG funds to meet disaster-related needs, including short-term disaster relief, mitigation activities, and long-term recovery activities. In assisting communities and states in responding to disasters, HUD may expedite grant awards for affected communities in presidentially declared disaster areas, including allowing affected grantees to move up their CDBG program start dates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Short-Term Disaster Relief", "paragraphs": ["Past disaster relief legislation has allowed CDBG funds to fill gaps in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency relief activities. In general, such legislation prohibited CDBG funds from substituting for FEMA or SBA funding but allowed CDBG funds to be used for activities that are not reimbursable by FEMA or SBA. Typically, CDBG has been used to finance the removal of debris, the provision of extra security patrols, and the emergency restoration of essential services, such as water, sewer, electrical, and telecommunications. For instance, approximately $250 million in CDBG funds were used to finance the emergency temporary restoration of utilities in the affected areas of Lower Manhattan following the destruction of the World Trade Center, and an additional $500 million was made available for permanent utility restoration and infrastructure improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Activities", "paragraphs": ["Mitigation activities are intended to lessen the impact of a disaster, and can range from such physical measures as the construction of levees to protect against flooding to buildings designed to withstand earthquakes.

Mitigation can take place at any time\u2014before a disaster occurs, during an emergency, or after a disaster, during recovery or reconstruction.", "Mitigation activities have involved the use of CDBGs to fund buyouts of real property in areas prone to a recurrence of the event. For instance, following the Midwest floods of 1993, CDBG and Hazard Mitigation Grants from FEMA were used to acquire privately held real property within flood plain areas in the nine affected states and convert the land to public uses, such as recreation, or allow it to return to its natural state. CDBG funds were also used to construct and repair levees in an effort to reduce the area's vulnerability to future flood losses. Following the Midwest floods of 1997, Congress again appropriated CDBG funds to cover buyouts of privately-held land in flood prone areas in the affected states.", "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress appropriated $2 billion under P.L. 107-117 for disaster relief and recovery assistance to New York. The act earmarked at least $500 million for economic losses to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in an effort to mitigate the attack's economic impact. That provision required HUD to implement the program within 45 days after passage of the act. It limited economic loss grants to small businesses located within a designated area to no more than $500,000. In addition, the act earmarked at least $10 million for the tourism and travel industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Recovery Activities", "paragraphs": ["The third set of activities eligible for CDBG assistance is associated with long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts.

The forms of assistance may range from business loans to infrastructure improvements.", "For instance, to assist in the redevelopment of the Lower Manhattan area of New York following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress appropriated $3.5 billion in CDBG funds. Of the $3.5 billion in CDBG funds made available, $1.49 billion has been allocated to recovery assistance including $350 million in business recovery grants (to compensate businesses for lost revenue) and small firm attraction and retention grants (awarding incentives to businesses agreeing to stay in Lower Manhattan). The $1.49 billion also included $280.5 million in residential grant assistance to encourage renters and owners to stay in the area. In exchange for a two-year commitment to stay in the area, renters and owners in designated Lower Manhattan neighborhoods received residential grants that covered up to 30% of their housing costs. In addition, $330 million in CDBG funds were made available to cover some portion of costs incurred by Con Edison and Verizon in restoring utility and telecommunication services to the Lower Manhattan area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Actions by HUD in Support of Disaster Recovery", "paragraphs": ["In addition to providing CDBG funding assistance, Congress has included a number of other provisions in past disaster relief appropriations to facilitate relief and recovery efforts and to ensure accountability.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, the Secretary may suspend all requirements for purposes of assistance under section 106 for that area, except for those related to public notice of funding availability, nondiscrimination, fair housing, labor standards, environmental standards, and requirements that activities benefit persons of low- and moderate-income.", "Congress, on a few occasions, has waived or modified the CDBG program's income targeting provisions, which require grantees to allocate at least 70% of their funds to activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. For instance, in response to the Midwest floods of 1998 and the Florida hurricanes of 2004, Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005, and natural disasters of 2008, the income targeting requirement was lowered to 50%. In response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Congress increased the ceiling on the use of the CDBG funds for public service activities in Los Angeles from 15% to 25%.", "In addition to waivers, affected grantees in presidentially declared disaster areas may request the suspension of certain statutory or regulatory provisions. This may include extension of the deadline for submitting annual performance reports, and changes in the time frame for measuring whether the community met the CDBG program's income-targeting requirement (that 70% of CDBG expenditures benefitted low- and moderate-income persons). Grantees may also seek a suspension or removal of statutory provisions prohibiting the use of CDBG funds for new housing construction or for repair or reconstruction of buildings used for the general conduct of local government.
