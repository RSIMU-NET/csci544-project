As in prior years, the Member pay adjustment prohibition was included in the legislation as introduced, and no separate votes were held on the pay issue.", "Although discussion of Member pay is often associated with appropriations bills, these bills do not contain language funding or increasing Member pay, and a prohibition on the automatic annual Member pay adjust ments could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill.

The House, Senate, and conference reports on legislative branch appropriations bills regularly contain language illustrating the deference of each chamber to the internal practices of the other. If comparing the House and Senate bill totals, or the total provided to the Architect of the Capitol at different stages of consideration, adjustments may be necessary to address any omissions due to this practice."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
