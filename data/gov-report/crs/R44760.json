The state can apply to waive any or all of these requirements, in part or in their entirety.", "To obtain approval for a waiver application, a state must show that the plan it will implement in the absence of the waived provision(s) meets certain requirements. Under current guidance, the state's plan must provide coverage to as many state residents as would be covered absent the waiver and must make available to a comparable number of residents coverage that is both as affordable and as comprehensive as would be absent the waiver.

Part II of S ubtitle D of the ACA : Part II of Subtitle D comprises Sections 1311-1313, which largely include provisions related to the establishment of health insurance exchanges and related activities. Section 1402 of the ACA : This section includes the provision of cost-sharing reductions to eligible individuals who purchase individual market coverage through a health insurance exchange. Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) : This section includes the provision of premium tax credits to eligible individuals who purchase individual market coverage through a health insurance exchange.

Section 5000A of the IRC: This section includes the requirement for individuals to maintain health insurance coverage (often called the individual mandate ).", "Each part noted above is comprised of many provisions, which makes the scope of the provisions that can be waived under a state innovation waiver quite broad. For example, Part I of Subtitle D of the ACA includes provisions that outline requirements for health plans to be certified as QHPs. It defines the essential health benefits (EHB) package that each QHP must offer, places limitations on the enrollee cost sharing that QHPs may impose, and requires that QHPs provide coverage meeting a minimum level of actuarial value.

These requirements are described in Table 1 . The Secretary or Secretaries (as appropriate) may grant a request for a state innovation waiver if a state's application meets the requirements. In making this determination, the Secretaries will \"consider favorably\" any waiver that incorporates some or all of the following principles: provide increased access to affordable private market coverage, encourage sustainable spending growth, foster state innovation, support and empower those in need, and promote consumer-driven health care.", "In guidance, HHS and the Treasury note that their assessment of a state's waiver application considers changes to the state's health care system that are contingent only upon approval of the waiver. Their assessment does not consider policy changes that are dependent on further state action or other federal determinations. For example, the Secretary's or Secretaries' (as appropriate) assessment of a state innovation waiver application would not consider changes to Medicaid or the state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that require approval outside of the state innovation waiver process, and savings accrued as a result of changes to Medicaid or CHIP would not be considered when determining whether the state innovation waiver meets the deficit-neutrality requirement. HHS and the Treasury indicate that this is the case regardless of whether a state's application for a state innovation waiver is submitted alone or in coordination with another waiver application.

Specifically, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally is not able to accommodate any state-specific changes to tax rules. The IRS may be able to accommodate small changes to the administration of federal tax provisions, in particular when such changes overlap with the IRS's current capabilities. For example, waivers that would require the IRS to expand premium tax credit eligibility to individuals with household income under 100% of the federal poverty level may be feasible, because it incorporates a similar special rule that the IRS currently administers.", "States are responsible for funding all changes to IRS administrative processes associated with wavier implementation.

Prior to submitting an application, a state must provide a public notice and comment period and conduct public hearings regarding the state's application.

If a state's application is not complete, the state is to be notified about the missing elements and given an opportunity to submit them.
