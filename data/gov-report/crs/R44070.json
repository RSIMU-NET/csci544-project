THUD programs receive both discretionary and mandatory budget authority; HUD's budget generally accounts for the largest share of discretionary appropriations in the THUD bill, but when mandatory funding is taken into account, DOT's budget is larger than HUD's budget. Mandatory funding typically accounts for around half of the THUD appropriation.", "The FY2015 THUD bill's appropriation totaled $107.3 billion: $53.8 billion in net discretionary funding and $53.5 billion in mandatory funding. The Administration requested net budget authority of $134.7 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for the agencies funded by the THUD bill for FY2016, an increase of $27.4 billion (26%). Most of this increase was for highway, transit, and passenger rail programs in DOT, reflecting the increased funding proposed in the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal.", "The House-passed bill (H.R. 2577) includes net budget authority of $108.7 billion for THUD in FY2016, $55.3 billion in discretionary funding and $53.5 billion in mandatory funding. In total, this is a 1% increase over FY2015 levels (+3% discretionary reduced by smaller offsets, about level mandatory funding). The Administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy for H.R. 2577 criticizing the funding levels and certain provisions in the bill, saying that the President's advisors would recommend that the bill be vetoed. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $109.1 billion in net budget authority and omitted certain provisions that the Administration had objected to, such as limitations on travel to Cuba.", "DOT: The Administration requested a total of $93.7 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding for DOT for FY2016, an increase of roughly $22 billion (31%) over FY2015. The House-passed H.R. 2577 would provide $70.6 billion for DOT, $646 million less than in FY2015. The reductions were primarily to the TIGER grant program (-$400 million), the New Starts transit grant program (-$199 million), and Amtrak capital grants (-$252 million). The Senate-reported bill recommends $71.3 billion, $35 million below the FY2015 level; the major change from FY2015 levels is a proposed cut of 25% ($535 million) to the New Starts transit grant program.", "HUD: The President requested $40.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD for FY2016, $5 billion more than provided in FY2015 ($35.6 billion). The House-passed H.R. 2577 includes $37.7 billion for HUD, $2.1 billion above FY2015. Of that increase, $1.1 billion is attributable to a reduction in savings from offsetting receipts from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The bulk of the remainder of the increase is directed to funding the renewal costs of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. The Senate-reported H.R. 2577 recommends $37.6 billion in net new budget authority, representing $850 million more in appropriations and $1.1 billion to make up for reduced offsets compared to the FY2015 level. Like the House-passed version, it prioritizes funding for Section 8 rental assistance.", "Related Agencies: The Administration requested a total of $351 million for the agencies in Title III (the Related Agencies). This is about $1 million more than they received in FY2015. The House-passed H.R. 2577 would provide $342 million for the related agencies, cutting $8 million from the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. The Senate-reported H.R. 2577 recommends $306 million, the $45 million reduction would come from the Neighborhood Investment Corporation.", "The Senate Committee on Appropriations released a substitute amendment to H.R. 2577 on November 18, 2015; see the \"Recent Developments\" box on page 3 for detail."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) appropriations subcommittees are charged with drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies.

Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in the rail, public transportation, commercial trucking and intercity bus, and maritime industries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees.", "Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill funds HUD. The department's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's funding. Two flexible block grant programs\u2014the HOME Investment Partnership Program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)\u2014help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families.

They include the Access Board, the Federal Maritime Commission, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General (IG), the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (often referred to as NeighborWorks), the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the costs associated with the government conservatorship and regulation of the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Concepts Relevant to THUD Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Most of the programs and activities in the THUD bill are funded through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. This is the amount of new funding allocated each year by the appropriations committees. Appropriations are drawn from the general fund of the Treasury. For some accounts, the appropriations committees provide advance appropriations , or regular appropriations that are not available until the next fiscal year.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters. These funds are sometimes provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014generally in addition to regular annual appropriations. Although emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund, they may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency.", "Most of the Department of Transportation's budget is in the form of contract authority . Contract authority is a form of mandatory budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, in contrast to discretionary budget authority, which is based on resources in the general fund. Contract authority controls spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. When the Appropriations Committee subcommittees are given their 302(b) allocations, those figures include only net discretionary budget authority (nonemergency appropriations, less any offsets and rescissions); contract authority from trust funds is not subject to that limitation. This can lead to confusion when comparing totals, as the total annual discretionary budget authority for THUD is typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of mandatory contract authority.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new nonemergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriations act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees collected by federal agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "THUD Funding Trends", "paragraphs": [" Table 1 shows funding trends for DOT and HUD over the period FY2009-FY2015, omitting emergency funding and other supplemental funding.

Each dollar available to the subcommittees in rescissions and offsets enables the subcommittee to provide funding that does not count against the 302(b) level.
