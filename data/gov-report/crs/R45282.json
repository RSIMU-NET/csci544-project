Additional annual appropriations fund the majority of the costs.

PRIA 1 modified provisions originally enacted in 1988 that authorized the collection and use of maintenance fees to enhance and accelerate a one-time EPA review of pesticide registrations that the agency issued prior to November 1, 1984 (i.e., reregistration). PRIA 1 also authorized the collection and use of registration service fees to defray costs associated with EPA review of applications for registering new pesticide active ingredients and products, adding new uses to existing pesticide registrations, establishing and amending tolerances, and amending pesticide labels.
