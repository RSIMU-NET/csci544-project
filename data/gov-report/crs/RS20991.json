Legislative and office action plans are often used by congressional offices for almost every significant project, from organizing an extensive conference in the district or state to introducing and guiding legislation. A major action plan requires a firm understanding of the project's goal, a research strategy, and a time line for completing the project.", "This report presents some of the factors usually considered in preparing an action plan. The information is provided in three sections. The first provides an overview that lays out summary considerations. The second raises questions to consider in preparing an outline for a project.
