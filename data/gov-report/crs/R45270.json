They may be accompanied by mental health challenges or depression, and can lead to unemployment or otherwise limit the ability of parents to provide for the physical and developmental well-being of their children.", "The current epidemic of opioid abuse has been accompanied by an increase in the number of infants who, having been exposed to drugs in-utero, experience a set of withdrawal symptoms after birth referred to as neo-natal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Separately, the number of children entering foster care, and for whom parental drug abuse is associated with their entry to care, has been growing. During FY2016, nearly 274,000 children entered foster care (up from 251,000 in FY2012). For more than one-third (92,000) of those children, drug abuse by a parent was associated with their removal from the home. Many child welfare administrators believe the increase in children and families in need of services is a consequence of the opioid crisis, and some research shows a statistical relationship between increased drug overdose rates and drug-related hospitalizations, and higher rates of child abuse and neglect reports, substantiated child abuse, and entry to foster care. ", "As of the last day of FY2016, the number of children remaining in foster care had grown to 437,000 (compared to 397,000 on the last day of FY2012). Traditionally, kin caregivers have helped mitigate the strain on child welfare agencies brought on by a drug epidemic by providing care that enables children to remain outside of foster care or to leave care more quickly. At the same time, studies of kin caregivers have shown that they may have limited income, be older, and may have their own service needs (e.g., health care). In the current opioid epidemic, state child welfare agencies are again seeking help from kin caregivers.
