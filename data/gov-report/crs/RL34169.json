The Administration has proposed increasing co-payments for generic pharmaceuticals and formulary drugs to $5 and $15, respectively, along with $22 continuing to be required for non-formulary drugs.

GAO has concluded that increases in beneficiaries' co-payments are unlikely to permit DOD to achieve the extent of savings it has anticipated but \"it is still likely to achieve significant savings.\" The Interim Report of the DOD Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care concluded that \"The portion of costs borne by beneficiaries should be increased to a level below that of the current FEHBP [Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan] or that of generous private-sector plans and should be set at or below the level in effect in 1996.\" Further, the Task Force recommended that \"Increases in cost-sharing should be phased in over three to five years to avoid precipitous changes.\"", "Reference(s): Government Accountability Office, Military Health Care: TRICARE Cost-Sharing Proposals Would Help Offset Increasing Health Care Spending but Projected Savings are Likely Overestimated , GAO-07-647, May 2007; Department of Defense, Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care, Interim Report, May 2007.", "CRS Point of Contact (POC): Dick Best, x[phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "*Treatment of Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Under Federal Procurement of Pharmaceuticals", "paragraphs": ["Background: Pharmaceuticals obtained by DOD are procured under federal pricing rules, but there has been a dispute regarding pharmaceuticals dispensed by the Tricare retail network: DOD has maintained that federal pricing rules apply; the pharmaceutical industry disagrees. Although there had been a provision relating to the issue in the Senate version of the defense authorization bill for FY2007, no language was included in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 109-364 ). The conference report ( H.Rept. 109-702 ) accompanying the final bill stated that \"prescriptions dispensed by the Department of Defense Retail Pharmacy Program qualify for discounted drug prices under [38 USC] Section 8126.\" A court case concerning the issue was returned to a lower court on a procedural issue and has not been pursued.", "Discussion: Both provisions aim at encouraging pharmacies in the Tricare retail network to obtain pharmaceuticals at the same price that is available to Federal agencies, including DOD and the VA. The House version provides flexibility to DOD; the Senate Committee on Armed Services provision makes federal pricing mandatory after October 1, 2007.
