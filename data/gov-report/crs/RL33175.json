Congress, with the MMA, continued the major legalobstacle to importation: the requirement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services firstcertify that imports are safe and offer cost savings to U.S. consumers -- something no Secretary hasbeen willing to do. This report, which will be updated, briefly discusses major differences amongcurrent law and the introduced bills, and presents a side-by-side comparison of their provisions.

Current law and the bills each have different lists of countriesfrom which imports could be imported, and they provide the Secretary with different time framesand criteria for determining whether to permit commercial or personal-use importation. Secretarialreporting requirements vary as do mechanisms to fund the import activities: current law relies onappropriations alone, while the proposed bills each create specific user-fee provisions. The proposedbills also address the regulation of Internet pharmacies. S. 109 / H.R. 328 and S. 334 / H.R. 700 propose links to patent law to influence industrybehavior.
