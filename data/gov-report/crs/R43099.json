To allay the concerns that legalization would go forward without increased enforcement, the first sections of Senate-passed S. 744 would make implementation of certain enforcement provisions pre-conditions (or \"triggers\") for the bill's legalization provisions. These legalization triggers were substantially broadened during the Senate floor debate in an effort to strengthen the bill's enforcement provisions. In addition, as passed by the Senate, S. 744 would authorize $51.8 billion in direct spending (i.e., spending that would go into effect without further congressional action) for certain border security and immigration enforcement expenses, for initial administrative and startup costs related to the bill, and for workforce training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Security", "paragraphs": ["Border security is a core element of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) effort to control unauthorized migration, and S. 744 includes a number of sections designed to better secure the Southern border. DHS would be required to submit to Congress a \"Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy\" and to establish a \"Southern Border Fencing Strategy,\" both within 180 days of enactment, and to begin implementing the Comprehensive Security Strategy immediately upon its submission. As amended during the Senate floor debate, the bill includes a detailed sector-by-sector list of technological assets to be included as minimum requirements in the Comprehensive Security Strategy; and it requires that the Fencing Strategy identify where 700 miles of fencing should be deployed along the Southern border. The bill would direct DHS to hire 3,500 additional CBP officers at ports of entry and, as amended on the Senate floor, would require CBP to deploy 19,200 additional Border Patrol agents to the Southern border. ", "In addition to these increases in border security personnel, equipment, and infrastructure, S. 744 would provide DHS with authority to waive certain restrictions on fencing and border infrastructure; give DHS access to certain federal lands; modify certain immigration-related crimes and increase border prosecutions; and strengthen the existing electronic entry-exit system. Of the direct spending authorized by the bill, about $45 billion would be designated for border enforcement activities, and $500 million would be designated to reimburse air and sea carriers for the collection of electronic exit data.

For certain immigration offenses, the bill would increase civil and misdemeanor penalties for first-time offenses and impose felony penalties when aggravating circumstances exist. The bill would amend INA provisions on unlawful reentry to increase criminal penalties.

CBO further estimates that the number of legal residents would boost direct spending for federal benefit programs and notes that under S. 744 direct spending for enforcement and other purposes also would increase.
