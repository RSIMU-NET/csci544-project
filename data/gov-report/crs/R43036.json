Actual services are typically provided by local entities using a combination of federal and non-federal funds. Specific curricula vary based on the needs and objectives of the local student population.", "In FY2013, approximately $575 million was appropriated for AEFLA. Of this sum, approximately $21 million was set aside for national activities and incentive grants. The remaining $554 million was allocated to the states via formula grants. To receive a federal grant, states are required to provide a match so that non-federal resources account for at least 25% of the total resources dedicated to adult education. Many states contribute well beyond their required match, though there is substantial variation among the states.", "The statute specifies that 82.5% of each state's grant must be subgranted to local providers of educational services.

A plurality of the students (47%) participated in ABE while a smaller share (40%) participated in EL activities. The remaining share of adult education students (13%) participated in ASE activities. Non-federal funds accounted for the majority of spending on these activities.", "The authorization of appropriations for AEFLA expired at the end of FY2003, though the programs it supports have continued to be funded through the annual appropriations process.
