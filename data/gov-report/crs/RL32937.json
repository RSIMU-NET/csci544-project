Also, H.R. 240 provides a more limited amount of federal costsharing for state pass-through and disregard policies than S. 667.", "Both bills revise some CSE enforcement tools and add others; increase funding for theFederal Parent Locator Service (FPLS); increase funding for federal technical assistance to the states;require states to review child support orders of TANF families every three years; require that a reportbe submitted to Congress on undistributed child support collections; and designate Indian tribes andtribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the FPLS. S. 667 increases funding for the CSE access and visitation program; requires states to adopt a laterversion of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) so as to facilitate the collection ofchild support payments in interstate cases; and requires that medical child support be provided byeither or both parents.

While the family receives TANFbenefits, the state is permitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of TANF benefits which has been paid to the family . The 1996 welfarelaw ( P.L. 104-193 ) repealed the $50 required pass through (6) and gave states the choice to decide how much, if any, of the stateshare (some, all, none) of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send thefamily. States also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family. Whilestates have discretion over their share of child support collections, P.L. 104-193 required states topay the federal government the federal government's share of child support collections collected onbehalf of TANF families. This means that the state, and not the federal government, bears the entirecost of any child support passed through to (and disregarded by) families.
