{"id": "R42830", "title": "Video Relay Service: Program Funding and Reform", "released_date": "2018-11-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates a number of disability-related telecommunications services, including video relay service (VRS). VRS allows persons with hearing disabilities, using American Sign Language (ASL), to communicate with voice telephone users through video equipment rather than through typed text. VRS has quickly become a very popular service, as it offers several features not available with the text-based telecommunications relay service (TRS).", "The FCC has adopted various rules to maintain the quality of VRS service. Now VRS providers must answer 80% of all VRS calls within 120 seconds. VRS providers must also offer the service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, in June 2010, the FCC began a comprehensive review of the rates, structure, and practices of the VRS program to minimize waste, fraud, and abuse and update compensation rates that had become inflated above actual cost. Rules in that proceeding were issued in June 2013. The new rules initiated fundamental restructuring of the program to support innovation and competition, drive down ratepayer and provider costs, eliminate incentives for waste, and further protect consumers. In addition, the new rules transition VRS compensation rates toward actual costs over the next four years, initiating a step-by-step transition from existing tiered TRS Fund compensation rates toward a unitary, market-based compensation rate.", "On June 20, 2017, the FCC extended existing (2016-2017) VRS rates on a provisional basis. For VRS providers with more than 500,000 monthly minutes, the per-minute VRS compensation rates are:", "$4.06 for minutes that fall within Tier I (a provider's first 500,000 monthly minutes); $4.06 for minutes that fall within Tier II (a provider's second 500,000 monthly minutes); and $3.49 for minutes that fall within Tier III (a provider's monthly minutes in excess of 1,000,000).", "For VRS providers with 500,000 or fewer monthly minutes, the per-minute VRS compensation rate is $4.82. Based on these compensation rates, the maximum rates within the range of VRS rates proposed by the Commission, projected demand for the services, and projected Fund administration expenses, the FCC adopted a funding requirement of $1,328,188,285, and a carrier contribution factor of 0.02289.", "Congressional interest in the VRS program is twofold: eliminating fraud and abuse in the program and maintaining the usefulness of the program for users. Controversy has arisen over the latest proposals for change to the program being considered by the FCC. The FCC believes that rate structure changes are needed to reduce fraud and better manage the VRS program, but the deaf and hard-of-hearing community is concerned that funding cuts will result in fewer and less-qualified ASL interpreters. Additionally, the FCC has proposed changing the technologies used to operate and use the system, but the community is concerned that changes in technology will decrease the quality of the system as it is now and also potentially pose challenges to some users."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction: How Video Relay Service Works", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates a number of disability-related telecommunications services, including video relay service (VRS). VRS is a form of telecommunications relay service (TRS). The service allows persons with hearing disabilities, using American Sign Language (ASL), to communicate with voice telephone users through video equipment rather than through typed text. Video equipment links the VRS user with a \"communications assistant\" (CA) so that the VRS user and the CA can see and communicate with each other in signed conversation (see Figure 1 ). ", "VRS has quickly become a very popular service. It offers several features not available with the text-based TRS:", "People with hearing disabilities can communicate using ASL rather than typing what they want to say. This allows them to incorporate facial expressions and body language into their conversations, which cannot be done using text. A VRS call is more like a telephone conversation between two hearing persons. For example, the parties can interrupt each other. The parties cannot interrupt each other during a traditional TRS call because the parties have to take turns communicating with the CA. Conversation flows more naturally between the parties, so the conversation may take place more quickly than with TRS. VRS calls may be made between ASL users and hearing persons speaking either English or Spanish.", "VRS is different from other forms of TRS in two important ways: (1) the conversation between the VRS user and the CA is made through a video link and sign language rather than typed text; and (2) the service relies on the Internet, rather than the public telephone system, for the connection between the VRS user and the CA. Also, unlike some other forms of TRS, VRS is not mandatory.

VRS providers must provide their users with a 10-digit telephone number, so users will be able to make 911 calls and have their location data routed to the appropriate emergency agency. Preferential treatment of calls is prohibited. VRS (and TRS) providers must handle calls in the order in which they are received. They cannot selectively answer calls from certain consumers or certain locations.
