For nonwind technologies, the credit expired at the end of 2017, so that only projects that began construction before the end of 2017 qualify for tax credits. After 2016, the PTC for wind remains available, at reduced rates, for wind facilities that begin construction before the end of 2019. Since the PTC is available for the first 10 years of production at a qualified facility, PTCs will continue to be claimed after the PTC's stated expiration date. Whether the PTC should be extended, modified, or allowed to expire as scheduled is an issue Congress may choose to consider.", "Most recently, the PTC for nonwind technologies was retroactively extended for tax year 2017 as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA18; P.L. 115-123). The PTC for wind was last extended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). This legislation had extended the PTC for two years, through 2016, for all eligible technologies. Additionally, the PTC for wind was extended an additional three years, through 2019, but at reduced credit rates for wind facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, or 2019.", "The PTC for wind and closed-loop biomass was first enacted in 1992. When first enacted, the PTC was scheduled to expire on July 1, 1999. Since 1999, the PTC has been extended 11 times. On several occasions, the PTC was allowed to lapse before being retroactively extended. In addition to being extended, the PTC has also been expanded over time to include additional qualifying resources. In 2017, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal technologies qualified for the full credit amount of 2.4 cents per kWh. Other technologies (open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower, marine, and hydrokinetic) qualified for a half-credit amount, or 1.2 cents per kWh in 2017. Wind facilities starting construction in 2017 qualified for 80% of the full credit amount. Credit amounts are adjusted annually for inflation.", "The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that in 2018, foregone revenues (or \"tax expenditures\") for the PTC were $4.8 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, under current law, tax expenditures for the renewable electricity PTC are estimated to be $25.8 billion. Extensions or modification of the PTC could increase or decrease the estimated tax expenditures associated with this provision.", "The PTC has been important to the growth and development of renewable electricity resources, particularly wind. Tax incentives for renewables, however, may not be the most economically efficient way to correct for distortions in energy markets or to deliver federal financial support to the renewable energy sector. Tax subsidies reduce the average cost of electricity, increasing demand for electricity overall, countering energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction objectives. Subsidies delivered as nonrefundable tax incentives often require those wishing to use the credit find \"tax-equity\" partners to provide equity investments in exchange for tax credits. The use of tax equity reduced the amount of the incentive that flows directly to the renewable energy sector.", "There are a number of policy options that might be considered related to the PTC. For example, the PTC could be allowed to expire as scheduled. Alternatively, the PTC could be temporarily extended. The extension could apply only to nonwind technologies. If the PTC is retroactively extended for nonwind technologies, the phaseout that currently applies to wind could be applied to nonwind PTC-eligible technologies. Another option would be to remove the phaseout that applies to wind starting in 2017. Other forms of PTC phaseout have been proposed in recent years, including elimination of the inflation adjustment factor. Another option would be to make the PTC a permanent feature of the tax code."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) expired on January 1, 2018, for nonwind facilities.

The maximum credit amount for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 was 2.3 cents per kWh. The maximum credit amount for 2017 and 2018 is 2.4 cents per kWh. The maximum credit rate, set at 1.5 cents per kWh in statute, is adjusted annually for inflation. Wind (before applying the 2017-2019 phaseout rates), closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy technologies qualify for the maximum credit amount (see Table 1 ). Other technologies, including open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic energy facilities, qualify for a reduced credit amount, where the amount of the credit is reduced by one-half (see Table 1 ).

The credit is reduced by 40% for facilities that begin construction in 2018, and reduced by 60% for facilities that begin construction in 2019. Before 2013, the PTC expiration date was a placed-in-service deadline, meaning that the electricity-producing property had to be ready and available for use before the credit's expiration date.", "The amount that may be claimed for the PTC is set to phase out once the market price of electricity exceeds threshold levels. Since being enacted, market prices of electricity have never exceeded the threshold level and the PTC has not been phased out, nor is the PTC likely to be phased out under current law. ", "In the past, the ability to claim the PTC was also, in some cases, limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). Before 2018, the PTC was available for taxpayers subject to the AMT for the first four years of the credit. While the PTC could not be claimed against the corporate AMT, unused credits could be carried forward to offset future regular tax liability. While few firms were subject to the corporate AMT, this limitation may have been significant for those affected. The corporate AMT was eliminated as part of the 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ).", "From 2009 through 2017, PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) in lieu of the PTC. Property that was placed in service during 2009, 2010, or 2011, or which was placed under construction in one of these years, also had the option of claiming an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits.

Indian coal production facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2009, for coal produced before January 1, 2016, to receive credits. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. Under current law, credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, but with the inflation adjustment the credit was $2.4 in 2017. For refined coal, the base credit amount is $4.375 per ton, and the 2018 credit with the inflation adjustment is $7.307 per ton.

Instead of being able to claim the PTC for the first 10 years of production, these new qualifying resources were limited to a five-year PTC period. Further, open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste facilities had their credit amount reduced by one-half. The AJCA also introduced a PTC for refined coal, with a rate of $4.375 per ton (indexed for inflation after 1992), available for qualifying facilities placed in service before January 1, 2009.", "The PTC was extended twice during the 109 th Congress. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58 ) extended the PTC for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, through 2007. EPACT05 also added two new qualifying resources: hydropower and Indian coal. Hydropower was added as a half-credit qualifying resource. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation.

Provisions enacted in ARRA also allowed PTC-eligible taxpayers to elect to receive a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) in lieu of the PTC. ARRA also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, which allowed PTC- and ITC-eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits.

Over the same five-year period, the estimated revenue losses associated with the production credits for refined coal and Indian coal are $0.1 billion each. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law. A policy that further extends the PTC would increase these tax expenditure estimates.", "Information on PTC claims by corporations is available from the IRS through the 2013 filing year. For 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the PTC (see Table 4 ). Most of the credits claimed were for production of renewable electricity, with only a few claims being made for refined coal, Indian coal, or steel industry fuel. In total, for 2013, taxpayers claimed PTCs of $2.8 billion. Because the PTC is paid out for 10 years, most PTCs awarded in any given year are the result of previous-year investments. Some taxpayers may not be able to use all of their tax credits to offset taxable income in a given tax year. In this case, taxpayers may carry forward unused credits to offset tax liability in a future tax year. In 2010, nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years.", "The IRS data on PTC claims highlight the effect that policy actions taken in response to the economic downturn had on renewable energy tax credit claims. While the number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009, this number decreased after 2009. With the Section 1603 grant option available, fewer taxpayers claimed the PTC. While Section 1603 grants were available in lieu of the PTC, $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that otherwise would have been PTC-eligible. This amount is not directly comparable to the costs of the PTC because Section 1603 grants were a one-time payment, while projects can claim the PTC for 10 years of production. ", "The effect of the economic downturn can also be seen in data on tax credit carry forwards. The amount of PTCs being carried forward more than doubled between 2008 and 2009, then doubled again between 2009 and 2010. During the economic downturn, taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits. Further, weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits.", "Other available estimates provide information on the cost of a long-term PTC extension. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a permanent PTC (or a PTC extended through the budget horizon) for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the wind construction start date through the end of the budget window, beyond 2019, would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027.

Recent extensions of the PTC reflect a belief that the tax incentives contribute to the development of renewable energy infrastructure, which advances environmental and energy policy goals. ", "Research suggests that the PTC has driven investment and contributed to growth in the wind industry. While further extension of the PTC may lead to further investment and growth in wind infrastructure, this potential is limited in the case of short-term extensions. Further, retroactive extensions provide what are often characterized as windfall benefits, rewarding taxpayers that made investments absent tax incentives. ", "While the PTC has contributed to increased use of renewable electricity resources, research on its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. In a 2013 report, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small (0.3%) increase in power-sector emissions. In an evaluation of the renewable energy tax credit extensions enacted in P.L. 114-113 , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that the recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, particularly if natural gas prices are low. ", "A common rationale for government intervention in energy markets is the presence of \"externalities,\" which result in \"market failures.\" Pollution resulting from the production and consumption of energy creates a negative externality, as the costs of pollution are borne by society as a whole, not just energy producers and consumers. Because producers and consumers of polluting energy resources do not bear the full cost of their production (or consumption) choices, too much energy is produced (or consumed), resulting in a market outcome that is economically inefficient. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option for addressing the inefficiencies and market failures in the energy sector. Here, the subsidies approach is not the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective. Subsidies reduce the average cost of energy, encouraging energy consumption, countering energy conservation initiatives, and offsetting emissions reductions. Additionally, tax subsidies do not necessarily provide a comparable incentive for all emissions reduction alternatives, and may favor more costly reductions over less costly ones. Finally, tax subsidies also reduce tax revenues. To the extent that these subsidies are financed by distortionary taxes on other economic activities, they reduce economic efficiency.", "A more direct and economically efficient approach to addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector would be a direct tax on pollution or emissions, such as a carbon tax. This option would generate revenues that could be used to offset other distortionary taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. A carbon tax approach would also be \"technology neutral,\" not requiring Congress to select which technologies to subsidize. ", "Tax incentives are also not the most efficient mechanism for delivering federal financial support directly to renewable energy developers and investors. Stand-alone projects often have limited tax liability. Thus, project developers often seek outside investors to \"monetize\" tax benefits using \"tax-equity\" financing arrangements. The use of tax equity investors, often major financial institutions, reduces the amount of federal financial support for renewable energy that is delivered directly to the renewable energy sector. Tax incentives that reward production, as opposed to investment, are likely to lead to more renewable electricity per dollar of federal subsidy. ", "Another consideration is the interaction of the PTC with other policies designed to support the development of renewable electricity resources. More than half of U.S. states currently have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) policies in place. Subsidies for renewable energy at the federal level, including the PTC, reduce the cost of complying with state-level RPS mandates.

One option is to allow the PTC to expire as scheduled. Under this option, projects that meet specified construction start dates would receive the PTC for the first 10 years of qualified production. ", "Another option would be to provide a temporary extension of the PTC. With this option, the construction start date deadline could be extended by a set number of years. With the enactment of P.L. 114-113 , the expiration date for the PTC for wind is different than the expiration date for the PTC for other technologies. Thus, Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies. The extension could be made retroactive for 2018. If the PTC for nonwind technologies were extended, the phaseout that currently applies to wind could be applied to other technologies. Another alternative would be to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies, and remove the phaseout for wind, such that all PTC-eligible technologies qualified for the PTC at the same rate. ", "In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a form of PTC phaseout as part his tax reform proposal introduced in the 113 th Congress, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1 ). Under this proposal, the PTC inflation adjustment factor would have been eliminated. This would reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh, for all PTC-eligible properties still within the 10-year eligibility window. Thus, facilities that had received a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014, and were still within their 10-year PTC window in 2015, would have seen the value of the PTC fall to 1.5 cents per kWh for 2015 and beyond. Under Chairman Camp's proposal, the PTC would have been fully repealed after 2024. Because the value of the PTC would be reduced for existing facilities, the JCT estimates that this proposal would have raised $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023, relative to current law at the time. A similar proposal was introduced in the 114 th Congress as the PTC Elimination Act ( H.R. 1901 ).", "President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC. Additionally, under President Obama's proposal, the PTC would be made refundable, solar facilities would be added as qualifying property, and the credit would be modified such that renewable electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits. Solar property that currently qualifies for the residential energy efficient property credit would also be eligible for the PTC. Additionally, the investment tax credit (ITC) for renewable energy would be made permanent. In analysis of President Obama's FY2017 budget, the JCT estimated that making permanent the PTC and ITC, along with these other changes, would cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."], "subsections": []}]}}
