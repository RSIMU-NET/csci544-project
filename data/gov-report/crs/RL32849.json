{"id": "RL32849", "title": "Child Welfare Financing: An Issue Overview", "released_date": "2005-04-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["Child welfare programs are designed to protect children from abuse or neglect. Services maybe offered to stabilize and strengthen a child's own home. If this is not a safe option for the child,however, he or she may be placed in foster care while efforts to improve the home are made. Inthose instances where reuniting the child with his or her parents is found to be impossible, a childwelfare agency must seek a new permanent (often adoptive) home for the child.", "In FY2003, the most recent year for which complete data are available, the federalgovernment provided states with some $6.9 billion in funding dedicated to child welfare purposes. Most of this funding is authorized under Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Apartfrom these dedicated federal child welfare funds, however, states also use non-dedicated federalfunds--including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, Medicaid, andthe Social Services Block Grant--to meet child welfare needs. The most recent data available (forstate fiscal year 2002) suggests that states spent at least $4.8 billion in non-dedicated funds for childwelfare purposes. While non-dedicated funding streams have increased resources to child welfareagencies, current legislative and administrative proposals may jeopardize their continued use forchild welfare.", "The way that the federal government distributes dedicated child welfare money to states hasbeen criticized as inflexible, out of sync with federal child welfare policy goals, and antiquated. Because most dedicated federal child welfare funding (about 65% in FY2003) may be used only forfoster care, critics charge that states have inadequate funds to prevent removal of children from theirhomes or to allow children to be reunited with their parents. In addition, a state's ability to claimmost of the dedicated child welfare funds is directly related to the number of foster and adoptivechildren it assists who meet the income, family structure, and other program rules of the nowdefunct Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (as that program existed on July16, 1996).", "Attention to federal child welfare financing has focused almost exclusively on dedicated childwelfare funding streams and is driven in part by the belief that the current structure hampers theability of state child welfare agencies to achieve positive outcomes for children. This assumptionis not easy to prove. However, it is possible to say that the AFDC link, which ties federal fundingin foster care and adoption assistance to increasingly antiquated income standards, over time, willerode the share of program costs for which states may seek federal reimbursement.", "Recent proposals to alter how dedicated federal child welfare funds are distributed included somethat would link eligibility for federally supported foster care and adoption assistance to TANF incomerules and others that would remove income restrictions entirely. The latter proposals, which wouldgreatly expand the number of children for whom the federal government would be committed toproviding support, have typically sought to cap (or block grant) some or all of what is now open-endedfederal funding for foster care and adoption assistance and/or to reduce the share of costs paid for eacheligible child by the federal government.
