{"id": "R45988", "title": "U.S. Natural Gas: Becoming Dominant", "released_date": "2019-10-30T00:00:00", "summary": ["In the beginning of the 21 st century, natural gas prices were increasing and the United States was viewed as a growing natural gas importer. Multiple liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals were built while existing ones were recommissioned and expanded. However, the market conditions also drove domestic producers to innovate. As average U.S. prices peaked in 2008, domestic shale gas production was brought to market. Improvements in technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling made the development of unconventional natural gas resources such as shale and other lower-permeability rock formations economically possible. Improved efficiency has lowered production costs, making shale gas production competitive at almost any price. The large amount of natural gas brought to market enabled large-scale exports from the United States. Of today's total global trade in natural gas, some 35% takes the form of LNG.", "As U.S. natural gas production increased and prices fell, U.S. consumption of natural gas grew. The rise in consumption did not keep pace with production, so companies turned to greater exports of natural gas, first by pipeline to Mexico and then as LNG to other parts of the world. The United States started exporting LNG from the lower-48 states in February 2016. The entrance of the United States as an exporter of LNG has caused significant changes to LNG markets. The U.S. natural gas market is one of the few that does not link the price of natural gas to oil, and this has carried in to LNG contracts. Some buyers view U.S. LNG exports as a hedge against oil prices. U.S. exporters do not require destination clauses, although where U.S. LNG exports end up must be reported to the U.S. Department of Energy. The relatively low price of U.S. natural gas has also helped consumers in other regions negotiate better prices for imports from non-U.S. sources.", "The United States is poised to rise in the export rankings and may have the most LNG export capacity, worldwide, within the next five years. According to projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. natural gas production, consumption, and exports will continue to grow for decades to come, while U.S. prices are projected to stay relatively low. One aspect of EIA projections is a status quo assumption when it comes to technology, laws and regulations, and markets among other things. As the advent of shale gas has shown, changes to the industry happen and may happen in significant ways and quickly.", "Natural gas has been and continues to be a topic of interest for Congress. One hundred bills have been introduced in the 116 th Congress related to different aspects of natural gas. Natural gas may play a bigger or smaller role in the U.S. economy depending, in part, upon congressional actions. Nevertheless, natural gas is an integral part of the U.S. and global energy mix. Knowing the major natural gas producing and exporting nations and how natural gas is transported for export are essential to understanding the sector and how U.S. natural gas fits into the global market."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction: U.S. Natural Gas Sets a High Mark", "paragraphs": ["In 2019, the United States stands atop the international natural gas world. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas (NG) ( Figure 11 ), is the largest consumer of natural gas, has the most natural gas storage capacity, and has the biggest and most expansive pipeline network. Production from shale formations ( Figure 7 ) has transformed the United States from a growing importer of natural gas to an increasing exporter ( Figure 12 ), with some of the lowest prices in the world ( Figure 10 ). The United States is the 4 th largest exporter of natural gas ( Figure 17 ), but its capacity by pipeline and by ship is growing. How the United States transformed its natural gas sector is a story of market competition, technological innovation, and other factors.

U.S. consumption outpaced production that year by more than 1,400 billion cubic feet (BCF) or 7% of consumption, and the United States was viewed as a growing importer of natural gas. Natural gas comprised 24% of the U.S. energy mix in 1998, and that figure remained unchanged in 2008. Canada supplied about 97% of U.S. imports in 1998. Between 1998 and 2008, the difference between U.S. production and consumption averaged 1,764 BCF annually. In 1998, U.S. natural gas consumption was mainly in the industrial sector, but by 2008 natural gas used to generate electricity equaled its use in the industrial sector. During this same time period, average annual U.S. natural gas prices quadrupled, reaching a peak in June, 2008.", "From 1998 to 2008, the United States added to its LNG import capacity by expanding existing facilities and constructing new import terminals. Import capacity in 2008 was almost 4,800 BCF, with an additional 2,000 BCF added later. There were also more than 20 additional import projects at various stages of development, most of which were never built because the market did not need additional import capacity as the United States moved toward being an exporter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shale Gas: Technological Breakthroughs", "paragraphs": ["In the mid-2000s, as LNG import terminals were capturing headlines in the U.S. effort to meet growing demand, some small and mid-size production companies were trying to figure out how to produce the massive resources of natural gas that were trapped in shale formations. Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and improved directional drilling capability were the keys to unlocking these resources.", "During this time, there were wide swings in U.S. daily natural gas prices as market conditions changed, sometimes quickly. Nevertheless, prices trended upward until the loss of economic activity from the Great Recession decreased demand. As prices rose, interest in developing shale gas grew.", "Shale gas started to come to market near the end of 2008 concurrent with the start of the Great Recession. The increased supply of natural gas, together with reduced demand, caused prices globally to plummet ( Figure 10 ). New production in the northeast, especially in Pennsylvania, began to grow rapidly.

In 2011, U.S. production started to outpace consumption and the interest in exporting U.S. natural gas took hold. During this period, natural gas became more incorporated in the nation's energy mix, especially in the electrical sector.", "As U.S. prices fell, the world took note. In 2010, Cheniere Energy became the first U.S. company to apply for a permit to export U.S. natural gas from the lower-48 states from its Sabine Pass facility (which was originally an import terminal), transporting it as LNG.

Liquefaction of natural gas is achieved by cooling the gas to -260\" F. At this temperature, the natural gas becomes a liquid and occupies only 1/600 th of its gaseous volume making it economical to send by ship.", "U.S. companies were looking to exports of natural gas for additional demand and a way to access higher world prices. As the global economy improved, natural gas prices outside the United States began to climb, which increased the number of companies looking to export U.S. natural gas.", "By the end of 2009, the United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest producer of natural gas.

However, in the first half of 2019, China's imports of U.S. LNG declined by 83% over the same time period in 2018, in part because of the trade dispute between the countries. Thirty-six countries have imported U.S. LNG since 2016.

Meanwhile, there has been no corresponding rise in U.S. natural gas prices due to increased exports.", "Since February 2016, there has been about, on average, a $1.74 price differential between U.S. spot prices and U.S. LNG export prices. In addition to the price of U.S. spot natural gas, the current price at which natural gas can be bought or sold, importers take into account the cost of liquefying the natural gas, transporting it, regasifying it, and moving it to consumers. Natural gas is expensive to liquefy and transport and requires sophisticated technology.", "Even though the United States is the largest producer of natural gas in the world, it is not the largest exporter. Russia, mainly through its pipeline exports to Europe, remains the largest overall exporter of natural gas. Qatar was the largest exporter of LNG in 2018, but Australia is projected to surpass it in 2019.", "Whereas the United States was the target market for LNG exporters in 2008, it is now a net exporter of natural gas and has seen its imports diminish by 27% since 2008. Industry analysts expect U.S. exports to rise significantly over the next few years. LNG now accounts for 35% of global natural gas trade.", "Energy issues have been a perennial topic of interest to Congress.
