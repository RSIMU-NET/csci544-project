{"id": "RS22490", "title": "TANF: A Guide to the New Definitions of What Counts as Work Participation", "released_date": "2006-08-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171) included changes to work participation standards under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant that seek to increase the share of the cash welfare caseload engaged in work or job preparation activities. The law also required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue regulations defining TANF work activities to ensure a consistent measurement of work activity across states. Highlights of the regulations (published June 29, 2006) include requiring all activities to be supervised (many on a daily basis); disallowing four-year or advanced college degrees to count as vocational educational training; and explicitly allowing treatment for the removal of certain barriers to employment, such as substance abuse and mental or physical disability to count toward the participation standards, though for a limited period each year as a \"job readiness\" activity. It also allows \"supported employment\" for individuals with disabilities to count. Additionally, the definition of job skills training directly related to employment appears to allow a wide range of training and educational activities. This report will be updated as warranted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["TANF law lists 12 categories of work activities that recipients of assistance may engage in and be counted toward its work participation standards.
