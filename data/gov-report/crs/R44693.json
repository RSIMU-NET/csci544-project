Subsequently, Congress added new categories of leave that allow eligible employees to address certain military exigencies stemming from the deployment of a close family member to a foreign country and to care for a servicemember with a serious injury or illness who is a close family member. The act has also been amended to expand access to certain legislative branch employees and to clarify eligibility criteria for airline flight crew.

Broader application of existing FMLA-qualifying uses of leave. Five bills proposed to expand employee's options for using the current set of FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by either broadening the set of relationships for which an employee may use family leave (S. 473, H.R. 5519, H.R. 5701) or amending definitions referenced in the descriptions of the current entitlement (S. 473, H.R. 5519, and H.R. 5701 sought to amend the definition of son or daughter to include adult children; and S. 2584/H.R. 4616 proposed amending the definition of serious health condition to reference the recovery from organ donation surgery as a possible condition).
