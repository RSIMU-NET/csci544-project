Data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources. In each department profile, the first of these two tables identifies, as of the end of the 112 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in that department and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. As of January 2013, these pay levels ranged from level I ($199,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for lower-ranked positions.", "The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). ", "The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each appointment action table provides the average days to confirm in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data.", "For a small number of positions within a department, the two tables may contain slightly different titles for the same position. This is a result of the fact that the title used in the nomination the White House submits to the Senate, the title of the position as established by statute, and the title of the position used by the department itself are not always identical. The first table listing incumbents at the end of the 112 th Congress uses data provided by the department itself. The second table listing nomination action within each department relies primarily upon the Senate nominations database of the LIS. This information is based upon the nomination sent to the Senate by the White House.
