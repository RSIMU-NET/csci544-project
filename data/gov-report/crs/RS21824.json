{"id": "RS21824", "title": "Student Eligibility: Drug Convictions and Federal Financial Aid", "released_date": "2007-10-10T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Higher Education Amendments (HEA) of 1998 added a provision to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, to suspend eligibility for federal student assistance (grants, loans, or work assistance under Title IV of the HEA) for any student who is convicted of a state or federal offense for the sale or possession of a controlled substance. This provision was amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) to apply only to students who were convicted for the sale or possession of a controlled substance that occurred while the student was enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV student aid. DRA did not change the criteria pertaining to the period of ineligibility due to a conviction for the sale or possession of a controlled substance. It remains that the period of ineligibility is determined by the recency of the conviction, the number of prior convictions, and whether the conviction was for selling or possessing a controlled substance. A student is considered indefinitely ineligible after the third conviction for possession and after the second conviction for selling a controlled substance. Participation in an eligible rehabilitation program enables a student to reestablish eligibility. This report includes a description of the drug conviction provision and a brief discussion of selected reauthorization issues. This report will be updated as warranted by major legislative or other relevant developments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Higher Education Amendments (HEA) of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ) added a provision, Section 484(r), to the Higher Education Act of 1965 to suspend eligibility for federal student aid (grants, loans or work assistance under Title IV of the HEA) to students who were convicted for the sale or possession of a controlled substance. Although the provision was not scheduled to go into effect until two years after the reauthorization, debate regarding the implementation of the provision immediately ensued. Many policymakers questioned the appropriateness of denying financial assistance to individuals who had already been convicted of a crime and paid their debt to society. Other policymakers questioned the Department of Education's (ED) interpretation of the bill's language and their subsequent implementation of the policy. The debate has continued since the last reauthorization of the HEA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Campus crimes, including the sale and use of illegal drugs, were among the topics discussed during the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments. During the discussion, studies were introduced that illustrated that, although campus crime rates in general were decreasing, the number of drug-related incidents on campuses was increasing. In various reauthorization hearings and in committee reports, Congress expressed concern about the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents occurring on college campuses. During the reauthorization discussions, Representative Souder stated that the country was facing an epidemic of drug abuse, and proposed the provision on student eligibility as an \"important first step\" in dealing with this epidemic. Congress ultimately added the provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial assistance for those who were convicted of drug-related crimes, as a part of P.L. 105-244 ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["The legislation specifies that any student who is convicted of a state or federal offense for the sale or possession of a controlled substance shall not be eligible to receive any federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends upon whether the conviction was for the sale or possession of a controlled substance, the recency of the conviction, and the number of prior convictions. A student becomes indefinitely ineligible if he/she has more than two convictions for possession or more than one conviction for selling a controlled substance. Once a student is deemed indefinitely ineligible, the student must successfully complete an approved drug rehabilitation program (to be further discussed later), or the conviction must be removed from the student's record, in order for the student's eligibility to be reinstated. The period of ineligibility begins on the date of such charge and ends after the interval noted in the following:", "Possession of a controlled substance \u00e2\u0080\u0094ineligibility period for the first, second, and third offense is", "First offense: one year from the date of the conviction; Second offense: two years from the date of the conviction; Third offense: indefinite.", "Sale of a controlled substance \u00e2\u0080\u0094ineligibility period for the first and second offense is", "First offense: two years from the date of the conviction; Second offense: indefinite.", "According to the 2006-2007 Federal Student Aid Handbook (Volume 1, Student Eligibility), any convictions that occurred prior to the student turning 18, unless the student was tried as an adult, or any convictions that were overturned, reversed, or otherwise removed from the student's record are not used in determining eligibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rehabilitation", "paragraphs": ["A student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete a drug rehabilitation program in order to reacquire eligibility.

For example, if a student has been convicted three times for possession of a controlled substance, participation in a rehabilitation program reduces the ineligibility period to the equivalent of two convictions (e.g., two years from the date of the most recent remaining conviction). A person can participate in a rehabilitation program for any of the convictions, not just those resulting in indefinite ineligibility. In addition, future convictions will make the student ineligible again.

Many policymakers expressed concern about the growing number of drug-related crimes that were reported each year by institutions across the country. Largely in response to this increasing problem, Congress included this provision for eligibility. However, critics assert that drugs are unfairly being singled out. Representative Frank is reported to contend that singling out drugs as the only crime for which a student can lose financial aid eligibility treats drug convictions more harshly than rape, arson or armed robbery. Supporters maintain that robbery, rape and arson are less likely to occur on a college campus than drug-related crimes, thus justifying the focus on drug-related crimes.", "The implications of limiting the loss of financial aid eligibility to students convicted of drug-related crimes might be considered during reauthorization.
