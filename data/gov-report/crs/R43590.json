Source s may vary in their totals due to differences in how federal workforce statistics are compiled. Some sources rely on \"head counts\" of employees (OPM), some on total hours worked (such as the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]), some on surveys of employing agencies, and others on self-identification by workers surveyed in their homes.

Some may also account for temporary or seasonal employees (such as those employed by the U.S. Census) depending on the time of year the statistics are generated.", "This report focuses on differences in methodologies, including exclusions, and the frequency of data collection employed by OMB and OPM to determine the size and scope of the federal workforce.

For example, an agency reporting 10 FTEs could conceivably report 20 \"on-board\" employees, depending on employees' work schedules.", "In addition, the \"on-board\" headcount may result in wide variances in employment numbers, depending on the specific date the employees are counted. For example, the Census Bureau hires 7,000 Census enumerators every 10 years. The federal on-board employees count is likely to be larger during the duration of their employment.
