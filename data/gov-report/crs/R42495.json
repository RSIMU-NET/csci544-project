{"id": "R42495", "title": "The STOCK Act, Insider Trading, and Public Financial Reporting by Federal Officials", "released_date": "2013-04-18T00:00:00", "summary": ["The STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012) was signed into law on April 4, 2012. It affirms and makes explicit the fact that there is no exemption from the \"insider trading\" laws and regulations for Members of Congress, congressional employees, or any federal officials. The law also expressly affirms that all federal officials have a \"duty\" of trust and confidentiality with respect to nonpublic, material information which they may receive in the course of their official duties, and a duty not to use such information to make a private profit.", "The STOCK Act, as part of the law's regulation of securities transactions by public officials, now requires expedited, periodic public disclosure of covered \"financial transactions\" by all officials in the executive and legislative branches of the federal government who are covered by the public reporting provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended. The act thus works to require not only annual public reporting of such transactions (which reporting has been required since 1978), but also now requires public reporting within 30 days of receipt of a notice of a covered financial transaction (but in no event more than 45 days after such transaction). These periodic reports are filed with reference to any financial transactions of $1,000 or more in securities, but are not required for transactions in mutual funds or income-producing real property.", "The act as originally adopted had required all public financial disclosure statements filed under the Ethics in Government Act in the legislative and executive branches to eventually be made in electronic form, and to be posted on the Internet where they may be publicly searched, sorted, and, if a log-in protocol is followed, downloaded from official government websites. Because of safety concerns, privacy threats, and the possibility of malicious use of such data, federal executives and employees complained about the Internet posting of their detailed financial information, and filed suit to stop the requirement to post such information on the Internet. Congress responded by amending the Stock Act to delay the Internet posting requirements of the public personal financial disclosure reports until a study could be made on the potential impact of having such personal financial information available on the Internet. Legislation (S. 716, 113th Congress) was signed into law on April 15, 2013 (P.L. 113-7, 127 Stat. 438) which permanently rescinds the requirement for Internet posting for most covered employees in the legislative and executive branches of the United States Government. However, the requirement for Internet posting of the financial disclosure reports and all financial information filed by Members of Congress, the President and Vice President, candidates for Congress, and federal officials appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate in positions on the Executive Schedule at Levels I (cabinet level) and II, remains in effect, and such information and reports are still required to be posted on the Internet."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["On April 4, 2012, the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012) was signed into law. The act clarifies and confirms that the \"insider trading\" rules apply to all government officials, including Members of Congress, and provides for more transparency and access to the reports on the personal financial information, assets, and transactions of federal officers and employees.", "The STOCK Act has, in summary, four major features: ", "First, the law reaffirms the fact that the existing \"insider trading\" provisions of securities law and regulations do not contain any exemption or exclusion for Members of Congress, congressional staff, or other federal officials. Furthermore, the law makes explicit the duty of confidentiality and trust that all public employees have concerning material, nonpublic information that comes to them by virtue of their federal employment. Secondly, the law requires the establishment of an electronic filing system for certain financial disclosure reports that must be filed by legislative and executive branch officials under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, and requires that the public reports of personal financial information filed by Members of and candidates to Congress, the President, the Vice President, and presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed officials at levels I (cabinet positions) and level II of the Executive Schedule are to be available to be publicly accessed on the Internet in a searchable and sortable format. Thirdly, the law requires public reporting within 30 days after receiving a report concerning, but no later than 45 days after, a covered financial transaction in income-producing property (such as the purchase or sale of stocks or bonds) by all legislative and executive branch personnel who are required to file the annual public financial disclosure reports under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Finally, the law expands the list of crimes, conviction of which would result in a Member of Congress losing all of his or her creditable service as a Member for congressional pension purposes, and broadens the time period when such conviction would apply to federal pension forfeiture. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Insider Trading", "paragraphs": ["The provisions of the new law expressly affirm that there exists no exemption for Members of Congress, congressional employees, or for other federal officers or employees from the \"insider trading\" prohibitions in federal securities law and regulation. It should be emphasized that there never was any exemption or exception from the \"insider trading\" provisions of securities law for Members of Congress, congressional staff, or for other federal employees, and such persons were subject to the insider trading restrictions in the same manner as members of the general public. However, certain media reports and allegations created the public impression that Members of Congress and staff were actually exempt or had \"excepted themselves\" from the insider trading provisions. This legislation addressed that perception.", "In addition to affirming that the insider trading restrictions of securities law and regulation apply to Members of Congress and to other federal officials, the STOCK Act further affirms expressly that each officer and employee of the legislative branch, each executive branch official, and each judicial officer and employee owes a duty of trust and confidence to the United States and the citizens of the United States with respect to material, nonpublic information derived from such person's public employment.", "The STOCK Act directs the ethics entities in the House and Senate\u2014the House Ethics Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics\u2014to issue interpretations of chamber rules \"clarifying\" that Members and staff are prohibited from using nonpublic information derived from their positions \"as a means for making a private profit.\" Although such explicit regulations already exist in the executive branch, the legislation directs that the Office of Government Ethics issue such interpretive guidance, and that the Judicial Conference of the United States issue such guidance to federal judges and to judicial employees.", "From the inclusiveness of the language of the legislation, and from previous guidance, it would appear that the restrictions on the use of nonpublic, material information extends not only to trading directly by the Member of Congress or by staff on such information, but would extend also to passing on such material, nonpublic information to another so that such other person may make a private profit for himself or herself, or for the public official."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commodity Exchange Act", "paragraphs": ["The STOCK Act expressly includes Members and employees of Congress within those employees or agents of the federal government, including all executive branch and judicial branch officers and employees, who are prohibited from using nonpublic information, imparting such nonpublic information, or stealing or converting nonpublic information to purchase or sell commodities, commodities futures, or options, for personal gain.

Those employees compensated at the rate of pay described above are required to file detailed public financial disclosure statements by May 15 of the following year if the individual works for the government for more than 60 days in the calendar year.

This requirement applies generally to the purchase or sale of such assets as stocks, bonds, commodity futures, or other securities, as well as the purchase or sale of real property which is income producing (such as rental property).", "The STOCK Act requires, as of July 3, 2012, the public reporting of covered transactions exceeding $1,000 in many of these income-producing assets to be made within 30 days of receiving notice of the transaction, but not later than 45 days after the transaction, from all federal officers and employees in the legislative and executive branches who are required to file public financial disclosure reports under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended. This requirement for more prompt public reporting of financial transactions will not apply to a widely held investment fund, such as mutual funds, if the fund is publicly traded, the assets are widely diversified, and the reporting individual neither exercises nor is allowed to exercise control over the financial interests of the fund. Furthermore, the periodic transaction reports generally apply only to transactions in securities, and do not apply to transactions in things such as real property. Such transactions in income producing real property, or in such holdings as mutual funds, must still, however, be reported on the annual financial disclosure reports of the official. In clarifications adopted as an amendment to the STOCK Act in August of 2012, it is now clear that reporting individuals who are required to file periodic transaction reports must file such reports with respect to covered transactions by the official's spouse or dependent children, except in very limited and unusual circumstances.", "Although the requirement for Internet posting of the periodic financial transaction forms filed by most federal officials will be rescinded in legislation recently passed by Congress, the underlying requirement to report such transactions to the proper, relevant ethics office within 30 days of receiving notice of the transaction, but not later than 45 days after the transaction, remains in force and continues to be required by all covered officials\u2014that is, for all public filers\u2014in the legislative and executive branches of government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internet Posting of Disclosure Reports; Electronic Reporting", "paragraphs": ["The STOCK Act as originally adopted had required the posting on the respective official websites of the House and Senate the annual financial disclosure reports, as well as the new prompt reporting disclosures of financial transactions, made in 2012 by Members, officers of the House or Senate, candidates to Congress, and employees of the entire legislative branch who are required to file public financial disclosure reports under the Ethics in Government Act. Similarly, the public disclosure reports made in 2012 by officers and employees of the entire executive branch under the Ethics in Government Act (including the periodic transactions reports) had been required under the original provisions of the STOCK Act to be posted on the official websites of the respective executive branch agencies. In subsequent reporting years, these reports were to be posted on the publicly accessible websites no later than 30 days after filing.", "With regard to such Internet postings of the detailed financial information of nearly 30,000 federal employees in the executive and legislative branches of government, concerns were expressed by federal employees, officials, and employee associations over increasing the opportunities and potential for identity theft, the increased prevalence of \"data mining\" on the Internet for malicious purposes, and concerns over the safety of federal workers and their families, particularly those who serve abroad. Additionally, a group of federal executive employees filed suit against the provision in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Maryland. In that case, on March 27, 2013, the court denied in part the government's motion to dismiss the suit, and strongly indicated its view that forced publication of employees' financial reports on the Internet, in light of new technologies and communications, might violate a constitutional \"right to informational privacy\" of federal employees. Although the Supreme Court and courts in other federal circuits have not necessarily recognized an expanded personal \"privacy\" right under the Constitution to this extent, the District Court in Maryland indicated that such interests were protected under precedents in the Fourth Circuit.", "In response to such concerns and judicial actions, Congress had delayed the implementation of the requirement for Internet posting of personal financial data for most federal officials until the potential impact of these new Internet disclosures may be studied by the National Academy of Public Administration [NAPA]. Issuing their study on March 28, 2013, the NAPA, in a detailed report, concluded that \"the online posting requirement does little to help detect conflicts of interest and insider trading, but that it can harm federal missions and individual employees.\" The panel thus recommended that \"the online posting requirement be indefinitely suspended while continuing the implementation of all the other provisions of the STOCK Act.\"", "Under the latest amendments to the STOCK Act passed by Congress, the disclosure reports and periodic transactions reports for high level officials\u2014the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, candidates to Congress, and Presidential appointed and Senate confirmed officials on the Executive Schedule I (cabinet level) and Executive Schedule II\u2014continue to be required to be posted on the Internet.
