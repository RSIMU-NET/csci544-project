A few scholars have also examined how Members typically spend their office allowances, analyzing spending within broader theories of representation.

For example, Senators have been reimbursed for trips to their states, as well as funds for staffing assistance and maintaining home state offices.

The current consolidated SOPOEA system was established in 1987 and effective January 1, 1988. It followed efforts during the previous decade to move to a system of increased flexibility for Senators in directing their individual office operations. The report from the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration accompanying the bill establishing the SOPOEA ( S. 1574 ) stated that the move \"would allow Members to set their own priorities and react accordingly.\"", "Periodically, legislation has been introduced to amend the SOPOEA. The legislation has sought to regulate, prohibit, authorize, reduce, or encourage the use of funds for a particular purpose or to alter the SOPOEA in response to other action; increase transparency; or govern the use of unexpended balances. With few exceptions, however, no further action has been taken on these bills, and revisions to the SOPOEA generally have been made through the appropriations acts or internal procedures.", "The annual reports issued by the Senate Appropriations Committee accompanying the legislative branch appropriations bill generally provide preliminary SOPOEA allocation information for the upcoming fiscal year in a table arranged by state. The reports also generally indicate the total amount of agency contributions anticipated by the request; any amounts provided to cover \"additional expenses that may be incurred in the event of the death or resignation of a Senator\"; and the number of individuals employed by this account. The legislative branch appropriations acts have also periodically adjusted limits on \"the aggregate of gross compensation paid employees in the office of a Senator,\" which is based on population of the state.", "The SOPOEA allocation for each Senator is calculated based on three components: ", "administrative and clerical assistance allowance . This allowance has been based on state population since 1940, with the current system dating to 1967. Today, 25 population categories exist, ranging from populations below 5 million to over 28 million. The preliminary figures in the FY2016 Senate report ( S.Rept. 114-64 ) show this allowance varies from $2,409,294 for a Senator representing a state with a population under 5 million to $3,829,063 for a Senator representing a state with a population of 28 million or more. legislative assistance allowance . This allowance was first authorized in 1975 and revised in 1977. It was designed to provide Senators with support for their committee assignments, and it was established after lengthy hearings and debates regarding the level and division of Senate staffing resources devoted to committee work. The allowance is calculated based on salaries for three employees at a set rate, and it is the same for all Senators. According to the FY2016 Senate report ( S.Rept. 114-64 ), the legislative assistance component of the SOPOEA is $477,874. official office expense allowance , which varies by state depending on the distance between Washington, DC, and the home state, the population of the state, and the official (franked) mail allocation. According to S.Rept. 114-64 , the FY2016 office expense allowance component ranges from $121,120 to $453,274. ", "The three components result in a single SOPOEA authorization for each Senator that can be used to pay for any type of official expense. Each Senator can choose how much to allocate to various types of expenses (e.g., travel or personnel or supplies), although additional limits pertain to spending on franked mail. Each Senator may also determine the number, job title, location, and duties of staff within his or her office. ", "The SOPOEA allocation formula results in varying levels depending on the state from which a Senator is elected. Both Senators from a state receive the same allocation. Figure 1 demonstrates the variation in authorization levels that has resulted from the SOPOEA allocation formula from FY1996 through FY2016. For FY2016, SOPOEA levels range from $3,008,288 to $4,760,211. The difference between the median level ($3,064,818) and the average ($3,263,940) for FY2016 demonstrates the cluster of similar allocation levels for many states, with a larger differential for some of the larger states. Overall funding for the SOPOEA, described below, has decreased or remained flat in recent years, and the FY2016 maximum, minimum, average, and median allocation levels all remain below the corresponding FY2010 allocation levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SOPOEA Appropriations: History", "paragraphs": ["The SOPOEA for all Senators is funded in one line-item within the \"Contingent Expenses of the Senate\" account in the annual legislative branch appropriations bills.
