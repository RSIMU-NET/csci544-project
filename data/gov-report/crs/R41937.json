S. 847 in the 112th Congress legislation would amend core provisions of TSCA Title I. This report compares key provisions of S. 847, as introduced, with current law (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.).", "Generally, S. 847 would increase the amount of information about chemical toxicity and usage that chemical manufacturers and processors would be required to submit to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and would facilitate EPA regulation of toxic chemicals. The bill directs EPA to establish, by rule, varied or tiered minimum data set requirements for different chemical substances or categories of substances. Data would be required from chemical manufacturers and processors for all chemicals within five years of the date of enactment of S. 847, earlier for high-priority chemicals. All chemicals already in commerce are to be placed on a list and prioritized by EPA into three groups based on the need for risk management. A chemical must be included in the highest priority class if it \"is, or is degraded and metabolized into, a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substance with the potential for widespread exposure to humans or other organisms.\" EPA is required to determine whether chemicals in the top two priority classes, as well as all new chemicals, meet a stringent new safety standard, given the imposition of any needed restrictions on manufacture, processing, distribution, use, or disposal. The bill would prohibit any activities with respect to an evaluated chemical substance that the EPA had not specifically allowed in the safety standard determination.", "In contrast, current law authorizes data collection from manufacturers only if exposure is expected to be substantial or if EPA determines that a chemical may pose an unreasonable risk. TSCA as currently written allows all chemicals to enter and remain in commerce unless EPA can show that a chemical poses \"an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.\" EPA then must regulate to control unreasonable risk, but only to the extent necessary using the \"least burdensome\" means of available control. This TSCA standard has been interpreted to require cost-benefit balancing.", "S. 847 also would add new sections to TSCA. Of particular significance is a section authorizing actions that would allow U.S. implementation of three international agreements, which the United States has signed but not yet ratified. Other new sections would provide authority for EPA to support research in so-called \"green\" engineering and chemistry, promote alternatives to toxicity testing on animals, encourage research on children's environmental health, and require biomonitoring of pregnant women and infants. A \"hot spots\" provision would require EPA to identify locations where residents are disproportionately exposed to pollution and to develop strategies for reducing their risks.", "Key provisions of S. 847 are compared with current law in Tables 1 through 6."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq .; TSCA), giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate production and use of industrial chemicals not otherwise regulated in U.S. commerce. Thirty-five years of experience with TSCA implementation and enforcement have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to TSCA's core provisions in Title I. Based on hearing testimony, stakeholders generally agree that TSCA needs to be updated, although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions. Democrats introduced legislation to amend TSCA Title I in the 111 th Congress ( S. 3209 and H.R. 5820 ), but Congress did not vote on either bill. Those previous bills proposed generally similar changes to TSCA that were summarized in CRS Report R41335, Proposed Amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA): Senate and House Bills Compared with Current Law . On April 14, 2011, Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced similar, but not identical, legislation ( S. 847 ) in the 112 th Congress. To date, no other legislation has been introduced that would amend core provisions of TSCA Title I. Therefore, this report compares key provisions of S. 847 , as introduced, with provisions of TSCA Title I (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. ) that would be affected if S. 847 becomes law. These provisions are summarized in Tables 1 through 5.

For example, provisions related to testing would still be in Section 4, requirements for notifying EPA when a new chemical or new use is proposed would still be in Section 5, and regulatory authorities would remain in Section 6. Also unaffected would be changes to TSCA Title I that were enacted during the 110 th Congress, such as a provision that bans exports of elemental mercury. However, S. 847 would amend or delete most of the original Title I provisions and would make substantial additions to current law. Some key changes are summarized below.

Moreover, an exemption from a prohibition would be allowed for a particular use only if: it were \"in the paramount interest of national security\"; lack of the chemical use \"would cause significant disruption in the national economy\"; the use were essential or critical and there were no safer feasible alternative; or the chemical use, relative to alternatives, provided a benefit to health, the environment, or public safety.

As introduced, the bill includes language that allows EPA to define various distinct forms of substances that are the same in terms of molecular identity but differ in structure and function, such as manufactured nanoscale forms of carbon and silver. The introduced bill also broadens the scope of environmental risks that EPA may manage to include risks found in the indoor environment; currently, TSCA applies only to chemicals in the ambient environment. S. 847 also would appear to more clearly authorize EPA control of risks posed by articles containing a substance.", "The proposed amendments to TSCA would increase public access to information about EPA's decisions, as well as to some information about chemicals that currently is treated as confidential business information. ", "S. 847 would authorize EPA activities not currently authorized under TSCA to allow implementation of three international agreements pertaining to persistent organic pollutants and other hazardous chemicals. For example, the proposal would authorize EPA to regulate chemicals manufactured solely for export. The authority provided by the bill would be specific to three international agreements, rather than more generally authorizing regulatory activity to implement any ratified international agreement concerning chemicals. The bill would prohibit production and use of chemicals when it was inconsistent with U.S. obligations under any of the three international agreements after they had entered into force for the United States.

Current law, TSCA Section 18, generally does not preempt state laws. However, if EPA requires testing of a chemical under section 4, no state may require testing of the same substance for similar purposes. Similarly, if EPA prescribes a rule or order under section 5 or 6, no state or political subdivision may have a requirement for the same substance to protect against the same risk unless the state or local requirement is identical to the federal requirement, is adopted under authority of another federal law, or generally prohibits the use of the substance in the state or political subdivision. TSCA authorizes states and political subdivisions to petition EPA, and authorizes EPA to grant petitions, by rule, to exempt a law in effect in a state or political subdivision under certain circumstances. A petition may be granted if compliance with the requirement would not cause activities involving the substance to be in violation of the EPA requirement, and the state or local requirement provides a significantly higher degree of protection from the risk than the EPA requirement does, but does not \"unduly burden interstate commerce.\" S. 847 would simplify this section of TSCA.
