The chambers act sequentially on vetoed measures: The House acts first on House-originated measures (H.R. and H.J. Res.), and the Senate acts first on Senate-originated measures (S. and S.J. Res.). If the first-acting chamber fails to override the veto, the other chamber cannot consider it. The House typically considers the question of overriding a presidential veto under the hour rule, with time customarily controlled and allocated by the chair and ranking member of the committee with jurisdiction over the bill. The Senate usually considers the question of overriding a veto under the terms of a unanimous consent agreement."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["A ccording to Article 1, Section 7, of the Constitution, when the President chooses not to sign a bill and instead returns it to the chamber that originated it, the chamber shall enter the message of the President detailing the reasons for the veto in its Journal and then \"proceed to reconsider\" the bill. A vetoed bill can become law if two-thirds of the Members voting in each chamber agree, by recorded vote, a quorum being present, to repass the bill and thereby override the veto of the President.", "The chamber that originated the bill sent to the President acts first on the question of its reconsideration. In other words, the House acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"H.R.\" or \"H.J. Res.\" designation, and the Senate acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"S.\" or \"S.J. Res.\" designation. If the chamber of origin votes to repass the bill, then the bill with the veto message is transmitted to the second chamber, which then also reconsiders it.", "Nothing in the Constitution requires that either chamber vote directly on the question of repassing a vetoed bill. The chambers have, for example, referred a vetoed bill to committee instead. If either chamber fails to vote on the question of repassing the bill, then the measure dies at the end of the Congress. Both chambers will not necessarily even have a chance to take up the question. If two-thirds of the Members of the chamber of origin do not agree to override a veto, then the measure dies, and the other chamber does not have an opportunity to vote on the question of repassing the bill.", "The Constitution does not otherwise address how Congress should consider a vetoed bill, and it is therefore House and Senate rules and practices that additionally govern the treatment of bills vetoed and returned by the President."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "House Procedure", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The consideration of a vetoed bill is a matter of high privilege in the House, and the chamber generally votes to override or sustain the veto shortly after the message is received from the President or the Senate.

The chair and ranking member of the committee serve as floor managers of the debate, yielding portions of time to other Members who wish to speak.
