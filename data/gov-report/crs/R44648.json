On election day, voters choose members of the electoral college, which formally selects the President- and Vice President-elect several weeks later (December 19 in 2016).

Although the amendment does not specifically address the issues of disability, disqualification, or resignation during this period, its language, \"failure to qualify,\" could arguably be interpreted to cover such contingencies. Vacancies in the position of Vice President-elect are not mentioned in the 20th Amendment; they would be covered after the inauguration by the 25th Amendment.", "If no person qualifies as President or Vice President by inauguration day, then the Succession Act (3 U.S.C. 19) applies: the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and duly confirmed Cabinet officers, in that order, would act as President.", "Following the events of September 11, 2001, concern about the possibility of terrorist attacks at the inauguration led to proposals to safeguard the line of presidential succession during the swearing-in ceremony, especially during a change of administrations. Most involve a \"designated survivor,\" a constitutionally eligible successor who would stay away from the ceremony in order to safeguard continuity in the office of the President. One option would be for an elected official in the line of succession, such as the Speaker of the House of Representatives or President pro-tempore of the Senate, to be absent from the ceremony. During a change of administrations, a Cabinet secretary of the new administration could be confirmed by the Senate and installed prior to the inauguration, or a Cabinet secretary from the outgoing administration could remain in office until after the inauguration. In either case, the designated survivor would be absent from the ceremony. Related precautions have been taken since the presidential inauguration of 2009. In that year, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, a George W. Bush appointee who remained in office in the Barrack H. Obama Administration, did not attend the inauguration ceremony. In 2013, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki stayed away from the swearing-in."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Presidential succession in the United States is governed by the 25 th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that the Vice President \"shall become President\" should the incumbent chief executive die, resign, or be removed from office.

", "In the event there is neither a President nor a Vice President, the Presidential Succession Act provides that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and duly-confirmed Cabinet officers, in order of the seniority of their departments, would be eligible to act as President.", "These provisions apply at all times when a duly-sworn President or Vice President holds office, but additional factors enter the equation during presidential election years. The three-to-four month period of the presidential general election campaign, from the national party conventions through election day, and the 10-week transition period, from election day to the January 20 inauguration, present a different range of succession issues concerning presidential and vice presidential nominees during the campaign and the President- and Vice President-elect during the transition. This situation is further complicated in elections when an incumbent President who is retiring or who has failed to win reelection prepares to leave office, while the incoming President-elect prepares for inauguration. It should be noted, however, that the period preceding the inauguration of Presidents who have been elected to a second consecutive term does not generally fall under the definition of a presidential transition. For instance, the period between President Barack H. Obama's election to a second term on November 6, 2012, and his inauguration on January 20, 2013, was not a transition period as defined in this report.", "For the purposes of this report, \"presidential election campaign\" refers to the period between the national party nominating conventions, traditionally held in July or August of the election year, and election day, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which falls on November 8 in 2016. In modern times, the transition period is considered to start immediately after the general election, and extends through January 20 of the following year. The first part of the transition period extends from election day through the meeting of the electoral college, which, for the 2016 election, takes place on December 19. During this period, with few exceptions, the winning candidates are known on the basis of the popular vote tally and the projected electoral vote results. They are \"heirs apparent,\" the de facto President- and Vice President-elect. The transition's second phase begins when the electors cast their votes and the electoral vote is announced. At this point, the balance of scholarly opinion holds that the candidates who received a majority of electoral votes actually become the President- and Vice President elect.", "This report examines succession procedures that apply to major party nominees for President and Vice President during the presidential election campaign and the first phase of the transition period, and for President-elect and Vice President-elect during the second phase of the transition period.", "Presidential transitions in the past half-century have generally been characterized by high levels of activity and frequent improvisation as the President-elect's team works to finalize personnel and policy arrangements for the incoming administration within a period of just over 10 weeks. The process takes on further significance and complexity when, as noted previously, a new President replaces a retiring or defeated incumbent, or when political party control of the executive branch also changes.", "Succession and disability procedures concerning the President-elect and Vice President-elect provide a potential complicating factor during the election period and the transition. They are based on a combination of political party rules, federal law, and constitutional provisions, different elements of which apply at different times during the whole period between the national conventions and inauguration of the incoming chief executive.

Sherman, Republican President William H. Taft's running mate, died on October 30, just days before the November 5 general election. The Republican National Committee nominated Columbia University President Nicholas M. Butler to replace Sherman, and all eight Republican electors subsequently voted for Butler. Sherman's death and the ensuing vacancy had no influence on the outcome of the election, and Butler's appointment proved to be noncontroversial because Taft came in last in the three-way presidential election: former President Theodore Roosevelt had quit the Republican Party to run as the candidate of his own Progressive Party, thus splitting the Republican vote.

Further, it is assumed that the electors, who are predominantly party loyalists, would abide by the national party's decisions. Given the unprecedented nature of such a situation, however, confusion, controversy, and a breakdown of party discipline among the members of the electoral college might also arise, leading to fragmentation of the electoral vote. For instance, an individual elector or group of electors might justifiably argue that they were nominated and elected to vote for a particular candidate, that the death or withdrawal of that candidate released them from any prior obligation, and that they were henceforth free agents, able to vote for any candidate they chose. The balance of opinion among constitutional scholars is that presidential electors are free agents, able to vote as they please, notwithstanding pledges or other commitments required by the state parties or state law to support the candidates of the party that nominated them.
