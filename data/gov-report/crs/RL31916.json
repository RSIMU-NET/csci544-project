Thechanges would have affected in a number of titles in the United States Code but primarily in Title5 (Government Organization and Employees), and Title 10 (Armed Forces).

The idea is to provide a \"road map\" that relates each section of theproposal to existing law. Provisions from the Homeland Security Act (HSA) of 2002 specific to theDepartment of Homeland Security are separately listed from the rest of the existing law, and are themost recently enacted changes to Title 5. The Homeland Security Act represents the broadestchanges in the Title in a number of years. HSA provisions that applied government-wide are coveredunder \"Current Law\" (Column 2) of the report. The DOD proposal, if it had been enacted in itsentirety, would have resulted in significantly greater changes in Title 5 than the HSA changes.", "The DOD proposal covered a wide spectrum of current law.
