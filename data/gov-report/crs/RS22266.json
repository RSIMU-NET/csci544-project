The Stafford Act authorizes the use of the military for disaster relief operations at the request of the state governor, but it does not authorize the use of the military to perform law enforcement functions, which is ordinarily prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act. However, the President may invoke other authorities to use federal troops to aid in the execution of the law, including the Insurrection Act.

I, \u00a78, cls. 11-14. These clauses do not expressly limit Congress as to how, when, or where it might employ the armed forces, although presumably such use must be in furtherance of other constitutional powers. Congress is also empowered to provide for calling forth the militia to execute federal law and to suppress insurrections, \u00a78, cl. 15, and to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia and to govern them when they are employed in the service of the United States, \u00a78, cl. 16. Once the army is raised or the militia called forth, the President serves as their Commander-in-Chief, art. II, \u00a72, cl. 1. And of course, the President is vested with the responsibility to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" art. II, \u00a72, cl. 3.

IV, \u00a74. States may not keep their own standing armies, art.

The act does not apply to the National Guard unless it is employed in federal service. Questions arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the PCA is violated (1) when civilian law enforcement officials make \"direct active use\" of military investigators, (2) when the use of the military \"pervades the activities\" of the civilian officials, or (3) when the military is used so as to subject citizens to the exercise of military power that is \"regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Exceptions", "paragraphs": ["Congress has provided for a number of statutory exceptions to the PCA by explicitly vesting law enforcement authority either directly in a military branch (e.g, the Coast Guard) or indirectly by authorizing the President or another government agency to call for assistance in enforcing certain laws."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order (the Insurrection Act)", "paragraphs": ["Congress has delegated authority to the President to call forth the military during an insurrection or civil disturbance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7331-335.

Section 332 delegates Congress's power under the Constitution, art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14, to the President, authorizing him to determine that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States\" and to use the armed forces as he considers necessary to enforce the law or to suppress the rebellion. Section 333 permits the President to use the armed forces to suppress any \"insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\" if law enforcement is hindered within a state, and local law enforcement is unable to protect individuals, or if the unlawful action \"obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\" This section was enacted to implement the Fourteenth Amendment and does not require the request or even the permission of the governor of the affected state.", "The Insurrection Act has been used to send the armed forces to quell civil disturbances a number of times during U.S. history, most recently during the 1992 Los Angeles riots and during Hurricane Hugo in 1989, during which widespread looting was reported in St. Croix, Virgin Islands.

In the event of a disaster that results in the wide-scale deterioration of civil law and order, the authority to employ active duty troops to perform law enforcement functions must be found elsewhere. The Stafford Act does not authorize the use of federal military forces to maintain law and order. Federal forces would have no authority, for example, to act as traffic controllers or provide security for facilities used in the relief efforts, unless such activities serve a valid military purpose. Patrolling in civilian neighborhoods for the purpose of providing security from looting and other activities, would not be permissible, although patrolling for humanitarian relief missions, such as rescue operations and food delivery (which may have the incidental benefit of deterring crime) would not violate the PCA.

The potential exists for a disaster relief situation, under which DOD invokes the immediate response authority, to rapidly deteriorate into a civil disturbance. Law enforcement activities in connection with a civil disturbance are an exception to the PCA. Therefore, DOD would be able to assist civil authorities with both disaster relief and law enforcement, simultaneously, under separate authorities.", "The 1906 San Francisco earthquake is a noted example of a simultaneous natural disaster/civil disturbance.
