An understanding of common irrigation technologies and the impacts of best management practices in irrigation may be useful to Congress concerning potential policy responses to this issue. As a major user of water, the agricultural industry's use of water resources continues to be a focal point of agriculture policy. Additional demands on water supplies, extreme weather events (e.g., prolonged drought), and agricultural market conditions have raised producers' interest in investing in irrigation systems. Increased pressure on the industry to reduce its water use has also drawn interest in the adoption of irrigation technologies and best management practices (BMPs) as a means of achieving efficiency and potential water savings.", "The federal government performs several roles in assisting agricultural producers with irrigation practices, including financial assistance, technical assistance, research, and monitoring and reporting. The majority of financial and technical assistance is offered through voluntary conservation programs that target increased irrigation efficiency. In some cases, improvements in irrigation efficiency can increase water consumption because farmers increase the number of irrigated acres or grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. This raises questions about how and where federal funds are allocated, particularly in areas where water shortages are a concern.", "The use and significance of irrigated agriculture varies widely across the United States. Although policy discussions related to irrigation typically focus on western states\u2014home to roughly 71% of irrigated farms\u2014irrigation is practiced in all 50 states and is growing in the east. Over time, there has been a shift in water resources used for irrigation, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and less on the use of surface water.", "The type of irrigation system used has also shifted over time\u2014from a gravity, or flood-type of irrigation, to potentially more efficient pressurized sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Pressure systems account for between 58 to 65% of irrigation systems used in the United States and include applicators such as center pivot, surface drip, slide roll or wheel move, and micro sprinkler. Gravity flow, which includes furrow, and controlled and uncontrolled flooding, accounts for approximately 35 to 42% of irrigation systems in the United States. Irrigation BMPs center around how water is managed on a farm and includes on-farm conveyance, irrigation scheduling, and application methods. Increasingly, precision technologies (e.g., drones, sensor networks, data analytics, etc.) are becoming a common part of many irrigation systems because of their potential to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.", "The use of irrigation technology and BMPs bring both benefits and costs. The control of water application achieved through irrigation systems can create higher yields and allow the production of higher value crops, while potentially reducing some production costs.

Drought and water shortages affecting farmers' ability to irrigate, however, are not isolated to the western United States. Between 2008 and 2013, irrigation was discontinued on over 470,000 acres of farmland across the United States due to surface and groundwater shortages. Given the increasing demands on water supplies for other users and uses, especially for the urbanizing West, there are pressures for the agricultural industry to reduce its water footprint. At the same time, there are other forces (e.g., markets, policies, and droughts) that are encouraging increased interest in irrigation adoption and efficiency.

Many municipal interests and customers are concerned about irrigation's role in regional water demands and how agricultural water use may affect urban water supplies. These interests would often like to see more judicious use of water in agriculture. Environmental interests are concerned about irrigation's impact on water quality and water source depletion and resulting impacts on aquatic ecosystems and species.

The viability of irrigated farming may be threatened by problems, such as salinization of soils and dependence on nonrenewable water supplies. The quality of irrigation drainage or return flows is sometimes sufficiently impaired as to limit the future reuse of that water for other purposes, including environmental uses. Irrigation systems and management will likely continue to evolve, moving toward advanced technologies that provide better water control. The ability of states, Indian tribes, and individual water users to market water could be central to increasing the flexibility of water allocation, whether for irrigation or nonirrigation uses.", "Agricultural water use and irrigation practices raise a number of policy questions.

Are there other areas of the water supply chain or involving water users (e.g., irrigation districts, municipal, manufacturing, thermoelectric power, etc.) that could provide greater water conservation more economically and/or in greater quantities? How is the efficiency of irrigation BMPs at conserving water measured? Could these efficiencies be incorporated into federal conservation program implementation and funding allocations? Should new and emerging precision technologies, such as data analytics and drones, receive federal assistance similar to the more traditional irrigation BMPs? What level of priority should these technologies receive, and what level of water conservation do they provide? Should conditions be attached to federal funding for irrigation BMPs to limit agricultural consumption of conserved water (e.g., limiting new irrigated land from coming into production when federal funds are used to convert to efficient irrigation systems)? If consumption restrictions were required, what impact would this have on irrigation BMP adoption? What impact would this have on voluntary federal conservation program participation? What would the conserved water be used for, and who controls it? If the conserved water is diverted to another consumptive purpose (e.g., urban use), is it truly \"conserved?\"", "This report primarily addresses two U.S. on-farm irrigation topics: (1) the adoption of irrigation technologies and best management practices and (2) water use associated with irrigation.

Although irrigation is the second-largest source of water withdrawals in the United States behind thermoelectric power, irrigation withdrawals have decreased by 23% since their peak in 1980. From 2005 to 2010, irrigation withdrawals dropped 9% nationally. It is unclear, however, whether this decline in withdrawals has led to a decline in water consumption.

This is determined by several factors, including irrigation system performance, uniformity of water application, and crop response to irrigation. One factor to consider in determining irrigation efficiency is the rate of evapotranspiration. Climate conditions, like length of sunlight hours, intensity of sunlight, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and canopy development, influence evapotranspiration rates, which determine the crop water requirement. Another determinant of irrigation efficiency is the water conveyance system. Irrigation canals that are not well constructed or maintained can lead to conveyance losses of up to 50%. ", "Efficient irrigation systems are often thought of as allowing the same level of crop production as less efficient systems while leaving additional water in the hydrological system for further use downstream. Studies have shown, however, that in some cases efficient irrigation systems may lead to greater water consumption. In a study of irrigation subsidies, researchers found that increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin would increase water consumption and crop yield while also increasing acreage irrigated. While some case studies support this, it remains unclear if expanded irrigation resulting from water conservation occurs nationwide and to what extent. ", "Microirrigation may be more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation typically consumes less water than microirrigation. This is because the majority of water that is not lost to evapotranspiration through gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation. This means that water that is not taken in by plants through evapotranspiration could potentially be put to subsequent beneficial use. Additionally, even if measures are taken to limit increased water consumption (e.g., limiting additional irrigated crop acreage after conversion to efficient irrigation systems), efficient irrigation technologies may encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops.
