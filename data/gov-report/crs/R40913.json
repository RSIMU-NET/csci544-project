{"id": "R40913", "title": "Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Incentives: A Summary of Federal Programs", "released_date": "2018-07-11T00:00:00", "summary": ["Energy is crucial to the operation of a modern industrial and services economy. Concerns about the availability and cost of energy and about environmental impacts of fossil energy use have led to the establishment of a wide variety of federal incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. These incentives are aimed at the implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and the development and commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.", "Many of the existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have authorizations tracing back to the 1970s. Many of the programs have been reauthorized and redesigned repeatedly to meet changing economic factors. The programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia, and from state and local governments to rural communities.", "Since 2005, Congress has enacted several major energy laws: the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005; P.L. 109-58); the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140); the Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA), enacted as Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343); and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5). Each of those laws established, expanded, or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) operate several programs. A few programs can also be found among the Departments of the Interior (DOI), Labor (DOL), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Small Business Administration (SBA).", "This report describes federal programs that provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy. For each program, the report provides the administering agency, authorizing statute(s), annual funding, and the program expiration date. The appendixes provide summary information in a tabular format and also list recently expired programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States has an abundance of natural resources. For much of the nation's history, energy availability was not a concern as commerce and industry needs could be met by domestic supplies. However, industrialization and population growth, and the continuing development of a consumer-oriented society, led to growing dependence on foreign sources of energy during the 20 th century to supplement the demands of a growing economy.", "Recognition of the implications of dependence on foreign sources of energy, coupled with concerns over the volatility of prices driven by fluctuations in supply spurred by world events, prompted federal efforts to increase U.S. energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. A major result has been the establishment of a number of programs focused on energy efficiency and conservation of domestic resources and on research programs that target the development of renewable sources of energy. Many of these programs have roots going back almost 40 years and have been redesigned many times over that period.", "Many of the current programs have been reauthorized and redesigned periodically to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. The programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia, and from state and local governments to rural communities. Each program has been designed to meet current needs as well as future anticipated challenges.", "Since 2005, Congress has enacted several major energy laws: the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005; P.L. 109-58 ); the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ); the Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA), enacted as Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ); and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ).

The programs are grouped by administering agency with references to applicable federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes.", "Most program descriptions were compiled from authorizing statutes, the U.S. Code, and Administration budget request documents. Other program descriptions and some funding information were compiled from The Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), the Assistance Listings (formerly the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance or CFDA) housed on the beta.SAM.gov website , and the Energy Star website. Most budgetary figures were compiled from executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports.
