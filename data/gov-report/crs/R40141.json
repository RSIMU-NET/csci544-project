These groups are absolutely prohibited from participating in campaign activity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). On the other hand, they are permitted to engage in nonpartisan political activities (e.g., distributing voter guides and conducting get-out-the-vote drives) that do not support or oppose a candidate. Determining whether an activity violates the IRC prohibition depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, and the line between impermissible and permissible activities can sometimes be difficult to discern.", "Due to the IRC prohibition, Section 501(c)(3) organizations generally are not permitted to engage in the types of activities regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). However, the activities regulated under the IRC and FECA are not necessarily identical. An organization must comply with any applicable FECA provisions if engaging in activities regulated by FECA (e.g., making an issue advocacy communication under the IRC that constitutes an electioneering communication under FECA).", "A 2010 Supreme Court case, Citizens United v. FEC, has received considerable attention for invalidating several long-standing prohibitions in FECA on corporate and labor union campaign treasury spending. This case does not appear to significantly impact the political activities of Section 501(c)(3) organizations because they remain subject to the prohibition on such activity under the IRC.", "This report examines the restrictions imposed on campaign activity by Section 501(c)(3) organizations under the tax and campaign finance laws.

One restriction that arises is that these organizations are prohibited under the tax code from engaging in campaign activity.

It may also be taxed on its political expenditures, either in addition to or in lieu of revocation of Section 501(c)(3) status. The tax equals 10% of the expenditures, with an additional tax equal to 100% of the expenditures imposed if the expenditures are not corrected (i.e., recovered and safeguards established to prevent future ones) in a timely manner. The organization's managers may also be subject to tax.

He analogized it to the lobbying limitation, enacted in 1934, under which \"no substantial part\" of a Section 501(c)(3) organization's activities may be lobbying; however, he mischaracterized the limitation by saying organizations that lobbied were denied tax-exempt status, as opposed to only those that engaged in substantial lobbying. It appears that the act's legislative history had no further discussion of the provision. It has been suggested that then-Senator Johnson proposed it either as a way to get back at an organization that supported an opponent or as an alternative to a controversial proposal denying tax-exempt status to organizations making donations to subversive entities and individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is Prohibited Campaign Activity?", "paragraphs": ["Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits the organizations described therein from \"participating in, or intervening in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office,\" but does not further elaborate on the prohibition. Treasury regulations define candidate as \"an individual who offers himself, or is proposed by others, as a contestant for an elective public office, whether such office be national, State, or local.\" As to what types of activities are prohibited, the regulations add little besides specifying that they include \"the publication or distribution of written or printed statements or the making of oral statements on behalf of or in opposition to such a candidate.\"", "Thus, the statute and regulations do not offer much insight as to what activities are prohibited. Clearly, Section 501(c)(3) organizations may not do such things as make statements that endorse or oppose a candidate, publish or distribute campaign literature, or make any type of contribution, monetary or otherwise, to a political campaign.", "On the other hand, Section 501(c)(3) organizations are allowed to conduct activities that are political in nature but are not related to elections, such as lobbying for or against legislation and supporting or opposing the appointment of individuals to nonelective offices. Additionally, Section 501(c)(3) organizations may engage in certain election-related activities so long as the activities do not indicate a preference for or against any candidate. Whether such an activity is campaign intervention depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

The guide must be unbiased in form, content, and distribution. According to the IRS, there are numerous ways in which a guide may be biased, and the determination will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, a guide could display a bias by not including all candidates on an equal basis. Another way a guide could be biased is by rating candidates, such as evaluating candidates and supporting a slate of the best-qualified candidates, even if the criteria are nonpartisan (e.g., based on professional qualifications). A voter guide could also indicate a bias by comparing the organization's position on issues with those of the candidates. A more subtle way in which a guide may show bias is by only covering issues that are important to the organization, as opposed to covering a range of issues of interest to the general public.", "Some guides consist of candidate responses to questions provided by the organization. According to the IRS, factors that tend to show these guides are candidate-neutral include the following:", "the questions and descriptions of the issues are clear and unbiased; the questions provided to the candidates are identical to those included in the guide; the candidates' answers have not been edited; the guide puts the questions and appropriate answers in close proximity to each other; the candidates are given a reasonable amount of time to respond to the questions; and if the candidates are given limited choices for an answer to a question (e.g., yes/no, support/oppose), they are given a reasonable opportunity to explain their positions.", "Other factors that may be important include the timing of the guide's distribution and to whom it is distributed. For example, the IRS ruled that a Section 501(c)(3) organization could include a compilation of members' voting records on issues important to it and its position on those issues in the edition of its monthly newsletter published after the close of each Congress. The newsletter was sent to the usual small number of subscribers and not targeted to areas where elections were occurring.

It has two parts: the IRS performed educational outreach to Section 501(c)(3) organizations about the prohibition and used a fast-track process for reviewing possible violations. The initiative was used during the 2004, 2006, and 2008 election cycles, although the data from 2008 have not yet been released. The initiative was not used during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. ", "The 2004 initiative involved the expedited review of 110 cases in which Section 501(c)(3) organizations were alleged to have violated the campaign intervention prohibition. The IRS issued a written advisory in 69 of these cases, which meant that the agency determined the organization engaged in campaign activity but mitigating factors led to the organization not being penalized. Mitigating factors included that the activity was of a one-time nature or shown to be an anomaly, the activity was done in good faith reliance on advice of counsel, or the organization corrected the conduct (e.g., recovered any funds that were spent) and established safeguards to prevent future violations. The IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of five organizations (one for issues not related to campaign activity) and proposed two more revocations. The IRS did not find substantiated campaign activity in 23 of the cases, and found non-political violations of the tax laws in six other cases. The remaining five cases were still open as of the last IRS update in 2007. ", "While the 2004 initiative was proceeding, there were reports in various media outlets that raised the question of whether the IRS had been politically motivated in investigating the Section 501(c)(3) organizations so close to the 2004 election. In response, the IRS Commissioner asked the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) to investigate whether the IRS had engaged in any improper activities while conducting the project. In 2005, TIGTA released its report, which concluded that the IRS had used appropriate, consistent procedures during the initiative.", "The 2006 initiative involved 100 cases selected for examination. As of the last IRS update in 2007, 60 of these cases remained open. In the 40 closed cases, the IRS issued written advisories in 26 of them, and did not find substantiated political intervention in the other 14 cases.

FECA prohibits corporations from using general treasury funds to make contributions in connection with federal elections. While FECA does not prohibit unincorporated Section 501(c)(3) organizations from making such contributions, the IRC prohibits all Section 501(c)(3) organizations, regardless of corporate status, from making such contributions, as discussed above.

FEC, the Supreme Court invalidated the prohibitions in FECA on corporations and labor unions using their general treasury funds to make \"independent expenditures,\" which are communications \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\" that are not coordinated with any candidate or party, and \"electioneering communications,\" which are broadcast, cable or satellite transmissions that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate and aired within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. The Court determined that these prohibitions constitute a \"ban on speech\" in violation of the First Amendment. Due to the tax code prohibition discussed above, Section 501(c)(3) organizations are generally not permitted to engage in the activities regulated by FECA, and thus the Citizens United decision does not appear to impact them in a significant manner.
