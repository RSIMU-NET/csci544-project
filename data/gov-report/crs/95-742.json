Federal administration of UC is under the U.S. Department of Labor(DOL). The UC system, established by theSocial Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271), operates in each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and theVirgin Islands. Federal law sets broad rulesthat the 53 state programs must follow and levies a payroll tax on employers under the Federal Unemployment TaxAct (FUTA). States set most of the specificrules for eligibility, benefits, and financing. States also process the claims and pay the benefits. The UC systemhelps counter economic trends. When theeconomy grows, UC revenue rises and program spending falls, thereby slowing growth. In a recession, revenue fallsand program spending rises, stimulatingthe economy. Benefits totaling an estimated $45.3 billion were paid to an estimated 10.2 million UC claimants inall programs during FY2004.", "Coverage. Federal law defines the jobs a state UC program must cover to avoid its employers' having to paythe maximum FUTA tax rate (6.2%) on the first $7,000 of each employee's annual pay. If a state UC programcomplies with all federal rules, the net FUTA taxrate is only 0.8% for employers. A state must cover jobs in firms that pay at least $1,500 in wages during anycalendar quarter or employ at least one worker ineach of 20 weeks in the current or prior year. The FUTA tax is not paid by governmental or nonprofit employers,but state programs must cover governmentworkers and all workers in nonprofits that employ at least four workers in each of 20 weeks in the current or prioryear (the states are reimbursed for theexpenditures on federal workers by the federal government). Table 1 lists the net FUTA tax ratesand taxable wage ceilings from 1937 and later.", "Table 1.

", "Benefits. To receive UC benefits, claimants must have enough recent earnings to meet their state's earningsrequirements. States usually disqualify claimants who lost their jobs because of inability to work or unavailabilityfor work; voluntarily quitting without goodcause; discharge for job-related misconduct; refusal of suitable work without good cause; or a labor dispute. Generally, benefits are based on wages in coveredwork over a 12-month period. Most state benefit formulas replace half of a claimant's average weekly wage up toa weekly maximum. Weekly maximums in2004 ranged from $133 (Puerto Rico) to $508 (Massachusetts) and, in states that provide dependents' allowances,up to $762 (Massachusetts). The averageweekly benefit nationwide was $262 for FY2004. Benefits are available for up to 26 weeks (30 weeks inMassachusetts and Washington (1) ). The averagebenefit duration in FY2004 was 16.4 weeks. A federal-state extended benefits (EB) program offers benefits for anadditional 13 to 20 weeks in states withunemployment rates above certain levels.", "Financing. The 0.8% FUTA tax funds federal and state administration, the federal share of the EB program,loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and state employment services. States levy their own payroll taxes to fundregular UC benefits and the state share of theEB program. State ceilings on taxable wages in 2004 ranged from the $7,000 FUTA federal ceiling (11 states) upto $31,000 (Hawaii). State UC tax rates areexperience-rated where employers generating the fewest claimants have the lowest rates. State tax rates averaged1.8% of taxable wages and 0.6% of totalwages in FY2003. State UC revenue is deposited in U.S. Treasury accounts as federal revenue in the budget. Stateaccounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund(UTF) are credited for this revenue. These credits allow Treasury to reimburse states for their benefit paymentswithout annual appropriations, but thesereimbursements do count as federal budget outlays. If a state trust fund account becomes insolvent, a state mayborrow federal funds. State UTF revenueexceeded outlays from FY1995 to FY2000, but outlays significantly exceeded trust fund revenue inFY2001-FY2004 ( Table 2 ).", "Table 2.
