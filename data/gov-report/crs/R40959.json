In a series of data tables, it lists the total dollar values of U.S. government-to-government arms sales agreements with its top five purchasers, and the total dollar values of U.S. arms deliveries to those purchasers, in five specific regions of the world for three specific periods: 2001-2004, 2005-2008, and 2008 alone. In addition, the report provides data tables listing the total dollar values of U.S. government-to-government arms agreements with and deliveries to its top 10 purchasers worldwide for the periods 2001-2004, 2005-2008, and for 2008 alone.", "This report is prepared in conjunction with CRS Report R40796, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2001-2008, by [author name scrubbed]. That annual report details both U.S. and foreign arms transfer activities globally and provides analysis of arms trade trends. The intent here is to complement that elaborate worldwide treatment of the international arms trade by providing only the dollar values of U.S. arms sales agreements with and delivery values to its leading customers, by geographic region, for the calendar years 2001-2004, 2005-2008, and 2008. Unlike CRS Report R40796, this annual report focuses exclusively on U.S. arms sales and provides the specific names of the major U.S. arms customers, by region, together with the total dollar values of their arms purchases or deliveries.
