{"id": "R43066", "title": "Federal Funding for Health Insurance Exchanges", "released_date": "2014-10-29T00:00:00", "summary": ["Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), a health insurance exchange has been established in each state and the District of Columbia (DC). Exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can \"shop\" for health insurance coverage.", "The ACA instructed each state to establish its own state-based exchange (SBE). If a state elected not to create an exchange or if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined a state was not prepared to operate an exchange, the law directed HHS to establish a federally facilitated exchange (FFE) in the state. Fourteen states and DC established SBEs in 2014, while the remaining 36 states have FFEs. In some states that have FFEs, the states carry out certain functions of the exchange; in other states, the exchange is wholly operated and administered by HHS.", "The ACA provided an indefinite appropriation for HHS grants to states to support the planning and establishment of exchanges. For each fiscal year, the HHS Secretary is to determine the total amount that will be made available to each state for exchange grants. No grant may be awarded after January 1, 2015.", "There are three different types of exchange grants. First, planning grants were awarded to 49 states and DC. These grants of about $1 million each were intended to provide resources to states to help them plan their health insurance exchanges. Second, there have been multiple rounds of exchange establishment grants. There are two levels of exchange establishment grants: level one establishment grants are awarded to states that have made some progress using their planning funds, and level two establishment grants are designed to provide funding to states that are farther along in the establishment of an exchange. Finally, HHS awarded seven early innovator grants to states (including one award to a consortium of New England states) to support the design and implementation of the information technology systems needed to operate the exchanges. To date, HHS has awarded a total of more than $4.8 billion to states and DC in planning, establishment, and early innovator grants.", "Under the ACA, each exchange is expected to be self-sustaining beginning January 1, 2015. The law authorizes exchanges to generate funding to sustain their operations, including by assessing fees on participating health insurance issuers. To raise funds for each of the FFEs, beginning in 2014, HHS is assessing a monthly fee on each health insurance issuer that offers plans through an FFE.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is incurring significant administrative costs to support FFE operations. According to CMS, a total of $456 million was used to support exchange operations over the period FY2010-FY2012. CMS spent $1,545 million on exchange operations in FY2013 and an estimated $1,390 million in FY2014. The agency has relied on a mix of annual discretionary appropriations and funding from other sources for these expenditures. Those sources include expired discretionary funds from the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, mandatory funding from the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund and the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and FFE user fees. CMS has budgeted $1.8 billion for exchange operations in FY2015. Most of that funding is projected to come from FFE user fees."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["A health insurance exchange has been established in every state, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Each exchange has two parts, a marketplace where individuals can shop for and enroll in health insurance coverage, and a small business health options program (SHOP) exchange for small employers. Some individuals are eligible to receive financial assistance for their coverage obtained through an exchange, and some small employers can obtain tax credits toward coverage purchased through a SHOP. Exchanges are not intended to supplant the private market outside of exchanges, and the ACA does not require that individuals and small businesses obtain coverage through an exchange. ", "A state can choose to establish its own state-based exchange (SBE). If a state opts not to, or if the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines that the state is not in a position to administer its own exchange, then HHS will establish and administer the exchange in the state as a federally facilitated exchange (FFE). Fourteen states and DC established SBEs in 2014, while the remaining 36 states have FFEs. There are varying levels of state involvement in FFEs. In some cases, a state has partnered with HHS to establish and administer the exchange, and in other cases HHS is administering the individual exchange while the state administers the SHOP exchange. In many states with FFEs, the exchange is wholly operated and administered by HHS. ", "To fund the establishment of exchanges, the ACA authorizes the HHS Secretary to award grants to states through 2014. Each exchange is expected to generate its own funds to sustain its operations beginning January 1, 2015. This report provides a state-by-state breakdown of the grants awarded to date.

For each fiscal year, the HHS Secretary is to determine the total amount that will be made available to each state for exchange grants. Any state that intends to do exchange establishment work can apply for and receive a Section 1311 grant; for instance, a state that is not establishing an SBE may receive a grant provided the state uses the funds for activities related to exchange establishment and implementation. States have had multiple opportunities to apply for Section 1311 grants. One deadline remains for submitting an application this year (i.e., November 14). No grants will be awarded after December 31, 2014. ", "HHS has awarded three different types of exchange grants, which are described below.

Beginning in 2014, HHS will charge a monthly user fee to all issuers that sell plans through an FFE. The fee for an issuer is equal to the product of the billable members enrolled in the plan through an FFE and a monthly user fee rate.

This information was included in CMS's FY2015 budget submission. During the period FY2010 through FY2012, a total of $456 million was used to support exchange operations. Of that amount, $331 million came from annual discretionary appropriations that cover the routine costs of running federal agencies, including salaries and expenses: $307 million from CMS's Program Management account, and an additional $24 million from the HHS Departmental Management account. The remaining $125 million came from the Health Insurance Reform and Implementation Fund (HIRIF), a $1 billion fund within HHS that was established and funded to help pay for the administrative costs of ACA implementation.", "CMS's administrative costs to support exchange operations totaled $1,545 million in FY2013. In the FY2013 budget, CMS requested an increase of $1,001 million for its Program Management account for ACA implementation and other activities. However, Congress did not provide any additional discretionary funds for ACA implementation in FY2013. CMS instead used funds from other sources to help pay for ongoing administrative costs associated with exchange operations. Those funds included (1) discretionary funds transferred from other HHS accounts under the Secretary's transfer authority; (2) expired discretionary funds from the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF); (3) mandatory funds from the HIRIF; and (4) mandatory funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (see Table 2 ).", "CMS estimated that its FY2014 administrative costs for exchange operations would total $1,390 million. The agency requested an increase of $1,397 million for its Program Management account in the FY2014 budget for ACA implementation and other activities. But, as in FY2013, Congress chose not to give CMS any additional funding. Once again, the agency relied on transferred departmental funds as well as NEF and HIRIF funding to help support exchange operations in FY2014. In addition, CMS projected that it would collect an estimated $200 million in FFE user fees in FY2014 (see Table 2 ).", "The President's FY2015 budget includes a total of $1,788 for exchange operations. Of that amount, $629 million is from CMS's Program Management account, and the remaining $1,159 million is projected to come from FFE user fees.
