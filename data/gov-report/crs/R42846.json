{"id": "R42846", "title": "Lifeline Telephone Program: Frequently Asked Questions", "released_date": "2012-12-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["The concept that all Americans should have affordable access to the telecommunications network, commonly called the \"universal service concept,\" can trace its origins back to the 1934 Communications Act. The preservation and advancement of universal service has remained a basic tenet of federal communications policy, and in the mid-1980s the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Lifeline program to provide support for low-income subscribers. The Lifeline program, which is administered under the Universal Service Fund (USF) Low Income Program, was established by the FCC in 1984 to assist eligible low-income subscribers to cover the recurring monthly service charges incurred for telephone usage. Although the program solely covers costs associated with the minutes of use, not the telephone, misinformation connecting the program to payment for a \"free phone\" has resulted in a significant number of constituent inquiries."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is the Lifeline Program?", "paragraphs": ["Lifeline is a federal program, established in 1984, that assists eligible individuals in paying the recurring monthly service charges associated with either wireline or wireless telephone usage. The program is part of the Low Income Program supported by the Universal Service Fund. ", "Eligible households can receive up to $9.25 per month in Lifeline discounts. Additional state support may be available. Approximately 2,000 telephone companies are eligible to provide these discounts. A household applies for the discounts through their designated telecommunications service provider. Support is not given directly to the subscriber, but to the service provider. The provider is reimbursed through the Lifeline Program and in turn passes the discount on to the subscriber.

Depending on the package selected the subscriber is allocated a set number of usage minutes per month. Once the allocation is used the subscriber may choose to pay for additional minutes of use. Although not required, most providers that offer a prepaid wireless option provide a wireless phone to the subscriber for free. The cost of this phone is not covered under the Lifeline program but is borne by the designated provider.", "Although the prepaid wireless option is growing in popularity the Lifeline program also covers a wireline option or a postpaid wireless option. As with the case of the prepaid wireless option the program solely covers the minutes of use, not the device."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are the Requirements for Eligibility?", "paragraphs": ["The Lifeline program is available to eligible low-income consumers in every state, territory, and commonwealth, and on Tribal lands. To participate in the program, consumers must either have an income that is at or below 135% of the federal Poverty Guidelines or participate in one of the following assistance programs: Medicaid; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps or SNAP); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8); Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP); Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); National School Lunch Program's Free Lunch Program; Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance; Tribally-Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TTANF); Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR); Head Start (if income eligibility criteria are met); or state assistance programs (if applicable).", "The Lifeline Pre-Screening Tool ( http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls/eligibility/default.aspx ) provided by USAC can help determine whether a household is eligible for Lifeline assistance.", "At least once each year, beginning in 2012, consumers who are receiving lifeline service must recertify their eligibility and that no one else in their household has a lifeline discounted service.

This line item appears when a company chooses to recover its USF contributions directly from its customers by billing them this charge.

Each company makes a business decision about whether and how to assess charges to recover its Universal Service obligations.
