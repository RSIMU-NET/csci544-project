It established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase or insure up to $700 billion in troubled assets owned by financial institutions. EESA also contained language indicating that the purposes of the act included, among other things, protecting home values and preserving homeownership. ", "EESA provided the Treasury Secretary with broad authority in how to implement TARP, including wide latitude in deciding what assets might be purchased or guaranteed and what qualified as a financial institution. Using this broad authority, and to comply with the homeownership preservation purposes of EESA, Treasury used some TARP funds to create certain programs designed to prevent home foreclosures, including the HHF. The programs are designed in such a way to qualify as activities authorized by EESA.", "Treasury set aside a total of $37.5 billion in TARP funds to use for foreclosure prevention initiatives.

Second Lien Assistance: Providing assistance to eligible borrowers to modify or extinguish a second mortgage on the property in conjunction with a modification of a primary mortgage or to facilitate a short sale.

Removing vacant and abandoned homes may help avoid negative impacts on nearby home values, which in turn could help prevent additional foreclosures. Down Payment Assistance: Providing funds for down payment assistance in an effort to prevent foreclosures by encouraging home buying activity in certain areas.", "In addition, states can use funds for other types of foreclosure prevention programs that are approved by Treasury.
