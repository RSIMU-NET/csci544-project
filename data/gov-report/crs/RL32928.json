One issue that has arisen involves breastfeeding mothers and jury duty, and whether a breastfeeding mother may receive an excuse or deferral from compulsory jury duty.", "At the present time there is no federal legislation on the subject, although Congress has considered and adopted other legislation concerning certain breastfeeding issues.", "By contrast, several states have enacted legislation to excuse or defer jury duty for breastfeeding mothers, either specifically or more generally under \"family friendly\" jury duty legislation. \"Family friendly\" jury legislation varies in scope, but it generally, though not always, is sufficiently expansive to cover breastfeeding mothers.", "Court rules concerning breastfeeding mothers and jury duty vary widely. California has adopted a uniform statewide rule. However, federal district courts have not adopted standard rules or practices. Likewise, state and local courts may have no specific rules, or very different rules on breastfeeding mothers and jury duty.", "The fact that a state, a court system, or a single court does not have a law, rule, or formally written procedure does not necessarily mean that a breastfeeding mother will be compelled to serve on a jury. It appears that a general \"medical exception\" from jury duty may be applicable to breastfeeding mothers in some instances, and local practice and custom may influence an excuse or deferral from jury duty. It appears that many of the decisions concerning a nursing mother's excuse or deferral from jury duty are handled on a case-by-case basis by the individual courts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since 1993, many states have enacted laws relating to breastfeeding. Currently, forty-three states and Puerto Rico have enacted some form of breastfeeding legislation, which most commonly addresses breastfeeding in the workplace and exempting nursing mothers from laws dealing with indecent exposure and/or criminal behavior.", "Additionally, some states have laws or rules that more directly bear on the obligation of breastfeeding mothers to serve on juries. This regulation of jury service generally has taken one of three approaches:", "Some states have enacted statutes that expressly excuse or defer jury service. States with this type of law include California, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Virginia. These laws are cited and summarized below. Additionally, Wyoming is considering legislation to defer or excuse jury duty. Another state legislative development is the enactment of \"family friendly\" jury duty legislation that permits parents who care for a young child on a full time basis, or who are caretakers of an elderly or disabled relative, to have jury service deferred or excused upon their request. Usually, breastfeeding mothers fall with the coverage of these statutes, although the statutes vary, and may not be applicable under every circumstance. Currently, twelve states\u2014Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming have some form of \"family friendly jury duty legislation.\" (The laws of Colorado and Massachusetts probably are not applicable to the excuse or deferral of breastfeeding mothers from jury duty.) California has adopted a state-wide court rule which uniformly deals with breastfeeding and jury service. In addition, many individual courts\u2014federal and state\u2014have adopted rules to deal with this situation.", "Even if a state has neither a specific statute dealing with jury service and breastfeeding, a \"family friendly\" statute, nor a statewide court rule, it does not necessarily mean that a nursing mother will be required to perform jury duty. Individual court rules or custom, community practice, or other circumstances may permit an excuse or a deferral from jury service for a nursing mother. In the absence of a state law or court rule providing a specific exception for breastfeeding, the nursing mother may or may not be excused on the basis of a general \"medical\" needs exception. On the other hand, research has not found any court that permits a mother serving on a jury to have her child present in the court room or the jury room, or to breastfeed during court proceedings or jury deliberations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Laws Permitting Breastfeeding Mothers to have Jury Duty Excused or Postponed", "paragraphs": ["At the present time, eleven states have enacted laws which specifically allow a breastfeeding mother to either postpone or be excused from jury duty.
