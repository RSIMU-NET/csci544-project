The 8(a) Program provides participating small businesses with training, technical assistance, and contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides and sole-source awards. A \"set-aside\" is an acquisition in which only certain contractors may compete, while a sole-source award is a contract awarded, or proposed for award, without competition. In FY2014, the federal government spent over $16 billion on contracts and subcontracts with 8(a) firms. Other programs provide similar assistance to other types of small businesses (e.g., women-owned, HUBZone).", "Eligibility for the 8(a) Program is generally limited to small businesses \"unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States\" that demonstrate \"potential for success.\" Each of these terms is further defined by the Small Business Act, regulations promulgated by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and judicial and administrative decisions.", "A \"business\" is generally a for-profit entity that has a place of business located in the United States and operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy by paying taxes or using American products, materials, or labor. A business is \"small\" if it is independently owned and operated; is not dominant in its field of operations; and meets any definitions or standards established by the Administrator of Small Business. Ownership is \"unconditional\" when it is not subject to any conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, or similar limitations. \"Control\" is not the same as ownership and includes both strategic policy setting and day-to-day administration of business operations.", "Members of certain racial and ethnic groups are presumed to be socially disadvantaged, although individuals who do not belong to these groups may prove they are also socially disadvantaged. To be economically disadvantaged, an individual must have a net worth of less than $250,000 (excluding ownership in the 8(a) firm and equity in one's primary residence) at the time of entry into the program. This amount increases to $750,000 for continuing eligibility. In determining whether an applicant has good character, SBA looks for criminal conduct, violations of SBA regulations, or debarment or suspension from federal contracting. For a firm to have \"potential for success,\" it generally must have been in business in the field of its primary industry classification for two years immediately prior to applying to the program. However, small businesses owned by Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations are eligible for the 8(a) Program under somewhat different terms.", "The 8(a) Program has periodically been challenged on the grounds that the presumption that members of certain racial and ethnic groups are disadvantaged violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The outcomes in early challenges to the program varied, with some courts finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they were not economically disadvantaged. Most recently, two federal district court decisions found that the program is not unconstitutional on its face because (1) \"breaking down barriers to minority business development created by discrimination and its lingering effects\" constitutes a compelling government interest; (2) the government had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that race-based action was necessary to further this interest; and (3) the 8(a) Program is narrowly tailored to \"minimize the burden on non-minority firms.\" However, in one of these cases, the court did find that the program was unconstitutional as applied in the military simulation and training industry because the government conceded it had no evidence of discrimination in this industry. The decision in one case was appealed. The litigation in the other has reportedly been settled."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["C ommonly known as the \"8(a) Program,\" the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program is one of several federal contracting programs for small businesses.

The agency was the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC), which was created partly for this purpose, and Congress gave it these powers in order to ameliorate small businesses' financial difficulties while also \"mobiliz[ing] the productive facilities of small business in the interest of successful prosecution of the war.\" The SWPC's subcontracting authority expired along with the SWPC at the end of the World War II. However, in 1951, at the start of the Korean War, Congress created the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA), which was generally given the same powers that the SWPC had exercised. Two years later, in 1953, Congress transferred the SDPA's subcontracting authorities, among others, to the newly created Small Business Administration, with the intent that the SBA would exercise these powers in peacetime, as well as in wartime. When the Small Business Act of 1958 transformed the SBA into a permanent independent agency, this subcontracting authority was included in Section 8(a) of the act. At its inception, the SBA's subcontracting authority was not limited to small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged. Under the original Section 8(a), the SBA could contract with any \"small-business concerns or others,\" but the SBA seldom, if ever, employed this subcontracting authority, focusing instead upon its loan and other programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs for Racial and Ethnic Minorities", "paragraphs": ["Federal programs for racial and ethnic minorities began developing at approximately the same time as those for small businesses, although there was initially no explicit overlap between them. The earliest programs were created by executive orders, beginning with President Franklin Roosevelt's order on June 25, 1941, requiring that all federal agencies include a clause in defense-related contracts prohibiting contractors from discriminating on the basis of \"race, creed, color, or national origin.\" Subsequent Presidents followed Roosevelt's example, issuing a number of executive orders seeking to improve the employment opportunities of members of various racial and ethnic groups. These executive branch initiatives took on new importance after the Kerner Commission's report on the causes of the urban riots of 1966 concluded that African Americans would need \"special encouragement\" to enter the economic mainstream. ", "Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon laid the foundations for the present 8(a) Program in the hope of providing such \"encouragement.\" Johnson created the President's Test Cities Program (PTCP), which involved a small-scale use of the SBA's authority under Section 8(a) to award contracts to firms willing to locate in urban areas and hire unemployed individuals, largely African Americans, or sponsor minority-owned businesses by providing capital or management assistance. However, under the PTCP, small businesses did not have to be minority-owned to receive subcontracts under Section 8(a). Nixon's program was larger and focused more specifically on minority-owned small businesses. During the Nixon Administration, the SBA promulgated its earliest regulations for the 8(a) Program. In 1970, the first of these regulations articulated the SBA's policy of using Section 8(a) to \"assist small concerns owned by disadvantaged persons to become self-sufficient, viable businesses capable of competing effectively in the market place.\" A later regulation, promulgated in 1973, defined \"disadvantaged persons\" as including, but not limited to, \"black Americans, Spanish-Americans, oriental Americans, Eskimos, and Aleuts.\" However, the SBA lacked explicit statutory authority for focusing its 8(a) Program on minority-owned businesses until 1978, although courts generally rejected challenges alleging that SBA's implementation of the program was unauthorized because it was \"not specifically mentioned in statute.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1978 Amendments to the Small Business Act and Subsequent Regulations", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, Congress amended the Small Business Act to give the SBA statutory authority for its 8(a) Program for minority-owned businesses.

Thus, if an individual was a member of one of these groups, he or she was presumed to be socially disadvantaged. Otherwise, the amendments were generally seen to grant the SBA discretion to recognize additional groups or individuals as socially disadvantaged based upon criteria promulgated in regulations. Under these regulations, which include a three-part test for determining whether minority groups not mentioned in the amendment's findings are disadvantaged, the SBA recognized the racial or ethnic groups listed in Table 1 as socially disadvantaged for purposes of the 8(a) Program. The regulations also established standards of evidence to be met by individuals demonstrating personal disadvantage and procedures for rebutting the presumption of social disadvantage accorded to members of recognized minority groups.", "The 1978 amendments also defined \"economically disadvantaged individuals,\" for purposes of the 8(a) Program, as \"those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.\" Later, the SBA established by regulation that personal net worth of less than $250,000 at the time of entry into the 8(a) Program ($750,000 for continuing eligibility) constitutes economic disadvantage.

The outcomes in early challenges to the program varied, with some courts finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring such challenges because they were not economically disadvantaged, or were otherwise ineligible for the program; and other courts finding that the program was unconstitutional as applied in specific cases. More recently, in its 2012 decision in DynaLantic Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that the 8(a) Program was not unconstitutional on its face because (1) \"breaking down barriers to minority business development created by discrimination and its lingering effects\" constitutes a compelling government interest; (2) the government had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that race-based action was necessary to further this interest; and (3) the 8(a) Program is narrowly tailored to \"minimize the burden on non-minority firms.\" However, the court found that the program was unconstitutional as applied in the military simulation and training industry because the Department of Defense (DOD) conceded it had \"no evidence of discrimination, either in the public or private sector, in the simulation and training industry.\"", "Particularly in its rejection of the facial challenge to the 8(a) Program, the court emphasized certain aspects of the program's history and requirements when finding that the government had articulated a compelling interest for the program and had a strong basis in evidence for its actions. Specifically, the court rejected the plaintiff's assertion that the 8(a) Program was \"not truly remedial,\" but rather favored \"virtually all minority groups \u2026 over the larger pool of citizens,\" because non-minority individuals may qualify for the program, and all 8(a) applicants must demonstrate economic disadvantage. The court also noted that the history of the 8(a) program prior to 1978 (when Congress expressly authorized set-asides for disadvantaged small businesses) had evidenced that race-neutral methods were insufficient to promote contracting with minority-owned small businesses. The court further noted that the 8(a) Program was intended to be a business development program, not a means to \"channel contracts\" to minority firms; that Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act expressly provides that awards may be made through the 8(a) Program only when SBA determines that \"such action is necessary and appropriate\"; and that the act requires the President and SBA to report annually to Congress on the program, thereby ensuring that Congress has evidence as to whether there is a \"continuing compelling need for the program.\" Similarly, in finding that the program was narrowly tailored to meet the government's interests, the court noted (1) that goals for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses are purely aspirational, and there are no penalties for failing to meet them; (2) the nine-year limits on program participation for individual owners and firms; and (3) that SBA may not accept a requirement for the 8(a) Program if it determines that doing so will have a adverse effect on another small business or group of small businesses. The court emphasized that the last two factors, in particular, helped ensure that race-conscious remedies do not \"last longer than the discriminatory effects [they are] designed to eliminate,\" and \"work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.\"", "A 2015 decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Rothe Development, Inc. v. Department of Defense subsequently adopted the reasoning of the DynaLantic court in finding that the 8(a) Program is not unconstitutional on its face. In so doing, the court noted the same attributes of the 8(a) Program that the DynaLantic court had emphasized. In particular, in its brief discussion, the court noted the following six factors: ", "1. alternative, race-neutral remedies had proved unsuccessful in addressing the discrimination targeted here; 2. the 8(a) Program is \"appropriately flexible\" because it imposes no quotas and prescribes no consequences for failure to meet the aspirational goals as to the percentage of federal contract dollars awarded to small disadvantaged businesses; 3. the program is neither under- nor over-inclusive, since it \"does not provide that every member of a minority group is disadvantaged\"; 4. the program imposes temporal limits on individuals' participation in the program, and SBA continuously monitors participants' eligibility; 5. the aspirational goals for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses are \"numerically proportionate\" to the evidence regarding the availability of minority firms that are ready, able, and willing to perform government contracts; and 6. various aspects of the 8(a) Program minimize the program's burden on non-minority firms (e.g., SBA cannot accept a contract for award through the 8(a) Program if it determines that doing so would have an \"adverse impact\" on other small businesses).", "The decision in Rothe has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The litigation in DynaLantic , however, was reportedly settled by the parties while their appeals to the D.C. Circuit were pending."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparison of the Requirements Pertaining to Different Types of 8(a) Firms", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}}
