Each year the President's budget estimates the amount of funding necessary to meet federal commitments under Title IV-E based on current law and, if included in the budget, provides estimates related to proposed changes to the law.

The overall funding level is $258 million above what HHS/ACF expects to need under the program for FY2015 ($7.343 billion). The primary reasons HHS/ACF assumes a need for this additional FY2016 funding are expected growth in the number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments; and increased program administrative costs tied to implementation of new program requirements.", "The Administration also seeks legislative authority to implement several new policies under the Title IV-E program.

However, states may not use Title IV-E funds to pay for any related services provided to the candidate or his/her family. According to HHS/ACF, states serve approximately 160,000 candidates on an average monthly basis. In FY2013 (the most recent data publicly available), states submitted Title IV-E foster care claims totaling nearly $591 million for administrative work carried out with regard to candidates for foster care, and they received federal reimbursement of 50% of those costs (more than $295 million).", "The Administration notes that this proposal is intended to support provision of both pre-placement and after care services, including services for kin families, if the lack of those services would effectively mean the child's entry, or re-entry, into foster care (that is, if the child meets the current law description of a candidate). Because of the nature of a candidate these services would be expected to be offered on a relatively short-term, rather than an ongoing, basis. To receive this proposed Title IV-E services funding, states would need to maintain their current level of investment in child welfare services.", "The Administration assumes states will need time to build capacity to provide these services (of which it says no fewer than 70% must be evidence-based or evidence-informed).

Additionally, this data analysis showed that while state child welfare agencies' use of congregate care has declined in the past decade, progress has been uneven across the states. Further, children with a diagnosed mental health condition or who had a \"child behavior problem\" tend to stay in congregate care for a longer time than those with no clinical indicators. The Children's Bureau recommends measures to both ensure appropriate use of congregate care and support family-based care for children with behavioral or mental health issues.", "To ensure appropriate use of congregate care, the Administration proposes a new Title IV-E eligibility requirement for any child placed in a congregate care facility. Specifically, for the child to be eligible for Title IV-E assistance the state would need to conduct an assessment to determine that a child's placement in a congregate care setting is the \"least restrictive\" and \"most family-like\" placement available for the child. Further, states would need to document this assessment in the child's case plan and secure a judicial determination (within six months of the child's placement in congregate care and every six months thereafter while the child remains in that care) to confirm that the congregate care placement remains the child's best placement option and that the child is making progress toward readiness for a family-based placement.

Five tribes or tribal entities have an approved Title IV-E plan (and more are working toward approval this year). As of February 2015, however, only two had been able to implement their approved Title IV-E plan.

CBO uses its own model and assumptions to project program outlays under both current law and proposed law. Further, when \"scoring\" the cost of a policy proposal, CBO looks at projected \"outlays\" rather than \"budget authority.\" Any positive difference between outlays under proposed law compared to outlays under current law (as estimated by CBO) is scored by CBO as a cost.
