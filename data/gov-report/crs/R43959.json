Authorization of appropriations for the Perkins Loan program is due to expire at the end of FY2015, and the future operation of the program is uncertain.

The Perkins Loan program authorizes the allocation of federal funds to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to assist them in capitalizing revolving loan funds for the purpose of making low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. The program is authorized under Title IV, Part E of the Higher Education Act (HEA). It supersedes Title II\u2014Loans to Students in Institutions of Higher Education\u2014of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-864), which was incorporated into the HEA through the Education Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-318). Previously, these loans were known as National Defense Student Loans and National Direct Student Loans.", "Institutions capitalize revolving loan funds created under the program with a combination of federal and institutional capital contributions (FCCs and ICCs, respectively). Each institution's ICC must equal one-third of the FCC received. The FCC is allocated according to statutorily prescribed procedures. After making loans, IHEs recapitalize their loan funds by depositing the principal and interest repaid by students who borrowed under the program, as well as any other charges or earnings associated with the operation of the program.", "Perkins Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate and professional students. They must be made reasonably available to all eligible students, with priority given to students with exceptional financial need. Interest on Perkins Loans is fixed at a rate of 5% per year, and no interest accrues prior to a student beginning repayment, nor while repayment is suspended during deferment. ", "Individuals who have engaged in a variety of public service endeavors (e.g., full-time elementary or secondary school teachers employed at a public or private nonprofit school in which low-income students are more than 30% of total enrollment, full-time law enforcement officers) are eligible to have part or all of their Perkins Loan cancelled. The Secretary of Education (the Secretary) is required to reimburse IHEs for Perkins Loans cancelled for students engaged in public service. Funds for reimbursing institutions for loan cancellations may not come from appropriations designated for FCCs; rather, these funds are appropriated under a separate authorization.", "In academic year 2013-2014, approximately 1,500 IHEs disbursed $1.2 billion in new Perkins Loans to approximately 539,000 students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Is the Perkins Loan program currently authorized?", "paragraphs": ["The authorization of appropriations under HEA Section 461(b)(1), for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make FCCs to IHEs for their revolving Perkins Loan funds, expired at the end of FY2014.

The authorized level of appropriations for a program in the additional year shall be the same as that for the terminal year of the program. Thus, because Congress did not extend or repeal the Perkins Loan program prior to its expiration on September 30, 2014, the authorization of appropriations for the program was automatically extended for an additional year, through FY2015.", "ED considers the authorization of appropriations under HEA Section 461(b)(1) to control the duration of the Perkins Loan program and has interpreted this section, along with the automatic one-year extension under GEPA Section 422, to mean that the Perkins Loan program is authorized through September 30, 2015.

However, when IHEs end their participation in the Perkins Loan program, they are required to assign any outstanding loans to ED for collection.

Under this provision, each participating IHE was to pay the Secretary an amount of the fund proportional to the FCCs paid by the Secretary and IHEs would have retained the remaining balance. Similarly, HEA Section 466(b) provides that after October 1, 2012, each participating IHE was to pay the Secretary the same proportion of any borrower payments in principal and interest on student loans made under the program (this is known as a distribution of late collections), with the IHE retaining any remaining balance.", "Although the HEA required the start of the distribution of assets and late collections by October 1, 2012, at the latest, ED determined that Section 461 of the HEA, which authorized appropriations for the Perkins Loan programs through FY2014, and Section 422 of GEPA, which authorizes an automatic one-year extension of appropriations through FY2015, supersede the October 1, 2012, distribution provisions.
