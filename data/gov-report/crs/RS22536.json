Interested companies prepare their offers in response to the solicitation, and, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), agency personnel evaluate the offers. Another type of procurement opportunity for a company is to serve as a subcontractor for a government contractor. To be eligible to compete for government contracts, a company must obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and register with the federal government's System for Award Management (SAM). Several agencies, such as the General Services Administration (GSA), provide assistance and services to existing and potential government contractors.

A contracting officer may need to determine, for example, whether to use a federal supply schedule (see below ), what type of contract to use, whether simplified acquisition procedures may be used, or whether the procurement should be set aside for small businesses.

At a minimum, a solicitation identifies what an agency wants to buy, provides instructions to would-be offerors, identifies the source selection method that will be used to evaluate offers, and includes a deadline for the submission of bids or proposals. Agencies also may post solicitations on their own websites and, in exceptional circumstances, may post solicitations on their websites instead of on FedBizOpps.

", "The awarding of a contract marks the beginning of the next stage in the acquisition process: contract performance and contract administration. Contract administration, which is the responsibility of agency personnel, helps to assure that the government gets what it paid for in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness and also helps to assure that the government fulfills its obligations vis-a-vis the contractor. The processes, activities, and events that occur during contract administration vary from procurement to procurement, though this stage would include invoice processing and payments to the contractor, and may include, among other functions and activities, a post-award orientation, performance monitoring, and contract modifications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Resources for Businesses", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governmental Resources", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Services Administration (GSA)", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration is perhaps best known, in terms of contracting opportunities and resources, as the agency that maintains numerous supply schedules.
