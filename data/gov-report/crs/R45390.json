The AIR Commission shall review the VA's recommendations but may not alter them, unless it determines that one or more recommendations are inconsistent with the criteria. The commission shall submit the list of recommendations to the President, who shall either approve the list in its entirety or send it back to the AIR Commission. The AIR Commission may change the recommendations and resubmit a revised list to the President for reconsideration. The President may approve or disapprove of the revised list.

Some believe that the best course for veterans is to provide all needed care in facilities under the direct jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), health care system. On the other hand, some see the use of private sector providers as important in ensuring veterans' access to a comprehensive slate of services (in particular, to specialty services that are needed infrequently), or in addressing geographic or other access barriers, such as long wait times for an appointment. In addition, those who believe that all needed care should be provided by VA providers in VA-owned facilities express concern that private sector options for providing care to veterans may dilute the quality of care in the VA health care system, and could fail to leverage key strengths of the VA health care network.", "Furthermore, studies have shown that private sector community providers may not have the necessary training and skills to provide \"complex and specialized multidisciplinary care including integrated behavioral health services that many veterans require.\" Some are concerned that if veterans leave the VA health care system for the private sector, some VHA sites and specialized medical services may be eliminated from the VA health care system, if comparable care is provided in the private sector. However, some propose that over the long term, having private sector options could improve the quality of services within the VA health care system through competition. Reaching the correct balance between providing care through VHA's health care system and through non-VA community providers has been an issue for policymakers, as well as for the VA and other stakeholders, for many years. On June 6, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION Act of 2018 ( S. 2372 ; P.L. 115-182 ; H.Rept. 115-671 ). The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018 ( S. 3479 ; P.L. 115-251 ), enacted on September 29, 2018, made some changes and technical amendments to the VA MISSION Act. Section 101 of this act, establishing the Veterans Community Care Program, or VCCP, is a legislative outcome of this long-standing policy debate on the role of the private sector in the delivery of health care to the nation's veterans. ", "To understand the key amendments made by the VA MISSION Act with respect to care provided through private sector community providers, this report begins with a brief history of key legislative changes to community care passed by Congress from the 1920s onwards. It should be noted that over the years, care provided through private sector providers has been known by many names, including \"Hometown Medical Program,\" \"Non-VA Fee Care,\" \"Fee-Basis Care,\" \"Purchased Care,\" \"Preauthorized Care,\" and the \"Fee-Care Program,\" among others. In this report, such care is referred to as the Veterans Community Care Program, or VCCP, as established by the VA MISSION Act. Following the brief legislative history of VA provided community care, the report describes the background and legislative history leading up to the enactment of the VA MISSION Act. This is followed by summaries of the major provisions in the VA MISSION Act by title. The report concludes with an appendix providing implementation and reporting deadlines contained in the VA MISSION Act. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief Legislative History of Community Care", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1920s, Congress has authorized the VA to contract for care in the community. For instance, the World War Veterans Act of 1924 (P.L. 68-242), enacted on June 7, 1924, included language that authorized the Director of the then Veterans Bureau to contract with private facilities in exceptional cases: ", "In the event Government hospital facilities are insufficient or inadequate the director may contract with State, municipal, or in exceptional cases, with private hospitals for such medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies as may be required, and such contracts may be made for a period of not exceeding three years and may be for the use of a ward or other hospital unit or on such other basis as may be in the best interest of the beneficiaries under this Act.", "VA's Hometown Medical Care Program, which was also known as the fee-basis care program, was established by the VA in FY1946, and under this program the VA entered into contracts with state medical societies, or with designated agencies for authorized services, and was reimbursed based on a VA fee schedule. Generally, the Hometown Medical Program was used to provide out-patient care\u2014including dental care for veterans who were in need of treatment for a service-connected disability\u2014because at that time outpatient care was generally authorized for treatment of service-connected disabilities. According to VA's annual report from FY1950: ", "This program has saved veterans many hours they would otherwise have been required to use in traveling to and from VA clinics, some of which would have been lost from their work. The convenience of treatment in their own hometown, together with the privilege of being treated by a doctor of their own choice, has made this [program] highly acceptable to veteran-patients. ", "In June 1957, Congress passed the Veterans' Benefit Act of 1957 (P.L. 85-56), which provided the VA the authority to contract with private facilities \"in order to provide hospital care (i) in emergency cases for persons suffering from service-connected disabilities or from disabilities for which such persons were discharged or released from the active military, naval, or air service; (ii) for women veterans of any war; or (iii) for veterans of any war in a Territory, Commonwealth, or possession of the United States.\" ", "The Veterans Health Care Expansion Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-82 ) broadly expanded out-patient care to nonservice-connected veterans, and by 1976, to address the \"patient and staff complaints generated by the overcrowded conditions in outpatient programs and ambulatory care services at VA health care facilities across the Nation.\" Congress passed the Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-581 ). This law made several changes to the fee-basis program. It added current (38 U.S.C. \u00a71703) statutory language stating that \"when facilities [Departmental] are not capable of furnishing economical care because of geographical inaccessibility or of furnishing the care or services required\" and further limited fee-basis or contract care to specific categories of veterans. These included veterans receiving hospital care or medical services for the treatment of a service-connected disability or a disability for which a veteran was discharged or released from the active military, naval, or air service, among other categories. ", "Further changes made by the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1979 ( P.L. 96-22 ) provided authority for fee-basis care for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities and in receipt of increased pension or other additional compensation who are in need of regular aid and attendance or who are housebound. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Veterans' Health-Care Amendments of 1986; P.L. 99-272 ) clarified the definition of the term \"Veterans' Administration facilities\" and authorized the VA to contract for medical care in private facilities. These and other legislative changes in subsequent Congresses eventually became codified at Title 38 United State Code (U.S.C.) section 1703. This section was completely amended by the VA MISSION Act ( S. 2372 ; P.L. 115-182 ; H.Rept. 115-671 ; and P.L. 115-251 ). ", "Over time, Congress has authorized additional programs to provide care through non-VA community providers or entities, each with their own unique requirements. In general, the VA MISSION Act amends the legal framework around several existing veterans care programs: the Veterans Choice Program (38 U.S.C. \u00a71701 note), Traditional VA Care in the Community (38 U.S.C. \u00a71703), Project ARCH (Access Received Closer to Home) (38 U.S.C. \u00a71703 note), community nursing home and adult health day care, home health care services, respite care, and hospice care (38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71720; 1720B and 1720C). It also creates a new program for walk-in care (38 U.S.C. \u00a71725A). However, it leaves intact other statutory provisions for emergency care for nonservice-connected conditions to certain veterans (38 U.S.C. \u00a71725), authority to provide reimbursement for emergency care for service-connected veterans (38 U.S.C. \u00a71728), authority to share health care resources with the Department of Defense (38 U.S.C. \u00a78111), health care sharing and contracting authority (38 U.S.C. \u00a78153), and agreements with Indian Health Service and tribal health program providers (25 U.S.C. \u00a71645)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Legislative History of the VA MISSION Act", "paragraphs": ["In response to the allegations of wait time manipulation and access issues at many VHA hospitals and clinics across the country, which were brought to the attention of congressional committees in the spring and summer of 2014, the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA; P.L. 113-146 , as amended) was enacted. This act, among other things, established the temporary Veterans Choice Program (VCP), which authorized veterans meeting certain criteria, such as wait times for appointments and distance from the nearest VA medical facility, to access care in the community. In addition, Section 802 of VACAA established the Veterans Choice Fund (VCF) and provided $10 billion in mandatory appropriations. ", "Significant challenges surrounding the implementation of the VCP are documented in several VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports, as well as congressional hearings.", "Acknowledging these implementation challenges associated with VCP, as well as the confusing and complex community care landscape created by the various statutory authorities, coupled with pilot programs such as Project Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) and Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3), Congress passed the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-41 ) and mandated the VA to provide a plan to consolidate existing community care programs. This plan was submitted to Congress on October 30, 2015. Numerous hearings were held during the 114 th Congress, and several measures were introduced to incorporate many of the concepts addressed in the VA's Plan to Consolidate Programs of Department of Veterans Affairs to Improve Access to Care , such as the Improving Veterans Access to Care in the Community Act ( S. 2633 ) and the Veterans Choice Improvement Act of 2016 ( S. 2646 ). However, at the end of the 114 th Congress, no major legislative action occurred to revamp and consolidate veterans community care programs. ", "At the beginning of the 115 th Congress, once again Congress faced implementation issues regarding the VCP, including its expiration in August 2017 and funding shortfalls. In response to this, Congress passed P.L. 115-26 (unofficially referred to as the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act), eliminated the August 7, 2017, sunset date, and allowed the VCP to continue until all funds in the VCF were expended. Later in 2017, as VCF funding was diminishing, Congress passed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-46 ), and P.L. 115-96 , and provided additional funding of $4.2 billion to continue VCP. ", "In the meantime, on October 6, 2017, the VA submitted to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees another plan to consolidate and streamline community care programs to replace the VCP. This plan, known as the Veterans Coordinated Access & Rewarding Experiences (CARE) plan, made additional enhancements to the initial plan that was provided in October 2015. More specifically, it focused on eligibility criteria for veterans to access care in the community, with criteria based on clinical need, quality of care, and convenience\u2014which had not been specifically addressed in the October 2015 plan. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee (HVAC) held a hearing on the CARE plan and other legislative proposals on October 24, 2017. Based on major concepts in this plan and other legislative proposals, the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees began drafting legislation. On November 3, 2017, the VA Care in the Community Act ( H.R. 4242 ) was introduced, and the measure was marked up by the HVAC and ordered reported as amended on December 19, 2017. It was subsequently reported with an amendment by the HVAC ( H.Rept. 115-585 ) on March 5, 2018. On November 29, 2017, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee (SVAC) marked up a draft measure, and it was reported to the Senate on December 5, 2017, entitled the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2017 ( S. 2193 ; S.Rept. 115-212 ). However, no further action occurred at the close of the first session of the 115 th Congress.", "At the beginning of the second session of the 115 th Congress, combining various provisions of the VA Care in the Community Act ( H.R. 4242 ; H.Rept. 115-585 ), the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017 ( H.R. 4243 ), and the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2017 ( S. 2193 ; S.Rept. 115-212 ), HVAC Chairman Dr. Phil Roe introduced the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION Act of 2018 ( H.R. 5674 ), on May 3, 2018. The HVAC marked up the legislation on May 8. The measure was reported by the HVAC on May 11 ( H.Rept. 115-671 , Part 1). The text of H.R. 5674 was then substituted as an amendment to S. 2372 and modified to include a new short title known as the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018. The House passed S. 2372 on May 16. The Senate began consideration of the House amendment to S. 2372 on May 17, and it passed the measure by concurring to the House amendment to S. 2372 on May 23.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this amount would continue to provide funding for the current VCP until about the first half of calendar year 2019. Excluding this direct appropriation, the CBO estimates that implementing all the provisions of the VA MISSION Act would cost approximately $46.5 billion over the FY2019-FY2023 time frame, subject to discretionary appropriations from Congress.

The last major comprehensive review of VA real property and medical facilities throughout the country was done under the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) program. In October 2000, the VA established the CARES program with the goal of evaluating the projected health care needs of veterans over the next 20 years and of realigning VA's infrastructure to better meet those needs. In August 2003, VA's then-Undersecretary for Health issued a preliminary Draft National CARES Plan (DNCP). The DNCP, among other things, recommended that seven VA health care facilities close and that duplicative clinical and administrative services delivered at over 30 other VHA facilities be eliminated. The sites slated to be closed were in the following locations: Canandaigua, NY; Pittsburgh, PA (Highland Drive Division); Lexington, KY (Leestown Division); Cleveland, OH (Brecksville Unit); Gulfport, MS; Waco, TX; and Livermore, CA. Patients currently receiving services at these VHA facilities would have been provided care at other nearby sites. The DNCP recommended that new major medical facilities be built in Las Vegas, NV, and East Central, FL. Furthermore, the DNCP recommended significant infrastructure upgrades at numerous sites including, at or near locations where the VA proposed to close facilities. In addition, the draft plan called for the establishment of 48 new high-priority Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).", "Following the release of the DNCP, the then-VA Secretary Anthony Principi appointed a 16-member independent commission to study the draft plan. The commission was composed of individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds outside of the federal government. The CARES Commission developed and applied six factors in the review of each proposal in the DNCP: (1) impact on veterans' access to health care, (2) impact on health care quality, (3) veteran and stakeholder views, (4) economic impact on the community, (5) impact on VA missions and goals, and (6) cost to the government. The commission conducted 38 public hearings and 81 site visits throughout 2003 and submitted its recommendations to the Secretary in February 2004. After reviewing the recommendations, the then Secretary announced the final details of the CARES plan in May 2004 (Secretary's CARES Decision). The final plan called for consolidating several facilities, as well as building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas; adding 156 new CBOCs, four new spinal cord injury centers, and two blind rehabilitation centers; and expanding mental health outpatient services nationwide. However, critics of the CARES plan contended that closures were considered without assessing what kind of facilities would be needed for long-term care and mental health care in the future. Also, some believed that the CARES plan did not focus enough on future nursing home needs, would leave the VA short of beds in a few decades, and, as a result, would leave the VA with no choice but to privatize some parts of the health care system. Moreover, some veterans' groups believed that CARES was only about closing \"surplus\" hospitals and did not believe that CARES would result in the building of new and modern facilities. Finally, the closure of some VA medical facilities raised serious concern among some Members of Congress who felt that they had little control over the CARES process.", "The Independent Assessment required by Section 201 of VACAA found that", "[c]urrent facilities, whether they have been maintained adequately or not, often do not match current models of care. The overwhelming majority of VHA hospitals were designed when care was focused more heavily around inpatient hospital treatments. Over the past eight years, Veteran inpatient bed days of care have declined nearly ten percent while outpatient clinic workload has increased more than 40 percent. Space for outpatient care is typically housed in converted inpatient spaces or VHA's growing number of clinics. As a result, VHA's capital needs fall into a broad range of categories, including ensuring adequate facility condition, providing sufficient and appropriate space for Veteran care, and upgrading infrastructure. As facilities age further and care continues to shift to the outpatient setting, the size of the capital need could continue to grow. ", "Furthermore, the Commission on Care was established by VACAA \"to examine the access of veterans to health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs and strategically examine how best to organize the [VHA], locate health resources, and deliver health care to veterans.\" In its final report, it recommended that the VA \"develop and implement a robust strategy for meeting and managing VHA 's facility and capital asset needs.\"", "Within this context, the HVAC began to examine VA's capital asset program in the summer of 2017. At a hearing held on July 12, 2017, the then-VA Secretary who was involved in the CARES plan testified that \"under CARES there was no requirement for Congress to adopt or reject the commission's final recommendations as a package. As a result, recommendations for some needed new hospitals and outpatient clinics were accepted. Most of those to change, realign, or maybe close the mission of other facilities were rejected.\" ", "Based on input and recommendations from various stakeholders, on November 3, 2017, the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017 ( H.R. 4243 ) was introduced; it was ordered reported on November 8 (without a written report).

Generally, the VA does not operate these programs, but it pays for resident training costs (including faculty support) during the time that a resident is at the VA.
