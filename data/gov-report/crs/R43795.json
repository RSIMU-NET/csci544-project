Although emissions increased in 2010, levels decreased again in 2011 and 2012, eventually reaching levels comparable to those from 1995.

However, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels\u2014petroleum, coal, and natural gas\u2014have received the most attention because they account for the vast majority of human-related GHG emissions: 78% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2012.", "In addition, (1) CO2 emissions from large stationary sources are easy to measure and have been tracked for almost 20 years, and (2) CO2 emissions from smaller sources can be estimated through relatively straightforward calculations. In 2012, the percentage contributions of CO2 emissions by sector were as follows:", "40% from electricity, 35% from transportation, 15% from industrial, 6% from commercial, and 4% from residential.", "Although multiple factors have some level of influence on U.S. GHG emission levels, it may be instructive to examine several broad energy-related factors including population, income, energy intensity (energy use per economic output such as gross domestic product, or GDP) and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of energy use). Although decreases in population and/or income would contribute to reducing U.S. GHG emissions, policies that would seek to directly limit these emissions drivers are essentially outside the bounds of U.S. public policy. Therefore, this report focuses on the impacts of energy intensity and carbon intensity on GHG emission levels.", "As energy use has grown at a slower rate than the economy, U.S. energy intensity declined by about 2% each year for more than two decades. Between 1990 and 2013, U.S. GDP (in 2009$) increased at an average annual rate of approximately 2.5%. Energy use, in contrast, increased from 1990 to 2000 at an annual average rate of 1.6%, but then remained relatively constant (excepting some annual fluctuations) through 2013.", "The U.S. carbon content of energy use remained relatively constant from 1990 to 2005, but by 2013, it was approximately 8% lower than in 2005. In this report, carbon intensity measures the amount of CO2 emissions generated per unit of energy used. Energy sources\u2014coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, renewables\u2014vary dramatically in the amount of carbon released per unit of energy supplied. For example, coal combustion accounts for almost twice the carbon content per unit of energy than natural gas, and some energy sources, when consumed, do not directly generate any emissions.", "This recent decrease in the carbon content of energy use is partially explained by changes in the energy sources used to generate electricity, because the electric power sector accounts for approximately 40% of total energy use. For example, between 2004 and 2013, the percentage of electricity from coal generation decreased from 50% to 39%, while the percentage of electricity generated using natural gas increased from 18% to 28%.
