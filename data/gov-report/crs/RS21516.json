In the mid-1980s, agricultureaccounted for only about 14% of the national GDP. After the imposition of U.N. sanctions and the Iraqigovernment's non-compliance with a proposed U.N. Oil-for-Food program in 1991, agriculture's share of GDP isestimatedto have risen to 35% by 1992. (1)", "Rapid population growth during the past three decades, coupled with limited arable land and a generalstagnation in agricultural productivity, has steadily increased dependence on imports to meet domestic food needssince themid-1960s. By 1980 Iraq was importing about half of its food supply. By 2002, between 80% and 100% of manybasic staples -- wheat, rice, sugar, vegetable oil, and protein meals -- were imported.", "This report will be updated if events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["RS21516 -- Iraq's Agriculture: Background and Status", "May 13, 2003"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Footnotes", "paragraphs": ["1.
