{"id": "R41782", "title": "1099 Information Reporting Requirements and Penalties: Recent Legislative Activity", "released_date": "2011-04-28T00:00:00", "summary": ["Taxpayers are seen as more likely to report items of income on their tax returns if they know that a third party has reported it to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); if follows, therefore, that expanding information reporting requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) can improve the collection of federal tax revenue. However, as those requirements are expanded, those who must comply with the requirements generally will face an increased administrative burden. This tension between the desire to improve tax compliance and the concomitant burden imposed on taxpayers was recently highlighted after expansions of the reporting requirements in IRC \u00a7 6041 were met by protests that the changes imposed too great a burden, particularly on small businesses. As a result of these objections, the expansions to the information reporting requirement were repealed shortly after they were enacted.", "IRC \u00a7 6041 requires payments totaling at least $600 in a single calendar year to a single recipient to be reported to the IRS. The required return is generally a Form 1099, which is prepared by the entity making the payment and identifies to whom payment was made, the amount of the payment, and the general reason for the payment. The form is filed with the IRS and a copy is provided to the payee. The form is required only when the payer is considered to be engaged in a trade or business and has made the payment in connection with that trade or business.", "The scope of IRC \u00a7 6041 was expanded by both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148) and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240). Section 9006 of PPACA would have made payments to corporations and payments for goods or other property subject to reporting. Section 2101 of the Small Business Jobs Act would have made most landlords subject to the reporting requirements of IRC \u00a7 6041. The expansions made by both bills were subsequently repealed by the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-9).", "The Small Business Jobs Act also increased the penalties for failure to file an information return (IRC \u00a7 6721) and the penalties for failing to provide a copy of the information return to the payee (IRC \u00a7 6722). These changes have not been repealed and will apply to any information returns required to be filed after December 31, 2010."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Taxpayers are seen as more likely to pay taxes on income if the realization of that income has been communicated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To encourage compliance with tax laws, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) includes a number of information reporting requirements regarding payments that may result in taxable income for the payee. ", "One such reporting requirement, contained in IRC \u00a7 6041(a), applies to certain payments made by persons in the course of a trade or business. Under IRC \u00a7 6041(a), if the total amount of payments made to a single payee over a year equals at least $600, the payer is required to file an information return with the IRS providing information identifying the payer, the payee, and the total amounts paid to that payee over the past calendar year. The information returns required to be filed under IRC \u00a7 6041 are typically versions of Form 1099. A copy of this information return must also be provided to the payee. Although payees may receive copies of information returns, payees are not required to file any information returns under IRC \u00a7 6041.", "Section 6041 was amended twice in 2010: once by \u00a7 9006 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and a second time by \u00a7 2101 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Both amendments were subsequently repealed by the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011. As a result, the information reporting requirements have been restored to their pre-PPACA scope. They may, however, be subject to stronger enforcement as a result of a surviving provision of the Small Business Jobs Act that revised the penalties for failing to file an accurate 1099 with the IRS or failing to provide an accurate copy of that form to the payee.", "This report briefly discusses the procedures and penalties under current law applicable to the information reporting requirements under IRC \u00a7 6041, and also briefly describes recent amendments that have been repealed.

The payees are required to provide their names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers to payers in order to facilitate information reporting. The information return must include all of these as well as the address and telephone number of the payer. It is the payer's obligation to request information from the payee, and the payee is required to provide it. The payer may use Form W-9 to request the information from U.S. persons. If the payee does not provide a taxpayer identification number, the payer is generally required to collect backup withholding from payments due to the payee.

Section 6722 has been amended to change the structure of the penalty so that it is similar to the structure of the \u00a7 6721 penalty. In so doing, the effect is that the amended penalty may be lower than it previously would have been where corrective action is taken.
