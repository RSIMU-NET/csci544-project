the internal revenue service's ( irs ) 2009 filing season is an enormous and critical undertaking . for example , timely issuance of refunds can reduce taxpayer demand for refund anticipation loans ( ral ) , which are short - term , often high - interest loans offered by tax preparers or banks that allow taxpayers to receive their refund cash quickly , sometimes within the same day . the filing season is also the time irs begins its enforcement efforts with its math error program , in which irs uses its computers to identify errors during processing , such as calculation mistakes or omitted or inconsistent entries . earlier this year , we provided an interim assessment of irs's 2009 filing season performance , made recommendations to improve irs's 2010 filing season performance , and made suggestions to congress to better ensure compliance , when tax returns are being processed , with the first - time homebuyer tax credit . reviewed irs reports and analyzed irs data on rals and racs to identify trends and opportunities to reduce taxpayers' reliance on them . rals are short - term , high interest rate bank loans . ral providers might also offer racs , which are not loans , but instead are a refund delivery option where irs direct deposits a refund into a temporary account set up by a financial institution , which withdraws the tax return preparation fee , and then makes the remaining funds available to the taxpayer . it helps taxpayers to receive their refunds faster and aids irs in achieving the electronic filing goal of having 80 percent of all federal tax and information returns filed electronically by 2012 . this accounts for about 29 percent of all returns processed . despite the heavy call volume , the accuracy of the telephone assistors' responses to tax law and account questions was higher by a statistically significant amount compared to the same period last year and exceeded irs's fiscal year 2009 goals ( see table 5 ) . according to irs officials , because contact analytics is a new program and data is only beginning to be collected , irs has not yet considered a plan to analyze the data produced by the program . while many taxpayers require service from live assistors , diverting calls to automated services is also important because of the costs involved — irs assistors answered about 26 million calls between january 1 , 2009 and june 30 , 2009 at a cost of $25.75 per call , for a total of $670 million . irs continues to launch new features on its web site to provide better access to information and reduce taxpayer burden , including the “how much was my 2008 stimulus payment” application and the recovery rebate check calculator that used the economic stimulus payment amount from 2008 along with several other factors to determine eligibility for recovery rebate credit and the appropriate amount to claim ; the online payment agreement application that provides taxpayers with an online , interactive payment agreement process that reduces the need for contact with an assistor and eliminates paper processing . they identified irs's itla in particular , for the increase in accuracy in tax law and return assistance , which is used by both irs's telephone and walk - in site assistors to provide more accurate and consistent answers to taxpayers' questions . while irs offers paper check and direct deposit options for delivering refunds to taxpayers , it has not studied the feasibility of distributing refunds electronically through debit cards . millions of taxpayers claim the hope and lifetime learning tax credits to offset qualified education expenses . if irs had authority to use information from prior years' returns to check taxpayers' eligibility , it could correct claims during processing , before refunds are issued , and enhance compliance . for example , the amount billed may not account for all scholarships or grants the student received . to reduce taxpayer confusion and enhance compliance with the eligibility requirements for higher education benefits , irs should determine the feasibility of using current information reported on form 1098-t , such as school location and taxpayer identification number or ssn , in irs's compliance programs ; and revise form 1098-t to improve the usefulness of information on qualifying education expenses . 2 below ) .
