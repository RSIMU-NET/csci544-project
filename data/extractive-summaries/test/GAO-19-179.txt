federal law encourages u.s. workers to save for retirement by authorizing tax incentives for the predominant forms of retirement savings in the united states — employer - sponsored defined contribution ( dc ) plans like 401 ( k ) plans and individual retirement accounts ( ira ) . in 2017 , dc plans and iras reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars . federal law also allows workers to access assets in employer - sponsored 401 ( k ) plans before retirement under certain circumstances , such as financial hardship . in 2013 , individuals ages 25 to 55 withdrew at least $68.7 billion early from their retirement accounts . according to irs estimates , 12 percent of ira owners in this age group withdrew money early that year from their iras in 2013 . at least $29.2 billion left 401 ( k ) plans in 2013 in the form of hardship withdrawals , cashouts at job separation , and unrepaid plan loans , according to our analysis of 2013 sipp data and data from dol's form 5500 . the amount of hardship withdrawals was equivalent to 0.5 percent ( + / - 0.06 ) of the cohort's total plan assets and 8 percent ( + / - 0.9 ) of the cohort's plan contributions made in 2013 . age . retirement assets . stakeholders we interviewed said that plan rules related to the disposition of account balances at job separation can lead participants to remove more than they need , up to and including their entire balance .  ( see fig . stakeholders said that plan participants take plan loans and hardship withdrawals for pressing financial needs . providing plan loan repayment options for separated participants: some plan sponsors allowed former participants to continue making loan repayments after job separation . they noted that any of these proposed strategies , if implemented , could ( 1 ) increase the costs of administering iras and plans , ( 2 ) require changes to federal law or regulations , and ( 3 ) involve tradeoffs between providing access to retirement savings and preserving savings for retirement . stakeholders suggested several strategies that , if implemented , could help reduce early withdrawals from iras . incorporating emergency savings features into 401 ( k ) plans: stakeholders said incorporating an emergency savings account into the 401 ( k ) plan structure may help participants absorb economic shocks and better prepare for both short - term financial needs and long - term retirement planning . to better identify the incidence and amount of loan offsets in 401 ( k ) plans nationwide , we recommend that the secretary of labor direct the assistant secretary for ebsa , in coordination with irs , to revise the form 5500 to require plan sponsors to report qualified plan loan offsets as a separate line item distinct from other types of distributions .  ( recommendation 1 ) . the objectives of this study were to determine: ( 1 ) what are the incidence and amount of retirement savings being withdrawn early ; ( 2 ) what is known about the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early ; and ( 3 ) what strategies or policies , if any , might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings . second , to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from 401 ( k ) plans , we analyzed data included in the 2014 panel of the u.s. census bureau's survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) — a nationally representative survey of household income , finances , and use of federal social safety net programs — along with retirement account contribution and withdrawal data included in the sipp's social security administration ( ssa ) supplement on retirement , pensions , and related content . we developed a common question set for each stakeholder category that we interviewed . in our interviews with plan administrators , we asked about factors that led individuals to access their retirement savings early , how plan providers interacted with companies and separating employees , available data on loans and hardship withdrawals from client retirement plans , and potential strategies to reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals . gao - 17-69 . gao - 15-556 .
