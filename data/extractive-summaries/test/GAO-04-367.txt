one way to inform this decision is to use competitive sourcing , a strategy under which agencies open the government's commercial activities to competition among public and private sector sources . therefore , after discussions with your staff , we agreed to ( 1 ) describe the progress agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program in response to the president's management agenda , ( 2 ) identify major challenges agencies are facing , and ( 3 ) identify strategies they are using to select activities for competition based on mission - related needs . by including competitive sourcing as one of five governmentwide initiatives announced in august 2001 , the administration directed agencies to implement competitive sourcing programs to achieve increased savings and to improve performance . since that time , all six civilian agencies we reviewed have established a basic competitive sourcing program infrastructure . interagency forums for sharing information also have been established . to address this challenge , the federal acquisition council is currently studying agency staffing and skill requirements . despite these additional personnel requirements , many department - level offices in the civilian agencies we reviewed have only one or two full - time staff to complete fair act inventories , interpret new laws and regulations , and oversee agency selection of positions to compete and the competitions . a final determination on army staffing requirements and capabilities has not been made . while most agencies have established vehicles for communicating their competitive sourcing goals internally — such as work groups and web sites — officials from omb report that it is difficult to convince employees that the current competitive sourcing program is designed to create value and improve efficiency , not to reduce the size of the federal workforce — as was the case with past competitive sourcing efforts . as we have previously reported , dod has also been challenged to ensure adequate funding for implementing competitive sourcing under circular a - 76 . however , some officials told us that omb recently instructed their agencies to include a line item in their fiscal year 2005 budget request for their competitive sourcing programs . several agencies have developed strategic and transparent competitive sourcing approaches by integrating their strategic and human capital plans with their competitive sourcing plans — an approach encouraged by the commercial activities panel . some of these approaches are summarized below . while omb is addressing the funding and human capital challenges that agencies face , it needs to ensure that the fair act inventory and goal - setting process is more strategic and helpful to agencies in carrying out their competitive sourcing responsibilities . to complement efforts already underway that address funding and human capital challenges and to help agencies realize the potential benefits of competitive sourcing and ensure greater transparency and accountability , we recommend that the director of omb take the following three actions: ensure greater consistency in the classification of positions as commercial or inherently governmental when positions contain a mix of commercial and inherently governmental tasks by reviewing current guidance and developing additional guidelines , as necessary , for agencies and omb examiners ; work with agencies to ensure they are more strategic in their sourcing decisions and are identifying broader functional areas and / or enterprisewide activities , as appropriate , for possible public - private competition ; and require agencies to develop competition plans that focus on achieving measurable efficiency and performance improvement outcomes . management services . appendix vii: omb scorecard criteria for the competitive sourcing initiative an omb approved “yellow” competition plan to compete an omb approved “green” competition plan to compete commercial activities available for competition ; commercial activities available for competition ; completed one standard competition or publicly announced standard competitions that exceed the number of positions identified for competition in the agency's yellow competition plan ; publicly announced standard competitions in accordance with the schedule outlined in the agency “green” competition plan ; since january 2001 , completed at least 10 competitions ( no minimum number of positions required per competition ) ; in the past two quarters , completed 75% of streamlined competitions in a 90-day timeframe ; and in the past year , completed 90% of all standard competitions in a 12-month time frame ; in the past two quarters , canceled less than 20% of publicly announced standard and streamlined competitions . as part of its one - ed approach the department developed its fair act inventory by first analyzing key processes .
