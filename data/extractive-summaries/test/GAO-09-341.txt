until recently , methadone was primarily used in opioid treatment programs ( otp ) to treat and rehabilitate people addicted to such opioids as heroin or certain prescription drugs . since the late 1990s , methadone has been increasingly prescribed by practitioners to treat their patients' pain . like many drugs , methadone can also be abused — that is , used for nontherapeutic purposes or for purposes other than those for which it was prescribed , and dangerous side effects or death can occur when methadone is combined with other drugs or alcohol . specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the regulation of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment , ( 2 ) the factors contributing to the increase in methadone - associated overdose deaths , and ( 3 ) the steps taken to prevent methadone - associated overdose deaths . we reviewed methadone poisoning death data from cdc's national vital statistics system and relevant dea data , including dea data on methadone drug items seized by law enforcement and analyzed in forensic laboratories . in addition , as of 2008 , if fda identifies postmarket safety concerns , the agency may take specific actions such as requiring drug manufacturers to make safety - related changes to a drug's labeling and requiring drug manufacturers to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a particular drug outweigh the risks . methadone is regulated as a controlled substance , under federal and state laws and regulations , when used for pain management and addiction treatment . when methadone is used for pain management , it is regulated under federal and state laws and regulations that apply to controlled substances generally and that do not impose requirements unique to methadone . the use of methadone for pain management is regulated under federal and state laws and regulations that apply to controlled substances generally and that do not impose requirements unique to methadone . although information on methadone - associated overdose deaths is limited , available data suggest that methadone's growing use for pain management has increased availability of the drug , therefore contributing to the rise in methadone - associated overdose deaths . similarly , data from ims health , a private company that tracks prescription drug trends , showed that from 1998 through 2006 the number of annual prescriptions of methadone for pain increased by about 700 percent , from about 531,000 in 1998 to about 4.1 million in 2006 . most officials from federal and state agencies , as well as experts in addiction treatment and pain management that we spoke with , cited the increased availability of methadone due to its use for pain management as a key factor in the rise in deaths , while some added that addiction treatment in otps was not related to increased deaths . several sources have also cited inadequate training among some practitioners . data and research regarding methadone - associated overdose deaths in the five states we reviewed support the idea that lack of knowledge and abuse of diverted methadone contributed to deaths , but also suggest that the circumstances under which people are dying are variable . education , safety , and monitoring efforts have been implemented to prevent methadone abuse and methadone - associated overdose deaths — either specifically or as part of broader efforts to prevent prescription drug abuse and deaths — by various federal agencies , states , and other organizations . steps taken to improve the safety of using methadone include limiting the distribution of a high - dosage methadone tablet intended only for use in addiction treatment . some officials and experts we spoke with cautioned that methadone is part of a larger problem of prescription drug abuse , and that prevention efforts focused on methadone alone might have the unintended consequence of shifting similar problems to a different drug — much like what occurred with methadone following reports of abuse and diversion of oxycontin . however , prescription drug monitoring programs have limitations . we received general comments from hhs . we also interviewed professional association officials from the american association for the treatment of opioid dependence , the federation of state medical boards , harmd ( helping america reduce methadone deaths ) , the national alliance of methadone advocates , the national association of boards of pharmacy , the national association of medical examiners , the national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors , and the national association of state controlled substances authorities . in addition , we reviewed relevant studies and reports about efforts to prevent methadone and other prescription drug overdose deaths and interviewed officials in our five selected states to learn about initiatives in their states . dosing .  - certain exceptions for emergencies . 6 ( 2007 ) .
