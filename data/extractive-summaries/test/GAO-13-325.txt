competition is the cornerstone of a sound acquisition process and a critical tool for achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers . in fiscal year 2012 , the department of defense ( dod ) obligated $359 billion through contracts and task orders , of which 57 percent was competed . for example , under far part 6 , justifications must include , at a minimum , 12 elements.these required elements include: a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and their estimated value ; identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition ; a determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable ; a description of market research conducted , if any ; and a statement of the actions , if any , the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required . since fiscal year 2008 the competition rate has declined 5.5 percentage points , from 62.6 percent in fiscal year 2008 to 57.1 percent in fiscal year 2012 ( see figure 1 ) . we also found that the competition rate for all contract obligations varied by dod component in fiscal year 2012 . a long - standing factor impacting dod's competition rate is its reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program because of a previous decision not to purchase proprietary technical data . for example , in its fiscal year 2011 competition report , the air force noted that it expected a significant impact to its fiscal year 2012 competition rate as the result of an anticipated $10 billion fms award . some justifications in our sample provided clear descriptions of sole - source environments where only one source was available to meet the government's needs , and others included detailed descriptions of planned actions that could help improve competition in the future . we also found that the one - offer requirement will likely have a limited impact on unnecessarily restrictive solicitation requirements because many awards are not subject to the program office consultation rule . unreliable data within fpds - ng hinder dod's ability to accurately measure the impact of its one - offer requirement . our analysis of 35 one - offer awards determined that 10 of these awards were incorrectly coded in fdps - ng by contracting officers . furthermore , we believe dod cannot use the data to accurately calculate the amount obligated on one - offer awards during fiscal year 2012 . without reliable data , dod cannot accurately measure the impact of the new requirement . dod does not systematically identify , track , and consider the specific factors that may be affecting competition when setting its annual competition goals . without this information , dod may be missing opportunities to gain a richer understanding of why past acquisitions were not competitive and to apply those lessons to effectively facilitate competition for future acquisitions . to better inform dod's efforts to enhance competition , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following three actions: identify and track the specific factors that affect the competition rate , such as foreign military sales , and consider this information when setting annual competition goals for each dod component ; develop guidance that could enable dod components to apply lessons learned from past procurements to increase competition for the same good and services in the future ; and develop an action plan for dod components to collect reliable data on competitive procurements for which only one offer is received , so that the department can determine the effect of its new requirement on one - offer contracts . the objectives for this review were to examine ( 1 ) trends in the department of defense's ( dod ) use of noncompetitive awards ; ( 2 ) factors influencing dod's competition rate ; ( 3 ) the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive procedures provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards ; and ( 4 ) the impact of dod's new requirement on contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one offer was received . we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to examine the trends in dod's use of noncompetitive awards and the factors influencing dod's competition rate , including the number of awards , dollar amount obligated , and the percentage of contracts awarded competitively overall and by component . to gain insight into how dod sets competition goals , we reviewed dod policy and spoke with dod officials .
