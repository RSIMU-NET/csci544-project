since dod is increasingly relying on the c - 5 aircraft as its primary airlifter , we assessed the reliability and mission capability of the aircraft and dod's current plan for modifying the c - 5 . factors accounting for the relatively poorer c - 5 mission capable rates included inadequate spare parts support , higher complexity associated with a large aircraft , and the generally poorer reliability characteristics of the older c - 5a model aircraft . amc's goal is one cannibalization action a month per aircraft . the c - 5's mission capability rates could increase if the air force were to conduct a readiness evaluation similar to the operational readiness assessment conducted for b - 1b bomber aircraft . amc established a c - 5 modernization plan to increase mission capability rates and reduce personnel requirements and life - cycle costs . we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to ( 1 ) conduct a readiness evaluation to determine how c - 5 peacetime mission capability can be improved and the costs of such improvements and ( 2 ) assess the impact of proposed aircraft modifications on c - 5 mission capability and then reprioritize the proposals according to the results of the assessment . dod stated that it has initiated some actions that would satisfy the intent of our recommendation that the air force conduct a readiness evaluation .
