on december 17 , 2003 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued proposed rules toaddress the effects of interstate transport of air pollutants on non - attainment of the national ambientair quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulates ( pm 2.5 ) and ozone ( specifically , the 8-hourstandard ) .  ( 1 ) the proposed interstate air quality ( iaq ) rule appeared in the federal register january30 , 2004 . for pm 2.5 , the proposed rule finds that the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) andnitrogen oxides ( nox ) from 28 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly todownwind non - attainment ; for ozone , the proposed rule finds that interstate transport of nox from25 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly to downwind non - attainment of the8-hour standard . with the iaq rule , epa proposes a region - wide emissions cap for nox and so 2 to be implemented in two phases - - 2010 and 2015 . based on the methodology employed in the proposedrule , epa's estimates of emissions under the caps are provided in table 1 , along with percentreductions from the basecase . epa's methodology determines the caps by applying "highly costeffective" pollution controls on electric generating units . alternativeperspectives are not addressed . from a policy standpoint , epa has presented the proposed interstate air quality rule and the accompanying proposed mercury rule as a "suite of integrated airactions" to reduce emissions of three pollutants - - so 2 , nox , and hg .  ( 41 ) the twoproposed rules are integrated in such a way that the technologies reducing so 2 andnox emissions under the interstate air quality rule also reduce enough hg emissionsto meet the 2010 reduction requirements of the proposed mercury rule . thiscombination of requirements and technology allows utilities to meet the requirementsof both rules without installing three different control technologies - - one for eachpollutant . as epa doesnot provide a cost - benefit analysis of hg reductions , it is not possible toquantitatively determine whether this decision is economically efficient in terms ofpotential hg benefits foregone by the lower reduction requirement . however , from the broader perspective of the interaction of the proposed rules with the underlying clean air act , there is a resulting lack of integration . it is likelyto be argued that the proposed rule simply adds another layer on an already multi - layered cake called the clean airact . adding a regionwide annual cap and tradeprogram on top a regulatory structure whose foundation is health - based nationalstandards that focus on the local concentration of pollutants in the ambient airpresents numerous difficulties . as a result , there are multiple inconsistencies betweenthe proposed rule and other provisions of the clean air act . these conflicts are notsurprising - - there is little epa can do to resolve them through regulation . if theadministration's goal is to restructure caa compliance strategies toward market - oriented cap and trade programswithout creating more layers and conflicts , it ispossible a statutory solution will be necessary .
