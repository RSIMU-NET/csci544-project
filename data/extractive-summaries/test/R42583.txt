the workforce investment act of 1998 ( p.l . although the programs have distinct activities and purposes , each program seeks to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities , as well as leadership development and community service activities . wia authorized funding through september 30 , 2003 ; however , wia programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts . job training and employment services for youth under wia include wia youth activities , a formula program that includes employment and other services that are provided year - round ; job corps , a program that provides job training and related services primarily at residential centers maintained by contractor organizations ; youthbuild , a competitive grant program that emphasizes job training and education in construction ; reintegration of ex - offenders , a demonstration program for juvenile and adult offenders that provides job training and other services and is authorized under wia's pilot and demonstration authority ; and youth opportunity grants ( yog ) , a multi - site demonstration program funded through fy2003 that created centers in low - income communities where youth could receive employment and other services . for further information about the programs , see crs report r40929 , vulnerable youth: employment and job training programs . members of congress and others have also continued to inquire about the effectiveness of youth workforce programs in meeting their objectives and serving the most at - risk youth . to date , only an impact evaluation of job corps has been completed ; however , dol recently awarded a contract to a social policy research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of youthbuild . in addition to these broader concerns , congress is interested in issues specific to youth activities and job corps: since the start of the youth activities program , as authorized under wia , policy makers and others have discussed the extent to which youth should have to prove their eligibility for the program . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l . 111-5 ) temporarily enabled youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the youth activities program . whether wia ought to target these older youth , particularly in light of the possible cost of doing so , could be addressed in any reauthorization legislation . related to this is the age of youth who ought to be eligible for the program . this is due to concerns that the program has had mixed performance outcomes , and that some centers are low performing . in addition , as part of their state and local workforce plans , state and local workforce investment boards would be required to describe the strategies and services that would be used in the state and local area to assist at - risk youth and out - of school youth in acquiring the following: ( 1 ) education and skills ; ( 2 ) credentials , including industry - recognized postsecondary credentials and industry - recognized credentials ; and ( 3 ) employment experience for succeeding in the labor market , including training and internships in in - demand industries or occupations important to the state and local economy ; dropout recovery activities designed to lead to the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent ; and activities combining remediation of academic skills , work readiness training , and work experience . another issue concerning youth workforce programs is the perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems that serve youth , particularly the education system . some stakeholders have suggested that greater coordination can help meet the multiple needs of youth , as intended by wia , and that existing wia infrastructure ( one - stop centers and youth councils , which are required under the youth activities program ) can facilitate coordination . a joint stw office was administered by both agencies . 803 , the reauthorization legislation that the house passed in march 2013 , states and local areas would be required to have strategies and services to assist at - risk youth , defined as low - income individuals who have a barrier to employment , and out - of - school youth ages 16 through 24 ; however , states and localities would not be required to serve a certain percentage of these young people or allocate a minimum amount of funding for such services , as required under current law . similar proposals have been put forth in prior congresses . for example , the reagan administration proposed closing all job corps centers or reducing the capacity of the program by about half to improve the efficiency of the program .
