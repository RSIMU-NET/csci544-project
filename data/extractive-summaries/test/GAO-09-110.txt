the federal government's senior corps generally represents the most experienced segment of the federal career workforce . having a diverse senior corps can be an organizational strength that can bring a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy development and implementation , strategic planning , problem solving , and decision making . for example , we issued a january 2003 report that included both a comprehensive review of career ses by race , ethnicity , and gender governmentwide as of october 2000 and a statistically estimated projection of what the profile of the ses would be in october 2007 if appointment and separation trends did not change . as requested , this report updates our january 2003 report and provides information ( 1 ) on the representation of women and minorities in the ses and the ses developmental pool ( i.e. , gs - 15 and gs - 14 positions ) for the executive branch as of fiscal year 2007 and compares this representation to fiscal year 2000 levels and to levels we projected for the end of fiscal year 2007 in our 2003 report ; ( 2 ) for fiscal years 2000 and 2007 , the average age at which women and minorities were appointed to and retired from the ses , the average length of service among those appointed to the ses in fiscal year 1990 , as well as information for 2000 and 2007 on the representation of individuals with targeted disabilities among the ses ; and ( 3 ) on the overall processes used in executive branch agencies for selecting and certifying members into the ses . for this report , we extracted representation data for the ses and the ses developmental pool governmentwide and by chief financial officers act ( cfo ) agencies for october 2000 and september 2007 from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) . we also calculated how long individuals , on average , served in the ses . as we reported in 2003 , the gender , racial , and ethnic profiles of the career ses at the 24 cfo act agencies varied significantly in october 2000 . table 7 also shows that women stayed in the ses longer than men ; women who voluntarily retired stayed , on average , for 11.4 years , and men who voluntarily retired stayed , on average , for 8.8 years . the average length of service among minorities ranged from 4.1 years for asian / pacific islander women to 12 years for american indian / alaska native men . candidates who are selected must have their executive qualifications certified by an opm - administered qualifications review board ( qrb ) before being appointed to the ses . in addition , opm guidance states that qrb members cannot review candidates from their own agencies .
