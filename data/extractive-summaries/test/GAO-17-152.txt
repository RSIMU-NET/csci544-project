amo also operates the tethered aerostat radar system ( tars ) program which includes fixed site , aerostat - based radar systems that provide air surveillance across the southern u.s. border and in puerto rico . you asked us to review cbp's use of uas and aerostats , including predator b uas , tars , tactical aerostats , and small uas and its efforts to assess their effectiveness to secure the border . findings from our observations and interviews cannot be generalized to all occurrences of cbp's use of predator b uas and aerostats , but provided insights into how these assets are used and contribute to border security operations along u.s. borders . for tactical aerostats and tars , we reviewed cbp documents and information related to its use of tars and tactical aerostats for border security activities . with regard to cbp's use of predator b aircraft in support of government agencies , based on our analysis of cbp data , we found that half of all predator b flight hours from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 ( 51 percent ) were in support of border patrol to help , among other things , in its efforts to detect the illegal entry of goods and people between u.s. ports of entry . without documenting its procedures for coordination of predator b operations with supported agencies , cbp does not have reasonable assurance that practices at nasocs in texas and north dakota align with existing policies and procedures for joint operations with other government agencies . asset assists . we also found users did not consistently record information on asset assists for predator b missions . however , by not logging or recording these requests in its system for recording predator b mission data , cbp does not document in a single system complete information about its use of predator b aircraft for non - cbp law enforcement purposes , such as the names of the state and local government agencies supported , making it more difficult for cbp to analyze its predator b mission data . second , with regard to data , cbp collects and tracks data on its use of tactical aerostats to assess effectiveness , including data on ( 1 ) operational availability ( i.e. , percentage of time an aerostat is in flight providing surveillance data to cbp ) , ( 2 ) asset assists for apprehensions of individuals and seizures of narcotics , and ( 3 ) the number of detections of items of interest . due to the constant change in cross - border illegal activity , costs associated with re - deployment of tactical aerostat sites ( between $60,000 to over $100,000 per site ) , and time needed to locate and obtain access for land use for re - deployment , better data collection practices to distinguish between asset assists associated with tactical aerostats and tars would help cbp to better ensure its data are complete to help guide resource allocation decisions . cbp established a performance goal of greater than 64 percent operational availability across all eight tars sites . cbp uses a variety of technologies and assets to secure the border , including predator b uas . by documenting its procedures in all operating locations , cbp could better oversee coordination procedures as use changes based on needs and cross - border illegal activity . cbp uses tactical aerostats in south texas to support border patrol's ability to detect and interdict cross - border illegal activity . to improve its efforts to coordinate predator b operations among supported agencies and assess the effectiveness of its predator b and tactical aerostat programs , we recommend that the commissioner of cbp take the following five actions: develop and document procedures for predator b coordination among supported agencies in all operating locations . with regard to the second recommendation related to updating and maintaining guidance for recording predator b mission information in its data collection system , dhs concurred and stated that cbp will take actions to update and maintain guidance for recording predator b mission information , including incorporating a new functionality in its data collection system to include tips and guidance for recording predator b mission information and updating its user manual for its data collection system by september 2019 . the purpose of the assessment was to assess the capability of small uas technology to provide situational awareness to support border patrol's mission along the southwest u.s. - mexico border and the ability of border patrol agents to employ small uas . this report addresses the following questions: how does u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) use unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) and aerostats for border security activities , and to what extent has cbp developed and documented procedures for uas coordination ? . as mentioned earlier , the asset assist data field “aerostat” does not distinguish asset assists identified by border patrol agents from u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) tactical aerostats and tethered aerostat radar system program .
