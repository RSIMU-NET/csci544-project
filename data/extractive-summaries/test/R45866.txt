members may invoke this mechanism during debate on the house floor or in the committee of the whole . it may also be invoked in the standing and select committees of the house . the phrase taken down , as described in the rule , refers to the writing down of the words objected to so they may be read back to the house by the clerk . following the reading of the allegedly unparliamentary remarks , the speaker of the house ( or , if the words are spoken in a committee , the chair of the committee ) will determine whether the words are in order . the standing rules of the house do not state explicitly what language is considered to be disorderly , although clause 1 ( b ) of rule xvii prohibits members from engaging in "personalities" in debate . when ruling on the words objected to , the presiding officer considers the words themselves , as well as the context in which they were used , and bases the ruling on these precedents . on the floor , the parliamentarian advises the speaker based on recorded precedents . the office of the parliamentarian is not responsible for providing procedural assistance during committee meetings , although the chair could attempt to consult with the parliamentarian in advance of or during such meetings . rule xvii , clause 4 , details the procedure for demanding that words be taken down: ( a ) if a member , delegate , or resident commissioner , in speaking or otherwise , transgresses the rules of the house , the speaker shall , or a member , delegate , or resident commissioner may , call to order the offending member , delegate , or resident commissioner , who shall immediately sit down unless permitted on motion of another member , delegate , or the resident commissioner to explain . if neither occurs , then the clerk will read the words to the house , and the presiding officer will make a ruling on the remarks: in the opinion of the chair , the words in question [were / were not] in order . the presiding officer's ruling is subject to appeal , and that appeal is subject to a motion to table . if the presiding officer rules that the words are out of order ( and if this ruling is sustained following any appeal ) , the words are usually stricken from the congressional record by unanimous consent . alternatively , a member ( although not the member whose words were taken down ) may make a motion to remove the disorderly language from the record , on which the house will vote: i move that the words of the gentleman / gentlewoman from [state] be stricken from the record . in the event that a member's words are ruled out of order , that member may not be recognized to speak for the rest of the day ( even on yielded time ) or insert undelivered remarks into the record unless the member is allowed to proceed in order by the house . this practice was formally adopted as part of the standing rules of the house in 1837 . the original rule , which introduced the need for the demand to be timely , stated: if a member be called to order for words spoken in debate , the person calling him to order shall repeat the words excepted to , and they shall be taken down in writing at the clerk's table ; and no member shall be held to answer , or be subject to the censure of the house , for words spoken in debate , if any other member has spoken , or other business has intervened , after the words spoken , and before exception to them shall have been taken . following the determination that the remarks were out of order , the words were usually stricken from the record by unanimous consent at the initiative of the speaker .
