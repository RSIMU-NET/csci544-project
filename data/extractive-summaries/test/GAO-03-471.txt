over the past decade , we and others have raised concerns about the adequacy of security at nuclear weapons facilities within the department of energy ( doe ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) â€” a separately organized agency within doe . nnsa has not been fully effective in managing its safeguards and security program in four key areas , and therefore , it cannot be assured that its contractors are working to maximum advantage to protect its sites . first , nnsa has not fully defined safeguards and security roles and responsibilities . this uncertainty has resulted in inconsistencies in how site offices comply with doe orders in assessing contractors . finally , nnsa's shortfalls at its site offices in the total number of staff and expertise could make it more difficult for the site offices to oversee safeguards and security effectively . however , nnsa needs a stable structure to establish clear roles and responsibilities for its headquarters and site offices , including safeguards and security oversight . nnsa site offices are not consistent in how they assess contractor safeguards and security activities , and they may not be conducting these assessments in accordance with doe policy . consistency problems are likely to continue without effective nnsa guidance for corrective actions . as a result , nnsa cannot be assured that all contractors are considering the costs of corrective actions in conjunction with the risk posed or the potential benefits to be gained . in order to strengthen the safeguards and security program of the nuclear weapons complex , we recommend that the nnsa administrator and secretary of energy formalize the roles and responsibilities of site offices and headquarters for conducting oversight ; ensure that sites are performing oversight using a survey approach that provides an integrated comprehensive view of security conditions and is consistent with doe orders ; ensure that contractors' corrective action plans are prepared and documented consistently and are based on qualitative root - cause , risk - assessment , and cost - benefit analyses , and that appropriate incentives are used to help motivate contractors toward effectively addressing findings ; and develop and implement a plan to ensure that nnsa allocates safeguards and security staff so that it provides effective safeguards and security oversight over the long term .
