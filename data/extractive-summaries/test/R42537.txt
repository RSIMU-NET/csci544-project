recent congressional interest in u.s. energy policy has focused in part on ways through which the united states could secure more economical and reliable petroleum resources both domestically and internationally . many forecasters identify petroleum products refined from canadian oil sands as one possible solution . further , the infrastructure to produce , upgrade , refine , and transport the resource from canadian oil sands reserves to the united states is in place , and additional infrastructure projects — such as the keystone xl pipeline — have been proposed . increased production from canadian oil sands , however , is not without controversy , as many have expressed concern over the potential environmental impacts . these impacts may include increased water and natural gas use , disturbance of mined land , effects on wildlife and water quality , trans - boundary air pollution , and emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) during extraction and processing . a number of key studies in recent literature have expressed findings that ghg emissions per unit of energy produced from canadian oil sands crudes are higher than those of other crudes imported , refined , and consumed in the united states . while ghg emissions and other air quality issues originating in the upstream sectors of canada's petroleum industry may not directly impact u.s. national emissions inventories or u.s. ghg reporting per se , many environmental stakeholders and policy makers have noted that the increased use of more emission - intensive resources in the united states may have negative consequences for both u.s. and global energy and environmental policy . the u.s. department of state ( dos ) , in response to comments on the 2010 draft supplementary environmental impact statement ( 2010 draft eis ) for the keystone xl pipeline project ( which would connect oil sands production facilities in the western canadian sedimentary basin with refinery facilities in the united states ) , commissioned a contractor to analyze the life - cycle ghg emissions associated with these resources in comparison to other reference crudes . hence , the 2014 final eis made similar findings to the 2011 final eis , including the following: 1 . canadian oil sands crudes "are more ghg - intensive than the other heavy crudes they would replace or displace in u.s. refineries , and emit an estimated 17% more ghgs on a life - cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the united states in 2005," and 2 . opponents of the pipeline , however , are critical of this impact assessment . the results of an lca can be used to evaluate the ghg emissions intensity of various stages of the fuel's life cycle , as well as to compare the emissions intensity of one type of fuel or method of production to another . other lcas ( e.g. , well - to - tank [wtt] or well - to - refinery gate [wtr] ) establish different ( i.e. , more specific ) life - cycle boundaries to evaluate emissions ( see figure 1 ) . inclusion of the final combustion phase allows for the most complete picture of petroleum's impact on ghg emissions , as this phase can contribute up to 70% - 80% of wtw emissions . life - cycle assessment has emerged as an influential methodology for collecting , analyzing , and comparing the ghg emissions and climate change implications of various hydrocarbon resources .
