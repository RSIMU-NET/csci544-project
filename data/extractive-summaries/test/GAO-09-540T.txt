specifically , section 1611 ( a ) of the ndaa 2008 directs dod and va to cover four key areas — ( 1 ) care and management , ( 2 ) medical evaluation and disability evaluation , ( 3 ) the return of servicemembers to active duty , and ( 4 ) the transition of recovering servicemembers from dod to va. because of the related ongoing work of the soc , it assumed responsibility for addressing these requirements . in my testimony today , i will discuss our preliminary findings on ( 1 ) the progress dod and va have made in jointly developing comprehensive policies for recovering servicemembers in the areas of care and management , medical and disability evaluation , return to active duty , and transition from care and services received from dod to va as required by sections 1611 through 1614 of the ndaa 2008 and ( 2 ) the challenges dod and va are encountering in the joint development and initial implementation of these policies . in conducting our work , we interviewed the acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness , the executive director and chief of staff of the soc , the departmental co - leads for most of the soc work groups , the acting director of dod's office of transition policy and care coordination , and other relevant dod and va officials . we shared the information contained in this statement with dod and va officials , and they agreed with the information we presented . we found that more than two - thirds of the requirements for dod's and va's joint policy development to improve the care and management of recovering servicemembers have been completed while the remaining requirements are in progress . most of the completed requirements were addressed in dod's january 2009 directive - type memorandum ( dtm ) , which was developed in consultation with va . this policy instruction will contain more detailed information on the policies outlined in the dtm . according to an agency official , further assessment of the feasibility and advisability of consolidation will be conducted . dod has completed the requirement for establishing standards for determining the return of recovering servicemembers to active duty . a va official reported that va plans to separately issue policy guidance addressing the requirements for transitioning servicemembers from dod to va in june 2009 . according to officials , these challenges contributed to the length of time required to issue policy guidance , and in some cases the challenges have not yet been completely resolved . finally , recent changes to the soc staff , including dod's organizational changes for staff supporting the soc , could pose challenges to the development of policy affecting recovering servicemembers . many of these challenges have been addressed , but some have yet to be completely resolved . establishing standard definitions for operational terms . dod and va officials told us that policy development for these issues was difficult . in march 2009 , va officials told us that they were developing a policy to clarify this issue . since december 2008 , the soc has experienced turnover in leadership and changes in policy development responsibilities . they point out that the soc's temporary staffing situation needed to be addressed , and also that the two new offices were created to support the soc and provide focus on the implementation of key policy initiatives developed by the soc — primarily the disability evaluation system pilot and the new case management programs . however , it is too soon to determine how well dod's new structure will work in conjunction with the soc . while the soc will remain responsible for policy matters directly related to recovering servicemembers , a number of policy issues may now be directed to the joint executive council , including issues that the soc had previously addressed .
