the internal revenue service ( irs ) relies extensively on information technology ( it ) systems to annually collect more than $2 trillion in taxes , distribute more than $300 billion in refunds , and carry out its mission of providing service to america's taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations . of this amount , irs expected to spend about $2.4 billion on it investments . however , tigta's review determined we reported in april 2014 , that 6 of irs's 19 major it investments were within 10 percent of cost and schedule estimates during fiscal year 2013 ; however , the reported variances were for the fiscal year only , and we therefore noted that irs's reporting would be more meaningful if supplemented with cumulative cost and schedule variances for the investments or investment segments . irs has made limited progress in improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope performance information: it has partially implemented two of our five related recommendations and not yet addressed the remaining three . irs's implementation of these recommendations is critical in ensuring that congress receives the reliable information it needs for effective oversight and decision making . specifically , while the 13 investments had a risk rating of “green” during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 , 12 of these investments reported a risk rating of “yellow” during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 , and 1 investment reported a risk rating of “red.” according to the deputy chief information officer for strategy and modernization , the chief technology officer and deputy chief information officers meet quarterly to make a broad assessment of the major it investments , and as a result , assign summary - level risk ratings for 13 of the major it investments . selected investments experienced variances from initial cost , schedule , and scope goals that were not transparent in congressional reporting because irs has yet to address our prior recommendations for reporting at the investment level and on progress in delivering scope . specifically , rrp has so far exceeded planned costs by $86.5 million and has yet to deliver functionality that was scheduled for september 2012 , in large part due to the need to implement new technology and a lack of adequate resources , including contracting expertise and staff ; a key phase of cade 2 was developed 10 months late and at $183.6 million more than planned ; and the irdm case management project was cancelled . in addition , the reports on the status of testing for the aca investment are not comprehensive , making it difficult to determine whether all required testing is being performed . in addition , these reports were not aligned with the manner in which aca testing is being performed . in his written comments , the commissioner stated that irs appreciated the acknowledgment of progress it had made to address two prior year recommendations to improve the consistency and timeliness in reporting cost , schedule and scope information for its major information technology ( it ) investments , but disagreed with our assessment of its efforts to address three prior recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information . accordingly , we believe our recommendation is still warranted . our objectives were to ( 1 ) evaluate irs's efforts to address our recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information ; ( 2 ) summarize the reported cost , schedule , and performance of irs's major it investments ; and ( 3 ) assess the status and plans of selected investments . we assessed a recommendation as being fully addressed if irs provided evidence that it fully addressed our recommendation ; partially addressed if irs provided evidence that it addressed our recommendation to some extent ; and not addressed if irs did not provide any evidence that it addressed our recommendation . for our third objective , we selected return review program ( rrp ) , customer account data engine 2 ( cade 2 ) , and information reporting and document matching ( irdm ) because the cost , schedule , or scope of these investments had changed from initial plans ; and the affordable care act administration ( aca ) investment due to the investment's criticality to the 2015 tax filing season and the significant amount of resources expected to be expended .
