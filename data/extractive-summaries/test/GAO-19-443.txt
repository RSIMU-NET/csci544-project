in recent years , railroad workers and communities have expressed concerns regarding the safety of railroads operating longer freight trains , some of which are nearly 3 miles long . this report examines what is known about changes in freight train length over time , views of selected stakeholders on safety considerations for operating longer trains and the potential impact of these trains on communities , and the extent to which fra is assessing any safety risks of operating longer trains . freight railroads are responsible for the safety of their trains , tracks , and personnel . according to officials from all seven class i freight railroads and representatives from aar , fra , stb , and other stakeholders we interviewed , freight train - length has increased in recent years ; however , the data are limited . according to data that two class i railroads provided to us , their average train length increased over the 10-year period of 2008 through 2017 by about 1,500 feet for one railroad ( from about 6,000 to 7,500 feet , or up to about 1.4 miles ) and about 1,200 feet for the other railroad ( from about 4,900 to 6,100 feet , or up to about 1.2 miles ) . additionally , railroad officials said that running longer trains can mean that they do not need to operate as many trains — officials from six class i railroads specifically indicated they are operating fewer shorter trains as a result of operating longer trains . for example , fra has investigated accidents in which it determined that train makeup and handling were the probable cause and contributing factors in train derailments of longer freight trains . while there are no comprehensive federal regulations that govern train makeup , including use of dp locomotives , representatives of class i railroads told us they consider a variety of factors when determining train makeup to ensure safe operation of all of their trains , including tonnage , train - length , and terrain . for example , some states and localities have passed laws limiting the duration of blocked crossings and proposed fines for railroads , but state and local officials and other stakeholders we spoke with said that federal law preempts such efforts . the study is examining issues related to train makeup and handling , including the use of dp locomotives , crew training and fatigue , and braking performance for longer trains . in 2006 , as part of its report on the impacts of blocked grade crossings on emergency response services , fra stated that future growth in rail and highway traffic will likely increase blocked crossings , and more recently fra officials stated that this is still the case . for example , fra does not plan to use any of the information gathered in its longer train study — which will include a sampling of the routes longer trains travel — to inform the agency's work on blocked crossings because fra officials stated that they do not expect the study will yield relevant information . as these issues continue to evolve and fra works to identify locations where blocked crossings are reported , working with railroads and local communities to identify any potential impacts of longer trains on grade crossings would help fra to determine whether and how longer trains are affecting these communities and what could be done to address those impacts . however , without documented strategies for how it plans to communicate the results of its research , fra may lose an opportunity to effectively work with internal and external stakeholders — such as railroads , railroad workers , and local communities — to address any risks of operating longer trains in support of the agency's mission of enabling the safe , efficient , and reliable transportation of people and goods . we are making the following two recommendations to fra: the administrator of fra should develop a strategy for sharing fra's research results with internal and external stakeholders and implement that strategy for its research on the safety impacts of very long trains .
