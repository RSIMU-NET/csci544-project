as congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include strengthened enforcement measures , a significant expansion of guest workers , and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration , some question whether the department of homeland security ( dhs ) can handle the increased immigration workload . in response to growing concerns that the immigration responsibilities and other important duties of dhs were not functioning effectively , dhs secretary michael chertoff announced the second stage review ( 2sr ) to base work on priorities driven by risk . currently , three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions: customs and border protection ( cbp ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and u.s . citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) . in 2004 , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) reported that many of the management problems that plagued the former immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) have carried over to the three dhs immigration agencies . it follows with an organizational chart depicting current immigration functions in dhs . of these , only the director of uscis has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration . while the secretary of dhs is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues , he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the attorney general , who oversees the eoir immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals , and the secretary of state , who oversees the bureaus of consular affairs and of population , refugees , and migration . thus far , independent assessments of the functioning of immigration in dhs have centered on problems rather than successes . the underlying question remains whether a sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhs's efficacy in managing immigration policy . appendix a . appendix c. reorganization plan modifying the immigration enforcement functions as dhs was forming , the administration provided the following explanation of the reorganization that created cbp and ice: ( a ) rename the "bureau of border security" the "bureau of immigration and customs enforcement. . establish and oversee the administration of the policies for performing the border patrol and inspections program functions as are â€” ( a ) transferred to the under secretary for border and transportation security by section 441 of the act and delegated to the commissioner by the under secretary for border and transportation security ; or ( b ) otherwise vested in the assistant secretary by law .
