patent infringement is the unauthorized making , using , offering for sale , selling , and importing of a patented invention . the patent provides the patent holder with the right to protect against such infringement by suing for relief in the appropriate federal court . the amount of patent infringement litigation has substantially increased during the last decade . however , others believe that the information required by the patent infringement complaint is sufficient to provide notice to the defendant of the pending claims , reserving the disclosure of more detailed information for the discovery stage of litigation . rule 8 of the federal rules of civil procedure requires a complaint to contain a statement showing a claim for relief and the grounds for the court's jurisdiction . form 18 provides a model for a "complaint of patent infringement. . according to this form , a complaint for patent infringement must include four statements asserting jurisdiction , patent ownership , patent infringement by the defendant , and demand for relief . commentators have linked paes together with the current patent pleading requirements for a patent infringement claim . they argue that the minimal information required in a patent infringement complaint encourages paes to initiate "frivolous" lawsuits that otherwise would not survive the initial pleading stage under a more stringent standard . the following bills specifically target patent troll litigation to curb their prevalence in court . the innovation act of 2013 , h.r . 3309 , proposes changes to the patent pleading requirements specifically . the co - sponsors intend the bill to "eliminate the abuses of our patent system [and] discourage frivolous patent litigation" by providing heightened initial pleading requirements for an infringement claim . under these new requirements , the complaint of a patent infringement would need to: identify each patent allegedly infringed ; identify each claim of each patent that is allegedly infringed ; identify the accused instrumentality that is allegedly infringing with specific name or model number ; describe where each element of each claim is identified within the accused instrumentality and how it corresponds to the functionality of the accused instrumentality ; and describe the direct infringement , person ( s ) involved , and the acts of that person ( s ) involved in inducing that infringement . these proposed requirements would demand more specific information from the plaintiff than form 18 . however , some commentators believe that the heightened pleading requirements would render patent enforcement impractical . this act authorizes the u.s. supreme court to promulgate rules of procedure , including the federal rules of civil procedure , for federal courts . however , members of the judicial branch have raised objections to the patent pleading reforms and have suggested potential separation of powers issues triggered by these proposed changes .
