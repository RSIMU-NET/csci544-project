this report begins by reviewing the framework for handling rescissions established by the impoundment control act of 1974 ( ica , 88 stat . president george w. bush sent no formal ica rescission requests to congress , but some controversy developed over his use of "cancellation statements" proposing spending reductions . the impoundment control act ( ica ) was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 , signed into law on june 12 , 1974 ( 88 stat . 332 ) . under the ica , unless congress takes action to approve of a rescission request from the president within the 45-day period , the funds must be released . in addition , absent a specific request from the president , congress of its own accord may initiate rescission actions , by cancelling previously appropriated funds in a subsequent law . for example , are funds originally proposed for rescission in a special message , but which again become available for obligation before congress permanently rescinds them , to be considered as "congressional approval of a president's request" or as a "rescission initiated by congress" ? . during his first year in office president reagan submitted more rescission proposals ( 133 ) than had president carter during his entire administration . in 1993 testimony , milton socolar , from the gao office of general counsel , called attention to this development: the data suggest an evolution in the use of rescissions as a budgetary tool.... ( t ) he share of total enacted rescissions originally proposed by the president has fallen and the share originating in the congress has increased.... as the congress has come to embrace an equivalent or greater amount of reductions than proposed by presidents , the debate has shifted from deciding whether to cut to deciding where to cut [emphasis in original] . for a brief period president clinton had new authority to rescind funds under the line item veto act of 1996 . according to gao data , from fy1974 to fy2009 , presidents requested 1,178 rescissions under the ica , totaling somewhat over $76 billion . close to a third of the proposals were approved by congress , with approximately 40% of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests ( $25 billion ) enacted by congress . the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequently enacted exceeded $1 billion in only four of the 30-plus years since the ica was enacted ( fy1981 , fy1982 , fy1992 and fy1994 ) . during the same period congress initiated 1,880 rescission actions amounting to nearly $197.1 billion , over eight times the total dollar amount of presidentially requested rescissions enacted . the trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress has already been noted . as discussed above , the liva reversed the burden of action regarding rescission proposals ; cancellations of the president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ( ultimately requiring rejection by a 2 / 3 majority in both chambers to override a presidential veto of a disapproval bill ) . during this period the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct ( mandatory ) spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending . cbo figures indicate that all the cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 ( including those overturned ) totaled some $355 million , with a projected five - year savings just under $1 billion . during senate floor debate on its substitute rescission package in 1992 , senator robert byrd , chairman of the appropriations committee , referred to the president's recent reference to the "wasteful spending" of congress , and stated the following: so to hear the chief executive speak on that occasion , to the effect that only congress is guilty of wasteful spending â€” and the president singled out some examples of what he considered to be wasteful spending , and the senate has gone along with some of them , but the president did not say anything about wasteful spending in the executive branch .
