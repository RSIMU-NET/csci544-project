congress and the executive branch have historically identified the asia pacific economic cooperation forum ( apec ) as potentially important in the promotion of liberalized international trade and investment in asia , and possibly the rest of the world . apec is unusual among various trade associations in its reliance on consensus - based , voluntary reductions in tariff and non - tariff trade barriers — as well as a variety of trade facilitation measures — to promote trade and investment liberalization not only between apec members , but for all international trade and investment , an approach often referred to as "open regionalism" ( see " apec's approach to trade liberalization " below ) . this was widely seen as a counterforce to the efforts of some members of the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) to pursue an alternative "asian only" model for regional economic integration that would exclude the united states . the uncertainty about the future role of apec in u.s. trade policy comes just before the target deadline for the first of apec's bogor goals — open trade and investment among the industrialized apec members by 2010 — and a year before the united states is scheduled to host the association's meetings in 2011 . according to some analysts , the next two years could be a critical time for apec's development . during the 1994 meetings in bogor , indonesia , apec established the "bogor goals" of "free and open trade and investment in the asia - pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies. . however , the obama administration has taken actions that may indicate a shift in style and focus in u.s. trade policy in asia . the formal notification of congress of the intent to enter into discussions with the current members of the tpp and three other interested parties — australia , peru and vietnam — about possible u.s. membership in the trade association creates tension with apec's approach to trade liberalization and the previous goal of creating a free trade area of the asia - pacific ( ftaap ) under the auspices of apec . major decisions are generally affirmed and / or announced at the leaders' meeting . skeptics have frequently criticized apec for being "all talk and no show. . although apec's exports and imports have grown at a faster rate than world trade figures since the creation of apec , it is uncertain if its trade growth is the result of trade liberalization and facilitation , or caused by other economic factors . apec's greater economic growth rate could be sufficient to explain most of its better trade performance compared to global figures . in 2009 , apec's interest in human security focused primarily on the issue of "enhancing human security. . also , there are oversight issues raised by u.s. participation in various apec activities and , in particular , with respect to the 2011 apec meetings to be held in the united states . in addition , congress may consider expressing its preferences regarding the agenda and content of the 2011 apec meetings to be held in the united states , possibly via appropriation legislation that provides funding for those meetings .
