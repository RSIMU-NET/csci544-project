these commitments include providing sanctions relief if iran implements its nuclear commitments as laid out in the jcpoa . in february 2016 , we issued an interim report on our preliminary findings . this report , which updates the preliminary findings in the interim report , examines ( 1 ) the jcpoa commitments that iaea has been asked to verify and monitor , and its authorities to do so ; ( 2 ) the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa ; and ( 3 ) potential challenges and mitigating actions , if any , iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying and monitoring iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa . the state department coordinates the united states' financial and policy relationship with iaea . stockpile limit . under the jcpoa , iran agreed to provisionally apply , and seek ratification of the additional protocol , which gives the agency's inspectors access to an expanded range of locations , including those where the agency seeks assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities . under the jcpoa , iaea is also conducting certain additional verification and monitoring activities agreed to by iran , such as containment and surveillance measures for monitoring iran's uranium mines and mills , according to iaea officials . the jcpoa includes a mechanism in which its participants commit to resolve access issues with the agency regarding an undeclared location within 24 days after the request is made . iaea has estimated the financial , human , and technical resources necessary to verify and monitor iran's implementation of its nuclear - related commitments in the jcpoa . iaea has estimated that it needs approximately $10 million per year for 15 years in additional funding above its current safeguards budget to fund additional inspections , among other things , under the jcpoa . consequently , according to a 2015 iaea report , all of iaea's jcpoa work through 2016 will be funded through extra - budgetary contributions . regarding funding from the united states , the state department and doe have requested approximately $190 million for fiscal year 2017 to support iaea generally and jcpoa - related iaea activities specifically , in the form of both regular contributions to the iaea budget and extra - budgetary funding: the state department has requested approximately $101.1 million for fiscal year 2017 to be contributed to iaea's regular budget . according to iaea officials , iaea's existing technical resources are sufficient to implement its verification and monitoring activities under the jcpoa . these potential challenges include ( 1 ) detecting undeclared nuclear materials and activities , ( 2 ) accessing sites in iran , and ( 3 ) managing safeguards budgetary , human , and technical resources . according to current u.s. officials , a former u.s. official , some former iaea officials , and officials from several expert organizations we interviewed , detection of undeclared nuclear material and activities is an inherent challenge for iaea . for example , according to u.s. officials , iaea has adapted its inspector training program to focus on potential indicators of undeclared activity beyond the agency's traditional safeguards focus on nuclear materials accountancy . as we previously noted , iaea proposes to integrate approximately $5.7 million in jcpoa costs into iaea's regular budget after 2016 . iaea officials , as well as a former iaea official , two former u.s. officials , and an official from one expert organization stated that the proposal to move funding for verification and monitoring efforts under the jcpoa into iaea's safeguards regular budget could face resistance from some member states without corresponding budget increases for other iaea programs , such as the technical cooperation program , which supports nuclear power development and other civilian nuclear applications . specifically , iaea's strategy of transferring inspectors to its office of safeguards verification in iran from other safeguards divisions may pose a challenge to iaea and its safeguards work in other countries because of the extensive time it takes iaea to hire and train new inspectors for those divisions . we are not making any recommendations in this report . this report examines ( 1 ) the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) commitments that the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) has been asked to verify and monitor and its authorities to do so , ( 2 ) the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa , and ( 3 ) potential challenges and mitigating actions , if any , iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa . we also analyzed iaea documentation concerning the safeguards legal framework , including the statute of the iaea , which authorizes the agency to apply safeguards , at the request of parties , to any bilateral or multilateral arrangement ; “the structure and content of agreements between the agency and states required in connection with the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons” ( information circular ( infcirc ) / 153 ) , which provides the basis for the comprehensive safeguards agreement that most countries have concluded with iaea and that covers all of the countries' nuclear material in peaceful activities ; iran's comprehensive safeguards agreement ( infcirc / 214 ) ; the model additional protocol ( infcirc / 540 ) , which provides the basis for an additional protocol that most countries with a csa have concluded with iaea to provide additional information about countries' nuclear and nuclear - related activities ; and the november 2011 iaea safeguards report , which details items concerning “possible military dimensions” of iran's nuclear program ; iaea's report on its investigation of the possible military dimensions ; and the related board of governors' resolution . the information from these interviews is not reflected in this report .
