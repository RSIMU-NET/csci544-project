perhaps in response to such concerns , congress established sunset provisions which apply to three of the most controversial amendments to fisa: section 6001 ( a ) of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) , also known as the "lone wolf" provision , which simplifies the evidentiary showing needed to obtain a fisa court order to target non - u.s. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor , specifically by authorizing such orders in the absence of a proven link between a targeted individual and a foreign power ; section 206 of the usa patriot act , which permits multipoint , or "roving," wiretaps ( i.e. , wiretaps which may follow a target even when he or she changes phones ) by adding flexibility to the manner in which the subject of a fisa court order is specified ; and section 215 of the usa patriot act , which authorizes orders compelling a person to produce "any tangible thing" that is "relevant" to an authorized foreign intelligence , international terrorism , or counter - espionage investigation . in summer 2013 , media began reporting on several foreign intelligence activities conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) , including the bulk collection of telephone metadata under section 215 . one day later , congress enacted the usa freedom act , which placed new limitations on the scope of the government's foreign intelligence activities , while simultaneously extending the expired provisions through december 15 , 2019 . if that date were to arrive without any extension , the amended fisa authorities would revert to their text as it appeared before the enactment of the usa patriot act . the grandfather clauses authorize the continued effect of the amendments with respect to investigations that began , or potential offenses that took place , before the provisions' sunset date .
