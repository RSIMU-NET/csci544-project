to determine whether additional notable concerns remain , we reviewed all 2011 and 2012 selection board reports , specifically these boards' written concerns and recommendations on how to improve the promotion process , as well as all grievances filed after the 2011 promotion cycle was completed , which were recorded by grievance staff as those related to promotion , low ranking , performance standards boards , or separation . state's foreign service promotion system follows an up - or - out principle , under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified period in a single salary class leads to mandatory retirement for personnel in certain occupational categories . state's foreign service promotion process includes several types of boards that evaluate and rank order candidates for promotion , identify other candidates for possible separation from the service , and address promotion process - related grievances . state carries out several key steps before convening selection boards . once a final rank ordering is established , the board submits its final results as part of its official board report , which includes , among other elements: the rank - order list for each competition group of all candidates recom - mended for promotion ; an alphabetical list of those mid - ranked ; an alphabetical list of those low - ranked ; an alphabetical list of any candidates referred directly to a performance standards board to be considered for possible separation ; and recommendations concerning policies and procedures for subsequent boards and improvements to the performance evaluation system . these offices respond indicating whether there are any outstanding issues concerning individual candidates , such as a pending investigation or other matter , that could lead to their removal from the promotion list . in response , state implemented a requirement that each board member sign an oath to protect the confidentiality of board materials and report any improper introduction of information about a candidate . state revised its procedures governing candidate and board member recusal requests in response to oig concerns about them . in addition , the foreign service grievance board found serious deficiencies and irregularities in the operation of six reconstituted boards , including destruction of underlying board records ; inability of board members to confirm that the results reported in the final reports accurately reflected the board's decisions ; evidence that the boards failed to incorporate the safeguards followed by regular selection boards ; and lack of evidence that hr staff prepared board reports with sufficient attention to detail . for example , the procedures call for hr to retain an official folder on each reconstituted board , which should include , among other items , documentation of the notification to employees of the names of board members ; final board scoresheets that are signed or initialed by all board recusal forms , if applicable ; and the final board members ; signed oaths ; report , signed by all members or their proxy . in addition to state's actions taken in response to others' identified concerns about the promotion process , we found that state initiated two additional documentation practices to strengthen promotion process safeguards . we found that selection boards , performance standards boards , and reconstituted boards complied with many updated procedures in the 2011 and 2012 foreign service promotion cycles ; however , some selection boards and reconstituted boards had documentation gaps for certain internal controls . while we found that state had responded to previously identified concerns about its foreign service promotion process and taken a number of actions to strengthen internal controls over the process , documentation supporting the full implementation of these controls was sometimes missing . a failure to implement safeguards , in turn , increases the risk that promotion results could be intentionally or inadvertently compromised . to improve and better document state's compliance with key safeguards governing the foreign service promotion process , we recommend that the secretary of state instruct the director general of the foreign service and director of the human resources office of performance evaluation to take steps to ensure that selection board , performance standards board , and reconstituted board reports are complete and fully document compliance with internal controls , including but not limited to signed oaths and recusal memos . this report examines ( 1 ) the department of state's ( state ) process for ranking and promoting foreign service personnel , ( 2 ) procedural changes state has made to its foreign service promotion process in response to identified concerns , and ( 3 ) the extent to which updated procedures were consistently followed in 2011 and 2012 and whether any notable concerns about the promotion process remain . to review state's process for ranking and promoting foreign service personnel , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , and procedures governing state's promotion and grievance processes , including the foreign service act of 1980 , the foreign affairs manual , the procedural precepts and core precepts for the 2012 foreign service selection boards , and the training and information materials provided to 2012 selection board members . we also reviewed all foreign service grievance board filings related to the same universe of filed grievance cases . if a recommendation addressed more than one of our categories , we coded it into all applicable categories .
