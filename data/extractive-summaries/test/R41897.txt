an issue for congress and state and local governments is whether the pay and benefits of public workers are comparable to those of workers in the private sector . the effect of the recession that officially began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 on government budgets increased the interest of policy makers in the compensation of public sector employees . among the ways to reduce budget deficits , policy makers are considering the pay and benefits of public sector employees . the report does not compare the actual pay or benefits of private and public sector workers or compare the characteristics of workers to try to explain any differences in the pay or benefits of private and public sector workers . from 2007 to 2010 — during and after the 2007-2009 recession — private sector employment fell by an estimated 7.9 million jobs , while public sector employment increased by almost 272,000 jobs . conversely , from 2010 to 2013 , private sector employment grew by approximately 6.7 million jobs , while public sector employment fell by an estimated 626,000 jobs . in 2013 , there were approximately 211,000 fewer federal jobs than in 2010 . in 2013 , 81.6% of workers ages 18 to 64 were employed full - time . reflecting the aging of the u.s. labor force , workers in both the private and public sectors have become older . nevertheless , employees in the public sector are older than private sector workers . in 2013 , 51.7% of full - time public sector workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 42.4% of full - time private sector workers . in 2013 , 56.7% of federal workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 49.7% of state employees and 52.1% of employees of local governments . thus , the age difference between private and public sector workers may indicate that public sector workers have more years of experience than private sector workers . in 2013 , women held almost three - fifths of full - time jobs in state and local governments ( 57.7% for both state and local governments ) . the largest increase in the share of jobs held by women has been in state governments . by contrast , over the same period , the share of jobs held by women in local governments increased by 8.8 points ( from 48.9% to 57.7% ) , in the federal government by 10.7 points ( from 31.5% to 42.2% ) , and in the private sector by 9.2 points ( from 32.5% to 41.6% after rounding ) . although women , on average , earn less than men , the gap has narrowed . the percentage of federal employees with a bachelor's , advanced , or professional degree increased by 17.0 percentage points , compared to a 13.7 point increase for employees of state governments and a 5.3 point increase for employees of local governments . workers with more education generally earn more than workers with less education . the cps provides occupational data for both major and detailed occupations . however , in 2013 , a larger share of public sector than private sector workers were employed in "management , professional , and related occupations" ( 56.2% of public sector workers , compared to 37.8% of private sector workers ) . in part , more public sector workers were employed in these occupations because 25.7% of all public sector workers were employed in "education , training , and library" occupations , compared to 2.3% of all private sector workers . broad occupational categories may not fully distinguish between detailed occupations that are concentrated in either the private or public sectors . many detailed occupations may require similar skills , however . the cost of living is generally higher in metropolitan than nonmetropolitan areas . in 2013 , private and federal employees were as likely to live in metropolitan areas of 1 million or more ( 57.8% for private sector workers and 58.8% for federal workers ) . the tables show the total number of persons employed , the number of workers employed in the private and public sectors , the percentage of total employment that was in the private sector , and the percentage of workers in the private and public sectors who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement . of the 2,941,000 "managers , all other" employed in the private sector , 1.8% were covered by a collective bargaining agreement , while 19.1% of public sector workers in this occupation were represented by a union .
