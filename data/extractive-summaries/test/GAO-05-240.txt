so that epa could perform further analysis of key issues , including the likely impact of phase ii's permitting requirements on the oil and gas industry , epa postponed the phase ii compliance date for storm water discharges from small oil and gas construction sites until march 10 , 2005 . storm water discharges from construction activities can increase pollutants and sediment amounts to levels above those found in undisturbed watersheds . although there is currently no centralized storm water permit database that tracks storm water permit coverage nationwide , our review of phase i storm water permit data for three major oil and gas producing states — louisiana , oklahoma , and texas — confirmed that permit coverage has been obtained for only a small number of oil and gas construction activities , compared with the thousands of drilling activities occurring in those states . three hundred four of the 433 activities for which permit coverage was obtained in the most recent 12-month period — about 70 percent — were for pipeline construction activities . another key oil and gas construction activity in these states was oil and gas well drilling , with 72 of the 433 permits — about 17 percent — involving drilling activities . industry officials must decide whether or not they will apply for permit coverage , and some may have applied for storm water permit coverage on few occasions because they broke their construction activities — which taken together would exceed 5 acres — into what they believed were distinct projects that disturbed less than 5 acres each . epa's phase i rule requires that activities disturbing 5 acres or more of land — as well as smaller construction activities that are part of a common plan of development that disturbs 5 acres or more — obtain permit coverage . as epa approaches the end of a 2-year period to study the impact of phase ii on oil and gas construction activities , epa has not yet quantified the number of sites impacted or the financial and environmental implications of the phase ii rule's implementation . the phase ii rule may lead to additional costs for industry and federal agencies , but these costs are difficult to quantify . the endangered species act requires most formal consultations to be conducted within 90 days . almost 2 years after delaying the implementation of phase ii for oil and gas activities in order to study and evaluate the impact on the industry , epa initiated an analysis of the rule but has not completed the study , quantified the number of activities affected , or determined its potential financial and environmental implications . furthermore , as a part of this analysis , we recommend that epa assess the number of oil and gas sites impacted by the phase ii rule ; the costs to industry of compliance with the rule and whether these costs are solely attributable to the storm water rule ; and the environmental implications and benefits of the storm water rule , including , but not limited to , potential benefits for endangered species . this report provides information about ( 1 ) oil and gas construction activities for which permits have been obtained under phase i and ( 2 ) oil and gas construction activities that are likely to be affected by phase ii and its financial and environmental implications .
