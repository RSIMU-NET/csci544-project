foreign nationals not legally residing in the united states who wish to come to the united states generally must obtain a visa to be admitted . as congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control ( i.e. , border security and interior enforcement ) , legal reform ( i.e. , temporary and permanent admissions ) , and the resolution of unauthorized alien residents , concerns arise over the capacity of the department of homeland security to identify and remove temporary aliens who fail to depart when their visas expire . by 1996 , the estimated number of unauthorized alien residents was 5.8 million , with about 2.1 million ( 41% ) estimated to have overstayed their nonimmigrant visas . over the years , it became apparent that the data on nonimmigrant overstays were unreliable because these data were based upon the i - 94 arrival / departure form . estimates of nonimmigrant overstays residing in the united states are plagued by the broader difficulties in measuring all three components of unauthorized migration — aliens entering without inspection between ports of entry and aliens entering with fraudulent documents , as well as aliens overstaying or otherwise violating the terms of legal entry . reportedly , the failure of dhs to consistently update the alien's record — for example if the authorized period of admission is extended , if deferred departure is granted , or if the immigration status changes — is another major factor that prevents dhs from calculating reliable estimates of overstays .
