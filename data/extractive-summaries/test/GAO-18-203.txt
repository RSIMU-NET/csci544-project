one of the goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes to the position they occupied before the crime was committed . various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting , ordering , and collecting restitution for crime victims , including the department of justice ( doj ) and the judiciary . to address the first question on the extent information is available on restitution requested by doj and ordered by courts for eligible federal criminal cases for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , we reviewed doj guidance for requesting restitution and aousc and judicial conference guidance for ordering restitution . we also analyzed doj's 2014-2018 strategic plan and eousa's internal evaluation program to assess the extent to which doj's oversight mechanisms provide sufficient information on usaos' performance in meeting initiatives outlined in doj's strategic plan and the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 . judiciary: within the judiciary , the 94 federal district courts order restitution , receipt restitution payments , and disburse restitution to victims . additionally , each district court is required to submit to ussc a report of each offender's sentence that includes , among other information , details on the offenses for which the offender was convicted ; the sentence imposed on the offender ; and if the judge departed from the sentencing guidelines , information on reasons why . eousa and usao officials in all six of the offices with whom we spoke told us that prosecutors document requests for restitution in their case files and that their offices employ other internal controls , such as the use of templates and forms , throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate . according to our analysis of ussc data , 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and restitution was ordered for 33,158 of those offenders , or 15 percent . table 1 shows the number of federal offenders sentenced and ordered to pay restitution for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , as well as the total amount of restitution ordered by the courts . specifically , from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , we found that restitution was not ordered — and no reason was documented in ussc data for that decision — for 9,848 offenders ( 5 percent of the 214,578 offenders sentenced during this time period ) . specifically , doj collected $1.5 billion ( 4 percent ) , of the $34 billion ordered from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 . according to our analysis of doj data , at the end of fiscal year 2016 , $110 billion in restitution was outstanding and usaos had identified $100 billion of that debt as uncollectible , as shown in figure 2 . collecting restitution . eousa officials stated that while the agency does not have any measures or goals to assess usaos' performance in improving debt collection , including the collection of federal restitution , they are working with doj's justice management division to develop a suite of analytical tools to monitor the collection of debt across all offices . developing and implementing performance measures and goals for each usao would allow doj to gauge usaos' success in collecting this restitution and , by extension , the department's success in achieving its major management initiative to increase the collection of debt . we are making three recommendations , including one to the judiciary and two to doj .
