mas contracts , macs , and gwacs are all interagency contracts . though precise numbers are unavailable , in fiscal year 2008 , government buyers used the mas program , macs , and gwacs to acquire at least $60 billion of commercial goods and services , including billions spent through enterprisewide contracts . we reviewed gsa's management structure for overseeing the program and the tools and controls gsa established for obtaining fair and reasonable pricing for mas contracts . interagency and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to the government in buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services , yet omb and agencies cannot be sure they are leveraging this buying power because they lack the necessary comprehensive , reliable data to effectively manage and oversee these contracts . both government contracting officials and representatives of vendors expressed concerns about this condition . in contrast , gwac creation and management has governmentwide oversight . agencies we met with cited several reasons for establishing their own macs and enterprisewide contracts including cost avoidance through lower prices , and fewer fees compared to other vehicles , mission specific requirements , and better control over the management of contracts . gsa's mas program is the largest government interagency contracting program , with approximately 17,000 of the 19,000 contracts involved in the federal supply schedules program , but gsa's limited application of selected pricing tools hinders its ability to determine whether it obtains the best mas contract prices . however , gsa uses these tools primarily for a small number of larger dollar value contracts , thus limiting its ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory pricing controls and obtain the best prices under mas contracts . as a result , the gsa inspector general has identified almost $4 billion in potential cost avoidance through pre - award audits from fiscal years 2004 through 2008 . for example , mas performance measures are inconsistent across the gsa organizations that manage mas contracts , including inconsistent emphasis on pricing , which limits gsa's ability to have a program wide perspective on its operations . however , this initiative is currently in its early stages . in addition to a lack of data and a decentralized management structure , shortcomings in assessment tools also create mas program management challenges . to provide better transparency and a coordinated approach in awarding macs and enterprisewide contracts , we recommend that the director of the office of management and budget direct the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy to take the following five actions in conjunction with the agencies' senior procurement executives: survey departments and agencies to update the 2006 office of federal procurement policy interagency contracting data collection initiative to identify the universe of macs and enterprisewide contracts in use throughout federal departments and agencies and assess their utility for maximizing procurement resources across agencies ; ensure that departments and agencies use the survey data to accurately record these contracts in fpds - ng ; establish a policy and procedural framework in conjunction with agencies for establishing , approving , and reporting on new macs and enterprisewide contracts on an ongoing basis ; the framework should stress the need for a consistent approach to leveraging the government's buying power across departments and agencies while continuing to use their statutory authorities for buying goods and services ; assess the feasibility of establishing and maintaining a centralized database , which could provide sufficient information on gwacs , macs , and enterprisewide contracts , for contracting officers to conduct market research and make informed decisions on the availability of existing contracts to meet the agencies' requirements ; and as part of developing the pending far rule to implement the 2009 national defense authorization act , ensure that departments and agencies complete a comprehensive business case analysis as described by the sara panel , and include a requirement to address potential duplication with existing contracts , before new macs and enterprisewide contracts are established . to strengthen gsa mas program pricing and management , we recommend that the administrator of the general services administration take the following eight actions: in coordination with the gsa inspector general , target the use of pre - award audits to cover more contracts that meet the audit threshold ; fully implement the process that has been initiated to ensure that vendors that meet the pre - negotiation clearance panel threshold receive a panel review ; when considering the mas advisory panel recommendations to clarify the price objective and eliminate the price reduction clause , ensure that any alternative means to negotiate and determine best prices are validated and in place before eliminating these pricing provisions , collect transactional data on mas orders and prices paid , possibly through the expanded use of existing electronic tools or through a pilot data collection initiative for selected mas schedules and make the information available to mas contract negotiators and customer agencies , establish more consistent performance measures across the mas program , including measures for pricing ; take steps to increase the mas customer survey response rate by using a methodologically sound means to identify bona fide program users and employing survey techniques that produce meaningful and actionable information that can lead to program improvements ; clarify and strengthen the mas program office's charter and authority so that it has clear roles and responsibilities to consistently implement guidance , policies , and best practices across gsa's acquisition centers including policies and practices related to the above recommendations ; and report gsa's plans to address these recommendations to the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy .
