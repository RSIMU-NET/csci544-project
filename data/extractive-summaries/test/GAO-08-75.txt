to help ensure that veterans are properly compensated for these service - connected disabilities , va is required to perform disability reevaluations for specific disabilities . va also performs disability reevaluations whenever it determines there is a need to verify either the continued existence or current severity of veterans' disabilities . in fiscal year 2005 the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) completed about 17,700 disability reevaluations . specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) the operational controls va uses to ensure the effectiveness of the disability reevaluation process and ( 2 ) the management information va collects and uses to manage the disability reevaluation process . vba maintains a quality assurance review program known as the systematic technical accuracy review ( star ) program . vba's operational controls do not adequately ensure that staff schedule or conduct disability reevaluations as necessary . vba plans on improving some of its control mechanisms through its new claims management system , vetsnet . the diary date is the only vba procedural trigger that alerts regional offices that a claim needs to be reviewed . vba is planning on improving its ability to track reevaluations . once the regional office receives the paper notice that a reevaluation is due , staff perform a preliminary assessment of the veteran's claim file to determine if more comprehensive reevaluation should be conducted . if staff determine during this preliminary assessment that a reevaluation is no longer needed , they can cancel the reevaluation . vba plans on improving its ability to track cancellations using vetsnet . vba cannot effectively manage the disability reevaluation process because some of the data it collects are not consistent and it does not systematically collect and analyze key management data . also , vba does not know the number of reevaluation diary dates that mature in a year or the types of disabilities being reevaluated , the length of time before reevaluations are conducted , or if the reevaluation decisions result in an increase , decrease , or no change in the severity of veterans' disabilities . vba's disability reevaluation timeliness data are inconsistent because regional offices use different starting points for measuring how long it takes to complete reevaluations . also according to vba officials , vba does not collect data on the outcomes of reevaluations and , as a result , does not have the benefit of historical results data that could be used to calibrate its decisions on which disabilities are likely to change and thus should be a higher priority for reevaluation . however , without a system to remind staff to schedule disability reevaluation diary dates or a system that automatically schedules diary dates for all claims that require reevaluation , staff could inadvertently fail to enter diary dates , and reevaluations may not be scheduled and performed as needed .
