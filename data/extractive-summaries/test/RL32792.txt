life expectancy is also routinely calculated for other ages . a person who reached age 60 in 2003 was expected to live an additional 22.2 years , on average , and would die at age 82.2 . life spans are not considered further in this report . this report documents the improvements in life expectancy that have occurred , analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions as well as the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race . in addition , it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years . while this report focuses on describing the demographic context of longevity change in the united states , these trends have implications for a wide range of social and economic issues that are likely to be considered by congress . as seen in table 1 and appendix b table b - 1 , life expectancy at birth increased dramatically over the past century in the united statesâfrom 49.2 years ( the average for 1900-1902 ) to 77.5 years in 2003 , the most recent year for which official data have been released by the centers for disease control ( cdc ) / national center for health statistics ( nchs ) . one of the most important public health achievements of the 20 th century in the united states was the dramatic and widespread increase in life expectancy that occurred over the past century in the united statesâfirst as a result of the control of the infectious and parasitic diseases that had plagued mostly infants and children in the early part of the century , and later because of medical advances that led to large decreases in adult mortality , especially from two of the most prevalent causes of deathâcardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases . life expectancy at birth in 2003 for black males measured 69.0 years , falling short of the comparable figure for white males by 6.3 years . the gap between black and white men has remained relatively stagnant since the mid - 1950s . detailed life expectancy table .
