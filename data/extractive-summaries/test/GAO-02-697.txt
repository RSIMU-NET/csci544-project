the ui program is a federal - state partnership designed to partially replace the lost earnings of individuals who become unemployed through no fault of their own and to stabilize the economy in times of economic recession . in light of the dramatic increase in the number of unemployed workers filing for ui benefits in the past year and the program's potential exposure to fraud and overpayments , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent and type of overpayments in the ui program , including those that may be attributable to fraud or abuse ; and ( 2 ) the factors that contribute to overpayments in the ui program , as well as actions taken by labor to ensure program integrity . we identified various management and operational practices at both the state and federal level that contribute to ui overpayments . in addition , while some of the states we visited use automated data sources to determine if claimants are working or obtaining other benefits while receiving ui , others rely heavily on self - reported information from claimants to make payment decisions . the vulnerabilities that we have identified are partly attributable to a management approach in labor and many states that does not adequately balance the need to quickly process and pay ui claims with the need to control program payments . totals for 2001 ) .
