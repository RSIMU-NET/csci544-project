this report formalizes the content of our briefings and our work since then , including: ( 1 ) the current extent of and potential for geothermal development ; ( 2 ) challenges faced by developers of geothermal resources ; ( 3 ) federal , state , and local government actions to address these challenges ; and ( 4 ) how provisions of the act are likely to affect federal geothermal royalty disbursements and collections . although heat pumps run on electricity , they produce three to four times the energy that they consume . the total potential for direct use applications is largely unknown because of the widespread occurrence of lower temperature geothermal resources and the many diverse applications . over 2,300 businesses and heating districts in 21 states used geothermal resources directly for heat and hot water in 2005 . four additional businesses — a nursery , a food processing plant , and two mines — have also used federal resources at one time in direct use applications . the development of geothermal resources for electricity production faces major challenges , including high risk and financial uncertainty , inadequate technology , and insufficient transmission capacity . developers of geothermal power plants face additional challenges when operating on federal lands . the act includes a variety of provisions designed to help the geothermal industry address numerous challenges , including the high risk and financial uncertainty of developing renewable energy projects , lack of sufficient transmission capacity , delays in federal leasing , and complex federal royalties . chief among these efforts are financial incentives , such as tax credits for production from renewable energy sources , sales and property tax exemptions , and mandates that certain percentages of the electricity generated within the state come from renewable energy sources , such as geothermal resources . these incentives include property tax incentives , sales tax incentives , and business tax credits . the program's costs are shared with awardees . the act also contains provisions that simplify federal geothermal royalties on resources that generate electricity and simplify and or reduce royalties on resources put to direct use . while the act provided that 50 percent of federal geothermal royalties will continue to be disbursed to the states in which the federal leases are located , an additional 25 percent will now be disbursed to the counties in which the leases are located , leaving only 25 percent to the federal government . to assist in achieving the same level of geothermal royalties as would have been collected prior to the energy policy act of 2005 , we recommend that the secretary of the department of the interior instruct the appropriate managers within the minerals management service to take the following two actions: correct erroneous and missing royalty data , when necessary , so that it will have an accurate baseline of royalty collections for each payor ; and routinely collect from royalty payors the gross sales revenues for electricity sold in order to compare these revenues with past royalty collections and to verify compliance with the percentages prescribed within the act for leases to be issued in the future .
