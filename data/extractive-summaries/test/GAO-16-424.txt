the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) has funded through capital advances approximately 151,000 units for very low - income elderly households and persons with disabilities through the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly ( section 202 ) and the section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities ( section 811 ) programs . from november 1990 through november 2011 , the programs provided capital advances to nonprofit organizations to develop affordable housing units . the house report accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 includes a provision for gao to provide information on hud capital advances for the section 202 and section 811 programs by state for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 . this report examines ( 1 ) how hud determined the capital advance amounts for section 202 and section 811 and ( 2 ) the section 202 and section 811 capital advance amounts by state from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and any changes in the distribution of capital advances over that period . section 202 and section 811 sponsors are not required to repay the capital advance as long as they continue to make supportive housing affordable to eligible households for 40 years . although congress continues to appropriate funds for rental assistance for existing section 202 and section 811 units , these appropriations also declined from 2011 to 2013 . according to hud , most section 202 and section 811 projects that received funding in fiscal year 2008 , fiscal year 2009 , or the combined fiscal year 2010 / 2011 funding cycle have been completed but some are still in the process of being completed . until fiscal year 2012 , when funding for new units ceased , hud used a two - phase process to allocate and award section 202 and section 811 capital advances ( see fig . first , hud headquarters allocated the total amount of appropriated funds for capital advances to each of the 18 hubs ( which in this report we refer to as regional offices ) based on a funding formula , which accounted for regional housing needs and cost characteristics . second , applicants submitted applications online and staff from the applicable regional office evaluated applications using a technical review and a point system and awarded capital advances to the highest - scoring applicants . at that time , each local program office received a minimum set - aside for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas . however , in the combined fiscal year 2010 / 2011 capital advance competition , hud did not subdivide the funds to local offices and discontinued the minimum set - aside of 20 units in metropolitan and 5 units in nonmetropolitan areas in order to fund properties at a higher level . applications that did not pass the technical review were rejected . instead , according to hud headquarters officials , once each regional office had awarded all the funds it could based on the stated criteria in the notice of funding availability ( nofa ) , hud headquarters combined any remaining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan funds to select the next highest ranked application from either a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area . as shown in figure 2 , for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 , applicants in 9 states received 10 or more awards , 15 states received between 5 and 9 awards , 19 states received between 2 and 4 awards , and 5 states received 1 award . total capital advance amounts awarded varied across states for the section 202 program ( see fig . since applications were only maintained for 3 years , hud officials were not able to tell us why a specific application did not receive funding , but they identified possible reasons why applicants may not have received funding during this period . specifically , hud officials noted that applications that were submitted may have been ineligible ; applications may have failed to meet the minimum point threshold for selection ; or higher - scoring applications from other states may have been selected instead . hud provided us technical comments which we incorporated where appropriate .
