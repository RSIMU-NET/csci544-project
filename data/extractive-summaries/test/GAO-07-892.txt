tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the world trade center ( wtc ) disaster , including new york city fire department ( fdny ) personnel , federal government personnel , and other government and private - sector workers and volunteers from new york and elsewhere . more than 5 years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected . in 2005 and 2006 , we reported that one of the wtc health programs , hhs's wtc federal responder screening program , which was established to provide onetime screening examinations for responders who were federal employees when they responded to the wtc attack , had lagged behind the other programs and accomplished little . we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , a component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs for responders , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who reside outside the new york city ( nyc ) metropolitan area . specifically , in this report we assess the status of ( 1 ) services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , ( 2 ) niosh's efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , and ( 3 ) niosh's awards to grantees for treatment services , as well as efforts to estimate the cost of serving responders . this interruption in service occurred because there was a change in the administration of the wtc federal responder screening program , and certain interagency agreements were not established in a timely way to keep the program fully operational . almost a year later , in march 2007 , foh modified its contract with the provider network and resumed scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services for federal responders . in february 2007 , niosh sent a letter to fema asking whether the funding for the program could be provided directly to niosh and whether the funding could be used to support monitoring in addition to the onetime screening examination the program currently offers , but as of june 2007 , niosh had not received a response from fema . according to a niosh official , if niosh either reaches a new agreement with fema or decides to pay for monitoring of federal responders by itself , niosh would have to either negotiate a new agreement with foh to provide monitoring , which foh officials said they would consider doing , or it would have to make arrangements with another program , such as the ny / nj wtc consortium , to provide monitoring . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in june 2005 , niosh began its second effort by awarding funds to mount sinai's dcc to provide both screening and monitoring services . however , these efforts are incomplete . officials from these programs expect that the funds they received from niosh for outpatient services will be spent by the end of fiscal year 2007 . niosh has worked with two of its grantees to estimate the cost of monitoring and treating responders ; however , the most recent effort , in 2007 , has not produced reliable results because the estimate included potential costs for certain program changes that may not be implemented as well as some costs that reduced the estimate's accuracy . to improve the reliability of future cost estimates , hhs officials have required some of the wtc health programs to report detailed cost and treatment data . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded and set aside funds totaling $51 million from its $75 million appropriation for four wtc health programs in the nyc metropolitan area to provide treatment services to responders enrolled in these programs . they did not have actual cost data on these services because the wtc health programs had not been required to report such data when private organizations were funding the programs' treatment services . hhs did not comment on our recommendations .
