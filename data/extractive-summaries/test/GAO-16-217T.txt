the forest service is responsible for contracting for large airtankers , although they may be used by any of the agencies . for example , the forest service and interior obligated $8.3 billion to suppress wildland fires in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 . my statement today focuses on ( 1 ) how the federal wildland fire management agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and ( 2 ) the forest service's efforts to modernize the large airtanker fleet and challenges it has faced in doing so . this testimony is based primarily on reports we issued in september 2015 and august 2013 . in addition , this testimony includes selected updates we conducted in november 2015 on actions the agencies have taken since our 2013 report . in our september 2015 report , we found that the agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs in several ways , including through performance measures , efforts to assess specific activities , and reviews of specific wildland fire incidents . we also found that the agencies had conducted reviews of their responses to wildland fires , but that they did not consistently follow agency policy in doing so or use specific criteria for selecting the fires they reviewed , limiting their ability to help ensure that their fire reviews provided useful information and meaningful results . for example , in fiscal year 2014 , the forest service began developing a performance measure intended to reflect that , in some cases , allowing naturally - ignited fires to burn can provide natural resource benefits at a lower cost and lower risk to personnel than fully suppressing the fire as quickly as possible . the officials told us they plan to finalize the measure and use it in 2017 . for example , the forest service and interior agencies use a system called fuel treatment effectiveness monitoring to assess fuel reduction treatment effectiveness . these officials told us that focusing exclusively on suppression costs when selecting fires may keep the agency from choosing those fires where it can obtain important information and best assess management actions and ensure they are appropriate , risk - based , and effective . however , with these broad criteria it is not clear why the forest service selected those particular fires and not others . within interior , bureau of land management officials told us that the agency completed its last fire review based on significant cost ( i.e. , federal expenditures of $10 million or more ) in 2013 . as a result , we recommended in our september 2015 report that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior direct the chief of the forest service and the director of interior's office of wildland fire to ( 1 ) develop specific criteria for selecting wildland fires for review and for conducting the reviews as part of their efforts to improve their approach to reviewing fires and ( 2 ) once such criteria are established , revise agency policies to align with the specific criteria developed by the agencies . in our august 2013 report , we found that the forest service faced challenges in modernizing the government's fleet of large airtankers — which had declined from 44 in 2002 to 8 in 2013 — but since that report the agency has increased the availability of such aircraft , with some challenges remaining . specifically , we found that the forest service planned to modernize the large airtanker fleet by obtaining large airtankers from various sources over the near , medium , and long terms , but that each component of this approach faced challenges that made the continued availability of such aircraft to meet national fire suppression needs uncertain . for the medium term , the forest service had awarded contracts for seven “next - generation” large airtankers that were expected to be faster and more up - to - date than the legacy aircraft . since then , according to forest service officials , six of these seven aircraft have completed the needed approval and certification processes . the forest service has issued additional contracts for next - generation aircraft and , as of november 2015 , the agency had a total of 20 privately - owned large airtankers under contract , according to forest service officials .
