on may 23 , 2013 , a truck carrying a permitted oversize load crashed into the skagit river bridge on interstate 5 in the state of washington , causing a portion of the bridge to collapse and raising questions about permitting practices for oversize loads . the joint explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 directed gao to review the oversight of oversize loads and the role of federal and state agencies in that process . to determine how state agencies regulate oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges , we reviewed commercially available information on states' vehicle size requirements , developed and administered a data - collection instrument to officials from 50 states and the district of columbia , and interviewed state officials from a non - generalizable sample of 10 states â€” iowa , maine , nebraska , new york , pennsylvania , south dakota , tennessee , texas , washington , and wisconsin.collection instrument , which can be viewed at gao - 15-235sp . the federal length standards differ from the above width and weight standards in that they do not establish a maximum overall length for a vehicle . the regulation provides only that states may not require permits for vehicles with trailers that are less than a specific length , which depends on the type of vehicle . fhwa officials said that the decision to not have a federal height standard goes back to a decision made in the 1950's when the interstate system was being constructed and the height clearances already varied from state to state . among other things , section 32801 of map - 21 required dot to conduct a comprehensive truck size and weight limits study addressing differences in safety risks , infrastructure impacts , and the effect on levels of enforcement between trucks operating at or within federal truck size and weight limits and trucks legally operating in excess of federal limits . while fhwa's regulations establish standards for vehicle size and weight , according to fhwa officials , fhwa lacks the statutory authority to establish any requirements for state permitting . specifically , we found that states vary on vehicle size and weight laws , on state practices to issue and enforce permits for oversize and overweight vehicles , and on other state permitting requirements , as described below . state departments of transportation are often responsible for issuing permits . for example , states reported that state dots issue permits in 31 states and d.c . not all of the states we interviewed agreed that automated routing would improve safety . in some areas , states follow similar practices and requirements: for example , most states make use of online permitting systems and escort vehicles . however , fhwa has authority to conduct transportation research , including research on issues with national implications that could lead to improvements in highway safety , and in the past has worked with the trucking industry and others to identify best practices for related issues such as escort vehicles . our review uncovered examples of how research of state permitting to identify best practices could better position fhwa to provide technical assistance to states that could help inform state policy and legislative changes needed to improve their permitting of oversize and overweight vehicles . officials in south dakota , which currently uses an automated routing system , agreed that while their system was expensive to implement and difficult to obtain support for , the investment has led to benefits of improved efficiency , that the state has benefitted more than the cost of the system , and that its use can be considered a best practice . fhwa's policy is to provide a safe and efficient highway system that accommodates large vehicles , in part by regulating some aspects of vehicle size and weight and ensuring state enforcement of federal standards . however , fhwa has an opportunity to do more . to improve stewardship over the nation's highways and bridges , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the fhwa administrator to take the following action: conduct a study on state oversize - and overweight - permitting practices , including automated vehicle routing and escort driver certification , to identify areas of best practice and share the results with states . dot also provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . to determine how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges , we reviewed relevant legislation , obtained program documents from and conducted interviews with fhwa and fmcsa officials to obtain information on current policies , procedures , and practices for monitoring the transportation of oversize and overweight vehicles and loads .
