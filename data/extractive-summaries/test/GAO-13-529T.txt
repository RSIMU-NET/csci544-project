my testimony is based on several previously published gao reports on stem education , including our january 2012 report entitled science , technology , engineering , and mathematics education: strategic planning needed to better manage overlapping programs across multiple agencies and also addresses actions taken by the administration to better plan and coordinate federal stem education programs since our 2012 report was issued.agencies and programs that provided funding for stem education programs in fiscal year 2010 ; ( 2 ) the extent to which these stem programs overlap ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which federal stem education programs have measured their effectiveness and were aligned to a governmentwide strategy . to gather information on federal stem education programs and to assess the level of fragmentation , overlap , and potential duplication , we reviewed past gao work on assessing the level of fragmentation , overlap , and duplication among other groups of federal programs and we surveyed over 200 programs across 13 agencies that met our definition of a stem education program , asking questions about program objectives , target populations , services provided , interagency coordination , outcome measures and evaluations , and funding . in 2005 , for example , gao identified a multitude of agencies that administer such programs . the number of programs each agency administered ranged from 3 to 46 with three agencies — the department of health and human services , the department of energy , and the national science foundation ( nsf ) — administering more than half of all programs — 112 of 209 . almost a third of the programs had obligations of $1 million or less , with five programs having obligations of more than $100 million each . beyond the 209 programs identified in our review , federal agencies carried out other activities that contribute to the overall federal stem education effort . as we reported in 2012 , and as figure 2 illustrates , in fiscal year 2010 , 83 percent of stem education programs overlapped to some degree with another program in that they offered at least one similar service to at least one similar target group in at least one similar stem field to achieve at least one similar objective . however , even when programs overlapped , we found that the services they provided and the populations they served may differ in meaningful ways and would therefore not necessarily be duplicative . there may be important differences between the specific field ( s ) of focus and a program's stated goals . in 2012 , we reported that in addition to the fragmented and overlapping nature of federal stem education programs , agencies' limited use of performance measures and evaluations may hamper their ability to assess the effectiveness of their individual programs as well as the overall stem education effort . program officials varied in their ability to provide reliable output measures — for example , the number of students , teachers , or institutions directly served by their program . in addition , most agencies did not use outcome measures in a way that is clearly reflected in their performance plans and reports — publicly available documents they use for performance planning . this step could include guidance and sharing of information that outlines practices for evaluating similar types of programs . in addition , stem education was named as an interim crosscutting priority goal in the president's 2013 budget submission ; however , it will be important for nstc to finalize its strategic plan , which should include guidance for how agencies can better align their performance plans and reports to new governmentwide goals . in conclusion , if nstc's 5-year strategic plan is not developed in a way that aligns agencies' efforts to achieve governmentwide goals , enhances the federal government's ability to assess what works , and concentrates resources on those programs that advance the strategy , the federal government may spend limited funds in an inefficient and ineffective manner that does not best help to improve the nation's global competitiveness .
