since its inception , nasa has undertaken numerous programs that have greatly advanced scientific and technological knowledge . as you are aware , nasa's activities span a broad range of complex and technical endeavors . but the agency is at a critical juncture , and major management improvements are needed . in january of this year , we identified four challenges facing nasa . controlling international space station costs . reducing space launch costs . nasa believes that similar workforce problems affect the entire agency and that , as a result , its ability to perform future missions and manage its programs may be at risk . in 2000 , we reported that nasa's frequent use of undefinitized contract changes could result in contract cost overruns and cost growth in the international space station program . nasa's administrator , who comes to the position with a strong management background and expertise in financial management , has made a personal commitment to change the way nasa does business and has appointed a chief operating officer to provide sustained management attention to strategic planning , organizational alignment , human capital strategy , performance management , and other elements necessary for transformation success .
