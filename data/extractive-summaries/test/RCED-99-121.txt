specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) how much and for what purposes federal funding was provided for the restoration of the south florida ecosystem from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1999 and ( 2 ) how well the restoration effort is being coordinated and managed . in addition to funds appropriated directly by the congress for projects managed by the u.s. army corps of engineers and restoration activities designated in the 1996 federal agriculture improvement and reform act ( farm bill ) , the federal agencies participating in the initiative determine and allocate funds from their own appropriations . the federal funding provided to date represents only a down payment . while an official cost estimate for the total restoration effort has not been made , the implementation of the central and southern florida project comprehensive review study , a major component of the restoration initiative referred to as the restudy , is estimated to cost $7.8 billion . the restudy , which will propose modifications to the existing central and southern florida project , is designed to substantially increase the amount of water that is delivered to natural areas while enhancing agricultural and urban water supplies . according to the executive director of the task force , at least $2 billion more will be needed to acquire additional lands , construct other infrastructure projects , and eradicate exotic plant species . our review of these projects indicates that the federal and state agencies involved are unable to agree on components of these projects , such as the lands to be acquired and the schedules for operating water pump stations . however , a strategic plan has not yet been developed that clearly lays out how the initiative will be accomplished and includes quantifiable goals and performance measures that can be used to track the initiative's progress . given the scope and complexity of the initiative and the difficulties already being encountered , unless a strategic or master plan is developed to guide the restoration effort and a mechanism is developed to provide the authority needed to make management decisions , the ability to accomplish the initiative in a timely and efficient manner is at risk . to ensure that the south florida ecosystem is restored in a timely and efficient manner , we recommend that the secretary of the interior , as the chairperson of the south florida ecosystem restoration task force , in conjunction with the other members of the task force , develop a strategic plan that will ( 1 ) outline how the restoration of the south florida ecosystem will occur , ( 2 ) identify the resources needed to achieve the restoration , ( 3 ) assign accountability for accomplishing actions , and ( 4 ) link the strategic goals established by the task force to outcome - oriented annual goals and work with the organizations and entities participating in the restoration effort to develop and agree upon a decision - making process to resolve conflicts in order to accomplish the initiative in a timely and efficient manner . in addition , the agencies noted that the report focuses only on the federal efforts and ignores the state's substantial efforts .
