thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our work on the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) — the largest federally - funded nutrition assistance program . today i will provide information from our ongoing and prior work , focusing on ( 1 ) snap e&t programs , including program participants , design , and fns oversight , and ( 2 ) fns's efforts to address program integrity , including improper payments and snap recipient and retailer fraud . to address the areas discussed in this testimony statement , we drew on our ongoing work on snap e&t programs , recipient fraud , retailer trafficking , as well as our prior work on improper payments . specifically , for our discussion of snap e&t programs , we analyzed data on snap e&t expenditures and participation collected by fns from the states for fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016 , the most recent data available . we also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations ; reviewed guidance and research from fns ; interviewed fns officials , as well as select state and local snap e&t staff from five states ; and reviewed our prior work on snap e&t programs . according to fns data , about 14 percent of snap recipients , or about 6.1 million , were work registrants who were subject to work requirements , and about 0.5 percent of snap recipients , or about 200,000 , participated in state snap e&t programs , in an average month of fiscal year 2016 . for example , according to fns , almost two - thirds of snap recipients were children , elderly , or adults with a disability in an average month of fiscal year 2016 — groups that are generally exempt . state snap agencies have broad flexibility in how they design their snap e&t programs , and the characteristics of these programs have changed in several ways over the last decade . for example , states have increasingly moved from mandatory to voluntary programs , focused on serving abawds , and partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services . 3. ) . fns and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity , including improper payments and fraud , and fns has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas , but concerns remain . in 2016 , we reviewed snap improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal snap policy in the previous decade , as well as improper payment rate calculation methods , likely affected these rates . in 2014 , usda identified snap improper payment data quality issues in some states and has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates . although usda reported national snap improper payment estimates for benefits paid through fiscal year 2014 , usda did not report a national snap improper payment estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 . according to usda , due to the data quality issues uncovered in 42 of 53 states during the reviews , the improper payment rates for those states could not be validated , and the department was unable to calculate a national improper payment rate for benefits paid in fiscal year 2015 . fns has increased its oversight of state anti - fraud activities in recent years by developing new guidance and providing training and technical assistance to states on detecting fraud by snap recipients and reporting on anti - fraud activities to fns . in our ongoing work , we are further reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify snap recipient fraud , including that which may be occurring during out - of - state transactions . in our 2006 report , we found that snap was vulnerable to retailer trafficking in several areas , including: requirements for food that retailers must stock to participate in snap: in 2006 , we found that fns had minimal requirements for the amounts of food that retailers must stock , which could allow retailers more likely to traffic into the program , although the agency has since taken steps to increase these requirements . focus on high - risk retailers: we also found in 2006 that fns had not conducted analyses to identify characteristics of retailers at high risk of trafficking and to target its resources — a shortcoming fns has since taken some steps to address . however , we and others , including a group of experts convened by fns , have identified some limitations with the retailer trafficking estimates .
