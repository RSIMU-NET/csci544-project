the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) of 2006 required gao to evaluate strategies and options for the long - term structural and operational reform of the united states postal service ( usps ) . usps's financial outlook is poor . our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the viability of usps's business model , ( 2 ) strategies and options to address the challenges to usps's current business model , and ( 3 ) actions congress and usps need to take to facilitate progress toward usps's financial viability . paea also made changes to usps's regulatory and oversight structure . mail volume declined 36 billion pieces over the last 3 fiscal years , 2007 through 2009 , due to the economic downturn and changing use of the mail , with mail continuing to shift to electronic communications and payments . usps lost nearly $12 billion over this period , despite achieving billions in cost savings , reducing capital investments , and raising rates . however , usps had difficulty in eliminating costly excess capacity , and its revenue initiatives had limited results . making the necessary progress would require ( 1 ) taking more aggressive actions to reduce costs and increase revenues within its current authority , using the collective bargaining process to address wages , benefits , and workforce flexibility , and ( 2 ) congressional action to address legal restrictions and resistance to realigning usps operations , networks , and workforce . usps has options to reduce its compensation and benefits costs in the following four key areas: workforce size , to be aligned with reduced workload ; wages , which continue to be a key component of costs ; benefits , which in some cases are more generous than those provided by other federal agencies ; and workforce flexibility , including the mix of full - and part - time employees and work rules that govern what tasks employees can perform . usps is also required to consult with its management associations that represent postmasters and supervisors . rising wages also increase benefit costs , such as pensions . the cost would have been nearly $21 billion if congress had not reduced usps payments for retiree health benefits by $4 billion to address a looming cash shortfall . there are multiple options for funding usps's retiree health benefit obligations . such deferrals , however , increase the risk that in the future usps will not be able to pay these obligations as its core business continues to decline and if sufficient actions are not taken to restructure operations and reduce costs . leverage the usps retail network: usps could maintain current retail facilities and leverage this network by providing other nonpostal goods or services . the significant deterioration in usps's financial condition over the past 2 years , its increasing debt , and the grim forecast for declining volume over the next decade led gao to add usps's financial condition to its high - risk list in july 2009 . usps forecasts of mail volume , revenue , and net income over the next decade quantify the magnitude of the challenges that it faces from continued volume decline to about 150 billion pieces in fiscal year 2020 — about the same as the volume level in fiscal year 1986 — and a projected cumulative $238 billion shortfall if no additional efficiency or revenue initiatives are undertaken . if usps is to continue being self - financing , congress , usps , and other stakeholders will need to reach agreement on major issues that impede its ability to implement actions to reduce losses . funding postal retiree health benefits: usps has said that it cannot afford its required prefunding payments on the basis of its significant volume and revenue declines , incurring large losses , nearing its debt limit , and limited cost - cutting opportunities under its current authority . furthermore , congress may want assurance through regular reports that any financial relief it provides is met with aggressive actions to reduce costs and increase revenues , and that progress is being made toward addressing its financial problems . at the same time , to facilitate making progress in difficult areas , congress should consider establishing ( 1 ) a panel of independent experts , similar to a brac - like commission , to coordinate with usps and stakeholders to develop a package of proposed legislative and operational changes needed to reduce costs and address challenges to usps's business model and ( 2 ) procedures for the review and approval of these proposals by the president and congress . the objectives of this report are to assess ( 1 ) the viability of usps's business model , ( 2 ) strategies and options to address challenges to usps's current business model , and ( 3 ) actions congress and usps need to take to facilitate progress toward usps's financial viability . u.s . postal service: usps has taken steps to strengthen network realignment planning and accountability and improve communication .
