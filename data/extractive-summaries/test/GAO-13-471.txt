this report addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which these field - based entities are distinct , fragmented , overlapping , or potentially duplicative ; ( 2 ) the extent to which doj , dhs , and ondcp hold these entities accountable for coordination and have assessed opportunities for coordination to reduce overlap and duplication and what practices , if any , select entities have reported using to coordinate and achieve efficiencies ; and ( 3 ) how , if at all , doj , dhs , and ondcp incorporate information they collect on the results that these field - based entities achieve when making funding decisions for them . the information provided in this report addresses the same questions as the sensitive report . to address the second objective and to identify efforts underway to improve coordination and information sharing among the entities and the federal agencies , including participation in interagency groups such as the information sharing and access interagency policy committee ( isa ipc ) within the executive office of the president , we analyzed documentation — including the 2007 national strategy for information sharing and the 2011 and 2012 reports to congress on federal efforts to implement an information sharing environment ( ise ) . overlap may result from statutory or other limitations beyond the agency's control . however , this fragmentation can be disadvantageous if activities are not coordinated , as well as if opportunities to leverage resources across entities are not fully exploited . riss centers do not have any full - time federal personnel . that is , the entities may conduct similar analytical or investigative support activities or services in support of similar goals in the same mission areas ( e.g. , all crimes , counterterrorism , and counternarcotics ) for similar customers ( e.g. , federal , state , and local agencies ) . five fusion centers reported that their mission was exclusively related to counterterrorism . hidta investigative support centers also have a performance measurement program that holds them accountable for referring leads to other hidtas and other agencies , but the program does not include measures about the hidta's ability to coordinate with other entities . therefore , agencies may have additional opportunities to apply these types of practices . although some of these agencies consider the results when they make decisions about future funding , others consider different factors — such as risk and threats — rather than results , or do not directly make decisions about future funding . according to bja officials responsible for overseeing the riss program , the agency collects information on riss centers' results to fulfill grant management requirements . recognizing that agencies are taking steps to ensure that two of the three systems officers use to deconflict their law enforcement actions are interoperable , we recommend that the director of ondcp work with the appropriate hidta officials to develop milestones and time frames for actions needed to make the third system , safetnet , interoperable in order to prevent unnecessary delays in reducing risks to officer safety and lessening the burden on law enforcement agencies that are currently using multiple systems . to help identify where agencies and the field - based entities they support could apply coordination mechanisms to enhance information sharing and reduce inefficiencies resulting from overlap , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security , the attorney general , and the director of ondcp work through the isa ipc or otherwise collaborate to identify characteristics of entities and assess specific geographic areas in which practices that could enhance coordination and reduce unnecessary overlap , such as cross - entity participation on governance boards and colocation of entities , could be further applied . doj , in its letter , stated that it generally agreed with the goal of the second recommendation to develop a mechanism to hold field - based information - sharing entities accountable for coordinating with each other , but that it did not concur that the department was not already actively promoting coordination . further , we acknowledge that entities serve as intermediaries to different customers , while each has a broader role in sharing information with its partners as appropriate . doj's letter also commented on the generalizeability of our analysis . before designating an area as a hidta , the director of ondcp must consider the extent to which the area is a significant center of illegal drug production , manufacturing , importation , or distribution ; state , local , and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug - trafficking problem in the area , thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem ; drug - related activities in the area are having a significant harmful impact in the area and in other areas of the country ; and a significant increase in allocation of federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug - related activities in the area .
