we are pleased to be here to discuss the results of our september 2013 report , which the subcommittee is releasing today , and the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) federal protective service ( fps ) to protect the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) . testimony discusses ( 1 ) challenges fps faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and ( 2 ) the extent to which fps and select federal agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies align with federal risk assessment standards issued by the interagency security committee ( isc ) . to identify the management controls and processes fps and the guard companies use to ensure compliance with training , certification , and qualification requirements , we reviewed fps's procedures for ( 1 ) conducting monthly guard file reviews ; ( 2 ) documenting compliance with guard training , certification , and qualification requirements ; and ( 3 ) monitoring performance . also , our previously issued reports were done in accordance with these standards . for example , of the 16 contract guard companies we interviewed about this topic: officials from eight contract guard companies stated that their guards have received active - shooter scenario training during fps orientation ; officials from five guard companies stated that fps has not provided active - shooter scenario training to their guards during the fps - provided orientation training ; and officials from three guard companies stated that fps had not provided active - shooter scenario training to their guards during the fps - provided orientation training , but that the topic was covered at some other time . fps agreed with our recommendation that they take immediate steps to determine which guards have not received this training and provide it to them . in response to our reports , fps stated that it planned to implement a program to train its inspectors to provide screener training to all of its contract guards . for example , an official at one contract guard company stated that 133 of its approximately 350 guards ( about 38 percent ) on three separate fps contracts ( awarded in 2009 ) have never received their initial x - ray and magnetometer training from fps . consequently , some guards deployed to federal facilities may be using x - ray and magnetometer equipment that they are not qualified to use ─thus raising questions about the ability of some guards to execute a primary responsibility to properly screen access control points at federal facilities . for example , although fps agreed with our 2010 and 2012 recommendations to develop a comprehensive and reliable system for contract guard oversight , it still does not have such a system . in our september 2013 report , we found that 23 percent of the 276 guard files we reviewed ( maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies we interviewed ) lacked required training and certification documentation.some guard files lacked documentation of basic training , semi - annual firearms qualifications , screener training , the 40-hour refresher training ( required every 3 years ) , and cpr certification . isc's risk assessment standards state that agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified by isc as possible risks to federal facilities , and assess the threat , vulnerability , and consequence of specific undesirable events . for example , officials from one agency told us that their vulnerability assessments are based on the total number of protective measures in place at a facility , rather than how vulnerable the facility is to specific undesirable events , such as insider attacks or vehicle bombs . because agencies' risk assessment methodologies are inconsistent with isc's risk assessment standards , these agencies may not have a complete understanding of the risks facing approximately 57,000 federal facilities located around the country — including the 9,600 protected by fps and several agencies' headquarters facilities . for example , if an agency does not know its facility's potential vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events , it cannot set priorities to mitigate them . in addition , we reported in 2012 that although federal agencies pay fps millions of dollars to assess risk at their facilities , fps's interim facility assessment tool — the modified infrastructure survey tool ( mist ) — was not consistent with federal risk assessment standards and had other limitations . specifically , fps's risk assessment methodology was inconsistent with isc's risk assessment standards because it did not assess the consequence of possible undesirable events ( i.e. , the level , duration , and nature of loss resulting from undesirable events ) . however , without a risk assessment tool that includes all three components of risk — threat , vulnerability , and consequence — as we have recommended , fps has limited assurance that facility decision - makers can efficiently and effectively prioritize programs and allocate resources furthermore , because to address existing and potential security risks.mist also was not designed to compare risks across facilities , fps has limited assurance that it prioritizes and mitigates critical risks within the agency's portfolio of more than 9,600 federal facilities . gao - 13-694 . washington , d.c.: september 2013 .
