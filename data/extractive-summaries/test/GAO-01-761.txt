usda's fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan have the potential for focusing the department's missions , but these efforts are compromised in a number of areas . usda's goals and measures are too general to give insight into the actual achievements that usda is striving to make . in particular , it is difficult to assess usda's progress when it uses unrealistic goals to achieve strategic outcomes and when it uses untimely data that has not been consistently verified . finally , usda missed the opportunity to develop strategies and plans to respond to the major management challenges identified by the oig . to improve usda's performance reporting and planning , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture ( 1 ) set priorities for improving the timeliness of the data that usda is using for measuring its performance ; ( 2 ) improve usda's performance report by including more consistent discussions of data verification and validation ; ( 3 ) better match the department's goals and outcomes with its capabilities for expanding and maintaining global market opportunities ; ( 4 ) include performance goals and measures for strategic human capital management issues and information security issues in the departmental performance plan ; ( 5 ) make reducing food stamp trafficking an annual performance goal in usda's plan ; and ( 6 ) address and include the office of inspector general's major management challenges in future performance plans .
