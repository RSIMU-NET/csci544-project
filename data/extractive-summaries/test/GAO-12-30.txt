on august 14 , 2008 , congress passed the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) to strengthen cpsc's authority to enforce safety standards and provide greater public access to product safety information . the act requires that the database be publicly available , searchable , and accessible through the cpsc web site . the cpsia - mandated database — saferproducts.gov — was launched on march 11 , 2011 . in the department of defense and full year continuing appropriations act , 2011 , congress required that we report on data in cpsc's safety information database . in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , ( 2 ) the extent to which the information required for submitting a report of harm is sufficient to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review a manufacturer's claim that a report of harm contains materially inaccurate information ( mii ) , and ( 3 ) the length of time cpsc takes to review and resolve manufacturers' claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm . cpsia requires , at a minimum , that the submitter include the following eight pieces of information when submitting a report of harm: ( 1 ) description of the consumer product sufficient to distinguish the product as a product or component part regulated by cpsc ; ( 2 ) identity of the manufacturer or private labeler by name ; ( 3 ) description of the harm related to use of the consumer product ; ( 4 ) approximate or actual date of the incident ; ( 5 ) category of submitter ; ( 6 ) submitter's contact information ; ( 7 ) submitter's verification that the information contained therein is true and accurate ; and ( 8 ) consent to publication of the report of harm . our analysis of cpsc data showed that as of july 7 , 2011 , 5,464 reports of harm were received by cpsc from eligible submitters . further , not all products have numeric identifiers . some industry representatives we spoke with have claimed that numeric product information such as model numbers or serial numbers should be required in all reports of harm in order to enable the product involved in the reported incident to be accurately identified . cpsc does not currently analyze its data to identify the number of reports of harm that contain either model numbers or serial numbers . instead its method of analysis combines numeric identifiers — model or serial numbers — and text entries . furthermore , some submitters include model and serial numbers in other database fields that cpsc does not include in its analysis . as noted earlier , on august 12 , 2011 , a new law was signed containing a requirement for cpsc to attempt to obtain the model number or serial number from submitters who did not provide this information in a report of harm . cpsc reviews mii claims for the following information: a unique identifier of the report of harm , the specific disputed sections of the report of harm , the basis for the allegation that the report of harm is inaccurate , evidence of the inaccuracy ( such as documents or photographs ) , the type of relief requested ( such as exclusion from the database or redaction of a section of the report ) , alternatives for correction other than removing the report from the database , and a statement that the person submitting the mii claim is authorized to do so by the manufacturer or private labeler . cpsc published 1,085 of these reports of harm with responses on saferproducts.gov , and 94 percent of these ( 1,020 ) were published within 10 business days of cpsc's having notified the company that a report of harm had been submitted . to address concerns about the time allowed to respond to claims of harm , congress passed amendments to cpsia to allow for a 15 business day publication time frame from the time cpsc transmits a report of harm to the manufacturer or private labeler in certain situations ( when an mii claim is made or the report does not contain a model number or serial number ) , during which cpsc reviews any response the company submits and determines whether or not to publish the report on saferproducts.gov . cpsc resolved 133 ( 92 percent ) of the 145 mii claims 10 business days or less after manufacturer notification . unless cpsc strengthens the analytic methods used to identify reports with missing model numbers or serial numbers , it will not be able to identify all reports that require the agency to contact the submitter for more product information because it currently does not track all reports of harm missing such information . to effectively implement the recent amendments to cpsia , we recommend that cpsc enhance the analytic methods it uses to identify product information in a report of harm , such as by verifying whether the model field in its data contains a number ( versus a text response , which would not meet the statutory requirement ) or by searching for model numbers or serial numbers that may be listed in other fields . as noted above , 24 percent said that the victim was their child , spouse , parent , or other relative . the reporting objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , ( 2 ) the extent to which the information required for submitting a report of harm is sufficient to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review a manufacturer's claim that a report of harm contains materially inaccurate information , and ( 3 ) the length of time cpsc takes to review and resolve manufacturers' claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm .
