a statutory formula determines monthly payment levels for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) . in addition , the law also eliminates from benefit calculations one year of a ssdi beneficiary's lowest earnings for every five years of earnings ( also known as the one - for - five rule ) , which equates to a maximum of five "disability dropout years" for an individual with 25 or more years of earnings . this report describes how workers become insured for ssdi benefits , how ssdi benefits are calculated , and the use of dropout years in benefit calculations . to be fully insured , a worker must have worked a minimum amount of time in employment covered by social security . a minimum of six quarters is required to become fully insured . in 2014 , each quarter of coverage requires $1,200 in earnings , which is indexed annually to average wage growth . in addition , a recency of work test requires the worker to have 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of disability ( generally five years of work in the last 10 ) . an exception applies to disabled workers under the age of 31 ; these individuals can meet the recency of work test by having credit in at least one - half of the calendar quarters during the period beginning with the quarter after the quarter the individual turned 21 and ending with the quarter that they became disabled . computation years may include years of zero earnings when the number of computation years is greater than the number of years of earnings ; it is these computation years of zero earnings for which cdys may be applied for eligible individuals . this provision reduces the effects of years of lower earnings on a disabled worker's benefit amount . in addition , in calculating the aime , disabled workers who receive fewer than three disability dropout years under the one - for - five rule ( as described above ) may be credited with up to two additional dropout years based on the care of a child , for up to a total of three dropout years .
