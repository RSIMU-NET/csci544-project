recreational trails require regular maintenance , including removal of trees and other debris and repairs to bridges . additionally , we found that the forest service's new computerized information system , to be operational in 1990 , was not planned to gather such data.issued that report , the forest service has faced new trail maintenance challenges , including widespread wildland fires , extensive tree die - offs due to insect and disease outbreaks , and more recreational use of its trails , all of which can require more maintenance to keep trails safe and passable . this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which the forest service is meeting trail maintenance needs , and effects associated with any maintenance not done ; ( 2 ) resources , including funding and labor , that the agency employs to maintain its trails ; ( 3 ) factors , if any , complicating agency efforts to maintain its trails ; and ( 4 ) options , if any , that could improve the agency's trail maintenance efforts . to evaluate the resources the forest service employs to maintain its trails , we reviewed allocation data in agency budget documents for fiscal years 2006 to 2012 . i for further details on our objectives , scope , and methodology. ) . for example , a trail may be designed and actively managed for hiker and equestrian use , although other uses , such as bicycling , might be allowed . for fiscal year 2012 , the agency reported that it accomplished at least some maintenance on about 37 percent of its trail miles , or 59,274 miles of trail , exceeding its fiscal year 2012 target of 46,580 miles . the lack of annual maintenance has led to a persistent deferred trail maintenance backlog , whose value in fiscal year 2012 was estimated by the forest service at $314 million . the forest service relies on a combination of internal and external resources to help maintain its trail system . for example , mt . in addition to internal resources , forest service officials reported using a number of external resources to support trail maintenance efforts , including volunteer labor and funding from other federal programs , states , and other sources . according to agency officials and stakeholders we spoke with , a number of factors complicate the forest service's trail maintenance efforts , including ( 1 ) factors associated with the origin and location of trails , ( 2 ) some agency policies and procedures , and ( 3 ) factors associated with management of volunteers and other external resources . many forest service trails are legacy trails created for purposes other than recreation , such as access for mining , timber harvesting , or firefighting . the forest service currently has no national , standardized training for these skills . administrative procedures . although volunteers and other external resources were repeatedly cited as important to the agency's trail maintenance efforts , officials and stakeholders we interviewed identified a number of complications related to working with volunteers , including insufficient agency emphasis on managing volunteers ; the time and effort it takes to coordinate , train , and supervise them , which decreases the time officials can spend conducting maintenance ; safety and liability concerns that limit local use of volunteers ; and the tenuous nature of partnerships . agency officials and stakeholders identified numerous options aimed at improving forest service trail maintenance , which generally fell into the following categories: ( 1 ) assessing the sustainability of the trail system , ( 2 ) improving certain policies and procedures associated with the forest service's management of the trails program , and ( 3 ) better using volunteers and other external resources . along with options for closing the gap.” many officials and stakeholders we interviewed told us that trail systems should be “right - sized” ; that is , units should assess their trail inventories in light of the resources available for maintenance and take steps , such as closing trails or portions of trails or reducing the maintenance on certain trails , so as to narrow the gap between funding and maintenance needs consistent with the framework . some officials indicated that training forest service employees on sustainable trail design might also improve trail sustainability , noting that agency field staff may not have a full understanding of how to assess trails for sustainability or how to redesign or relocate unsustainable trails because the agency has provided little guidance or training on this . improve data collection practices . given the value of volunteer hours devoted to forest service trail maintenance in fiscal year 2012 — equivalent to nearly one - third of the agency's trails allocation — some officials and stakeholders said that making collaboration with and management of volunteers clear expectations for trails staff ( e.g. , through performance evaluation standards ) and offering relevant training could enhance the agency's management of volunteers , as well as better reflect the central role that volunteers play in trail maintenance . to improve agency management of its trails program in the long term , particularly in light of the gap between program needs and available resources , the agency should take the following two actions consistent with the agency's framework for sustainable recreation: in line with the framework's emphasis on evaluating infrastructure investments and program costs , ( 1 ) ensure that the agency's management of its trails program includes an analysis of trails program needs and available resources and ( 2 ) develop options for narrowing the gap between program needs and resources . to conduct this work , we reviewed relevant laws and agency documents , including agency handbooks and other guidance . we selected these organizations to represent a variety of trail user , conservation , and industry perspectives .
