the benefit , which became available in january 2006 , enables medicare beneficiaries to enroll in drug plans sponsored by private companies . you asked us to review ( 1 ) the progress that ssa has made in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the low - income subsidy ; ( 2 ) the processes that ssa uses to make eligibility determinations , resolve appeals , and conduct redeterminations for the subsidy ; and ( 3 ) the impact that the subsidy had on ssa's workload and other operations . ssa approved 2.2 million subsidy applicants as of march 2007 , despite factors that limited its efforts to identify the eligible population and solicit applications ; however , measuring the success of its efforts is difficult because there are no reliable data on the size of the eligible population . to compensate for the lack of reliable data on the eligible population , ssa used data from a variety of federal sources to initially target its outreach effort to approximately 18.6 million potentially eligible medicare beneficiaries , which it believed to be an overestimate of the potentially eligible population . ssa took this approach because there were no reliable data on the size of the eligible population . ssa's efforts to solicit applications were hindered by various factors , including individuals' confusion over the difference between the prescription drug program and the subsidy , the reluctance of some individuals to share personal financial information , and eligibility requirements , among other factors . after over 2 years of implementation efforts , however , ssa's estimated participation rate of 32 to 39 percent of individuals who were not automatically deemed eligible for the subsidy compares favorably to those of some other low - income programs at a similar stage of implementation . as a result , ssa sent approximately 1.2 million notices to inform individuals that their continued eligibility status was being reviewed . although the subsidy program affected ssa's workload and operations , ssa officials said that the additional workload was manageable overall . ssa hired a total of 2,200 field office staff to assist with subsidy applications , as well as an additional 500 headquarters staff to support its mma activities . ssa officials stated that the agency's new responsibilities under the subsidy program have not adversely affected its other workloads . ssa officials attribute the light impact of the subsidy program to various factors , including the automation of the subsidy application process and the $500 million congressional appropriation it received for administrative start - up costs to implement its mma responsibilities . to improve ssa's outreach efforts and its ability to measure the effectiveness of the medicare part d low - income subsidy application processes , we recommend that the commissioner of social security: establish specific performance goals and measures for ssa's outreach activities to provide the agency with a means to assess their effectiveness in soliciting applications from additional individuals who qualify for the subsidy , but have not yet applied , and direct staff to begin collecting data on the processing time for individual redetermination decisions , and establish performance standards for processing time for the appeals and redetermination decisions . ssa stated that it monitors the time for completing the overall redetermination cycle , which provides adequate management controls for operational data . while ssa stated that it had established a performance standard for assessing the timeliness of appeals , in a follow - up discussion with agency officials after receiving their comments , they told us that the goal did not currently exist , but that the agency is planning to establish a goal of processing 75 percents of appeals in 60 days . irs also agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is willing to work with ssa in conducting such a study . to assess the social security administration's ( ssa ) implementation of the medicare part d low - income subsidy , we reviewed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) to understand ssa's responsibilities under the law .
