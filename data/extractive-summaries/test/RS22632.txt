the outcomes of u.s. policies toward pakistan since 9 / 11 , while not devoid of meaningful successes , have neither neutralized anti - western militants and reduced religious extremism in that country , nor have they contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan . many observers thus urge a broad re - evaluation of such policies , including a questioning of a seeming u.s. reliance on the institution of the pakistani military and on the person of president musharraf , along with a shifting of considerable u.s. assistance funds toward programs that might better engender long - term stability in pakistan .
