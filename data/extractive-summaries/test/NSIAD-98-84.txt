specifically , we reviewed ( 1 ) the extent , nature , and cost of civil military projects ; ( 2 ) the consistency of dod's guidance on the irt program with statutory requirements ; ( 3 ) the conformity of selected projects to statutory requirements , especially those dealing with military training ; and ( 4 ) the effectiveness of the office of the secretary of defense's ( osd ) and service secretaries' oversight of such projects . dod officials do not know the full extent of the irt program . using available service and osd records for fiscal year 1997 , we found that most of the projects were engineering , infrastructure , or medical in nature . for example , the benefiting organizations were eligible for the assistance , and the provision of assistance did not interfere with units' or individuals' military functions . while the statute requires that individuals providing assistance perform tasks directly related to their military specialties , on two of the projects we reviewed , some individuals' tasks were not directly related to their specialties . thus , it appeared that the goal of completing a project sometimes took priority over the goal of providing valid military training . in addition , we were unable to determine whether providing the assistance had resulted in a significant increase in the cost of training for any of the six projects because dod has established no basis for making such a determination . osd has provided limited and inconsistent oversight of irt projects and the delivery of support and services under them . for the most part , oversight is limited to those projects that receive supplemental irt program funding . even within those projects , osd did not always follow its own processes for ensuring the statutory requirements for civil military projects were met and did not have procedures in place to ensure that military organizations were meeting the statutory requirement not to provide assistance that results in a significant increase in training costs . while the legislation does not permit centralized direction of activities under the irt program , it does not preclude dod from conducting oversight . the total dod cost to fund this project is not known , but it was at least $2.3 million .
