since the mid - 1990s , gao has highlighted the need for the department of state and other agencies to establish a systematic process for determining their overseas staffing levels . however , because the questions were developed primarily based on our work at the u.s. embassy in paris , omb was not confident that the questions could be uniformly applied at all posts worldwide . to accomplish this objective , we applied the questions to each post in west africa by reviewing embassy planning and requirements documents and by interviewing embassy managers and officials in the department of state's bureau of african affairs regarding each embassy's security , mission , cost , and rightsizing options . our work at the three posts in west africa further demonstrated that our framework and corresponding questions can provide a systematic approach for assessing overseas workforce size and identifying options for rightsizing in developing countries . officials at the embassies in dakar , banjul , and nouakchott agreed that security vulnerability should be a key concern in determining the size and composition of staffing levels at the posts and should be addressed in conjunction with the other rightsizing elements of mission and cost . in keeping with the administration's rightsizing initiative , we are recommending that the director of omb , in coordination with the secretary of state , ensure that application of our framework be expanded as a basis for assessing staffing levels at embassies and consulates worldwide ; and the secretary of state adopt the framework as part of the embassy mission performance planning process to ensure participation of all agencies at posts and the use of comparable criteria to address security , mission , cost issues , and rightsizing options . to determine the extent to which our framework's questions are applicable in developing regions , we visited three west african embassies â€” dakar , senegal ; banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania . cost data were incomplete and fragmented . is there adequate justification for the number of direct hire personnel devoted to support and administrative operations ? .
