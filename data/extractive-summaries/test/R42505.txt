the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , formerly called the food stamp program , is designed primarily to increase the food purchasing power of eligible low - income households to a point where they can buy a nutritionally adequate low - cost diet . this report describes the rules related to eligibility for snap benefits and the rules related to the issuance and use of benefits . this law , formerly the food stamp act of 1977 , has since 1973 been reauthorized by the "farm bill," omnibus legislation that also typically includes the reauthorization of other federal agricultural policies and programs . 113-79 ) . see crs report r43332 , snap and related nutrition provisions of the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) changed the name of the program from the food stamp program to snap and revised the name of the governing law from the food stamp act to the food and nutrition act . the u.s. department of agriculture's food and nutrition service ( usda - fns ) administers snap . snap benefits are available for households that meet federal financial eligibility tests for limited monthly income and liquid assets . as of february 2018 , 42 states utilize broad - based categorical eligibility , although several do so with an added limit on liquid assets . to be eligible for snap , a household must fulfill requirements related to work effort and must meet citizenship and legal permanent residence tests . in general , the maximum snap benefit is based upon the level of the u.s. department of agriculture's lowest cost food plan ( the thrifty food plan or tfp ) and varies by household size . net income is the gross income with certain specified deductions subtracted . its financial tests require that those eligible have monthly income and liquid assets below limits set by law and adjusted for inflation . categorical eligibility rules make some automatically eligible for snap assistance ( most who receive a benefit from the temporary assistance for needy families [tanf] block grant or receive supplemental security income [ssi] or state [ga] cash benefits ) . the eligibility rules of snap , discussed above , create a framework by which individuals ( constituting a household ) are eligible or ineligible for benefits , but once eligible , the participant is also subject to a benefit calculation process , which determines the household's monthly benefit amount or allotment . an eligible household's net income is determined ( i.e. , the deductions noted earlier for judging eligibility are subtracted from gross income ) , its maximum benefit level is established , and a benefit is calculated by subtracting its expected contribution ( by law , 30% of its net income ) from its maximum allotment . benefits are provided through electronic benefit transfer ( ebt ) systems under which recipients are issued a debit - like card that they use to make food purchases . snap benefits are not the same as cash . snap benefits may be redeemed only at authorized retailers . regarding inventory and sales requirements , an eligible retailer must either offer ( 1 ) three varieties of qualifying foods in each of the four staple food categories , and ( 2 ) perishable foods in at least two of the staple food categories ; or , have more than 50% of total sales from the sale of eligible staple foods ( this option is often used for specialty stores that may specialize in certain of the staple food categories , e.g. , a bakery , produce store , or butcher ) .
