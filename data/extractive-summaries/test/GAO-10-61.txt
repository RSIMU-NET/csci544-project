under the accounting standards , fiscal year 2008 was generally the first year that the largest governments were to begin reporting , in annual financial statements , the amount of government's obligation to employees who have earned opeb ; these amounts are known as opeb liabilities . this has raised concerns about the fiscal pressures that state and local governments will face in the coming decades and leads to questions about the actions state and local governments can take to address their opeb liabilities , such as changing their retiree health benefits . this report describes ( 1 ) what has been reported in state and local governments' comprehensive annual financial reports ( cafr ) about unfunded opeb liabilities , ( 2 ) actions state and local governments have taken to address the liabilities associated with retiree health benefits , and ( 3 ) the overall fiscal pressures these governments face . we determined that the state and local government cafr data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes , which were to describe the total unfunded opeb liability reported ; the total opeb liability , assets , and unfunded liability for each of the individual governments for which we reviewed cafrs ; as well as the ranges of unfunded opeb liabilities , assets , and funded ratios reported . as variation between studies' totals shows , totaling unfunded opeb liabilities across states and local governments can be challenging . approximately 35 percent of the governments for which we reviewed cafrs — 18 of 50 states and 13 of 39 local governments — reported having set aside at least some assets for opeb liabilities for one or more entities in the government , as of their actuarial valuation . although we reviewed cafrs for all the states and focused our review on cafrs for the 39 largest local governments , and included some of the largest unfunded liabilities , we did not review opeb data for all governments . when governments value their opeb liabilities , a decrease in the discount rate or increase in the health care inflation rate used results in higher unfunded opeb liabilities , holding other factors , like the benefit plan and employee population , constant . some state and local governments have taken actions to address their liabilities associated with retiree health benefits by setting aside assets in order to prefund the liabilities and reducing these liabilities by changing the structure of retiree health benefits . among the 10 selected governments whose actions we reviewed in more detail , officials from the governments that were prefunding at least a portion of their retiree health liability reported using irrevocable trusts . while governments also make relatively routine changes to the health benefits they offer retirees ( such as changing co - payments , deductibles , or covered benefits ) that could affect their liability , we identified three key types of changes our selected governments have made to the structure of retiree health benefits: changing the type of retiree health benefit plan , changing the level of the government's contribution toward retirees' health insurance premiums , and changing the eligibility requirements employees need to meet to qualify for retiree health benefits . level of government contribution: some of the governments we selected have changed the level of the contribution they provide toward retiree health insurance premiums by reducing the amount or proportion of health insurance premiums paid for by the government or by changing how the level of contribution is calculated . the changes were most often applied to newly hired employees or currently active employees . however , spending on state and local government retirees' health benefits is projected to more than double as a share of total operating revenues by 2050 , from 0.9 percent to 2.1 percent . those sources include workplace economics , state government retiree health benefits: current status and potential impact of new accounting standards , 2004 ; cato institute , unfunded state and local health costs: $1.4 trillion , 2006 ; standard and poor's , u.s. state and quantifying opeb liabilities and developing funding strategies as the gasb deadline nears , 2007 ; national association of state comptrollers , annual opeb survey , 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 ; pew center on the states , promises with a price: public sector retirement benefits , 2007 ; credit suisse , you dropped a bomb on me , gasb , 2007 ; the center for state and local government excellence , at a crossroads: the financing and future of health benefits for state and local government retirees , 2009 ; and robert clark and melinda sandler morrill , health plans for retired state employees: is there a funding crisis ? . in particular , the assumptions regarding health care cost growth are critical .
