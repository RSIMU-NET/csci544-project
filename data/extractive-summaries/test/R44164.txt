title i - a of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) authorizes the largest grant program in the esea , funded at $14.9 billion in fy2016 . it is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other students attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low - income families . the u.s. department of education ( ed ) determines title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) based on four separate funding formulas: basic grants , concentration grants , targeted grants , and education finance incentive grants ( efig ) . the esea was comprehensively reauthorized by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l . 114-95 ) on december 10 , 2015 . this report provides a general overview of the key components of each of the four formulas used to allocate title i - a funds and changes to these factors made by the essa . annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's title i - a appropriation to be allocated to leas and states under each of these formulas . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a "formula child count," consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an "expenditure factor" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor . these maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula , taking into account a variety of state and lea minimum grant and "hold harmless" provisions . some leas may qualify for a grant under only one formula , while other leas may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas . thus , in a state with less variation in appe among its leas , the use of the weights produces smaller differences in the weighted formula child counts of leas with a relatively high number of formula children or a relatively high formula child rate as compared with other leas in the state ; thereby , lessening the differences in grant per formula child to each lea in that state relative to grants that are provided to states in which appe among leas is less equitable .
