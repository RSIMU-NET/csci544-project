the challenge for those who wish to expand the use of market incentives in health care is to design policies that align material incentives facing consumers and providers of health care so that changes in behavior enhance economic efficiency . the report provides an overview of efforts to expand the use of market or market - like institutions in health care and considers effects of these initiatives or proposals on the federal budget . economists' belief in the efficiency of markets is based on the invisible hand theorem , which states that market outcomes are efficient , so long as certain conditions hold . an externality , or spillover effect , exists when one's consumption or production affects the ability of another to consume or produce . no one has an informational advantage over others . no market power . the invisible hand theorem takes the distribution of buying power as given . the rapid rise in health care costs is straining public budgets at all levels of government , and projected increases in health care costs promise to intensify pressures on public budgets . if health care costs continue to grow at past rates , cutbacks in other types of consumption will be inevitable . even if health care costs moderate , a substantial portion of the gains from economic growth will be directed towards the health care system . rising health care costs have cut into the growth of other types of consumption for most households . in the decades following world war ii , productivity and incomes grew fast enough relative to health care costs to allow steady increases in health and non - health spending . market competition has brought rapid technological change , higher quality , and lower prices to many parts of the economy , leading many to ask why broader application of market principles to the health care system could not reduce costs and improve performance . information asymmetries between patients and physicians as well as between providers and payers stem from the unavoidable need for highly specialized roles .
