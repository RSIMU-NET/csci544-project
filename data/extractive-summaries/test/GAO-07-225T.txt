however , tsa has recently placed additional focus on securing surface modes of transportation , particularly in the area of passenger rail security . regarding passenger rail security , key department of homeland security ( dhs ) stakeholders with critical roles include the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , which is responsible for securing all modes of transportation , and the office for grants and training ( ogt ) , which provides grant funds to rail operators and conducts risk assessments for passenger rail agencies . in particular , my testimony highlights three key areas: ( 1 ) the actions that dhs and its component agencies have taken to assess the risks posed by terrorism to the u.s. passenger rail system ; ( 2 ) the actions that tsa and other federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of the u.s. passenger rail system ; and ( 3 ) the security practices that domestic and selected foreign passenger rail operators have implemented to mitigate risks and enhance security . my comments today are based on gao's september 2005 report addressing the security of the u.s. passenger rail system and selected updates on this program obtained in january 2007 . the dhs office of grants and training has developed and conducted risk assessments of passenger rail systems to identify and protect rail assets that are vulnerable to attack , such as stations and bridges . while tsa has begun to establish a methodology for determining how to analyze and characterize the risks identified , the agency has not completed a comprehensive risk assessment of the u.s. passenger rail system . until tsa completes this effort , the agency may be limited in its ability to prioritize passenger rail assets and help guide security investment decisions about protecting them . however , federal and rail industry stakeholders have questioned the extent that these directives were based on industry best practices and expressed confusion about how tsa would monitor compliance with the directives . for example , tsa has tested rail security technologies , developed training tools for rail workers , and issued a proposed rule in december 2006 regarding passenger and freight rail security , among other efforts . we also observed security practices among certain foreign passenger rail systems or their governments that are not currently used by the domestic rail operators we contacted , or by the u.s. government , which could be considered for use in the u.s. for example , some foreign rail operators randomly screen passengers or utilize covert testing to help keep employees alert to security threats , and some foreign governments maintain centralized clearinghouses on rail security technologies and best practices . while introducing any of these security practices into the u.s. rail system may pose political , legal , fiscal , and cultural challenges , they nevertheless warrant further examination . because neither this element nor the framework as a whole has been finalized or provided to tsa or other sector - specific agencies , it is not clear what impact , if any , dhs's framework may have on ongoing risk assessments conducted by , and the methodologies used by , tsa , ogt , and others , and whether or how dhs will be able to use these results to compare risks and prioritize homeland security investments among sectors . fra has also taken a number of actions to enhance passenger rail security since september 11 , 2001 . in response to a previous recommendation we made , dhs and dot signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to develop procedures by which the two departments could improve their cooperation and coordination for promoting the safe , secure , and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the transportation system . for example , 11 of the 13 operators we interviewed had implemented a customer awareness program . gao - 05-851 .
