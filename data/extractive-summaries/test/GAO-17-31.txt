to address both objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance . to conduct case studies , we selected five states ( california , colorado , kentucky , ohio , and pennsylvania ) , which were among those identified by national associations as 1 ) having substantial experience developing and implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , or regional planning prior to wioa , and / or 2 ) making significant changes to implement any of these strategies under wioa . furthermore , we interviewed dol and education officials . in these plans , states are required to include career pathways strategies , which help job seekers obtain employment or education , and sector partnership strategies , which engage employers in the workforce system . with respect to the requirement that states establish regions , dol regulations state that the purpose of these regions is to align workforce development activities and resources with larger regional economic development areas and available resources to provide coordinated and efficient services to both job seekers and employers . each of the five selected states had experience with career pathways , sector partnerships , or both prior to the enactment of wioa , and officials in these states told us that wioa provided an opportunity to enhance the strategies they already had in place . similarly , pennsylvania's state plan proposes building on over 10 years of experience with sector partnerships by increasing technical assistance and seeking additional funding for these partnerships , and exploring the development of a certification program for such partnerships . in each of the five selected states , officials reported involving a wide range of stakeholders in enhancing or developing career pathways , sector partnerships , or regional planning strategies , and sought their input in various ways . for example , officials in two states said they involved the state agency overseeing the vocational rehabilitation program to a greater extent under wioa , and officials in the other three states said that the wioa planning process was the first time they involved this agency in workforce planning efforts . for example , these officials said that including these stakeholders led them to train staff at all of their one - stop centers on disability awareness . each of the five selected states consulted multiple sources of labor market information ( lmi ) , which helped officials in some states better align career pathways strategies with employer needs , and helped officials in all five states draw regional boundaries and assign local workforce areas to those proposed regions . in colorado , officials said one example is that when they asked employers to review projections that the state would experience a shortage of workers in the medical industry over the next 10 years , employers said they actually would need more workers over a shorter time period . officials then used this information to focus their career pathways strategies on preparing individuals to fill the jobs projected to have worker shortages by identifying entry - level jobs that could eventually lead to these higher - level jobs . officials in the selected states reported facing challenges establishing regions , which they addressed by revising their regional boundaries or increasing the number of regions and by providing incentives for future regional collaboration or innovation . for example , some local officials may be reluctant to change local area boundaries that have been in place for many years . dol and education officials said they are aware that states have faced challenges designating regions , and plan to provide states with technical assistance on implementing other wioa regional planning requirements . in addition , a kentucky official said the state is also using a private grant to fund regional efforts to develop career pathways and sector partnership strategies and ensure that they help job seekers obtain credentials that are valued by employers . we provided a draft of this report to the department of education and the department of labor for review and comment . both departments provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . we examined 1 ) the approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) provisions related to career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning , and 2 ) the related planning challenges , if any , these states have encountered and how they have addressed them . in order to gather further information on their planned strategies and corroborate information from interviews , we reviewed the plans submitted by these five states to dol and education and other relevant documentation , such as documents summarizing the state planning process , state board meeting minutes and agendas , state guidance for local workforce areas , and other reports or materials produced by the state board .
