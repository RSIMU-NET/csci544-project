the trio programs are the primary federal programs providing support services to disadvantaged students to promote achievement in postsecondary education . the higher education amendments of 1968 ( p.l . 90-575 ) consolidated a "trio" of programs under one overall program . collectively , the trio programs are designed to identify qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds , prepare them for a program of postsecondary education , provide support services for postsecondary students , motivate and prepare students for doctoral programs , and train individuals serving or preparing for service in the trio programs . there are six main trio programs ( in descending order of funding levels ) : trio upward bound ( ub ) program , trio student support services ( sss ) program , trio talent search ( ts ) program , trio educational opportunity centers ( eoc ) program , ronald e. mcnair postbaccalaureate achievement ( mcnair ) program , and trio staff development ( training ) program . this report serves as an introduction to the trio programs . each of the trio programs is designed to serve a different target population of participants through a different level of education . the following subsections describe the purpose , eligible recipients , program participants , program intensity and activities , and outcome criteria of each of the trio programs and are ordered according to their sequence in the educational pipeline: ub primarily supports the college preparation of secondary students , ts primarily supports the postsecondary enrollment of secondary students , eoc primarily supports the postsecondary enrollment of adult students , sss primarily supports the completion of undergraduate education , mcnair primarily supports graduate school preparation , and training supports trio staff development . the number of ts participants declined , in part , as a result of ed reducing the ts allocation from $142 million in fy2010 to $139 million in fy2011 and establishing $460 as the maximum cost per participant in the fy2011 competition in response to the heoa amendments , which increased the intensity of ts services . several statutory provisions common to most of the trio programs were amended or added by the higher education opportunity act ( heoa ; p.l . 110-315 ) of 2008 . support services that mimic those provided by trio projects may supplement the trio services provided to trio participants and may be provided to the comparison or control group . the review determined that ub projects do not typically target the students , those with lower expectations and at higher risk , for which the program was most effective according to an independent evaluation .
