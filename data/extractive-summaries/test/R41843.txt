some , particularly the agreement's opponents , argue that the agreement could lead to increased u.s. imports of goods or components made in north korea . as a result of north korea's relative economic isolation , the undeveloped state of its export sector , and u.s. trade restrictions , the united states imports virtually no finished goods from north korea . those concerned that the korus fta would change this situation focus considerable attention on the kaesong industrial complex ( kic ) , a seven - year - old industrial park located in north korea just across the demilitarized zone , where more than 100 south korean manufacturers employ over 45,000 north korean workers at relatively low wages . critics argue that south korean firms could obtain low - cost kaesong - made goods or components , incorporate the latter into finished products such as electronics or automobiles , and then reship the final goods to the united states with "made in [south] korea" labels . if the korus fta were in effect , the argument runs , these goods might receive preferential treatment , to the benefit of the north korean government , which receives revenue from the kic . the third section addresses the issue of how , if at all , the korus fta would affect potential u.s. imports of north korean content , including whether the agreement could result in legal action against the u.s. government if it kept out imports of north korean content . over the course of the 2000s , north korea's significant export markets shrunk to two countries , south korea and china , which in 2010 appear to have accounted for over three - quarters of north korea's export shipments . the korus fta appears likely to have only a minimal impact on whether u.s. sanctions on north korean imports are put to the test . the korus fta's preferential terms would not apply to finished goods made in the kic , and the provisions for bringing the kic into the agreement include multiple opportunities for the united states , including congress , to block such a move by a future south korean government . as long as u.s. sanctions on north korean imports remain in place and are adequately enforced , the korus fta's rules of origin — which are used to determine the country of origin of imported products — would apply only in cases where an importer has received a license from ofac to bring in a south korean good that contains north korean components . there is no means to determine with one hundred percent certainty that there are no goods or components originating in north korea entering u.s. commerce without proper authorization . an example of the challenge faced is the automobile supply chain , in which chinese or south korean producers could source one of thousands of components from a low - wage north korean producer and then seek to evade u.s. customs authorities by not reporting the item to ofac or cbp . the ability of the united states to enforce its restrictions would then depend to a large extent upon the level of u.s. - south korea customs cooperation — which arguably would be enhanced by the korus fta — and the severity of the penalties charged for non - compliance with u.s. import restrictions .
