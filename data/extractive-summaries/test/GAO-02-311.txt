a growing backlog of cases and longer processing times have prompted concern on the part of taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders about the management of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) offer in compromise ( oic ) program . generally , irs considers offers in cases in which taxpayers cannot afford to pay the full tax liability . specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine why the inventory of cases and case processing times have continued to grow ; ( 2 ) assess whether irs's current initiatives for managing the oic program will reduce inventory and processing times ; and ( 3 ) determine whether irs is fulfilling the requirements of the restructuring act in terms of independently reviewing all proposed rejections of offers , considering the facts and circumstances of each case , and not rejecting offers from low - income taxpayers solely on the basis of the amount offered . because of concern that this decision would leave some taxpayers unable to qualify for either an installment agreement or an offer , you asked us to determine the extent to which irs has information on how the counsel decision affects taxpayers and to evaluate irs's legislative proposal for a new partial payment installment agreement program . program changes , some initiated by irs and some mandated by the restructuring act , contributed to increases in the demand for offers , the number of processing steps , and the number of staff hours needed to process a case . demand exceeded the number of offer cases closed by staff . less complex offers will be processed centrally using standardized procedures intended to reduce staff hours per case and allow processing by lower - grade staff , while more complex offers will continue to be processed by higher - grade professional staff . irs expects to stabilize inventory and keep up with the flow of new cases by the end of fiscal year 2002 . projecting offer submissions . instead , the only option for irs was to put the account in inactive status , creating , according to irs officials , a new group of cases for which there was no resolution . evaluations could determine the effectiveness of the initiatives and the reasons for their effectiveness .
