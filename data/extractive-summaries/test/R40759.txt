local and regional procurement ( lrp ) of food aid refers to the purchase of commodities for emergency food aid by donors in countries with food needs or in another country within the region . lrp is used extensively by the united nations world food program ( wfp ) and has been proposed as a cost - effective , time - saving tool that the united states could use to meet emergency food needs . food aid budget submissions in fy2006 through fy2009 included a proposal with suggested legislative language to authorize the administrator of the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) to allocate up to 25% of the funds available for u.s. food aid ( title ii of p.l . 480 , or the food for peace act ) to local or regional purchase . the budget justification for this authority was that it would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the u.s. response to overseas food aid needs by eliminating the need to transport the commodities by ocean carriers . congressional and other critics of the local purchase proposal maintain that allowing non - u.s. commodities to be purchased would result in undermining the coalition of commodity producers , agribusinesses , private voluntary organizations ( pvos ) , and shippers that participate in the food aid program and in reducing u.s. food aid . instead , the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . are there risks that could be associated with lrp that would make it a less - effective response to emergency food needs than provision of u.s. commodities ? . almost all u.s. food aid is provided in the form of u.s. commodity donations . p.l . while the united states is the world's largest food aid provider , other food aid donors , including the european union ( eu ) and eu member countries , canada , and australia , among others , also provide food aid . the eu , the world's second - largest supplier of food aid , supplies almost all of its food aid in the form of cash . the wfp and pvos have been using donor funding to procure commodities in developing countries for more than 30 years . evaluations of lrp have focused on the cost - effectiveness of lrp versus u.s. commodity donations and the timeliness of delivery of lrp versus overseas donations . however , usaid lrp initiatives and the wfp's purchase for progress program have begun explorations of how low - income farmers in developing countries could participate in lrp efforts carried out by wfp or usaid . in the 111 th congress , lrp was dealt with in appropriations bills and in proposed authorizing legislation in both the house and senate . the president's fy2010 foreign affairs budget called for $300 million to be allocated to usaid's international disaster assistance ( ida ) program to be used for lrp and the financing of cash transfers and cash vouchers to meet food security objectives . the house - passed foreign operations appropriations bill ( h.r . 111-366 ) stipulates that "a significant portion of the funds available under this heading ( $845 million ) will support food assistance in fiscal 2010 and will be in addition to the $1.169 billion designated in this act for food security and agricultural development. .
