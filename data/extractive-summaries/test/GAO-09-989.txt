serving and protecting the nearly 5 million americans who reside overseas as well as the u.s. citizens who take more than 64 million trips to foreign countries each year are chief priorities of the department of state ( state ) . this report addresses: ( 1 ) what services state provides to u.s. citizens who are the victims of crimes , suffer accidents , or otherwise need emergency services ; ( 2 ) how state is prepared to assist u.s. citizens in need of emergency services ; and ( 3 ) how state monitors the assistance it provides to u.s. citizens in need of emergency services . overseas , emergency services are provided by state's 267 embassies and consulates in 174 countries . when no support can be found , the post may provide a loan . consular affairs provides information to travelers and americans living overseas through several of mechanisms . embassies and consulates also maintain a warden system for american citizens living overseas . while state uses a variety of means , including web sites , to provide information for american citizens in need of emergency assistance , emergency contact information is not immediately apparent on many embassy or consulate web sites . state's main web site has a link on its front page , under “travel,” that includes a subdirectory on emergency services , which includes emergency phone numbers to call from the united states or abroad ( see fig . state provides guidance , training , and other resources to ensure staff are able to carry out these services . while state provides a wide range of emergency services to american citizens overseas , state's ability to comprehensively analyze the global demand for these services is hampered by limitations with its data systems . although state shifts consular resources to meet emergency service demands , such as in the case of the mumbai bombings , resource allocation , training , and planning decisions may not be based on a clear understanding of global workload . to ensure the bureau of consular affairs has accurate and reliable data from the mechanisms used to monitor and evaluate its provision of emergency services worldwide , and therefore make informed resource allocation decisions , we recommend that the secretary of state direct the bureau of consular affairs to take the following two actions: provide guidance on the information to be entered into the acs system to ensure that data are consistently captured across posts and accurately reflect workload , and improve functionality in the acs system so that consular affairs and posts can use the system more effectively . we also interviewed foreign service officers and locally employed staff at all the posts we visited about the training they received both formally and on the job , as well as the resources at their disposal , including training and mentoring provided by regional consular officers at selected posts , guidance provided by senior - level consular officers to entry - level officers at large posts , and new forums for providing information , such as a consular - supported blog focused on acs and the regional consular officer forum .
