each year , the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) insures billions of dollars in multifamily housing mortgage loans to facilitate the construction , substantial rehabilitation , purchase , and refinancing of apartments and health care facilities . hud's guidance requires an fha - approved lender wishing to participate in map to submit documentation demonstrating , among other things , that it is financially sound , has a satisfactory lending record , and has qualified underwriters . hud did not always comply with or effectively implement processes and procedures for reviewing and monitoring map lenders' underwriting of loans . hud's procedures require field staff to conduct and document reviews of lenders' mortgage insurance applications to ensure lenders' compliance with hud's underwriting requirements before the loans are insured . however , at the field offices we visited , we found that the staff did not always properly document their reviews . to hold map lenders accountable for specific violations of program requirements or for exhibiting patterns of noncompliance , hud's office of multifamily housing can suspend or terminate their ability to participate in the map program . strengthen the lender qualifications and monitoring division's monitoring of lenders and hud field offices , by ( 1 ) establishing a time frame for finalizing and issuing written operating procedures that include criteria for selecting loans and lenders for review that pose a high insurance risk to the department ; ( 2 ) issuing written reports on all quality assurance reviews conducted in fiscal year 2001 to the cognizant map lenders and hud field offices ; and ( 3 ) developing a process for aggregating and analyzing the results of quality assurance reviews to identify patterns of underwriting deficiencies and program violations by map lenders .
