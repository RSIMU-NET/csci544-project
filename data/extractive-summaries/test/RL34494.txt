the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . the implementation was , subsequently , delayed until tax years beginning after december 31 , 2010 , by p.l . 110-289 . in the 111 th congress , the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 , p.l . 111-92 , delayed implementation of the worldwide allocation rules to 2018 , while the hiring incentives to restore employment act , p.l . 111-147 , further delayed implementation to 2021 . another proposal in the 111 th congress , h.r . 3962 , the affordable healthcare for america act of 2009 , would repeal the worldwide allocation rule . tax planning techniques could undermine this objective — and lead to increased revenue loss and efficiency costs . the foreign tax credit provisions generally permit u.s. taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they pay against u.s. taxes they would otherwise owe — on a dollar - for - dollar basis . the foreign tax credit , however , generally alleviates the possibility of double - taxation of foreign - source income . with the credit , the u.s. concedes that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income and collect the tax revenue that it generates . while it is beyond the scope of this report to determine if the fungibility of debt is a reasonable assumption , except to recognize that it underlies both the current interest allocation rules and those enacted by the jobs act , some facts on each side are worth noting . current law contains a subgroup election for firms that are banks . as mentioned above , the jobs act contains a number of rules intended to limit the extent to which the expansion of the bank group election can be used to avoid interest allocation . if debt is fungible , worldwide allocation is the most accurate method of ensuring that the u.s. foreign tax credit is used for its intended purpose: allowing the foreign tax credit to offset the full share of u.s. pre - credit tax that falls on foreign source income . while the distortions created by current law can be viewed as a cost of collecting taxes — since they increase u.s. revenue — and potential increased distortion associated with worldwide rules cannot since they decrease u.s. revenue . finally , the subgroup election provision in the jobs act does not appear consistent with the general objective of the foreign tax credit limit or the act's own worldwide allocation regime . this appendix derives the allocation rules that most accurately support the foreign tax credit limitation — the rules that most accurately limit creditable foreign taxes to u.s. tax on foreign - source income . the basic limitation without allocation of interest assume a multinational's u.s. tax liability can be expressed as: ( 1 ) u.s. tax = t ( y + d / ( 1 - t f ) - ib d ) - td / ( 1 - t f ) ; where t is the u.s. tax rate , y is u.s. - source income before interest deductions , d is dividends from a foreign subsidiary , t f is the foreign tax rate , i is the interest rate , and b d is domestic borrowing . clearly , if fungibility is assumed , requiring no allocation rules does not result in an effective limitation . this can be accomplished by allocating part of domestic interest to foreign sources and part of foreign interest to domestic sources — since foreign borrowing has already been netted out of the dividend . with worldwide allocation , worldwide interest is allocated the same way regardless of where it originates , so that the only effects that multiply the expression ti , each one less than one , that dilute but do not eliminate the effect of the foreign tax credit limit . in this case , however , the worldwide allocation rule will further discourage investment abroad because of a more powerful effect on the allocation rule .
