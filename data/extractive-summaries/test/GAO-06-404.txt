visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is a governmentwide program for controlling and monitoring the pre - entry , entry , visa status , and exit of foreign visitors . control environment . however , the program office did not effectively oversee us - visit – related contract work performed on its behalf by other dhs and non - dhs agencies , and these agencies did not always establish and implement the full range of controls associated with effective management of their respective contractor activities . further , the program office and other agencies did not implement effective financial controls . in addition , some agencies improperly paid and accounted for related invoices , including making a duplicate payment and making payments for non - us - visit services from funds designated for us - visit . according to the us - visit program official responsible for contract matters , the program office has initially focused on contracts that it manages directly . to effectively oversee program - related contracts being managed by others , it is important for a program office to , at a minimum , depending on the nature of the contract , ( 1 ) define the roles and responsibilities for both itself and the entities it relies on to manage the contracts , ( 2 ) know the full range of such contract work that has been completed and is under way , and ( 3 ) define and implement the steps it will take to obtain visibility into the degree to which contract deliverables meet program needs and requirements , which underpin the program goals and outcomes . although the program office has generally established and implemented key contractor management controls on those contracts that it manages directly , it has not adequately overseen us - visit – related contracts that were managed by other dhs and non - dhs agencies . develop and implement practices for overseeing contractor work managed by other agencies on the program office's behalf , including ( 1 ) clearly defining roles and responsibilities for both the program office and all agencies managing us - visit – related contracts ; ( 2 ) having current , reliable , and timely information on the full scope of contract actions and activities ; and ( 3 ) defining and implementing steps to verify that deliverables meet requirements . require dhs and non - dhs agencies that manage contracts on behalf of the program to ( 1 ) clearly define and delineate us - visit work from non - us - visit work as performed by contractors ; ( 2 ) record , at the contract level , amounts being billed and expended on us - visit – related work so that these can be tracked and reported separately from amounts not for us - visit purposes ; and ( 3 ) determine if they have received reimbursement from the program for payments not related to us - visit work by contractors , and if so , refund to the program any amount received in error . with respect to its own financial management , dhs said that for us to declare that us - visit depended on another agency for financial management support without identifying the agency and the system , in combination with our acknowledging that we did not examine the effectiveness of this unidentified system , implies that our report's scope is broader than what our congressional clients asked us to review .
