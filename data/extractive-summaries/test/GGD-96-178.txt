this report summarizes the results of , and discusses the methodologies used in , the studies that have been done on the cycle of sexual abuse â€” that is , on the likelihood that individuals who were victims of sexual abuse as children will become sexual abusers of children in adulthood . if researchers take a retrospective approach , and ask adult sex offenders whether they experienced childhood sexual abuse , there are problems of selecting a representative sample of offenders , finding an appropriate comparison group of adults who have not committed sex offenses but are similar to the study group in other respects , minimizing errors that arise when recalling traumatic events from the distant past , and dealing with the possibility that offenders will purposely overreport childhood abuse to gain sympathy or underreport abuse to avoid imputations of guilt . another four presented findings from two prospective research studies , which began with samples of sexually victimized children and tracked them into adulthood to determine how many became sex offenders . there was no consensus among the studies we reviewed that being sexually abused as a child led directly to the victim's becoming an adult sexual abuser of children . however , some studies did conclude that it might increase the risk that victims would commit sexual abuse later . a majority of the retrospective studies noted that most sex offenders had not been sexually abused as children , and the two prospective studies showed that the majority of victims of sexual abuse during childhood did not become sex offenders as adults . we reviewed 23 retrospective studies . sexually abused children were significantly more likely to have been arrested for prostitution , however .
