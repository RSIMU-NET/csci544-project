generally , electricity cannot be easily stored , so power plants' electricity output must be matched continuously with demand , which varies significantly depending on the time of day and year . batteries and other energy storage technologies can store energy in one form — such as chemical , mechanical , or thermal energy — and transform the energy to generate electrical power . this report examines ( 1 ) how energy storage can be used to enhance grid operations and performance ; ( 2 ) factors that affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations ; and ( 3 ) federal and state policies and other efforts that address the deployment of energy storage . we selected studies to review based on their relevance to energy storage , its role in grid operations , and factors affecting deployment of storage for grid operations . for all of the objectives , we conducted interviews with officials and representatives of 41 stakeholder groups including federal and state government agencies , industry , and other stakeholders . these markets include capacity markets — auctions through which owners of power plants can be compensated for agreeing to make their plants available to provide electricity at a specified time in the future — designed to incentivize the building and retention of enough generation and other resources to meet future power demands ; energy markets for scheduling which power plants will generate electricity throughout the day to maintain the balance of electricity generation and consumption , and at what prices ; and ancillary services markets , which are designed to maintain electric reliability and ensure that supply and demand remain in balance from moment to moment so that grid operators can deliver electricity within technical standards , such as at the right voltage and frequency . energy storage can be used in various ways to enhance the reliability , resilience , and efficiency of grid operations , according to studies we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed . storage can be deployed throughout the electricity system and act as a generation , transmission , distribution , or customer - sited asset to provide various services , address operational challenges and needs , and potentially reduce costs . for example , storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions , relieve transmission congestion during periods of high demand , defer the need for transmission or distribution system upgrades , and provide backup power during a power outage . energy storage can support the reliability of grid operations by helping grid operators respond to fluctuations in electricity supply resulting from the variability of renewable energy resources , such as solar or wind , or disruptions to the grid , such as the loss of a transmission line or a generating unit . these factors include industry and technology readiness , safety concerns and stringency of siting requirements , increasing use of renewable resources , the cost - competitiveness of storage and challenges with quantifying the value of storage , and the regulatory environment . industry and technical challenges affecting deployment of storage include uncertainty about the performance of certain storage technologies over time and in various operating conditions . limited information on cost . doe's fiscal year 2018 budget request proposed reducing this funding by about 74 percent , to $8 million , and proposed eliminating , among other efforts , work related to engagements with states , utilities , and storage providers for conducting tests and trials ; engagements with state and federal regulatory officials on efforts to understand regional market barriers to deployment ; validation of system performance and analysis of regional use cases ; support to states and regional entities for the procurement , commissioning , and analysis of deployed systems ; the development of enhanced tools and data for sharing with industry for the development and use of grid - scale batteries ; and participation in both industry - led and international codes and standards development . in march 2018 , ferc published a final rule that aims to address barriers to integrating storage into organized wholesale markets . through interviews with stakeholders and our review of documents , we identified examples of policies and other efforts that have encouraged the deployment of energy storage or aim to address market barriers , including the establishment of mandates and targets for storage adoption , the revision of interconnection rules and planning requirements , financial incentives , and funding .
