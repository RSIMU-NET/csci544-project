participation in school sports can benefit children , but it also carries a risk of injury , including concussion . concussion can affect memory , judgment , reflexes , speech , balance , and muscle coordination and can result in serious complications , such as swelling , bruising , or bleeding of the brain , which can cause permanent disability or death . several factors may affect decisions about when it is safe for an athlete to participate in sports again , which are referred to as return - to - play decisions . research has also shown that children and adolescents are more likely than adults to sustain a concussion and take longer to recover from one , although the reasons for this difference remain unclear . to determine what is known about the nationwide occurrence of concussion incurred in high school sports , we conducted a literature search of social science and medical databases to find articles published from 1999 through 2009 that discuss or report national data from public or private programs for tracking the occurrence of concussion in high school sports . we then reviewed the laws and identified their key components , similarities , and differences . to describe the recommendations of voluntary nationwide guidelines for the management of concussion incurred in high school sports , we interviewed federal officials and experts to obtain assistance in identifying nationwide guidelines and to obtain information about the development of the guidelines . the agencies provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . we identified three national databases that , as part of broader data collection efforts , collect information on the occurrence of concussion in high school sports , but they do not provide an overall national estimate of occurrence . according to experts and federal officials , while none of the databases can provide a national estimate of the occurrence of concussion in high school sports , two of them provide national estimates of the occurrence of concussion for the populations they study . the third database , nccsi , provides information on cases of concussion with serious complications , but it cannot provide national estimates of occurrence of all concussions . for example , high school rio gathers information only on concussions that are reported to or observed by a certified athletic trainer , but , according to officials from an athletic trainers' association , athletes may be reluctant to report symptoms of possible concussions to athletic trainers to avoid being removed from play . the heads up: concussion in high school sports tool kit includes a concussion guide for coaches with information on signs and symptoms and strategies for preventing concussions , a coach's quick - reference wallet card , a coach's clipboard sticker with concussion facts and space for emergency medical contacts , two fact sheets — one for parents and one for athletes — in english and spanish , an educational dvd , posters for school gymnasiums , and a disc that contains additional resources . other federal agencies administer programs related to concussion , but most of these programs are not directed specifically at the prevention of concussion in high school sports . these initiatives are not targeted exclusively at high school sports , but are directed more broadly at sports and recreation safety for youth and adults . the three key state laws regarding the management of concussion that were identified by federal officials and experts all include requirements related to concussion education and athletes' return to play . the return - to - play requirements of the key state laws vary with respect to the conditions under which the requirements apply and the personnel who may authorize return to play . all three state laws include requirements for education on concussion , but they vary in the groups targeted and the content and frequency of the education . the oregon law is unique in that it requires that coaches receive education on concussion symptoms annually . the washington law requires that an athlete suspected of having a concussion be evaluated and cleared to return to play by a health professional specifically trained in the evaluation and management of concussion . federal officials and experts we spoke with identified five sets of voluntary nationwide guidelines that address the management of concussion in sports . all sets of guidelines also recommend returning an athlete to play on a gradual basis , tailored to the individual athlete's recovery and based on the athlete's signs and symptoms and the results of various concussion assessment tools , such as tests of memory , cognition , balance , and physical exertion .
