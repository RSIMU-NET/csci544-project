each year , millions of visitors come to the united states legally on a temporary basis either with a visa or , in some cases , as visitors who were allowed to enter without a visa . overstays are individuals who were admitted into the country legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized periods of admission . however , overstays could pose homeland security the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has primary responsibility for identifying and taking enforcement action to address overstays . in addition to taking actions in response to the recommendations we have made , since april 2011 , dhs has reported taking other actions to strengthen its processes for identifying and taking enforcement action against overstays , such as enhancing its use of biographic data to identify overstays and developing plans to capture biometric data as part of departure records to comply with federal law . this report addresses ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to review records that are maintained in its databases to identify potential overstays , ( 2 ) the extent to which dhs's changes in its systems or processes have improved data on potential overstays and dhs's ability to report overstay rates , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dhs has made progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system . we also conducted interviews with ice and dhs office of policy officials regarding the department's plans to calculate and report overstay rates using the data available in its component agency systems and evaluated those plans based on statutory requirements and standards for internal control . dhs has implemented or taken actions to implement some of these recommendations ; however , dhs has not addressed others . dhs reviewed a backlog of records of potential overstays that we dhs uses adis to match departure previously identified in april 2011.records to arrival records and subsequently close records for individuals with matching arrival and departure records because either ( 1 ) the individual departed prior to the end of his or her authorized period of admission and is therefore not an overstay , or ( 2 ) the individual departed after the end of his or her authorized period of admission and is therefore an out - of - country overstay . in april 2011 , we reported that , as of january 2011 , adis contained a backlog of 1.6 million unmatched arrival records that dhs had not reviewed through automated or manual processes . according to our analysis of dhs documentation , since completing this review of the backlog of records of potential overstays in the summer of 2011 , as new records have accrued , dhs has continued to review all records of potential overstays through national security and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats , regardless of whether the subjects of the records meet ice's priorities for enforcement action . since dhs conducted its review of the previous backlog in 2011 , additional unmatched arrival records have accrued , and as of june 2013 , dhs has more than 1 million unmatched arrival records in adis ( that is , arrival records for which adis does not have a record of departure or status change ) , which do not meet ice's enforcement priorities . thus , dhs has not manually reviewed them and does not plan to take enforcement action against these individuals . however , challenges to reporting reliable overstay estimates remain . although dhs has improved connections among its various databases used to help identify potential overstays , these improvements do not address some of the underlying data quality and reliability issues we previously identified . moreover , gao's standards for assessing computer - processed data , which can provide a framework for assessing dhs's computer - processed overstay data , states that care should be taken to ensure that collected data are sufficient and appropriate . however , development and implementation of a biometric exit capability has been a long - standing challenge for dhs . as a result , as of april 2013 , according to dhs officials , the department's planning efforts focus on developing a biometric exit capability for airports , with the potential for a similar solution to be implemented at seaports , and dhs's planning documents , as of june 2013 , do not address plans for a biometric exit capability at land ports of entry . to address these concerns , dhs is conducting outreach and soliciting information from airlines and airports regarding their operations . although dhs's may 2012 report stated that dhs would take steps to address the report's recommendations by may 2014 , dhs officials told us that the department's current goal is to develop information about options for biometric air exit and to report to congress in time for the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle regarding ( 1 ) the additional benefits that a biometric air exit system provides beyond an enhanced biographic exit system and ( 2 ) costs associated with biometric air exit . to help improve confidence in the quality of overstay data that dhs plans to report in december 2013 in accordance with statutory reporting requirements , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct relevant dhs components to assess and document the extent to which the reliability of the data used to develop any overstay estimates has improved and any remaining limitations in how the data can be used .
