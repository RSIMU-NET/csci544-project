this report responds to your requests that we assess the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to reduce problem disbursements and its implementation of section 8137 of public law 103-335 , department of defense appropriations act , 1995 , which required that each disbursement exceeding $5 million be matched to the appropriate obligations in dod's official accounting records before the disbursement is made . as of january 31 , 1996 , dod reported that it had reduced the $37.8 billion of problem disbursement balances to $25.4 billion . on february 28 , 1995 , dod submitted its plan — which was a general overview plan describing processes and milestones for automating the prevalidation process and lowering the prevalidation threshold to $1 million — to the congress , and the dod ig provided the defense congressional committees with its independent assessment , which generally agreed with the plan and dod's overall approach for implementation . prevalidating disbursements to obligations helps to ensure that this is done , but dod has not followed this basic accounting procedure . dod had automated prevalidation to electronically process certain disbursement data between the dfas columbus center's disbursing system , known as the mechanization of contract administration services ( mocas ) , and eight dod primary contract accounting systems . the dod ig has made specific recommendations to address these problems in its report on the prevalidation program . however , since prevalidation at dfas columbus is made only for payments exceeding $5 million , large numbers of transactions , amounting to tens of billions of dollars , are excluded from this important accounting control . dod's problems with accounting for and reporting on disbursements will not be resolved until ( 1 ) weaknesses in control procedures that allow problem disbursements to occur are corrected and ( 2 ) improvements are made to dod's contract pay , disbursing , and accounting processes and systems .
