section 302 of the dwrra provides a mechanism by which holders of existing leases can apply for royalty relief , which is to be granted by the secretary of the interior if the lease would otherwise be uneconomic . on august 4 , 2007 , the house passed h.r . 3221 . included in this omnibus energy bill is the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 . since the kerr - mcgee ruling was issued on october 30 , 2007 , there has been extensive congressional interest in the impact of the ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 , as described above . the recent ruling by the u.s. district court for the western district of louisiana , if upheld , would effectively eliminate the distinction between the 1998 and 1999 deep water leases , which do not include price thresholds , and the 1996 , 1997 and 2000 deep water leases , which contain price thresholds that are not enforceable because they are in violation of congressional intent in enacting section 304 of the dwrra . as noted above , section 7504 ( d ) ( 1 ) defines a "covered lease" as "a lease for oil or gas production in the gulf of mexico that is ... issued by the department of the interior under section 304 of the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act ... and ... not subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market prices that are equal to or less than the price thresholds" described in the dwrra . if congress does wish to encourage recovery of royalties on all leases issued pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra between 1996 and 2000 that are limited by both price and volumetric thresholds , it could likely do so by passage of the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as it is currently worded in sections 7501-7505 of h.r .
