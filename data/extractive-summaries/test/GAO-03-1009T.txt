over the years , gao , state's office of the inspector general ( oig ) , and various commissions and studies have identified numerous management weaknesses at state . in addition , gao and others have identified management challenges and operational deficiencies at usaid that affect the agency's ability to implement its programs . ongoing attention to resource management issues at both state and usaid will be needed to ensure that the department and the agency take advantage of opportunities for more efficient operations and achieve budget savings wherever possible . in addition , state plans to spend $262 million over fiscal years 2003 and 2004 on information technology modernization initiatives overseas . the management of real property is an area where state could achieve major cost savings and other operational efficiencies . in total , between fiscal years 1997 through 2002 , state sold 129 properties for more than $459 million . state estimates it will sell additional properties between fiscal years 2003 and 2008 valued at approximately $300 million . if state continues to streamline its operations and dispose of additional facilities over the next several years , it can use those funds to help offset the cost of replacing about 160 embassies and consulates for security reasons in the coming years . seds provide obo with the ability to contract for shortened design and construction periods and control costs through standardization ; shifted from “design - bid - build” contracting toward “design - build” contracts , which have the potential to reduce project costs and construction time frames ; developed and implemented procedures to enforce cost planning during the design phase and ensure that the final designs are within budget ; and increased the number of contractors eligible to bid for construction projects , thereby increasing competition for contracts , which could potentially result in lower bids . we reported in january 2003 that these cost - cutting efforts allowed obo to achieve $150 million in potential cost savings during fiscal year 2002 . in addition , state has already taken some rightsizing actions to improve the cost effectiveness of its overseas operating practices . for example , state plans to spend at least $80 million to purchase and renovate a 23-acre , multi - building facility in frankfurt , germany — slated to open in mid - 2005 — for use as a regional hub to conduct and support diplomatic operations ; has relocated more than 100 positions from the paris embassy to the regional financial services center in charleston , south carolina ; and is working with omb on a cost - sharing mechanism , as previously mentioned , that will give all u.s. agencies an incentive to weigh the high costs to taxpayers associated with assigning staff overseas . as state continues to modernize information technology at overseas posts , it is important that the department employ rigorous and disciplined management processes on each of its projects to minimize the risks that the department will spend large sums of money on systems that do not produce commensurate value . in recent years , state has made improvements to its strategic planning process both at headquarters and overseas that are intended to link staffing and budgetary requirements with policy priorities . continued improvements to strategic and performance planning will ensure that state is setting clear objectives , tying resources to these objectives , and monitoring its progress in achieving them — all of which are essential to efficient operations . now i would like to discuss some of the challenges usaid faces in managing its human capital , evaluating its programs and measuring their performance , and managing its information technology and financial systems . meanwhile , usaid's program budget has increased from $7.3 billion in 2001 to about $12 billion in fiscal year 2003 , due primarily to significant increases in hiv / aids funding and supplemental funding for emerging programs in iraq and afghanistan . usaid is aware of its human capital management and workforce planning shortcomings and is now beginning to address some of them with targeted hiring and other actions . usaid management has acknowledged these weaknesses and the agency is making efforts to correct them . state department: sale of unneeded property has increased , but further improvements are necessary . gao - 01-11 .
