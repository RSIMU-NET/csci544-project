in 2000 , congress authorized usaid to order , transport , and store food for prepositioning in the united states and in foreign countries . this report examines the ( 1 ) effects of usaid's prepositioning on delivery time frames for emergency food aid shipments , ( 2 ) the effects of prepositioning on the costs of emergency food aid , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the agency monitors prepositioning to maximize time savings and cost effectiveness . for wfp , prepositioning food aid in overseas and domestic warehouses shortened delivery time frames by an average of almost a month . for nine of usaid's other cooperating sponsors , prepositioning food aid in domestic and overseas warehouses shortened delivery time frames by an average of more than 2 months . wfp officials also stated that because prepositioned food is available for immediate collection from warehouses , prepositioning helps ensure a sufficient food aid supply to meet spikes in demands due to unforeseen emergencies . we estimated , using statistical modeling to control for various factors , that prepositioning food aid commodities in overseas and domestic warehouses in fiscal years 2007 through 2012 saved an average of about 67 days for nine of usaid's cooperating sponsors , compared with usaid's standard shipping process . for both overseas and domestic prepositioning , usaid incurs additional warehouse costs that it does not incur for standard shipments . additionally , the framework does not outline guidelines for evaluations on timeliness or costs . limitations in some data from several other cooperating sponsors . according to usaid's automated directives system , the agency should collect and analyze data to make necessary program adjustments and to guide higher - level decision making and resource allocation . to strengthen usaid's ability to help ensure that its food aid prepositioning program meets the goal of reducing delivery time frames in a cost - effective manner , we recommend that the usaid administrator take the following three steps to systematically 1. collect , and ensure the reliability and validity of , data on delivery time frames for all emergency food aid shipments , including prepositioned food aid shipments ; 2. monitor and assess data on delivery time frames for prepositioned food aid shipments ; and 3. monitor and assess costs associated with commodity procurement , shipping , and storage for prepositioned food aid shipments . warehouse costs . we also interviewed usaid officials in washington , d.c. , to discuss the extent to which the agency has taken steps to monitor the program . to identify additional commodity costs associated with usaid's domestic and overseas prepositioning of emergency food aid , we compared the weighted average annual prices paid for six key prepositioned commodities with the weighted average annual prices paid for each of those commodities for standard shipments of emergency food aid in fiscal years 2007 through 2012 . gao - 13-809 . world food program: stronger controls needed in high - risk areas .
