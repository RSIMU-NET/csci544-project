our work has shown that a careful consideration of federal pay is essential to fiscal stewardship and is necessary to support the recruitment and retention of a talented , agile , and high - performing federal workforce . high - performing organizations have found that the full life - cycle of human capital management activities — including workforce planning , recruitment , on - boarding , compensation , engagement , succession planning , and retirement programs — need to be fully aligned and focused on the cost - effective achievement of an organization's mission . however , despite some improvements in the federal government's management of its personnel in recent years , strategic human capital management — and more specifically , the need for the office of personnel management ( opm ) and agencies to address skills gaps in mission critical occupations — continues to be a gao high risk area . in my remarks today , i will discuss ( 1 ) lessons learned in creating a more market - driven , results - oriented approach to federal pay , and ( 2 ) opportunities in addition to pay and benefits that opm and agencies could use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps . the bottom line is that , while the federal compensation system may need to be re - examined , it will also be important for agencies to make better use of the management tools already available to them . indeed , more effective use of hiring flexibilities , adopting leading human capital management practices , and strengthening the capacity of agencies' human resource offices could significantly improve executive branch personnel management , and thus help agencies to better carry out their missions in an era of highly constrained resources . my testimony is based on our large body of work on federal human capital management issued primarily between june 2012 and march 2017 . recognizing that the federal government's pay system does not align well with modern compensation principles ( where pay decisions are based on the skills , knowledge , and performance of employees as well as the local labor market ) , congress has provided various agencies with exemptions from the current system to give them more flexibility in setting pay . this type of system is a critical component of a larger effort to improve organizational performance . our 2005 work showed that implementing a more market - based and more performance - oriented pay system is both doable and desirable . moreover , representatives of public , private , and nonprofit organizations , in discussing the successes and challenges they have experienced in designing and implementing their own results - oriented pay systems , told us at the time they had to shift from a culture where compensation is based on position and longevity to one that is performance - oriented , affordable and sustainable . focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system . examine the value of employees' total compensation to remain competitive in the labor market . 3 . 4 . when devolving such decision making , overall core processes help ensure reasonable consistency in how the system is implemented . 5 . 6 . build consensus to gain ownership and acceptance for pay reforms . 7 . as we noted in our 2017 high - risk update , agencies can drive improvements to their high risk areas — including strategic human capital management — through such steps as: sustained leadership commitment , including developing long - term priorities and goals , and providing continuing oversight and accountability ; ensuring agencies have adequate capacity to address their personnel issues , including collaborating with other agencies and stakeholders as appropriate ; identifying root causes of problems and developing action plans to address them , including establishing goals and performance measures ; monitoring actions by , for example , tracking performance measures and progress against goals ; and demonstrating progress by showing issues are being effectively managed and root causes are being addressed . by analyzing hiring authorities , opm and agencies could identify opportunities to refine authorities , expand access to specific authorities found to be highly efficient and effective , and eliminate those found to be less effective . we and others have found that the work of the federal government has become more highly skilled and specialized than the gs classification system was designed to address when it was created in 1949 when most of the federal workforce was engaged in clerical work . collectively , these attributes provide a useful framework for considering refinements or reforms to the current system . among other things , we found effective performance management helps agencies establish a clear “line of sight” between individual performance and organizational success and using core competencies helps to reinforce organizational objectives . the human resources specialist occupation continues to be one of six government - wide , mission - critical skills gap areas identified by opm .
