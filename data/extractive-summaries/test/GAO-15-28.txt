in the public sector , federal insurance programs include the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) , administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the u.s. department of homeland security , which makes flood insurance available to residential property owners and businesses , and the federal crop insurance program , administered by the risk management agency ( rma ) within the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , which protects farmers against financial losses caused by drought , floods , and other natural disasters , among other things . this report examines ( 1 ) how federal and private exposure to losses has changed since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance and how climate change may affect insured and uninsured losses ; ( 2 ) how public insurers are preparing for climate change and associated challenges , if any ; and ( 3 ) how selected private insurers and reinsurers are preparing for climate change and associated challenges , if any . to understand longer - term trends in exposure , we also analyzed federal exposure data from 2000 . federal law prohibits crop insurance from covering losses due to a farmer's failure to follow good farming practices . executive order 13653 , which was signed in november 2013 , directs federal agencies to , consistent with their missions , ( 1 ) address barriers to the nation's resilience to climate change ; ( 2 ) reform policies that may , perhaps unintentionally , increase the vulnerability of natural or built systems , economic sectors , natural resources , or communities to climate change ; and ( 3 ) identify opportunities to support and encourage smarter , more climate - resilient investments . growing federal and private sector exposure since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance has increased insured and uninsured losses to date , and climate change and related increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events may further increase such losses in coming decades . specifically , inflation - adjusted federal exposure to potential insured losses grew from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion ( 8 percent ) from 2007 through 2013 . according to our analysis of the most recent data available , private sector exposure grew from an estimated $60.7 trillion to $66.5 trillion ( 10 percent ) from 2007 through 2012 , in 2014 dollars . the 20 scientific and industry studies we reviewed that examined the historical loss record generally found that the exposure growth in hazard - prone areas has largely driven increased insured and uninsured losses to date . recent assessments of loss projections for certain weather events suggest that climate change may increase losses substantially by 2040 , and potentially double annual losses by 2100 , compounding existing loss trends . based on this report's findings , fema initiated two pilot studies to analyze sea - level rise and its impacts in special flood hazard areas . these risk transfer methods reduce exposure to losses from extreme weather . first , federal law encourages federal insurers , such as fema and rma , to provide affordable insurance to policyholders through subsidized rates , which lessens the agencies' ability to collect sufficient premiums from policyholders to pay claims , increases the federal government's fiscal exposure , and may reduce policyholders' incentives to manage risk by giving them inaccurate signals about the level of risk . property insurance contracts typically estimate and communicate risk of property losses for the 1-year term of a policy . for example , certain practices , such as conventional tillage and traditional irrigation methods , may maintain historic crop yields in the short - term , but they may inadvertently reduce agriculture's long - term resilience through increased erosion , depleted soil quality , and inefficient water use . many private property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have taken some steps since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance to understand and report on their risks associated with climate change , including participating in industry climate change surveys , and issuing reports that identify and assess climate change risks and trends in weather - related losses . while selected insurers we interviewed said they manage climate change risks through their underwriting practices , we found that the industry faces challenges in preparing for long - term climate change , such as short - term insurance contracts and catastrophe modeling limitations . however , the agencies continue to face fundamental challenges that send inaccurate price signals to policyholders about their potential risk of loss and increase federal fiscal exposure , and may unintentionally increase their policyholders' vulnerability to climate change risks . in its written comments , usda referenced our finding that rma's good farming practices focus on maintaining historic crop yields over the term of the annual insurance contract and that some of these practices may unintentionally increase the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change , contrary to executive order 13653's directive for agencies to manage vulnerabilities to climate change . in its written comments , dhs concurred with our findings that fema has taken action to better understand and prepare for climate change's potential effects and that fema faces challenges that may limit its ability to minimize long - term federal exposure to climate change .
