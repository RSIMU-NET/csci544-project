epa's data show that most emissions determinations are based on generic emissions factors . while epa allows facilities to estimate their emissions in this manner , epa officials generally consider direct methods to be more reliable . the accuracy of these reports is important because they influence ( 1 ) the financing of states' regulatory programs through fees and ( 2 ) the development of emissions inventories , which , in turn , assist regulators in developing control strategies and establishing permit limits . furthermore , steps taken to assess the accuracy of these reports — such as more thoroughly reviewing the supporting information — could provide benefits in terms of compliance with clean air act requirements . for example , a more thorough review of the information underlying a facility's emissions reports or a more systematic comparison of these reports over a period of time could identify indications of increased emissions . such indications could , in turn , trigger a review of compliance with new source review requirements , an area where epa found widespread noncompliance in four industries . the state that performed the most detailed reviews found widespread inaccuracies . while taking steps to improve its overall compliance - monitoring strategy , epa does not plan to evaluate state processes for verifying emissions reports from large facilities . the acting assistant administrator questioned the intent of our recommendation , stating that if the intent is to improve the accuracy of emissions reports to ensure the sufficiency of fees that states collect to support their title v permit programs , epa disagrees and believes the recommendation is unnecessary because the states can simply raise the fee rate ( the fee per ton of emissions ) if fee revenues prove insufficient ; if the intent is to improve the emissions inventories used in state planning and in developing national inventories , epa concurs ; and if the intent is to improve compliance with applicable permit requirements , epa disagrees because emissions reports are not intended to determine compliance with permit requirements .
