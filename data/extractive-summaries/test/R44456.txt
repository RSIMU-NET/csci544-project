a separate major project operated by the state of california , the state water project ( swp ) , delivers about 70% of its water to urban users ( including water for approximately 25 million users in the south bay [san francisco bay] , central valley , and southern california ) ; the remaining 30% is used for irrigation . after five years of drought , rain and snowstorms in northern and central california in the winter of 2016-2017 improved water supply conditions in the state in 2017 . according to the u.s. drought monitor , as of april 18 , 2017 , less than 1% of the state was in severe drought conditions . this represents a drastic improvement from one year ago , when 73% of the state was in severe drought conditions , and two years ago , when 92% fell under this designation . the stress on water supplies due to the drought resulted in cutbacks in water deliveries to contractors receiving water from the cvp and swp . after several consecutive years of cutbacks , in a series of announcements in spring 2017 , reclamation provided its estimated water allocations for cvp contractors in water year 2017 ( october 2016 through september 2017 ) . for the first time in years , water allocations for most cvp water contractors were 100% . although some contractors south of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers' delta ( bay delta ) received a lower allocation in the initial march 2017 announcement ( 65% for agricultural contractors and 90% for municipal and industrial contractors , respectively ) , reclamation subsequently revised these allocations upward to 100% in april . legislation enacted in the 114 th congress ( subtitle j of s. 612 , the water infrastructure improvements for the nation ( [wiin] act ) incorporated provisions from multiple california drought - related bills that had been considered dating to the 112 th congress . these provisions directed pumping to "maximize" water supplies for the cvp ( in accordance with applicable biological opinions ) , allowed for increased pumping during certain high water events , and authorized expedited reviews of water transfers . it is unclear the extent to which these provisions were used prior to 2017 allocations . h.r . 23 , the gaining responsibility on water act ( grow act ) , incorporates a number of provisions that were included in legislation during the 112 th - 114 th congresses , including those that were proposed in the 114 th congress but were not included in the final version of the wiin act . this report provides high - level summary information on recent hydrologic conditions in california and their impact on state and federal water management , with a focus on deliveries related to the federal cvp . as a result of increased precipitation , water levels at several of california's largest reservoirs also continued to rebound in 2017 relative to prior years ( see figure 2 ) . these and other changes had been proposed in legislation dating to the 112 th congress . during consideration of the bill , supporters of cvp operational changes contended that they could potentially make available additional water to users facing curtailed deliveries , while also improving the flexibility and responsiveness of the management and operations of the cvp and swp . according to reclamation , changes in the wiin act that directed increased communication and transparency in certain operational decisions influenced some decisions in the early part of winter 2016-2017 and led to the avoidance of certain pumping restrictions . similar to recent congresses , the 115 th congress is expected to consider new legislation that proposes additional changes to cvp operations . congress may consider this and similar legislation , as well as oversight of cvp operations and implementation of wiin act cvp provisions .
