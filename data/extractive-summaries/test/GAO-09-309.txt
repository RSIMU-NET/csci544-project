in fiscal year 2008 , $667 million in grants were awarded to over 500 institutions . in this requested report , we address the following questions: ( 1 ) what are the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v , including the characteristics of students served ; ( 2 ) what challenges do grantees face , and how have they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges ; and ( 3 ) to what extent does the department of education monitor the financial and programmatic performance of title iii and v grantees , and use this information to target its technical assistance ? . this program provides discretionary grants to help institutions that serve large numbers of low - income students improve their academic quality , institutional management , and fiscal stability . median tuition and fees at eligible institutions were 12 percent less than at ineligible institutions for 2-year private , not - for - profit institutions , and 38 percent less at 4-year private , not - for - profit institutions . at both eligible and ineligible 2-year public institutions , more than 60 percent of students attended part - time . according to data collected through education's annual performance reports , fiscal year 2006 grantees reported spending almost $385 million in total grant funds on activities across all four focus areas , with over three - quarters of the funds expended in the areas of academic quality and student support services ( see fig . based on our review of a representative sample of grant applications , we estimate that all grantees reported challenges in improving academic quality , such as recruiting and training highly qualified faculty , using the latest technology in the classroom for instruction , improving academic space , and tailoring courses to student needs . nearly all grantees reported difficulty providing student support services , including remedial courses , tutoring , and academic counseling . specific examples of how institutions used grant funds to address student support challenges follow: a 2-year strengthening institution in illinois reported in 2005 that 75 percent of its first - year students were at risk of leaving college without a degree because the institution could not provide adequate academic support and advisement . while education has made recent progress in automating its monitoring tools and developing risk - based criteria , it lacks a coordinated approach to guide its monitoring efforts . one former senior education official told us that site visits had declined because the program office has limited staff and few have the requisite skills to conduct financial site visits . education has not fully implemented its planned monitoring initiatives and lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds , increasing the potential for fraud , waste , or abuse . as we reported in 2004 and 2007 , education's ability to target technical assistance is also limited in that the annual performance reports used to obtain feedback about program improvements may discourage candor because the reports identify grantees and are used to make continued funding decisions . education has made progress in developing tools , such as an electronic monitoring system and risk - based criteria , to assess potential risks associated with title iii and v grants , but it lacks a comprehensive risk - based monitoring and technical assistance approach to target its efforts . such an approach would also ensure that more information is shared among grantees about common implementation challenges and successful projects to better leverage the considerable federal investment , and ensure that grantees have an opportunity to provide feedback on areas for program improvement . we reviewed title iii and v grants programs to determine ( 1 ) what are the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v , including the characteristics of students served , ( 2 ) what challenges do grantees face , and how have they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges , and ( 3 ) to what extent does the department of education ( education ) monitor the financial and programmatic performance of title iii and v grantees , and use this information to target its technical assistance .
