in 2013 , an estimated 19.8 million individuals in the united states aged 12 or older ( 7.5% of this population ) were current ( past month ) users of marijuana . while reported marijuana use is similar to that in 2012 , it has generally increased since 2007 when 5.8% of individuals aged 12 or older were current users of marijuana . this increase has been linked to factors such as rising marijuana production in mexico and increasing marijuana cultivation in the united states led by criminal networks including mexican drug trafficking organizations . the uptick in availability and use of marijuana in the united states is coupled with a general shift in public attitudes toward the substance . in 1969 , 12% of the surveyed population supported legalizing marijuana ; today , more than half ( 52% ) of surveyed adults feel that marijuana should be legalized . in addition , 60% indicate that the federal government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting marijuana use in those states that allow for its use . in the november 2014 elections , voters in the district of columbia , oregon , and alaska also passed recreational legalization initiatives . these moves have spurred a number of questions regarding their potential implications for related federal law enforcement activities and for the nation's drug policies on the whole . specifically , this commission was charged with examining issues such as ( a ) the extent of use of marihuana in the united states to include its various sources of users , number of arrests , number of convictions , amount of marihuana seized , type of user , nature of use ; ( b ) an evaluation of the efficacy of existing marihuana laws ; ( c ) a study of the pharmacology of marihuana and its immediate and long - term effects , both physiological and psychological ; ( d ) the relationship of marihuana use to aggressive behavior and crime ; ( e ) the relationship between marihuana and the use of other drugs ; and ( f ) the international control of marihuana . over the past few decades , some states have deviated from an across - the - board prohibition of marijuana . federal law enforcement has generally tailored its efforts to target criminal networks rather than individual criminals ; its stance regarding drug ( particularly marijuana ) offenders appears consistent with this position . in a follow - up memorandum to u.s . in an august 2013 memorandum , deputy attorney general cole stated that while marijuana remains an illegal substance under the controlled substances act , the department of justice would focus its resources on the "most significant threats in the most effective , consistent , and rational way. . the memo outlined eight enforcement priorities for the department of justice: preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors ; preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises , gangs , and cartels ; preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states ; preventing state - authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity ; preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana ; preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use ; preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands ; and preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property . these priorities are to guide u.s . without a clear understanding of ( 1 ) actual proceeds generated by the sale of illicit drugs in the united states , ( 2 ) the proportion of total proceeds attributable to the sale of marijuana , and ( 3 ) the proportion of marijuana sales controlled by criminal organizations and affiliated gangs , any estimates of how marijuana legalization might impact the drug trafficking organizations are purely speculative . in short , there is no definitive answer to this question , and arguments have been presented to support both the stance that marijuana legalization in the united states could drive violence higher ( because of increased competition for the scarce revenues that would be generated from an expected dwindling market of mexican - produced marijuana ) and the position that such legalization could help in reducing drug trafficking - related violence ( because the profit motive for entering and dominating the drug trade might be reduced ) . given the differences in marijuana policies of the federal government and those of alaska , colorado , oregon , washington , and the district of columbia , congress may choose to address state legalization initiatives in a number of ways , or not at all . there are a host of options available to policy makers should they choose to address state - level legalization of marijuana , including affirming federal marijuana policy , exercising oversight over federal law enforcement activities , or incentivizing state policies through the provision or denial of certain funds . policy makers may question whether federal law enforcement priorities have shifted in states that have altered their marijuana laws and regulations . policy makers may choose to evaluate whether certain drug task forces are sustainable in states that have established policies that are either inconsistent — such as in states that have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana possession — or are in direct conflict — including states that have legalized either medical or recreational marijuana — with federal drug policy . it is unclear whether or how doj is tracking activity in these states to ensure that these priorities are being emphasized .
