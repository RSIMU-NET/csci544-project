congress pays the u.s . postal service for franked mail through annual appropriations for the legislative branch . the franking privilege is regulated by federal law , house and senate rules , orders of the committee on house administration and senate rules and administration committee , and regulations of the senate select committee on ethics and the house commission on congressional mailing standards . senators are prohibited from sending mass mailings fewer than 60 days prior to any primary election in which they are a candidate , as well as 60 days prior to any general election , regardless of whether or not they are a candidate . however , analysis of monthly data on official mail costs indicates that , due to the structure of the fiscal year calendar , comparisons of election - year and non - election - year mailing data tend to overstate the effect of pre - election increases in mail costs , because it also captures the effect of a large spike in mail costs from december of the previous calendar year . reform efforts during the past 30 years have reduced overall franking expenditures in both election and non - election years . even - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 85% from $113.4 million in fy1988 to $16.9 million in fy2014 , while odd - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 90% from $89.5 million in fy1989 to $8.3 million in fy2015 . the senate has dramatically reduced its costs , from $43.6 million in fy1984 to $1.5 million in fy2015 . h.r . 1873 , the ending special mail privileges for congress act , would eliminate the traditional franking privilege of members of congressâthe use of the member's signature in lieu of prepayment for the mailing of letters related to official business . the bill , however , would continue to authorize the use of official funds for the purpose of member official communications with constituents and others , as "congressional mail. . it would also eliminate , without replacement , the franking privilege of survivors of members of congress . one piece of legislation was introduced in the 113th congress that would have altered the franking privilege . s. 3528 would have repealed the authorization providing franking privileges to former speakers of the house . currently , former speakers are authorized to use the frank for a period of five years after they leave congress . two bills introduced in the 111 th congressâ h.r . 2056 and h.r . 5151 âwould have altered the congressional franking privilege . 2788 âwere introduced in the 110 th congress that would have altered the congressional franking privilege . 2687 would have effectively prohibited representatives from mass mailing newsletters , questionnaires , or congratulatory notices . current law allows members to send mass mailings in various forms ( newsletters , questionnaires , press releases , notices ) on a variety of topics , including but not limited to the impact of laws and decisions , public and official actions taken by members of congress , proposed or pending legislation or governmental actions , the positions of the members of congress on legislation or other public issues , and other related matters of public concern or public service . previously , representative lahood introduced similar legislation ( h.r . 2788 would have required that each individual piece of franked mail contained in a mass mailing made by a member of the house contain a statement indicating the aggregate cost of producing and mailing the mass mailing .
