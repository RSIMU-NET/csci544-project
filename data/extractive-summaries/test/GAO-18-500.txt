this report examines ( 1 ) how prices compared for selected categories of consumer goods that are differentiated for men and women , and potential reasons for any significant price differences ; ( 2 ) what is known about the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in , or experience different levels of access to , markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender ; ( 3 ) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and taken steps to address any concerns about gender - related price differences ; and ( 4 ) state and local government efforts to address concerns about gender - related price differences . in addition , the extent to which consumers pay different prices for the same or similar goods can depend on other factors , such as consumers': willingness to purchase an item they believe may be priced higher for ability to compare prices and product characteristics and choose a product based on its characteristics rather than its price , choices about whether to purchase a more expensive version of the product ( e.g. , a branded item versus a cheaper store brand ) , choices about where to purchase the item ( i.e. , when different retailers sell the same item at different prices ) , and use of coupons or promotions . however , consumer protection laws do prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions . while the factors we controlled for likely proxy for various costs and consumer preferences , we could not fully observe all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders . women's versions of personal care products sold at a statistically significant higher average price than men's versions for 5 of the 10 personal care product categories we analyzed — using two different price measures and after controlling for observable factors that could affect price , such as brands , product size or quantity , promotional expenses ( see table 1 ) and other product - specific attributes ( e.g. , scent , special claims , form ) . though we found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences we identified , we do not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender - related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors . for example , some product differences such as scents may discourage one gender from buying products targeted to another gender . we reviewed studies that compared prices for men and women in four markets where the product or service is not differentiated by gender: mortgages , small business credit , auto purchases , and auto repairs . however , several of these studies have important limitations , such as using nonrepresentative data samples , and the results are not generalizable . after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors , three studies did not find statistically significant differences in interest rates between men and women for the same type of mortgage , while one study found that women paid higher mortgage rates for certain subprime loans . in addition , one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently on their loans than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics , suggesting that women as a group may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk . while these studies attempted to control for factors other than gender or sex that could affect borrowing costs , several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics . the authors found that female - only borrowers on average pay more for their mortgage loans because they generally have weaker credit characteristics , such as lower income , and also because a higher percentage of these mortgage loans are subprime . a study that analyzed data from the 1993 ssbf did not find evidence that businesses owned by women paid more for credit than firms owned by white men . in 2017 bcfp received approximately 320,200 consumer complaints . one category had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed , and two others showed no significant gender price differences . the product categories included underarm deodorants , body deodorants ( typically sold as a spray ) , disposable razors , nondisposable razors , razor blades , shaving creams , shaving gels , and three categories of fragrances . to examine the federal role in overseeing gender - related price differences , we reviewed relevant federal statutes and agency guidance , and interviewed officials from the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , bureau of consumer financial protection ( bcfp ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and the department of justice ( doj ) . bcfp and ftc monitor consumer complaints related to violations under the equal credit opportunity act , while hud and the department of justice ( doj ) investigate housing discrimination complaints under the fair housing act . 102 , no . “the cost of doing femininity: gendered disparities in pricing of personal care products and services,” gender issues , vol .
