congress might consider reforms to the nation's immigration system , and , thus , the detention of noncitizens ( aliens ) in the united states may be an issue . for example , as the department of homeland security ( dhs ) expands programs to locate removable aliens from jails throughout the country , dhs may need additional detention beds in areas of the united states where traditionally there has not been a need for detention space . the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination of whether they should be removed from the united states and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention ( i.e. , the aliens must be detained ) by dhs . aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained , paroled , or released on bond . the report also presents general policy issues surrounding detention of aliens , including concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory detention ; the justness of mandatory detention , especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation ; and the proper limits on the length of time in detention for aliens who have been ordered removed but cannot be returned to their home country . other proposed legislation , such as h.r . the bill would have allowed dhs to detain indefinitely , subject to six - month reviews , an alien under orders of removal who could not be removed if ( 1 ) there was a significant likelihood that the alien would be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future ; ( 2 ) the alien would have been removed but for the alien's refusal to cooperate with the dhs secretary's identification and removal efforts ; ( 3 ) the alien had a highly contagious disease that posed a public safety threat ; ( 4 ) release would have had serious adverse foreign policy consequences ; ( 5 ) release would have threatened national security ; ( 6 ) release would have threatened the safety of the community , and the alien had either been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies or other designated crimes or been convicted of one or more crimes of violence and due to a mental condition or personality disorder was likely to engage in future acts of violence ; or ( 7 ) release would have threatened the safety of the community , and the alien has been convicted of at least one aggravated felony . they argued that the supreme court in zadvydas v. davis ( 2001 ) , did not deny congress the authority to provide for extended periods of detention . the number of noncitizens in immigration detention and the funding for immigration detention has increased fairly steadily over the past decade .
