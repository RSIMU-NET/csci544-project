medicare consists of four parts — a through d. part a covers hospital services , skilled nursing facility services , home health visits , and hospice services . enrollment in part b is optional , however most beneficiaries with part a also enroll in part b . part d provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage through private plans . for example , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 as amended ) , made numerous changes to the medicare program that modify provider reimbursements , provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care , and enhance certain medicare benefits . certain medicare payments are exempt from sequestration and therefore not reduced . medicare's financial operations are accounted for through two trust funds maintained by the department of the treasury — the hospital insurance ( hi ) trust fund for part a and the supplementary medical insurance ( smi ) trust fund for parts b and d. for beneficiaries enrolled in medicare advantage ( part c ) , payments are made on their behalf in appropriate portions from the hi and smi trust funds . the hi and smi trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that provides annual reports to congress . because hi and smi have different funding mechanisms , a description of each fund's 2013 operations is presented separately below . additionally , unlike in prior years' projections , these growth rates assume that the scheduled physician payment reductions of about 21% in april 2015 will not go into effect . the 2014 trustees report estimates that the hi trust fund will become insolvent in 2030 , four years later than projected in last year's report ( see figure 4 ) . the improved projections are primarily due to lower than expected expenditures in 2013 , the base year used to project future expenditures , and reductions in assumptions of utilization of part a services . instead , the long - term financial soundness of the medicare program is generally determined using one or more of the following measures: a comparison of the program's income and its cost as a percentage of taxable payroll ( how much would need to be added to the payroll tax to keep hi solvent — this measure is only applicable to the hi trust fund ) ; a determination of the present value of the program's unfunded liabilities over a particular period ( the amount in today's dollars that would be needed to be in the trust fund for the program to remain financially sound for a specified period ) ; and / or a comparison of expected benefit costs with gdp , the most frequently used measure of the total output of the u.s. economy ( the amount spent on medicare compared to the size of the economy in general ) . hi is funded by current workers through a payroll tax , while smi is funded by premiums from current beneficiaries and federal general revenues . by law , the annual medicare trustees reports focus on the financial status of the medicare hi and smi trust funds . the medicare trustees estimate that , assuming personal and corporate income taxes in the future maintain their historical average level relative to the national economy , the portion of income taxes that will be needed to fund the general revenue portion of smi will grow from 13.8% in 2014 to 30.6% in 2080 ( see table 4 ) .
