increasingly , the federal government relies on networks and partnerships to achieve its goals , and many of these involve nonprofit organizations . therefore , our objectives in this report are to provide information on ( 1 ) the mechanisms through which federal dollars flow to nonprofit organizations ( which we define as those entities that are federally tax - exempt ) , and how federal involvement varies across them , and ( 2 ) what is known about federal dollars flowing through these mechanisms to nonprofit organizations in fiscal year 2006 ( the most recent year for which we could obtain data from all sources ) . to better understand how funds to nonprofit organizations are tracked and how mechanisms operate , we reviewed 19 federal programs selected to provide information on a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms and services across a variety of policy areas and sectors , and to include some of the more highly funded programs involving nonprofit organizations . to assess federal funding reaching nonprofit organizations through various mechanisms , we conducted a literature review of funding to nonprofit organizations , assessed the suitability of various potential data sources , and analyzed data from several sources . our data sources included the federal procurement data system — next generation ( fpds - ng ) , federal awards and assistance data system ( faads ) , several systems at the centers for medicare & medicaid services , the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) estimates of the revenue loss of tax expenditures , and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) collection of information on federal credit programs . the federal government uses a variety of funding mechanisms to achieve national priorities through partnerships with nonfederal parties such as nonprofit organizations . finally , some federal programs use loans and loan guarantees to encourage activities that indirectly result in increased revenues to nonprofit organizations . while the federal agency does not monitor the performance of individual nonprofit and other recipients receiving this grant funding , states are required to monitor the performance of nonprofit recipients . with fee - for - service programs such as medicare , states determine service provider eligibility , but individuals choose their providers . additionally , some tax expenditure programs , such as the low - income housing tax credit , leverage state or local governments to select or monitor nonprofit performance , or both . however , in developing the funding information outlined above , we found that nonprofit organizations are not reliably identified in either of these systems . furthermore , there is no consistent , governmentwide definition of “nonprofit.” guidance for registrants in the central contractor registration , which agencies may use to identify the nonprofit status of entities for federal assistance and contracts in faads , fpds - ng , and usaspending.gov , asks registrants simply to identify whether they are “for profit” , “non profit” , or “other not for profit.” similarly , hpms provides no guidance for recipients . contracts — about $10 billion was obligated in actions with nonprofit organizations , representing less than 3 percent of total contract obligations in 2006 . credit — available data from faads indicates that about $450 million in direct loans and $2.5 billion in loan guarantees were issued directly to nonprofit organizations in 2006 , though omb has raised concerns with how some of these data are reported . the significant extent and diversity of the federal government's partnering with the nonprofit sector should be better understood , but this opportunity is being missed , in part , because of the absence of complete and accurate data on federal funding reaching recipients of different types . it concurred that data limitations and reliability concerns contribute to an incomplete and unreliable picture of federal funding , which limits the reliability and completeness of reported funds . other indirect grants through states — for perspective on the extent to which states collect data on federal funding passed through to nonprofit organizations , we spoke to officials from the three states obtaining the most federal assistance funds in 2006 , based on the faads data from that year — california , new york , texas — as well as two states suggested by others as developing information systems to track those funds — michigan and maryland .
