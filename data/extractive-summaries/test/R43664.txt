the surge of central american children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and who lack proper immigration documents is raising complex and competing sets of humanitarian concerns and immigration control issues . adults and families from the same three countries — el salvador , guatemala , and honduras — have also been coming in increasing numbers over the same period . current law requires that unaccompanied alien children are treated differently than unauthorized adults or unauthorized families with children who come to the united states seeking asylum . this report focuses on unaccompanied alien children as asylum seekers . it further builds on a set of crs reports analyzing the issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children . to receive asylum in the united states , foreign nationals must demonstrate a well - founded fear that if returned home , they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics: race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . foreign nationals — specifically in this context adults and families with children — apprehended along the border or arriving at a u.s. port of entry who lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are placed in a procedure known as expedited removal ; however , if they express a fear of persecution , they receive a "credible fear" hearing with a uscis asylum officer and — if found credible — are referred to an eoir immigration judge for a hearing . the most notable and recent revisions to asylum policy that pertain to unaccompanied children were included in the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization act ( tvpra ) of 2008 . the asylum provisions of the tvpra were part of a larger set of provisions that revised the initial processing , temporary placement , and immigration relief options for unaccompanied children . as congress faces the challenges posed by an influx of unaccompanied alien children , whether to revise the law on how unaccompanied children are treated in terms of asylum and expedited removal is a key question .
