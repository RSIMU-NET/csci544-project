this report responds to your request and provides our ( 1 ) assessment of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to manage the fund's cash and ( 2 ) recommendations to dod which , if properly implemented , will provide additional management oversight of the fund's cash operations . while this report focuses on cash management problems , they are symptomatic of the persistent weaknesses in dod's and the fund's financial management operations . having systems and reports that provide timely and accurate information on the fund's cash balances for individual business areas and on collections and disbursements is integral to having effective controls over cash management . the fund's financial reports are untimely , incomplete , and inaccurate and , therefore , do not provide fund managers with the information they need to manage cash . specifically , we found that ( 1 ) the monthly financial reports do not contain cash balances for each individual fund business area , ( 2 ) collection and disbursement data are not timely since the data are reported approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the month in which the transaction took place , and ( 3 ) monthly financial reports do not fully disclose billions of dollars of adjustments made to accounts receivable and payable balances , which could mask the actual amount of future collections and disbursements . therefore , according to dod , it was necessary for the military services to continue to advance bill customers so that their cash portion of the fund would not go negative . in fiscal year 1993 , a system change request was made to automate the billing process . these problems could ( 1 ) result in an increase in the fund's cash requirement to cover the day - to - day fluctuations in the fund's cash balance and ( 2 ) impact major programmatic decisions , which may be driven largely by cash balance considerations . defense business operations fund: management issues challenge fund implementation ( gao / aimd - 95-79 , march 1 , 1995 ) .
