the u.s. commercial space launch industry , which the federal aviation administration ( faa ) reports had estimated revenues of $617 million in 2015 , has experienced considerable change since the enactment of the commercial space launch amendments act of 2004 ( “the act” ) . to allow the space tourism industry to develop , the act prohibited faa from regulating the safety of crew and “spaceflight participants” before 2012 , except in limited circumstances — a moratorium that was extended to october 1 , 2023 in the commercial space launch competitiveness act enacted in november 2015 . in addition , in recent years , faa has been licensing an increasing number of commercial space launches , including those for the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) commercial cargo program , which contracts with commercial launch companies to transport cargo to the international space station ( iss ) . this statement is primarily based on our august 2015 report on commercial space issues . for the 2015 report , we reviewed faa's guidance on its launch permit , licensing , and safety oversight activities ; interviewed faa officials , industry stakeholders , and experts who were selected on the basis of their knowledge of faa's oversight of the commercial space launch industry ; and visited spaceports where two 2014 launch mishaps occurred . we updated information for this statement in june 2016 primarily by reviewing faa information on the industry , faa's budget request , and contacting faa officials . see figure 2 . as we reported in our 2015 report , during the last decade , u.s. companies conducted fewer orbital commercial launches in total than companies in russia or europe , which are among the main foreign competitors . in 2015 , u.s. companies conducted more orbital launches than companies in russia , which conducted five , or europe , which conducted six . in our 2015 report , we asked faa officials , representatives from nine commercial space launch companies , and three experts to identify the challenges that faa faces — and is likely to face in the near future — to address significant developments in the commercial space launch industry over the last decade . the challenges for faa that they identified included: ( 1 ) determining whether and when to regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants and ( 2 ) handling an increased workload relating to licensing and permitting launches and launch sites . for example , virgin galactic's spaceshiptwo , xcor's aerospace's lynx , and blue origin's new shepard are new vehicles . we recommended that faa review its maximum probable loss methodology . in 2015 we found that faa's budget requests for its commercial space launch activities generally were based on the number of projected launches , but that in recent years the actual number of launches was much lower than faa's projections . according to faa officials , more detailed information was not provided in their budget submissions because the agency lacked certain workload metrics regarding its commercial space launch oversight activities . we also found that the office of commercial space transportation did not track the amount of time spent on the office's various activities . to provide congress with more information about the resources requested to address developments in the commercial space launch industry , we recommended that faa provide more detailed information in its budget submissions about its workload . faa has taken steps to implement our recommendation . in the 2017 budget submission , faa provided workload indices based on the number of authorizations which the agency uses to authorize companies to conduct one or more launches , the number of licenses and permits , the number of on - site inspections as part of licensing launch sites , and staffing levels since fiscal year 2006 .
