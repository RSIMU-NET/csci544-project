the negative perceptions of the united states , associated with u.s. foreign policy initiatives , have underscored the importance of the united states presenting a complete portrayal of the benefits that many countries in the world derive from u.s. foreign assistance efforts . congress has expressed concerns that the united states has frequently understated or not publicized information about its foreign assistance programs and , as a result , the generosity of the people of the united states has not been fully understood abroad . it ( 1 ) describes the policies , regulations , and guidelines that agencies have established to mark and publicize foreign assistance ; ( 2 ) describes how the department of state ( state ) , usaid , and other agencies mark and publicize foreign assistance ; and ( 3 ) identifies key challenges that agencies face in marking and publicizing foreign assistance . the dfa: has authority over all usaid and most state foreign assistance funding and programs , with continued participation in program planning , implementation , and oversight conducted by the various bureaus and offices within state and usaid , as part of the integrated interagency planning , coordination , and implementation mechanisms ; develops a coordinated u.s. government foreign assistance strategy , including multiyear country specific assistance strategies and annual country - specific assistance operational plans ; creates and directs consolidated policy , planning , budget , and implementation mechanisms and staff functions required to provide overarching leadership to foreign assistance ; and provides guidance to foreign assistance delivered through other agencies and entities of the u.s. government , including the mcc and the office of the u.s . most of the agencies we reviewed involved in foreign assistance activities have established some marking policies , regulations , and guidelines . usaid has established the most detailed policies , regulations , and guidelines for marking and publicizing its assistance . however , usda , dod , hhs , treasury , and mcc efforts in this area have been more limited . hhs has established its own policies related to marking and publicizing hhs activities . to increase awareness of u.s. assistance abroad , key agencies that we reviewed used various methods to mark and to publicize some of their activities and exercised flexibility in deciding when it was appropriate to do so . these agencies used different methods of marking , or visibly acknowledging , their assistance , including applying graphic identities or logos on such things as publications and project signage . in addition , agencies generally used embassy public affairs offices for publicizing , or disseminating information about , the source of their assistance and , in some cases , augmented these efforts with their own publicity methods . first , little reliable work has been done to assess the impact of u.s. assistance on foreign citizens' awareness of that assistance . second , although the newly appointed dfa has begun to develop governmentwide guidance for marking and publicizing all u.s. foreign assistance , it is unclear to what extent this policy will be implemented by agencies whose foreign assistance programs are not under state's direct authority . usaid also conducts some research . to enhance u.s. marking and publicity efforts , and to improve the information used to measure the impact of u.s. marking and publicizing programs , we recommend that the secretary of state , in consultation with other u.s. executive agencies , develop a strategy , which appropriately utilizes techniques such as surveys and focus groups , to better assess the impact of u.s. marking and publicity programs and activities on public awareness .
