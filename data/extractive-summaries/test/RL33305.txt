despite its name , the crude oil windfall profit tax was not a tax on profits . it was an excisetax - - or more accurately , a system of excise taxes - - on domestically produced oil effective march1 , 1980 . notes: tier i oil is oil that was lower and upper tier oil under epca75 , and sadlerochit oil fromalaska's north slope ; tier ii and tier iii oil was uncontrolled oil under epca75 ; the 1981 ertalegislation changed the rate structure as follows: ( 1 ) the tax rate on new oil was reduced gradually,but further reductions were frozen in 1984 so that the rate remained fixed at 22.5% until 1988 ; ( 2 ) stripper oil produced by independents was made tax - exempt ; ( 2 ) royalty owners received a taxcredit followed by an exemption for limited amounts of oil production . if the secretary of the treasuryreported that , on a given month beginning january 1988 , cumulative net revenues would exceed thepre - established target of $227.3 billion , then the phaseout of the tax would begin on the monthfollowing the attainment of the target . cumulative net revenues , which totaled about $43 billion between 1980 and 1987 , fell farshort of the $227.3 billion target . finally , while the tax was called a "profit" tax , it was not really a profit tax but rather aspecial type of excise tax - - a selective excise tax on oil producers . the base prices had no precise or even approximaterelationship to the costs of oil production . this difference between an excise tax and a true excessprofit tax is crucial because , as will be demonstrated , the two taxes have very different economiceffects , particularly on energy prices and oil imports . the wpt resulted from a compromise between the carter administration , which wanted todecontrol oil prices , and the congress , which generally did not ; without the tax , many doubted thatthe congress would have supported oil price decontrol . the congress believed that the projected huge redistribution ofincome from energy consumers to energy producers would not be fair . the major economic issues concerning the wpt and its effects were: revenues , increaseddependence upon foreign oil , economic efficiency , and the tax's administrative and complianceburden . some bills would allocate thereceipts to offset the cost of supplemental spending bills targeted to aid victims ofhurricanes katrina and rita . the algebraic formula for the wpt liability is as follows: t t = ï [p t m - p t b ( 1+ ï t - 2 ) ] ( 1- s ) ( 1- c ) where t t = the wpt in $ / barrel , in time t ( e.g. , in the 1st quarter of any year ) , ï = the wpt tax rate in percent ( see table 2 in the text ) , p t m = the market ( removal ) price of domestic crude oil at the wellhead at time t , p t b = the base price corresponding to the type of oil produced , as specified by law ( see table 2 ) ï = rate of inflation , as measured by the gnp deflator , so that ï t - 2 is the gnp deflatorlagged two quarters , ( 61 ) s = the rate of state severance tax , if any c = the rate of federal corporate income ta .
