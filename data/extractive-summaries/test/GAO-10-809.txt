congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) to help stimulate the united states economy by providing an estimated $862 billion over 10 years through a variety of programs . federal agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) were provided funding under the recovery act to audit the act's programs and projects , including grant and contract awards . in response , we determined ( 1 ) the extent of recovery act funding obligated by federal agencies on contracts , and the extent to which these contracts were awarded noncompetitively , ( 2 ) the reasons selected federal agencies awarded noncompetitive recovery act contract actions , ( 3 ) the extent of oversight of recovery act contracting at selected federal agencies , and ( 4 ) state officials' level of insight into and oversight of the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts within selected states . since many of the programs and the processes and procedures used to implement them existed before the recovery act funds were provided , much of the focus of the state - level oversight efforts has been on the new aspects of the recovery act , such as the new recipient reporting requirements and state fiscal stabilization funds . more than two - thirds of the $26 billion that had been obligated on federal contracts through may 2010 was obligated on contracts that were already in place before the recovery act . the new contracts that were not competed consisted of contracts awarded under the sba's 8 ( a ) program , contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures , and other contracts that were awarded under authorized exceptions to competition , such as only one source was available or the requirement was urgently needed . whether an existing contract had been competed originally did not influence decisions about which of these contracts to use since the level of competition had already been established prior to the availability of recovery act funds . contracting under the 8 ( a ) program was not a focus for four of the five igs , who did not use the 8 ( a ) status of a business as a factor in their selection of contracts for review , and did not review 8 ( a ) compliance issues , such as 8 ( a ) eligibility or limits on the amount of work that can be subcontracted . these states rely on their pre - recovery act contracting policies and procedures , which generally require competition . state - level information on the type and amount of data routinely collected on noncompetitive recovery act contracts varied in the five states we visited â€” california , colorado , florida , new york , and texas . representatives of the five states' audit organizations said that their organizations could provide additional oversight of the states' use of recovery act contracting funds through the internal control work performed as part of the states' single audits , and some explained that this could also be done through separate programmatic reviews if contracting is identified as an area of risk . in fact , our report points out that omb's recovery act guidance specifically lists providing opportunities for small businesses to the maximum extent practicable and supporting disadvantaged businesses as goals for agencies using recovery act funds . most of the contract dollars are being spent in this area . for our second and third objectives , we used fpds - ng data to select five agencies for more extensive review: department of defense ( dod ) department of energy ( doe ) department of health and human services ( hhs ) national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) small business administration ( sba ) these agencies were identified on the basis of the volume , dollar value , and percentage of noncompetitive contract actions on which they obligated recovery act funds , according to data drawn from fpds - ng on february 19 , 2010 .
