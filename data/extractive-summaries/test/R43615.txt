social security's minimum benefit provision , the special minimum primary insurance amount ( pia ) , is an alternative benefit formula that increases benefits paid to workers who had low earnings for many years and to their dependents and survivors . beneficiaries receive the higher of the two amounts . in 2017 , about 39,347 ( or about 0.6% ) of the 62 million social security recipients qualified for the minimum benefit . the social security administration projects that the provision will have no effect on people turning 62 years old in 2019 or later . the estimates of the impact the special minimum pia has on monthly benefits show that in june 2013 , the special minimum pia increased average benefits of those affected by the provision by an average of $46 per month ( see table 2 ) . dually entitled beneficiaries get benefits based on their own work record or their spouse's , whichever is larger ; thus , even though the special minimum pia might increase the benefit based on the beneficiary's own work record , if their spousal benefit is even higher , they receive the spousal benefit and the special minimum pia does not affect their monthly benefit amount . although there have been numerous proposals for minimum benefits , most fall into three categories: 1. a benefit based on the number of years of work , similar to the current special minimum pia , 2. an enhancement of benefits via a percentage increase in the regular benefit , or 3. an increase to benefits by a fixed - dollar amount . instead of implementing a minimum benefit , low - wage workers could be assisted through other approaches , including changes to the standard benefit formula , other changes to the social security benefit rules , or a separate program . such a change could be designed to redistribute benefits to people with lower lifetime earnings in a way similar to the way that a standard , wage - indexed minimum benefit would . a new program could also be established . benefit and eligibility standards would be less strict than for ssi ; for example , asset tests would be more generous .
