under its resource conservation challenge ( rcc ) , epa operates several national and regional programs to support public and private sector efforts to increase recycling and to help epa reach its goal of recycling 35 percent of national municipal solid waste by 2008 . state governments also play a role in recycling efforts . you asked us to ( 1 ) identify the key practices that selected u.s. cities are using to increase recycling , ( 2 ) describe what epa and commerce are doing to encourage recycling nationwide , and ( 3 ) identify federal policy options that stakeholders with recycling expertise believe could help increase recycling . several states have laws to encourage recycling . the three practices they cited most frequently were making recycling convenient and easy for their residents , offering financial incentives for recycling , and conducting public education and outreach . in addition to these three key practices , recycling coordinators and the recycling literature identified other ways to increase recycling , such as targeting a wide range of materials for recycling , extending recycling programs to the commercial sector , mandating that residents recycle , and targeting multiunit dwellings for recycling . several epa programs are designed to increase recycling and help the agency achieve its 2008 national municipal solid waste recycling goal ; however , the programs lack performance measures and comprehensive performance data to help determine their impact . in 1994 , epa launched wastewise , one of the agency's primary recycling programs . while commerce is taking some actions to stimulate international markets for recycled materials , the agency is not taking any actions to stimulate domestic markets and , therefore , is not fully meeting its responsibilities under rcra subtitle e. for example , commerce is not identifying the geographical location of existing or potential markets for recycled materials or the economic and technical barriers to the use of recycled materials in the united states . nonetheless , according to commerce officials , the agency supports increased international trade in recycled and recyclable materials as part of its general trade promotion responsibilities . recycling stakeholders we interviewed identified various federal policy options that they believe could help municipalities increase their recycling rates . the three policy options cited most frequently as top priorities were to establish a nationwide campaign to educate the public about recycling , enact a federal bottle bill in which beverage containers may be returned for money , and require producers to establish a system that consumers can use to recycle their products . other policy options for helping municipalities to increase recycling include facilitating the sharing of recycling best practices , expanding epa research on the economic and environmental benefits of recycling , providing additional grant money for recycling projects , reducing or removing subsidies to industries that extract virgin materials , and providing subsidies to the recycling industry . the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) identify the key practices that selected u.s. cities are using to increase recycling , ( 2 ) describe what the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the department of commerce ( commerce ) are doing to encourage recycling nationwide , and ( 3 ) identify federal policy options that stakeholders with recycling expertise believe could help increase recycling . during the structured interviews with the recycling coordinators from the 11 cities , we asked for detailed information about the characteristics of their cities' residential and commercial recycling programs , including the planning processes used to design their recycling program , legal requirements for their recycling programs , and economic and financial incentives their residents and businesses have to recycle .
