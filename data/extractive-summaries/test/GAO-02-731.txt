the medicare program is the nation's largest health insurer with almost 40 million beneficiaries and outlays of over $219 billion annually . hcfac , which is administered by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and the department of justice ( doj ) , established a national framework to coordinate federal , state , and local law enforcement efforts to detect , prevent , and prosecute health care fraud and abuse in the public and private sectors . hipaa requires hhs and doj to issue a joint annual report no later than january 1 of each year to the congress for the preceding fiscal year on ( 1 ) amounts deposited to the federal hospital insurance trust fund pursuant to hipaa and the source of the amounts and ( 2 ) amounts appropriated from the trust fund for the hcfac program and the justification for the expenditure of such amounts . under the joint direction of the attorney general and the secretary of hhs ( acting through the hhs / oig ) , the hcfac program goals are as follows: coordinate federal , state , and local law enforcement efforts to control fraud and abuse associated with health plans ; conduct investigations , audits , and other studies of delivery and payment for health care for the united states ; facilitate the enforcement of the civil , criminal , and administrative statutes applicable to health care ; provide guidance to the health care industry , including the issuance of advisory opinions , safe harbor notices , and special fraud alerts ; and establish a national database of adverse actions against health care providers . the objectives of our review were to identify and assess the propriety of amounts for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 reported as ( 1 ) deposits to the trust fund , ( 2 ) appropriations from the trust fund for hcfac activities , ( 3 ) expenditures at doj for hcfac activities , ( 4 ) expenditures at hhs for hcfac activities , ( 5 ) expenditures for non - medicare anti â€“ fraud and abuse activities , and ( 6 ) savings to the trust fund . in testing at doj , we identified some errors in the recording of hcfac collections that resulted in an estimated overstatement of $169,765 to the trust fund in fiscal year 2001 . doj officials told us that there was a programming mistake in generating the criminal fines report that resulted in these errors . we found that over $480,000 in interest penalties not related to hcfac activities were miscoded and inadvertently charged to the hcfac appropriation .
