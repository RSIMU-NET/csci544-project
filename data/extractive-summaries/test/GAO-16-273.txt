the general services administration ( gsa ) annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars making major and minor repairs and alterations to the more than 1,500 federally owned buildings that it holds . some of this work is initiated by gsa and some at the request of tenant agencies . in general , unforeseen site conditions are different from what was expected or what may have been in a project's plans or specifications . in 2001 , the gsa inspector general's office , which reviewed 45 repair and alteration projects , reported that unforeseen site conditions in 10 projects completed in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 accounted for about $22 million , or about 43 percent , of cost growth on these projects . contract change orders and modifications are also recorded in gsa's electronic project management system . officials from the u.s . although industry stakeholders and gsa told us unforeseen site conditions are common in repair and alteration projects , data on the overall extent and impacts of unforeseen site conditions are limited . on one of the 11 projects — a prospectus project to , among other things , modernize the heating , ventilation , and air - conditioning system at the new executive office building in washington , d.c. — the cost for addressing unforeseen site conditions was approximately 6 percent of the original construction contract award . all of the reported costs for remediating unforeseen site conditions on the projects we reviewed were below the typical 10 percent construction contingency that gsa attaches to repair and alteration projects . three of the 11 projects that encountered unforeseen site conditions experienced schedule delays . these ranged from 23 to 105 days due to the unforeseen site condition . gsa officials told us that contract change orders and modifications are used to document unforeseen site conditions . five projects did not have pmps — three were rwa projects associated with larger projects and no separate pmp was prepared for the rwa project , and for two projects , gsa officials were not sure if a pmp was prepared and were unable to provide documentation of a pmp . although gsa has risk assessment methods that were generally used on the projects we reviewed , these methods had inconsistent results in terms of identifying unforeseen site conditions that were later experienced . the risks associated with unforeseen site conditions that gsa most often identified on the projects we reviewed included: access issues ( 7 projects ) : limiting access to areas may limit building information ( for example , not being able to conduct site testing and evaluation in an occupied space may lead to an unforeseen site condition ) ; presence of hazardous materials ( 9 projects ) ; lack of accurate building drawings ( 4 projects ) ; and other risks ( 11 projects ) , included risks that did not fall into other categories , including risks from procurement and acquisition methods . in particular , gsa can better analyze the information it has available , like contract change orders and modifications , an approach that would allow a more comprehensive identification of types of project risks , the role these risks play in repair and alteration projects , and the impacts these risks have on project costs , schedules , or scope of work . to improve risk assessments for repair and alteration projects , we recommend that the administrator of gsa develop and implement a plan to periodically analyze information gsa already collects , for example , based on a representative sample of repair and alterations projects , in order to: identify the specific impacts unforeseen conditions have had on project costs , schedules , and scope of work ; analyze the causes of these conditions for those projects that experienced unforeseen site conditions ; and identify actions that will be taken to address the potential causes of unforeseen site conditions . the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) identify information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions during selected repair and alteration projects in federally owned buildings held by the general services administration ( gsa ) and to ( 2 ) determine how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions . finally , we contacted 19 organizations and individuals ( referred to in this report as industry stakeholders ) with knowledge of or experience in the construction industry ( see table 2 ) .
