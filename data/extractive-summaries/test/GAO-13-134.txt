gao has designated department of defense ( dod ) support infrastructure as a high - risk area , and identified installation support as one key support infrastructure category where opportunities existed for savings . for this report , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) dod developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and has tracked the costs , estimated savings , and efficiencies from joint basing ; ( 2 ) joint base common standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for installation support services at the joint bases ; and ( 3 ) the joint bases or dod have a process in place to consistently identify and address any implementation challenges to facilitate achievement of joint basing goals . we analyzed osd's processes for reviewing and changing the standards by reviewing osd guidance , and interviewed or obtained written answers to our questions from osd and joint base officials about how they addressed reported problems with the standards . ensuring top leadership drives the transformation . in addition to not having an implementation plan , dod does not yet have a fully developed method for accurately gathering information on costs , estimated savings , and efficiencies achieved specifically as a consequence of joint basing , and as a result it does not have an estimate of the extent to which joint basing has realized actual cost savings . in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 the joint bases reported meeting the common standards more than 70 percent of the time . however , the lack of clarity in some standards , the fact that unclear standards are not always reviewed and changed in a timely manner , and the fact that the data collection and reporting on the standards in some cases adhere to individual service standards rather than the common standard hinders the effectiveness of the standards as a common framework for managing installation support services . this includes such areas as telephone services and video teleconference . because some of the standards are not clear and are not reviewed and changed in a timely fashion and in some cases the joint bases use service - specific data and standards rather than the joint standard , the common standards do not provide osd and the joint bases with a common tool to ensure that the joint bases are interpreting and reporting on the standards consistently . these include a multi - level management structure for the joint bases , annual review meetings , performance reporting , newsletters , and informal communications , as follows . informal communications . these challenges cover a wide range of issues , from differing expectations among the military services about how particular base support services should be provided to the incompatibility of information technology systems . without such guidance and a mechanism to routinely share lessons learned across the joint bases , opportunities will be missed to work together to resolve common challenges and reduce duplication of effort , and the potential that joint bases may be implementing policies inconsistently will increase . it also states that for an entity to run and control its operations , the entity must have relevant , reliable , and timely communications relating to internal events , and that information is needed throughout the agency to without a means of identifying common achieve all of its objectives.challenges and sharing best practices and lessons learned in order to identify common solutions , dod is likely to miss opportunities to efficiently resolve joint base challenges using common methods . to enable dod to achieve cost savings and efficiencies and to track its progress toward achieving these goals , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the deputy under secretary of defense ( installations and environment ) to take the following two actions: develop and implement a plan that provides measurable goals linked to achieving savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and provide guidance to the joint bases that directs them to identify opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies . lastly , dod stated that they believed our evidence was based on an anecdotal assessment . gao - 12-513t . military base realignments and closures: dod faces challenges in implementing recommendations on time and is not consistently updating savings estimates . gao - 08-20 . gao / nsiad - 90-42 .
