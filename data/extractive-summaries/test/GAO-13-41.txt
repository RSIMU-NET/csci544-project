this report addresses usps's use of contract postal units ( cpus ) — independent retailers that , under contract with usps , provide customers with a broad range of the same products and services as post offices at the same prices , but at a potentially lower cost to usps . usps revenue from cpus and compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , and 3. challenges usps might face if it increases its use of cpus . we analyzed data from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 on cpu locations , dates of cpu closures , and cpu revenues and usps compensation to cpus . they provide most of the same products and services as post offices ( see fig . in addition , all cpus are contractually prohibited from selling services , including private mailboxes and others , that are competitive with usps's products , and all cpu contracts specify usps's rights to inspect the cpu at any time during operating hours . cpus are located in a variety of locations , both urban and rural , and range from very close to far from post offices , demonstrating how usps uses cpus to provide customers with alternatives located near crowded post offices — which are often found in urban areas — and to provide service where post offices are not conveniently located or may not be cost effective for usps , often in rural areas . in recent years , usps has intentionally shifted its means of compensating cpus from fixed - price contracts — in which compensation to cpus is a fixed amount regardless of sales — to performance - based contracts — under which compensation to cpus is a percentage of the cpu's postal sales — resulting in potentially greater revenue and less financial exposure to usps . the decline in cpu revenues is part because of the decrease in the number of cpus , as average cpu revenues decreased only 2 percent during this time . on average , usps's revenue from individual cpus averaged about $160,000 in revenue in fiscal year 2011 , but a substantial number ( 41 percent ) generated less than $50,000 . according to usps officials , the increase in compensation from fiscal years 2007 and 2008 was because of larger numbers of performance - based contracts , fewer public service contracts , which are generally less expensive , individual cpus' petitions for increased compensation because of increased cost of doing business , and economic conditions . the subsequent decline in usps compensation to cpus from fiscal years 2008 to 2011 was because of declining numbers of cpus during the time . as we described previously , in fiscal year 2011 , usps earned a total of $610.5 million in revenues from cpus and , in return , compensated cpus a total of $79.9 million , allowing usps to retain $530.6 million in cpu revenues . usps's target for individual cpus is to retain , after compensation , $0.80 for every dollar in revenues . at the same time , pending legislation in the senate would require usps to consider opening cpus as replacements for post offices that it closes.pared down its plans to close post offices by instead reducing their hours , to the extent that usps closes post offices in the future , this requirement may put more pressure on usps to open more cpus . usps may face limited private interest in opening cpus in certain areas . as a result , district staff are not always able to open as many new cpus as they would like . limited staff resources in usps districts . some usps district retail managers we spoke with told us that although there are unmet needs for cpus in their districts , compared to prior years , they now have fewer staff and less time to seek out opportunities for new cpus . we continue to believe , as we stated in november 2011 , that it is important that such a strategy discuss how usps plans to increase its use of retail alternatives — including cpus — while considering significant changes to its network of post offices and the means through which it provides access to usps's customers . for example , by considering factors , such as the distance of cpus to existing post offices , cpu hours and days of service , and usps's costs of compensating cpus , usps could better inform its retail strategy in order to make better strategic use of cpus in its future retail network , which will likely include reduced hours at thousands of post offices . to determine usps revenue from cpus and usps's compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , we analyzed data from cput .
