specifically , you asked us to evaluate ( 1 ) why women's benefits are lower than men's under the current social security system , ( 2 ) the possible differential effects on women of the new privatization reform proposals , and ( 3 ) what can be done to minimize the possibly negative effect on women of certain elements of the social security reform proposals . to evaluate these issues , we reviewed the literature on women's labor force participation and earnings , spoke with social security and insurance industry analysts , analyzed data on individual annuity benefits for men and women , and conducted an econometric analysis to estimate the relative levels of risk aversion of men and women . social security is a retirement income program whose benefits are based , in part , on an individual's earnings . by investing in stocks or other assets , workers could increase their retirement savings and potentially increase their retirement benefits . even if earnings for men and women and their labor force participation behavior were equalized starting today , women would continue to have lower benefits than men until the 2030s because earnings are averaged over 35 years ; it would take that long for benefits to be equalized . neither the difference between men's and women's labor force participation rates nor the gap in their earnings is expected to disappear in the foreseeable future . since retirement income benefits are based on both amount of earnings and number of years in the labor force , the gap will continue to produce lower benefits , on average , for women than for men . although proponents argue that privatization could allow for higher retirement benefits for both men and women , a too - conservative investment strategy could leave women with lower final account balances than men , even if both make the same contributions to their accounts . by investing less in these riskier assets , women benefit less from the potentially greater rates of return that , in the long run , stocks could generate . most married women with little work history of their own currently receive a social security benefit as a dependent , based on their husband's earnings . that is , insurance companies take into account women's longer life expectancy and either provide a lower monthly benefit to women or charge women more for the same level of benefits given to men.insurance companies also pay lower benefits for a joint and survivor annuity that covers both husband and wife than for a single life annuity that covers only the worker during his or her lifetime , again because the total time in which the benefits are expected to be paid is longer . the effect of individual changes in the reform proposals could be relatively minor . under several of the reform proposals that create mandatory savings accounts , divorced spouses and divorced survivors are not acknowledged as having any claim at all on the mandatory savings accumulated by their former spouse during the period of their marriage . nevertheless , investor education that covers general investment principles and financial planning advice might help both men and women to better manage their investments . the monthly benefits from these annuities would be lower than under a full annuitization plan , since they would not be using the entire account balance , but dependent spouses would still benefit from the protection of having some portion of their retirement income in the form of a joint and survivor annuity .
