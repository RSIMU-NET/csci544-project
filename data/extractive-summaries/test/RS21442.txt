the freedomcar initiative replaced a related clinton administration initiative , the partnership for a new generation of vehicles ( pngv ) , announced in 1993 . while both initiatives aimed to increase fuel efficiency of the automotive fleet , freedomcar extended the time frame by another 10 to 15 years and focused research on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ; pngv focused mainly on diesel - fueled hybrid vehicles . the initiative's goals are to develop hydrogen fuel cell power systems that are durable , and deliver higher efficiency at lower cost than today's systems ; transportation fuel cell systems that deliver greater efficiency and lower cost , and meet or exceed emissions standards ; hydrogen refueling systems that are highly efficient and deliver fuel at the market price of gasoline ; and on - board hydrogen storage systems with improved energy density and cost over existing systems . these issues include the proper role of the government in r&d , as well as the proper level of funding , and concerns over energy efficiency and fuel consumption .
