the objectives of federal commodity programs are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks of short term market price instability and longer - term capacity adjustments to the federal government . however , they argue that ( 1 ) current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade , ( 2 ) the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of production and make the united states less competitive in global markets , and ( 3 ) the benefits are concentrated among a comparatively small number of commodities produced on a small number of large farms . omnibus farm legislation often contains policy guidance and resources aimed at achieving these objectives . u.s. agricultural trade is influenced by a number of factors , especially global income and population growth . while many of these factors are beyond the scope of congressional action , agricultural trade policy and commercial export promotion programs typically have been dealt with in the trade title of the omnibus farm bill . competition from agricultural imports raises concerns among some producers and policymakers , but farm bill trade titles generally have not addressed import issues . agriculture is generally viewed as an inherently risky enterprise . the federal government has a long history of providing credit assistance to farmers . thus , many interests in production agriculture continue to see some need for federal intervention in agricultural credit markets . this likely will be one of the major debates in the 2007 farm bill . when agricultural production and related businesses dominated rural economies , federal policies that strengthened and improved agriculture also tended to strengthen and improve the well - being of most of america's small communities and rural residents . agriculture remains the primary policy framework for congress's consideration of rural issues , and questions have been raised about whether current rural policies and programs are helping to create new economic capacity in rural america that will generate future competitive advantages . omnibus farm bills have become the legislative vehicle for reauthorizing expiring authorities and appropriations , especially for food stamps and several smaller domestic food programs ; most recently , the 2002 farm bill reauthorized expiring nutrition program authorities and appropriations authorizations through fy2007 . they include: the food stamp program in the 50 states , the district of columbia , guam , and the virgin islands ; programs operating in lieu of the regular food stamp program — nutrition assistance block grants for puerto rico , american samoa , and the northern mariana islands , along with the food distribution program on indian reservations ( fdpir ) ; the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) ; the commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) ; and community food projects . might be compensated . the idea of federal support for developing markets for these traditionally non - market services has generated broad interest , and may be discussed as a possible forestry program in the upcoming farm bill . appendix a . titles and subtitles of the 2002 farm bill ( farm security and rural investment act of 2002 , p.l . 107-171 ) appendix b .
