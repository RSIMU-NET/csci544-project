completing cleanup at the department of energy's ( doe ) three former uranium enrichment sites will cost billions of dollars and span decades . to examine what em has spent on cleanup at the three gdp sites , and the extent to which em's cost estimates for completing gdp cleanup are reliable , we reviewed historical funding and cleanup expenditure data for all three sites for fiscal years 1994 through 2018 and analyzed em documentation supporting cost estimates for each of the three gdps . in addition , since 2007 , doe has stated in its triennial reports to congress that its intent is to manage the gdps in an integrated manner . as a result , they are not useful as plans for decision - making on the three gdps in an integrated manner . by taking steps to manage the three gdps as an integrated program and following relevant program management leading practices ( developing a program management plan ; an integrated master schedule ; and a reliable , integrated , comprehensive life - cycle cost estimate ) , em would have more reasonable assurance that it is taking every opportunity to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its management activities . moreover , em's cost estimates for completing cleanup at the three gdps are not reliable because they do not fully or substantially meet all of the characteristics of a high - quality , reliable cost estimate as described in our cost estimating guide . until em ensures the site - specific life - cycle cost estimates for the cleanup of each of the gdps fully incorporate best practices for cost estimation , em , doe , regulators , and congress will not have the information needed to understand the level of resources required to achieve cleanup of the gdps . these limitations reduce the quality of the information congress receives for making decisions about allocating resources to the d&d fund at the same time that congress will have to address a continued need for resources for gdp cleanup given the fund is estimated to be exhausted by 2020 . the latest triennial report , issued in may 2019 , is based on financial information as of september 2016 and on cost estimates prepared in 2013 ( oak ridge ) and 2014 ( portsmouth and paducah ) . given that doe estimates the d&d fund will be exhausted in 2020 , there is an urgency for doe to communicate current and accurate information on the fund on a timely basis to congress . by regularly reporting on the status of the d&d fund and cleanup efforts at the three gdps with current information that contains details on challenges in reaching agreement with regulators and a clear scope of work , doe will be able to provide better information for congressional decision - making on the sufficiency of the fund .  ( recommendation 5 ) . specifically , of our five recommendations , doe concurred with four and partially concurred with one . as such , we continue to believe it is important that doe include oak ridge in implementing this recommendation . our report examined: ( 1 ) the extent to which the department of energy's ( doe ) office of environmental management ( em ) has managed cleanup of the three gaseous diffusion plants ( gdp ) compared with relevant program management leading practices and the status of the cleanup effort ; ( 2 ) what em has spent on cleanup at the three gdps and the extent to which em's cost estimates for completing gdp cleanup are reliable ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the decontamination and decommissioning ( d&d ) fund is sufficient to cover em's estimated cleanup costs of the gdps and challenges , if any , that could affect the sufficiency of the d&d fund .
