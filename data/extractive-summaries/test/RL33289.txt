social security plays an important role in reducing poverty , not only among the aged but among children as well . children may be eligible for social security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies , becomes disabled , or retires . in addition to receiving social security benefits in their own right , children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members who receive benefits . the estimates presented in this report are based on a crs analysis of u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data in april 2013 . social security benefits paid on behalf of children exceed federal dollars spent on cash welfare to families with children under the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program . in fy2013 , combined federal and state tanf expenditures , in the form of cash aid to families , amounted to an estimated $8.7 billion , of which approximately $4.3 billion ( 49% ) was from federal funds . in order to address questions relating to the income and poverty status of families in which children live , and the impact of social security benefits on income and poverty status of families with children , other data sources must be used . crs analysis of sipp data for april 2013 indicates that among an estimated 73.0 million children under age 18 , an estimated 8.5 million ( 11.6% ) lived in families in which one or more family members received social security — over two and one - half times the number of children estimated to receive social security benefits based on the administrative data discussed above from four months earlier ( 3.3 million in december 2012 ) . among the estimated 8.5 million children living in families that received social security in april 2013 based on sipp data , an estimated 3.2 million ( 37% ) were in families in which social security was reported as having been received on behalf of at least one of the children in the family — a number quite close to the 3.3 million child recipients reported by administrative data , four months earlier . the remaining 3.4 million children ( 40% ) lived in families where social security was received by someone other than a child or the children's parent ( s ) or guardian ( s ) ; in such cases social security benefits may have been received by an extended family member ( e.g. , grandparent , aunt or uncle , cousin , niece or nephew ) or an older adult sibling . an additional 1.893 million children lived with a parent or guardian who reported receiving social security on the sipp in april 2013 , but who did not indicate that benefits were received on behalf of a child . for the former group , social security's effect on child poverty is more directly related to social security policy , whereas for the latter group , social security's effect on child poverty is incidental , being more directly related to children's incidental family living arrangements .
