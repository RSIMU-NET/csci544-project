the three largest federal disability programs providing cash assistance , which are administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , in 2001 collectively provided $89.7 billion in cash benefits to approximately 10.2 million adults with a physical or mental condition that reduced their earning capacity . if federal disability programs do not update scientific and labor market information used in assessing program eligibility , they risk overestimating the limiting nature of some disabilities while underestimating others . ssa administers both the disability insurance ( di ) program and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program . ssa's slow progress in completing the updates could undermine the purpose of incorporating medical advances into its medical criteria . this entire review process can take up to 3 years . the disability criteria used by di , ssi , and va programs for determining who is disabled have not incorporated labor market changes . incorporating scientific advances and labor market changes into di , ssi , and va programs can occur within the existing program design and at a more fundamental level . within the context of the programs' existing statutory and regulatory design , agencies will need to continue updating the criteria they use to determine which applicants have physical and mental conditions that limit their ability to work . in addition to continuing their medical updates , ssa and va need to vigorously expand their efforts to more closely examine labor market changes . more fundamentally , ssa and va could consider the impact that scientific advances and labor market changes have on the programs' basic orientation . our recommendation reflects the need for more information on the implications of integrating the effects of treatment and assistance into the disability determination process , including the process to determine ( 1 ) the impact of physical and mental conditions on earnings and ( 2 ) the appropriate type and timing of benefits — such as cash , medical , and vocational assistance — to minimize the reduction of earnings associated with the disabilities .
