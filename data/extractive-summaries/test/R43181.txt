the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 and p.l . 111-152 ) contains several provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly among small businesses . the provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are ( 1 ) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance , ( 2 ) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms , and ( 3 ) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs . on february 10 , 2014 , the department of the treasury issued a final regulation that would delay implementation of the employer penalty for firms with fewer than 100 full - time equivalent ( fte ) employees ( i.e. , firms with 50 fte employees to 99 fte employees ) from 2015 to 2016 . this report analyzes several aca provisions that are most relevant to small business . lastly , this report presents several approaches that could address some criticisms of the aca's employer penalty and reduce its effects on small businesses . further , administrative costs per employee are larger for small firms ; one study estimates these costs are 18% higher for small businesses . this section of the report analyzes the effects certain aca provisions could have on small businesses . in addition , proponents of the revision argue that the 30-hour definition encourages employers to reduce the number of hours allotted to each worker ( thereby reducing each worker's pay ) to decrease the number of full - time workers and reduce employers' compliance costs with the aca ( or the size of their employer penalty , because the penalty is only based on full - time workers ) . changing the cutoff from 30 hours per week to 40 hours per week would not eliminate the incentive for employers to shift more workers to part - time status and could actually provide a greater incentive for firms not to offer health insurance to their employees . some are concerned that the effects of the employer penalty could be concentrated among smaller firms in certain industries that are large enough to be over the 50-fte - employee threshold and that primarily employ low - income workers ( who are less likely to be able to afford out - of - pocket premium costs of an employer - sponsored health plan ) . for example , a $2 million payroll cap could provide an exemption to certain firms with lower average wages that would otherwise be subject to aca employer penalties ( because they have too many employees to be exempt ) . also , some of these workers have an average salary above 133% of the fpl ( as defined in table 4 ) . this option could be more administratively complicated for some firms that , arguably , fall into multiple industry categories . if fewer firms offer employer - sponsored health plans , then more workers could rely on government subsidies for coverage in individual insurance exchanges . president obama's fy2014 budget proposed expanding and simplifying the credit . the budget recommended increasing the eligibility cutoff from 25 workers to 50 workers , changing the phaseout formula so more firms will qualify for at least part of the credit , and simplifying the calculation of the credit ( by removing a requirement that an eligible employer pay a uniform percentage of the premium for each employee and eliminating a cap on the credit based on the average health insurance premium in the employer's state ) . 3046 ) and the small business tax credit accessibility act ( h.r .
