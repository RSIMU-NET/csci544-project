in december 2002 , the congressional joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ( 5 ) , recommended that a new cabinetlevel senate - confirmed nid position be established , and that a separate director be named to managethe cia . supporters of the nid concept argue that the dci , who manages the ic and the cia , and servesas the principal intelligence advisor to the president , has too many jobs , and that an nid , unburdenedby the need to manage the cia , must be established if the ic is to be effectively managed .  ( 12 ) they also argue that an nid must be empowered with two authorities the dci now lacks: the authority to hire and remove ic agency heads in consultation with the defense secretary ( currently,the secretary of defense selects principal ic agency heads for the three combat support agencies - - nsa , nro , and nga - - with the concurrence of the dci ) ; and the authority to move funding andpersonnel within or across ic agencies at any time during the year of execution with congressionalapproval .  ( 14 ) from the prospective of proponents , failure to establish an empowered nid with hiring , firing and budget authority will leave the ic with divided management of intelligence capabilities ; lack ofcommon standards and practices across the foreign - domestic intelligence divide ; structural barriersthat undermine the performance of joint intelligence work ; and a weak capacity to set priorities andmove resources . some opponents counter that although perhaps a good idea , establishing the position of nidwill have only a marginal impact , and assert that had this change been made prior to the september11 attacks , it would not have significantly altered the way the u.s. dealt with al qaeda , and certainlywould not have prevented the 9 / 11 attacks . they assert an nid would lose day - to - daycontrol over the cia , a natural power base . other skeptics assert that establishing the position of nid will only add another layer of bureaucracy , and risks disruption at a time when terrorists continue to threaten to attack the unitedstates . critics are likely to also assert that centralized management control will be further weakenedif the nid is not granted meaningful hiring , firing and budget authority . some critics have voiced concern about the 9 / 11 commission's recommendations to locate the office of the nid in the executive office of the president . some critics contend that the 9 / 11 commission's concept of the ndi would shift too much influence over the ic to the defense department , because dod would retain most of its roles underthe commission's proposal and , they say , stand to gain influence . the issue of centralized ic leadership was first addressed by the second hoover commissionin 1955 .  comparison of s. 2845 , h.r . 10 , and currentla .
