to assist your committee in considering various fda reform proposals , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine how the eu now reviews and approves new drug applications ( nda ) and ( 2 ) explain why the emea was established , how it operates , and how it is financed . under this procedure , the cpmp reviewed all biotechnology and other high - technology pharmaceutical products for approval across the eu . because the cpmp opinions were not binding , member states issued different decisions on drug approvals , which prevented pharmaceutical companies from obtaining eu - wide approval for their products . the cpmp , composed of two representatives from each member state , renders opinions about the safety , efficacy , and quality of human pharmaceutical products that are binding on all the member states . the decentralized approval procedure is expected to take between 300 and 686 days depending on whether other member states object to the marketing authorization granted by the first member state , objections lead to a formal arbitration by the cpmp , the applicant appeals an unfavorable opinion , the member states raise important new scientific or technical questions , or the standing committee cannot reach consensus on a commission draft decision and refers the matter to the council of ministers . regulatory and industry officials believe that this concern will be somewhat mitigated by the new procedures' use of two rapporteurs . the emea is funded by the commission and industry application fees and has a small permanent staff and two scientific committees that draw upon eu - wide scientific expertise . the emea also performs several other functions . the permanent secretariat consists of four units: the administration and logistical unit , which is responsible for personnel , administration , budget , accounting , and organization of and interpretation for conferences and meetings ; the human medicines evaluation unit , whose two sections support the centralized and decentralized procedures for approval of pharmaceutical products for human use ; the veterinary medicines evaluation unit , which supports centralized and decentralized procedures for approval of pharmaceutical products for veterinary use and monitors the maximum residue levels in foodstuffs of animal origin ; and the technical coordination unit , which is responsible for inspection , pharmacovigilance , and technical documentation activities . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also .
