the funding authorization for the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , included in the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 ( p.l . 115-63 ) , is now set to expire on march 31 , 2018 . in addition to setting spending levels , faa authorization acts typically set policy on a wide range of issues related to civil aviation . this report considers topics likely to arise as the 115 th congress continues to debate faa reauthorization . it does not attempt to be comprehensive . many issues debated prior to passage of the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 are not discussed unless further congressional consideration appears probable . additional issues , not discussed in this report , may arise as congress moves forward . in addition to excise taxes deposited into the trust fund , faa imposes air traffic service fees on flights that transit u.s. - controlled airspace but do not take off from or land in the united states . these overflight fees partially fund the essential air service ( eas ) program . in the longer term , however , the vitality of the aatf remains a concern , as reductions in general fund appropriations to faa have increased the proportion of faa funding that is derived from the trust fund . none of those proposals has been enacted into law . participation in the appp has been limited . a related issue is whether to make the planning for noise - mitigating air traffic control procedures at individual airports eligible for aip funding . other provisions required faa to evaluate the role of airport surveillance technologies in the implementation of nextgen airport surface operations management ; authorized the establishment of a nextgen research and development center of excellence ; and authorized public - private partnerships to leverage and maximize private - sector capital for the purpose of equipping general aviation and commercial aircraft with nextgen avionics . faa is to report to congress on its initiatives to encourage nextgen equipage , including policies that give priority handling to ads - b - equipped aircraft . h.r . by and large , the rights of airline passengers are defined by congress . oaep considers a number of factors in determining the civil penalty it would seek in an enforcement proceeding , such as the harm caused by the violations , the alleged violator's compliance disposition , the alleged violator's financial condition and ability to pay , how long the violations continued , and the strength of the case . currently , large air carriers are subject to a maximum civil penalty of $27,500 per violation , under 49 u.s.c . part 383 . the intense price competition of recent years has prompted airlines to respond by "unbundling" their offerings and charging separately for services that once were included in the price of a ticket . the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 ( p.l . 114-190 are summarized below . one controversy involves some u.s. network airlines' and labor unions' opposition to the expansion of three fast - growing airlines based in the persian gulf region â€” emirates airline , etihad airways , and qatar airways . the other controversy concerns norwegian air international ( nai ) , an airline that is registered in ireland . more specifically , the opponents argued that nai's plans to operate with an irish air operator's certificate rather than a norwegian one and to source crews from asia ( possibly through a third - party company ) as well as from the united states and europe would violate article 17 bis of the u.s. - eu air service agreement .
