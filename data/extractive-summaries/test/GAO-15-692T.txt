the threat posed by an electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) or solar weather event could have a debilitating impact on critical electrical infrastructure and communications systems , as well as other key assets and infrastructure that depend on electric utilities for power . addressing these threats necessitates effective collaboration among multiple government agencies and industry partners and no singular federal program or entity has sole responsibility for addressing electromagnetic threats . in april 2008 , the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack ( emp commission ) issued a report which included recommendations addressing the preparation , protection and recovery of u.s. critical infrastructures against a possible emp attack.to doe . the majority of these recommendations were made to dhs and my statement today is based on preliminary observations and analyses from our ongoing review of dhs's efforts to address electromagnetic threats . background research , as key stakeholders and subject matter experts within the electrical sector . our preliminary analysis of dhs's actions indicates that they generally fell under four categories of effort: ( 1 ) developing reports , ( 2 ) identifying mitigation efforts , ( 3 ) strategy development and planning , and ( 4 ) conducting training exercises . this 2011 report assessed the impacts of space weather on the electric grid , seeking to understand how previous solar storms have affected some power grids , and what cost - effective mitigation efforts are available to protect the electric grid , among other topics . recx . in 2012 , s&t partnered with industry to develop a prototype transformer that could significantly reduce the time to transport , install , and energize a transformer to aid recovery from power outages associated with transformer failures from several months to less than one week . while dhs has taken several positive steps to address electromagnetic threats to the electric grid since the emp commission issued its recommendations in 2008 , our preliminary analysis indicates that these actions may fall short of the expectations for dhs regarding overall responsibilities to oversee and coordinate national efforts to protect critical electrical infrastructure , consistent with ppd - 21 and the nipp . specifically , dhs has had difficulty identifying the relevant dhs components , officials , or ongoing internal dhs activities with an emp nexus . we recognize that dhs does not have a statutory obligation to address the specific recommendations of the emp commission and many of these recommendations were also directed to doe . nevertheless , we believe that implementation of them could help mitigate electromagnetic impacts to the electric grid , such as helping to assure the protection of high - value transmission assets . for example , ppd - 21 states that dhs , in carrying out its responsibilities under the homeland security act of 2002 , as amended , is to , among other things , evaluate national capabilities , opportunities , and challenges in protecting critical infrastructure ; analyze threats to , vulnerabilities of , and potential consequences from all hazards on critical infrastructure ; identify security and resilience functions that are necessary for effective stakeholder engagement with all critical infrastructure sectors ; integrate and coordinate federal cross - sector security and resilience activities ; and identify and analyze key interdependencies among critical infrastructure sectors . we will continue to assess the extent to which dhs's efforts align with the emp commission recommendations as well as the extent to which dhs's current and planned actions align with its own risk management framework , as identified in the nipp , as we complete our work . we will report our final results later this year . although dhs participation in the identified projects is a positive step to help mitigate some potential impacts of electromagnetic threats , our preliminary work suggests that dhs has not fully coordinated with stakeholders in other areas to help facilitate emp and gmd protective efforts . dhs has not identified any efforts to specifically provide emp - related threat information to industry stakeholders . collecting risk information .
