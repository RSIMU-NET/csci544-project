the increased interest has been driven at least in part by the federal fiscal situation and in part by the state of the economy since the recession began in 2007 . issues related to the compensation of federal employees often center on the pay differential between federal workers and their private sector counterparts . for years , the annual president's pay agent ( ppa ) study , which is covered in greater detail later in this report , has shown a large wage penalty for federal workers compared to private sector workers in similar occupations . a spate of recent studies , which use a different analytical approach and data sources , has partially contradicted the findings of the ppa study by concluding that at least some federal workers enjoy a wage premium over comparable private sector workers . these studies and accompanying reporting on the comparison of compensation of federal workers to private sector workers provide an indication of the disparate findings , which makes it difficult to determine how compensation of federal employees actually compares to that of workers in the private sector . this report attempts to clarify why the recent studies have arrived at different conclusions and examines limitations of the approaches employed in the different studies . in evaluating claims about federal pay , there appear to be two basic approaches to comparing compensation in the federal and private - sector workforces â€” the human capital approach and the jobs analysis approach . these two approaches are not mutually exclusive but may be difficult to combine given data limitations . each approach is outlined below , followed by an examination of a few recent studies comparing federal and private sector compensation . the studies reviewed were chosen because they are official government studies ( president's pay agent , congressional budget office ) or have received significant attention in policy debates . controlling for educational attainment and experience are particularly important , given their impact on earnings . of the five studies under review , one reports an overall average wage penalty for federal workers ( ppa ) , one reports neither an overall average wage premium nor a penalty for federal workers ( cbo ) , and three ( heritage , aei , and cato ) find overall average wage premia for federal workers compared to private sector workers . while the aei report shows a clear wage premium across levels of educational attainment , the more methodologically rigorous cbo study finds a more nuanced outcome . that is , federal workers with less than a bachelor's degree have on average a wage premium compared to private sector counterparts , while federal workers with post - graduate educational attainment experience a wage penalty relative to private sector counterparts . as with wage differentials , the cbo study finds a declining benefit premium as educational attainment rises . results from these studies provide useful information . the range of worker and job characteristics is sufficiently broad across sectors that claims about "average" workers generally conceal much of the variation driving differences in compensation . for purposes of policy , the most informative studies show variation in compensation differentials by some control variables , particularly by some measure of human capital ( e.g. , education ) or detailed occupation .
