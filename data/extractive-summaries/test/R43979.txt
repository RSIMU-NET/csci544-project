in june 2015 , the house judiciary committee approved the innovation act ( h.r . this report describes how the major provisions of current patent litigation reform legislation , with a particular focus on these two bills that have seen the most legislative activity , would change existing patent law to address the perceived problems in the patent litigation system . the innovation act , h.r . under these new requirements , a party alleging infringement in a complaint must include specific details regarding the following: each patent allegedly infringed ; all claims necessary to produce the identification of each process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter ( "accused instrumentality" ) that is alleged to infringe any claim of each patent identified above ; for each accused instrumentality alleged to infringe a claim , an identification with particularity ( if known ) of the name or model number of each accused instrumentality or a description of each accused instrumentality ; for each accused instrumentality , a clear and concise statement of how it infringes each claim of each patent ; for each claim of indirect infringement , the acts of the alleged indirect infringer that contribute to , or are inducing , a direct infringement ; the authority of the party alleging infringement to assert each patent and the grounds for the court's jurisdiction ; and each complaint filed that asserts any of the same patents like the innovation act , the senate's patent act also proposes heightened pleading requirements , including such details as the identification of each patent allegedly infringed ; the identification of each claim of each patent that is allegedly infringed ; the identification ( including the name , model number , or description ) of the accused instrumentality that has allegedly infringed the patent ; a description of how the accused instrumentality is allegedly infringing specific elements of the claim ; and a description of the acts of the alleged infringer that allegedly contributed to or induced the direct infringement , for claims of indirect infringement . both the innovation act and patent act would also explicitly eliminate the federal rules of civil procedure's form 18 . upon the filing of an initial complaint for patent infringement , plaintiffs would be required to disclose to the uspto , the court , and all adverse parties the following information relating to entities that own or have a financial interest in the patent: 1. the assignee ( s ) of the patent ( s ) involved in the case ; 2. any entity with a right to sublicense or enforce the patent ( s ) at issue ; 3. any entity , other than the plaintiff , that the plaintiff knows to have a financial interest in the patent ( s ) at issue or in the plaintiff ; 4. the ultimate parent entity of any assignee , or the entities identified in #2 and #3 above ; 5. a clear and concise description of the principal business , if any , of the party alleging infringement ; 6. a list of each complaint filed , of which the party alleging infringement has knowledge , that asserts or asserted any of the patents identified above ; 7. for each patent identified , a statement as to whether the patent is subject to certain licensing requirements ( imposed by the federal government , a foreign government , or by a standards development organization ) . section 5 of the innovation act would codify a modified version of the customer suit exception by amending the patent act to require a court to suspend or postpone litigation against a customer of a product or process that contains allegedly infringing technologies , if several requirements are satisfied: 1. the manufacturer is a party to the civil action or a separate action involving the same patent ( s ) ; 2. the customer agrees to be bound by the decisions of the court in the action involving the manufacturer , with respect to any issues that the customer and manufacturer have in common ; and 3. the customer requests the court to stay the action no later than the later of ( a ) 120 days after the date on which the first pleading in the action is served ( if such pleading specifically identifies the product or process that is the source of the customer's alleged infringement of the patent , and the pleading specifically explains how the product or process is alleged to infringe the patent ) , or ( b ) the date on which the first scheduling order in the case is entered . then in 1947 , congress enacted a fee - shifting provision that gave district courts the power to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in patent suits . section 3 ( b ) of the innovation act would amend section 285 to require a court , in any patent case , to award attorney fees to a prevailing party ( plaintiff or defendant ) , unless the court finds that either 1. the nonprevailing party's position and conduct are "reasonably justified in law and fact" or 2. there are "special circumstances ( such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor ) [that] make an award unjust. . unlike the innovation act's creation of what appears to be a presumption of an award of attorney fees , section 7 ( b ) of the patent act would require the prevailing party to first make a motion for the fees , after which the court must determine whether the position of the nonprevailing party was "objectively reasonable in law and fact , and whether the conduct of the nonprevailing party was objectively reasonable. . section 3 ( c ) of the innovation act would establish mandatory joinder rules when the nonprevailing party alleging infringement is unable to pay the fee award ordered by the court and other expenses . the patent act contains a mechanism for recovering fee awards from interested parties that is similar to the innovation act ( as reported ) . the innovation act states that it is the "sense of congress" that "it is an abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent infringement. . 1896 , the "demand letter transparency act of 2015," outlines both content and disclosure requirements for demand letters . the senate's patent act addresses both abusive demand letters and demand letters sent as pre - suit notification . instead , the innovation act and patent act ( as reported ) would require that the ptab , in ipr and pgr proceedings , use the same claim construction standard that is applied by federal courts ; that is , the ptab would need to construe a patent claim "in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning of such claim as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and the prosecution history pertaining to the patent. . however , the patent act ( as reported ) does not change the evidentiary standard for proving unpatentability , as the strong patents act would . sections 102 ( d ) and 103 ( d ) of the strong patents act would provide even more stringent standing requirements for persons wanting to initiate a pgr or ipr . the strong patents act would put an end to uspto fee diversion . the innovation act ( as reported ) would effectively overturn ve holding corp. by imposing limitations on the judicial districts in which a civil action may be brought for patent infringement or for a declaratory judgment that a patent is invalid or not infringed . furthermore , the innovation act would require that the uspto's existing small business patent outreach programs , as well as relevant offices at the small business administration and the minority business development agency , provide education and awareness on abusive patent litigation practices .
