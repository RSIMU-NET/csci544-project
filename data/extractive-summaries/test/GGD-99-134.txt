the authority did not provide us with any information on what procedures were followed in awarding this contract. . the authority's regulations prescribe some of the basic procurement principles , including the avoidance of conflicts or impropriety and the appearance of conflict or a preference for competition among potential sources to ensure fair and reasonable prices and best value for the authority ; use of sole source contracting only when it makes good business sense or promotes the authority's mission and is justified in writing and , if the contract exceeds $100,000 on an annual basis is approved by the authority's chair ; identification of potential sources to achieve the benefits of competition ; publication of the authority's requirements to make potential qualified sources aware of the authority's requirements ; preparation of statements of work that include a thorough description of the required services , a delivery schedule , and standards for measuring the contractor's performance ; and monitoring of contractor performance and certification of satisfactory performance prior to payment of contractor invoices . the authority's executive director , deputy general counsel , and chief financial officer also assisted these staff members . as you specifically requested , we focused on the contracts that were awarded for the authority's former cmo and to thompson , cobb , bazilio and associates . for the contract that was awarded prior to the adoption of the authority's regulations , we reviewed the information in the contract file to determine what information was available to document key contract award and administration decisions , including the basis for contract selection and whether the file contained evidence that the authority received the services it paid for . we also reviewed several reports of studies done by other entities on the authority and district's procurement process.however , as agreed with your offices , we did not review the authority's process or controls for ensuring that its review and approval regulations governing district contracts were being followed . although the authority's procurement regulations set forth some basic requirements for contract award , we found that the authority did not always comply with its procurement regulations or follow sound contracting principles for the nine contracts that we assessed . several factors appear to have contributed to the authority's contracting problems . to improve its contracting operations , we recommend that the chair of the authority require the executive director to ( 1 ) approve and justify all waivers of authority contracting regulations in writing , ( 2 ) only extend contracts in writing and prohibit the executive director from extending or modifying expired contracts , and ( 3 ) include in contract files a written certification , signed by an appropriate official , stating that the contractor's performance was or was not satisfactory ; direct the executive director to ( 1 ) fully define the roles and responsibilities of the authority's procurement staff ; ( 2 ) prepare a written plan for contracting that includes methods for ensuring compliance with the procurement regulations ; ( 3 ) provide guidance to the procurement staff on areas , such as determining best value , developing performance standards for work statements , monitoring and certifying contractors' performance , preparing written justifications for sole source awards , documenting the basis for contract selection , awarding contracts that are between $100,000 and $500,000 , and executing contract modifications , or contract options ; hold the executive director and other procurement staff accountable for ensuring that they follow the authority's procurement regulations ; and require the executive director to assess whether the authority's processes and controls for the review and approval of district contracts prior to award are effective and , if not , make appropriate changes .
