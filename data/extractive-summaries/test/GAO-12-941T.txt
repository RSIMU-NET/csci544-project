i am pleased to be here today to discuss the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) to develop and deploy a global nuclear detection architecture ( gnda ) — an integrated system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities to combat nuclear smuggling in foreign countries , at the u.s. border , and inside the united states — and to provide an update on the deployment of radiation detection equipment at u.s. borders . preventing terrorists from using nuclear or radiological material to carry out an attack in the united states is a top national priority . dndo is charged with , among other things , enhancing and coordinating the nuclear detection efforts of federal , state , local , and tribal governments and the private among other things , sector to ensure a managed , coordinated response.dndo is required to coordinate with other federal agencies to develop an enhanced gnda . while federal efforts to combat nuclear smuggling have largely focused on established ports of entry , such as seaports and land border crossings , dndo has also been examining nuclear detection strategies along other potential pathways in the architecture , including ( 1 ) land border areas between ports of entry into the united states , ( 2 ) international general aviation , and ( 3 ) small maritime craft , such as recreational boats and commercial fishing vessels . develop one . in january 2009 , we recommended that the secretary of homeland security develop a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear detection strategy to help ensure the success of initiatives aimed at closing vulnerabilities in the united states.on , among other things , establishing time frames and costs for the areas dndo had identified — land border areas between ports of entry , aviation , and small maritime craft . dhs did not comment on this recommendation but noted that it aligned with dndo's past , present , and future actions . the status of these recommendations is discussed later in this testimony . we stated that this plan should focus as we will discuss today , dhs has made meaningful progress in deploying radiation detection equipment at u.s. border crossings and seaports ; however , as deployed portal monitors begin to reach the end of their expected service lives , dhs will soon need to make decisions about whether to refurbish or replace them . dhs has also made progress in developing key planning documents to guide the gnda . this testimony discusses: ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the united states at ports of entry , ( 2 ) observations from our past work that may help dhs as it considers options for deploying new technologies to refurbish or replace existing portal monitors when they reach the end of their expected service lives , and ( 3 ) our assessment of the extent to which dhs has addressed our prior recommendations . this testimony is primarily based on our prior work on federal efforts to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials , issued from october 2002 through july 2011 . in summary , over the past 10 years , dhs has made significant progress in deploying radiation detection equipment to scan for nuclear or radiological materials in nearly all trucks and containerized cargo coming into the united stated through seaports and border crossings . however , challenges remain for the agency in developing a similar scanning capability for railcars entering this country from canada and mexico , as well as for international air cargo and international commercial aviation . among other things , we have previously reported that dhs should ( 1 ) test new equipment rigorously prior to acquisition and deployment , ( 2 ) obtain the full concurrence of the end user to ensure that new equipment meets operational needs , and ( 3 ) conduct a cost - benefit analysis to inform any acquisition decisions . in our past work on the gnda , we recommended that dhs develop an overarching strategic plan to guide the development of the gdna , as well as a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear detection strategy . we reported , in july 2011 , that the gnda strategic plan addressed several of the aspects of our prior recommendations but did not ( 1 ) identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or ( 2 ) employ monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify needed improvements . however , in both the gnda strategic plan and the implementation plan , it remains difficult to identify priorities from among various components of the domestic part of the gnda . among other things , in july 2008 , we recommended that dhs develop an overarching strategic plan for the gnda that ( 1 ) clearly defines the objectives to be accomplished , ( 2 ) identifies the roles and responsibilities for meeting each objective , ( 3 ) identifies the funding necessary to achieve those objectives , and ( 4 ) employs monitoring mechanisms to determine programmatic progress and identify needed improvements . in december 2010 , dhs issued the interagency gnda strategic plan and in april 2012 , it issued its gnda implementation plan for domestic aspects of the gnda .
