software security , including the protection of software code from hacking and other malicious tampering , is therefore an area of concern for many dod systems . dod has reported that countries hostile to the united states are focusing resources on developing information warfare strategies . dod acquisition policy allows program managers discretion in managing foreign suppliers used for software development . while dod acquisition policy requires major weapon programs to maintain information about the software project's size , effort , schedule , and quality to track the cost - related implications of software development , it does not require program managers to identify and manage suppliers or the potential security risks from foreign suppliers . even if the suggested guidance was implemented , the procedures for addressing software security are generally for use after software suppliers have been selected , and do not provide the program manager the opportunity to evaluate whether the risks associated with using those suppliers for software development are acceptable . these procedures are intended to mitigate system vulnerabilities from operational threats , such as external hacking and unauthorized access to information systems . while these plans and initiatives may help to increase dod's focus on software security and may lead to the development and identification of several potential software security best practices , dod software assurance officials acknowledge that significant effort remains to adequately mitigate software risks to weapon systems . while dod initiatives have begun to recognize potential risks from foreign software suppliers , this is not always the case within the weapon programs where software is developed or acquired . program officials for most of the systems we reviewed did not make foreign involvement in software development a specific element of their risk identification and mitigation efforts . as a result , program officials' knowledge of the foreign - developed software included in their weapon systems varied . in addition , risk mitigation efforts emphasized program level risks , such as meeting program cost and schedule goals , instead of software security risks . further , program managers often delegated risk mitigation and source selection to their prime contractors who tended to be concerned with software functionality and quality assurance , rather than specifically addressing software development risks associated with foreign suppliers . as the amount of software on weapon systems increases , it becomes more difficult and costly to test every line of code . further , dod cannot afford to monitor all worldwide software development facilities or provide clearances for all potential software developers , especially for cots software . require the office of the assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration and the office of the undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics , as part of their role to review , oversee , and formulate security and acquisition practices , to work with other organizations as necessary to ensure that weapon program risk assessments include specific attention to software development risks and threats , including those from foreign suppliers . further , dod agreed certification activities such as ditscap can assist in addressing insider threats in software development , but that additional guidance is necessary to ensure that software security risks are addressed during system design and development or when selecting software sources .
