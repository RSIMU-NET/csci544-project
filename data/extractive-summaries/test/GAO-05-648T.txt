generally speaking , foia establishes that federal agencies must provide the public with access to government information , thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions . to help ensure appropriate implementation , the act requires that agencies report annually to the attorney general , providing specific information about their foia operations . although the specific details of processes for handling foia requests vary among agencies , the major steps in handling a request are similar across the government . agencies receive requests , usually in writing ( although they may accept requests by telephone or electronically ) , which can come from any organization or member of the public . once received , the request goes through several phases , which include initial processing , searching for and retrieving responsive records , preparing responsive records for release , approving the release of the records , and releasing the records to the requester . other requests may require more extensive processing , depending on their complexity , the volume of information involved , the need for the agency foia office to work with offices that have relevant subject - matter expertise to find and obtain information , the need for a foia officer to review and redact information in the responsive material , the need to communicate with the requester about the scope of the request , and the need to communicate with the requester about the fees that will be charged for fulfilling the request ( or whether fees will be waived ) . citizens have been requesting and receiving an ever - increasing amount of information from the federal government , as reflected in the increasing number of foia requests that have been received and processed in recent years . from 2002 to 2004 , the number of requests received increased by 71 percent , and the number of requests processed increased by 68 percent . in addition to processing greater numbers of requests , many agencies ( 13 of 25 ) also reported that their backlogs of pending requests — requests carried over from one year to the next — have increased since 2002 .
