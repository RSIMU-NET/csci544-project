in 2017 , 47,600 overdose deaths in the united states involved an opioid , and prescription opioids were involved in many of these deaths . the federal government has taken multiple steps to reduce the misuse and abuse of opioids . for medicare , the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2016 ( cara ) established drug management programs ( dmp ) to limit access to frequently abused drugs for beneficiaries considered to be at risk for their abuse , among other things . cara included a provision for gao to review the implementation of medicare dmps . to describe how medicare identifies beneficiaries that are at risk of opioid misuse and abuse , and how it attempts to mitigate that risk , we reviewed the recommendations contained in cdc's guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain and cms's opioid misuse strategy , as well as cms regulations , and other relevant cms guidance . to identify the factors likely to affect the success of the medicare dmps , we reviewed the literature on opioid misuse and abuse , and interviewed officials from cms and other stakeholders , including the five largest medicare part d plan sponsors , and officials with six organizations representing medicare plan sponsors , physicians ( including pain specialists ) , pharmacy benefit managers , state medicaid programs , and patients suffering chronic pain . in 2017 , nearly one in three medicare part d beneficiaries received an opioid prescription , and medicare spending for prescription opioids was almost $3.4 billion . for years , to limit medicaid at - risk beneficiaries' access to controlled substances , state medicaid programs have used lock - in programs , which restrict certain beneficiaries' access to a single prescriber ( such as a physician or other health - care provider ) , a single pharmacy , or both . medicare dmps perform case management to identify at - risk beneficiaries and attempt to mitigate risk by increasing communication and coordination across plan sponsors , health - care prescribers , pharmacists , and at - risk beneficiaries . cms's framework includes two steps for identifying at - risk beneficiaries: 1 ) cms identifies potentially at - risk beneficiaries based on key clinical factors and 2 ) plan sponsors use case management to identify the subset of potentially at - risk beneficiaries who are actually at risk . use of higher numbers of prescribers and pharmacies may put the beneficiary at more risk . the notification letter notifies each beneficiary that he or she has been identified as potentially at risk ; details which coverage limitations the sponsor intends to implement and for how long ; explains how the beneficiary can submit preferences for the selected frequently abused drugs prescriber ( s ) and the selected dispensing pharmacy or pharmacies for frequently abused drugs in case a lock - in tool is used ; provides information about resources and plan benefits that address prescription abuse ; explains how additional information can be provided to the plan sponsor ; and informs the beneficiary of the right to appeal , among other things . beneficiary specific point - of - sale claim edit . reporting requirements for medicare dmps . although the medicare dmps are currently voluntary , the framework places reporting requirements on plan sponsors that choose to establish dmps . none of the five plan sponsors we interviewed expressed concerns about beneficiaries not receiving clinically appropriate doses of opioids under the medicare dmps , given that the case management process includes clinician input , including the beneficiary's primary health - care provider and plan sponsors' clinicians . specifically , several officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders noted that sponsors should communicate with , and educate stakeholders to ensure that dmps , especially their coverage limitation tools , are not viewed as punitive tools by beneficiaries , but rather as tools for keeping them safe . flexibility to incorporate best practices from dmps and flexibility in varying coverage limitation features to fit regional differences are other keys to success , some plan sponsors and a stakeholder told us , due to regional and other differences in population groups . in addition , some officials with plan sponsors and stakeholders stated that the criteria for dmps such as how at - risk beneficiaries are identified , and other parameters of the dmp ( such as which drugs are designated as frequently abused drugs ) should be periodically reassessed by cms with feedback by plan sponsors and adjusted , where appropriate , to incorporate evidence from the outcomes of the dmp . according to cms officials , the agency also will obtain feedback from plan sponsors about how the dmps are working , and this feedback will be the basis for making periodic changes to the dmps . cms is also updating its medicare part c and d audit protocol so it can audit dmp related beneficiary notices . finally , cms tracks the utilization of opioids by medicare part d enrollees using part d data and the overutilization monitoring system .
