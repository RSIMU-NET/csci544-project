because fish grown in confined aquacultured areas can have high rates of bacterial infections , farmers may treat them with drugs , such as antibiotics and antifungal agents , to increase their survival rates . specifically , this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) fda's program is able to ensure the safety of seafood imports against residues from unapproved drugs and ( 2 ) fda and nmfs have implemented the 2009 mou to enhance federal oversight of seafood and leverage federal resources . to assess the extent to which fda's program is able to ensure the safety of seafood imports against residues from unapproved drugs , we analyzed information on fda's oversight mechanism for seafood imports — importer and foreign country processing facilities inspections — and its seafood import sampling program . processors are responsible for addressing hazards that may have been introduced into the products before they reach the processors , which could include hazards resulting from drugs unapproved by fda for use in aquaculture . in particular , from fiscal years 2005 through 2009 , we found that fda inspected 315 facilities that nmfs also inspected . fda's program to ensure the safety of imported seafood from residues of unapproved drugs is limited , because the agency's primary oversight program generally involves reviews of documents at individual foreign processing facilities and importers for haccp compliance . in contrast , the eu reviews foreign government structures , food safety legislation , and the foreign country's fish farm inspection program to ensure imported seafood products come from countries with seafood safety systems equivalent to that of the eu . moreover , fda's sampling program is limited in scope , is not effectively implemented , and does not fully use the capabilities of fda's laboratories . in general , as part of foreign haccp inspections , fda inspectors do not visit fish farms to evaluate drug use or controls . however , according to fda officials , the agency does not have any written operating procedures or any criteria or standards that it uses for these assessments to evaluate a country's regulatory infrastructure ; farms ; or the capabilities , competence , and quality controls of foreign laboratories . for example , fda's documentation on this visit stated that fish farms were likely using fluoroquinolones . these standards are used to evaluate foreign food safety systems . fda's sampling program for detecting residues from unapproved drugs in imported seafood products is limited in scope . thus , fda does not generally test for drugs that some countries and the eu have approved for use in aquaculture . fda and nmfs have made limited progress in implementing the 2009 mou , resulting in a lack of systematic collaboration between the agencies . fda has inspected 41 of 2,744 ( or 1.5 percent ) chinese seafood processing facilities in the last 6 years . to better ensure the safety of seafood imports , we recommend that the secretary of health and human services direct the commissioner of fda to take the following three actions: study the feasibility of adopting other practices used by other entities , such as requiring foreign countries that want to export seafood to the united states to develop a national residues monitoring plan to control the use of aquaculture drugs , to more efficiently ensure the safety of imported seafood and report its findings to the secretary ; develop a more comprehensive import sampling program for seafood by more effectively using its laboratory resources and taking into account the imported seafood sampling programs of other entities and countries ; and develop a strategic approach with specific time frames for enhancing collaborative efforts with nmfs and better leveraging nmfs inspection resources . as part of our data request , we asked fda to provide the drug residue being tested for in each analysis .
