population were college graduates and by 2000 this had increased to 24% . a second indication from these data is that the representation of first generation and low - income students among thoseenrolled in college has been consistently lower than among those graduating from high school . thus , it appears thathighschool graduates from low - income families and those that lack a parent with a college degree are less likely thanothergraduates to move on to college . note: columns may not sum to 100% due to rounding . the figures in tables 1 and 2 also support the large body of research which has established a strong link between thesocio - economic status of parents ( including income , occupation , and educational attainment ) and that of theirchildren . the findings presented here indicate that rates of college enrollment vary greatly by family income and parental educational attainment .
