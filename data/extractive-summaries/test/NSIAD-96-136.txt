pursuant to our basic legislative responsibilities , we reviewed the thaad uoes program to determine whether planned testing would reasonably demonstrate the capabilities of uoes as an interim system before funds are committed to interceptor production . the army anticipates exercising the contract option for the uoes interceptors in the 3rd quarter of 1996 based on the results of only the first 7 of 14 scheduled demonstration and validation flight tests . the airlift requirement for uoes will be significant . the army estimates that to transport the full system with 40 interceptors from the united states to a theater of operation will require up to 18 c - 5 , 26 c - 17 , or 40 c - 141 flights . they stated that the increase in interceptor cost is due to technical , estimating , and schedule changes . accordingly , to avoid committing over $200 million for a system that may not have adequate operational effectiveness , we recommend that the secretary of defense ( 1 ) restrict obligational authority for uoes interceptors until the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff certifies that uoes has adequate effectiveness to merit deployment as an interim system and ( 2 ) seek legislative relief from the requirements of the 1996 national defense authorization act in regards to acquiring thaad uoes by fiscal year 1998 .
