policymakers have raised questions about the extent to which these increases in health insurance premiums are justified and could adversely affect consumers . while oversight of private health insurance , including premium rates , is primarily a state responsibility , the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) established a role for the department of health and human services ( hhs ) by requiring the secretary of hhs to work with states to establish a process for the annual review of unreasonable premium increases . to describe changes that states that received hhs rate review grants have begun making to enhance their oversight of health insurance premium rates , we collected information about state changes in our survey described above from the 45 state survey respondents that were awarded hhs rate review grants in 2010 entitled , “grants to states for health insurance premium review - cycle i” ( referred to as cycle i rate review grants ) . in addition , the reported outcomes of rate filing reviews varied widely across states in 2010 , in particular , the extent to which rate filings were disapproved , withdrawn , or resulted in lower rates than originally proposed . nearly all — 48 out of 50 — of the state officials who responded to our survey reported that they reviewed rate filings in 2010 . respondents from 38 states reported that all rate filings they reviewed were reviewed before the rates took effect , while respondents from 8 states reported reviewing at least some rate filings after the rates went into effect . some survey respondents also reported conducting relatively more comprehensive reviews and analyses of rate filings , while other respondents reported reviewing relatively little information or conducting cursory reviews of the information they received . respondents from pennsylvania reported that while they compared data submitted by carriers in rate filings to the carriers' previous rate filings , the state's department of insurance did not have adequate capacity to perform a detailed review of all rate filings received from carriers . survey respondents from six states reported conducting rate review hearings in at least one market in 2010 to provide consumers with opportunities to be involved in the oversight of premium rates . specifically , survey respondents from 5 of these states — connecticut , iowa , new york , north dakota , and utah — reported that over 50 percent of the rate filings they reviewed in 2010 were disapproved , withdrawn , or resulted in rates lower than originally proposed , while survey respondents from 13 of these states reported that these outcomes occurred in less than 10 percent of rate reviews . these reported changes consisted primarily of hiring staff or outside actuaries , and improving the information technology systems used to collect and analyze rate filing data . seventeen respondents reported taking steps to increase their capacity to oversee premium rates by improving information technology and data systems used in the review process . obtain additional legislative authority . more than a third of state survey respondents that reported making changes to rate oversight reported that their states have taken steps — such as introducing or passing legislation — in order to obtain additional legislative authority for overseeing health insurance premium rates . hhs provided us with written comments on a draft version of this report . hhs and naic also provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . in its written comments , hhs also noted the steps it is taking to improve transparency , help states improve their health insurance rate review , and assure consumers that any premium increases are being spent on medical care . to ensure that we identified a range of states for our in - depth interviews , we considered state insurance departments' authorities in 2010 for reviewing health insurance premium rates , as reported by the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) ; states' plans to change their premium rate oversight practices , as described in their cycle i rate review grant applications to hhs submitted in june and july of 2010 ; states' population sizes ; and states' geographic locations . this appendix presents additional results from our survey of insurance department officials in all 50 states and the district of columbia on their oversight of health insurance premium rates in 2010 , and changes they have begun to make to enhance their oversight of health insurance premium rates .
