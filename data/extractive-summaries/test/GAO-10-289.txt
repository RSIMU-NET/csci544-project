gao has been mandated under p.l . with porous borders , difficult terrain , and weak rule of law , the fata is recognized as a safe haven for international terrorists and militants . to fulfill this pledge , the u.s. government created the fata development program , which aims to “support the government of pakistan's development efforts to integrate fata into the mainstream of pakistan.” in support of this pledge , state reports that the u.s. government has allocated $728 million in nonmilitary assistance in pakistan's western frontier region , including the fata . in accordance with good management practices , the u.s. government has implemented two efforts to track the $750 million pledge . using these criteria , the f bureau identified $728 million in allocations from fiscal years 2007 through 2009 toward meeting the $750 million pledge . usaid and state collect reports on the performance of their fata - specific programs , as required by federal regulations and agreements with implementing partners . usaid's automated directives system ( ads ) requires usaid officials to produce complete performance management plans for each u.s. assistance objective , but usaid has not produced a complete plan that includes all key elements for its development assistance efforts in the fata , as shown in table 2 . however , inl had minutes from several review meetings and one monthly performance report for counternarcotics activities . performance of usaid's programs in the fata: performance could not be measured against targets for all ten usaid assistance programs in the fata because they did not all include sufficient data on performance indicators in their most recent annual reporting instruments . state's inl is using a combination of monitoring procedures , but also is not documenting its use of all of these procedures . although usaid has established these procedures to monitor programs in the fata , it has not consistently documented their use for its long - term programs . to help ensure that u.s. development projects associated with the u.s. pledge and future spending plans for pakistan continue to be aligned with our national security goal of assisting pakistan in addressing terrorist threats , and have clearly articulated monitoring responsibilities , indicators , and performance tracking , we recommend that usaid work with the government of pakistan to complete the development of joint strategic implementation plans as originally called for in the agreement between usaid and the government of pakistan . in addition , we believe that joint u.s. pakistan strategic implementation plans would help to ensure that u.s. efforts in the fata are not only based on the needs of each of the seven geographic fata areas , but also u.s. national security goals . the objectives of this review were to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which u.s. development objectives align with u.s. goals and pakistan's objectives , ( 2 ) u.s. efforts to track the fulfillment of the u.s. pledge , ( 3 ) efforts to measure and report the performance of development programs , and ( 4 ) efforts to monitor development assistance in the federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) . we conducted an in - depth analysis of the monitoring documentation provided by usaid's oti and state's inl and compared this documentation to the procedures described in monitoring plans and in interviews with u.s. officials . washington , d.c.: february 23 , 2009 .
