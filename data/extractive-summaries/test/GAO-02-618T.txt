nevertheless , irs officials believe that the number and dollar consequence of schemes has grown in recent years . irs caught about $5 billion in improper tax avoidance or tax credit and refund claims , but estimated that another $20 billion to $40 billion had not been identified and addressed . recent developments suggest that the number of individuals involved in one type of abusive tax scheme involving offshore accounts may be greater than what irs estimated just 2 months ago , and thus , potential lost revenues may be higher . in part because no one individual or office could provide an agencywide perspective on irs's strategy , goals , objectives , performance measures , or program results , it is difficult to provide a clear picture of all that is underway and being accomplished in irs's efforts to address abusive tax schemes . available information suggests , however , that irs has created new offices , reemphasized and reorganized certain prior efforts , and planned to assign or already assigned at least 200 additional staff to its efforts . limited data also suggest that irs's enhanced focus has led to some increased success in convicting those promoting and taking advantage of abusive schemes , in publicizing these results , and in uncovering previously hidden major offshore compliance problems . the sheer number of possible abusive tax schemes that likely will require face - to - face audits could outstrip irs's available resources . furthermore , identifying and handling these cases will require a better - coordinated effort on irs's part . the increased scope of abusive tax schemes has also led irs to develop an improved process for selecting the best cases to pursue among the many that it identifies , develop a new policy to govern simultaneous criminal and civil enforcement investigations of taxpayers , consider how to ensure that increased volumes of scheme - related tax assessments are followed up by irs's collection function when taxpayers are unable to pay in full , and use its internal research group and a contractor to develop better models for identifying indicators that taxpayers may be participating in abusive tax schemes .
