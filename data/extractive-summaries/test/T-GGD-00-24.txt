i am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges that face the national archives and records administration ( nara ) and federal agencies in their efforts to manage the rapidly increasing volume of electronic records . also , because of the wide variance in electronic records management ( erm ) policies and practices at four agencies we visited , we recommended that nara conduct a baseline survey of all agencies as a part of its planned business process reengineering ( bpr ) effort . we found that nara and federal agencies are confronted with many erm challenges , particularly technological issues . nara must be able to receive electronic records from agencies , store them , and retrieve them when needed . agencies must be able to create electronic records , store them , properly dispose of them when appropriate , and send valuable electronic records to nara for archival storage . data files . in addition to increasing volume , nara must address some definitional problems , such as what constitutes an electronic record . in addition , because agencies follow no uniform hardware or software standards , nara must be capable of accepting various formats from agencies and maintaining a continued capability of reading those records . nara is not alone in facing erm challenges , the agencies also must meet federal records act responsibilities . agencies must incorporate nara's guidance into their own recordkeeping systems . on the basis of our discussions with nara and some agency officials , we learned that some agencies are waiting for more specific guidance from nara while others are moving forward by looking for ways to better manage their electronic records . even though nara is aware of what some agencies are doing â€“ such as dod , nasa , ots , and some others - - it does not have governmentwide data on the records management capabilities and programs of federal agencies . nara had planned to do a baseline assessment survey to collect such data on all agencies by the end of fiscal year 2000 . the archivist decided , however , to temporarily postpone doing this baseline survey because he accorded higher priority to such activities as reengineering nara's business processes . even though nara lacks governmentwide data on how agencies are implementing erm , nara has already begun revising its guidance to agencies . our review of the erm activities in four states and three foreign governments showed that approaches to erm differ . these entities often did things differently from each other and / or nara . in conclusion , it is obvious that nara and federal agencies are being challenged to effectively and efficiently manage electronic records in an environment of rapidly changing technology and increasing volume of electronic records .
