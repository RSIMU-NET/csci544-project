many developing countries have expressed concern about their inability to take advantage of global trading opportunities because they lack the capacity to participate in international trade . the united states considers the ability to participate in and benefit from the global trading system key factors in reducing poverty , achieving economic growth , raising income levels , and promoting stability . u.s. trade capacity building is primarily a collection of existing activities placed under the umbrella of trade capacity building by a u. s. government survey . however , 18 agencies have self - reported that they obligated almost $2.9 billion for trade capacity building activities in over 100 countries from fiscal years 2001 through 2004 . these trade agreement - specific working groups are led by ustr . while some of the agencies we reviewed have set program goals for building trade capacity , generally , most have neither developed performance indicators related to trade capacity building , nor have they compiled performance data and analyzed the results in terms of building trade capacity . usda's trade capacity building strategy does not include performance indicators . although usaid officials have called developing trade capacity building performance indicators difficult , they are working toward that end independently and with other donors . without evaluating the effectiveness of its trade capacity building assistance , the united states cannot ensure the reasonable use of resources devoted to such assistance , determine whether the assistance is helping countries participate in and benefit from trade , and credibly demonstrate that trade capacity building is a useful u.s. trade and development policy . to provide more objective information on the progress of u.s. trade capacity building efforts and allow the united states to assess their effectiveness , we make the following two recommendations: the administrator , u.s. agency for international development , and the u.s. trade representative , as co - chairs of the trade capacity building interagency group , in consultation with other agencies that fund and implement trade capacity building assistance , should develop a cost - effective strategy to systematically monitor and measure program results and to evaluate the effectiveness of u.s. trade capacity building assistance . this report ( 1 ) identifies the nature and extent of u.s. trade capacity building ; ( 2 ) describes how agencies implement such assistance , including coordination ; and ( 3 ) assesses whether agencies evaluate its effectiveness .
