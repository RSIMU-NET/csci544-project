of an estimated 220 million acres of marshes , bogs , swamps , and other wetlands in the contiguous united states during colonial times , over half have disappeared , and some of the remaining wetlands have been degraded . this decrease is due , primarily , to agricultural activities and development . developers whose projects adversely affect wetlands must , as prescribed in regulations and guidance issued by the army corps of engineers ( corps ) and environmental protection agency ( epa ) under the clean water act , first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable . in the event that adverse impacts are unavoidable , the developer is required to compensate by restoring a former wetland , enhancing a degraded wetland , creating a new wetland , or preserving an existing wetland . mitigation by third parties has occurred under three types of arrangements in recent years: ( 1 ) “mitigation banks,” often private for - profit entities , typically establish ( restore , enhance , create , or preserve ) wetlands under agreements with the corps and then sell credits for these wetlands to developers ; ( 2 ) developers pay fees to public entities or private nonprofit natural resources management organizations that , usually under agreements with corps district offices , use accumulated fees to establish wetlands ( referred to in this report as in - lieu - fee arrangements ) ; and ( 3 ) developers pay individuals or entities , which are neither mitigation banks nor considered by the corps to be in - lieu - fee organizations , to perform mitigation ( referred to in this report as ad hoc arrangements ) . since use of the in - lieu - fee mitigation option has increased over the last decade , you asked us to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the in - lieu - fee option has been used to mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands , ( 2 ) the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its intended purpose of mitigating such impacts , and ( 3 ) in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers' mitigation business . corps officials in 11 of the 17 districts with the in - lieu - fee option stated that the number of wetland acres restored , enhanced , created , or preserved by the in - lieu - fee organizations equaled or exceeded the number of wetland acres adversely affected . of the eight districts that did not report functions and values at the same level or better , one reported that the functions and values had not met or exceeded the functions and values of the adversely affected wetlands ; two did not know whether the functions and values of the mitigated wetlands met or exceeded the functions and values of the impacted wetlands ; and five reported that the in - lieu - fee organizations had not started any projects that could be assessed . mitigation banks provided restoration and other mitigation services similar to those provided by in - lieu - fee organizations in only 13 of the 17 districts , however , and mitigation banks served the same geographic area as in - lieu - fee organizations in only 12 of those 13 districts . oversight of mitigation efforts performed under ad hoc arrangements was lacking in almost half of the 24 districts using such arrangements . of the 24 districts that used ad hoc arrangements , officials in 13 said ad hoc fund recipients were not liable for the failure of their mitigation efforts , while officials in 2 said they were , and officials in 9 said they did not know whether ad hoc recipients were liable . we disagree . other agencies have raised concerns about such uses . 5 . 9 .
