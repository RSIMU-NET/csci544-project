i am here today to tell you about our preliminary findings and what agencies within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and other federal departments are doing to fulfill their many responsibilities under the act . mtsa called for actions in 46 key areas we identified , such as creating a maritime intelligence security system , assessing security conditions in port areas , creating and implementing a vessel tracking system , and creating identification systems for port workers and seafarers . so far , we have obtained information for 43 of these areas , and agency officials indicate that actions are complete or under way in 42 of them . for example , the coast guard , which had lead responsibility for most of the assignments , has six interim rules in place covering major areas of responsibility , such as security in and around the ports , aboard individual vessels , and at individual facilities . also , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is testing new identification cards for controlling access to secure transportation facilities , including vessels and port facilities . the bureau of customs and border protection ( bcbp ) and the maritime administration ( marad ) , the two other agencies with the largest set of responsibilities under mtsa , also are making progress on major projects . passed in november 2002 , mtsa imposed an ambitious schedule of requirements on a number of federal agencies . since the passage of mtsa in 2002 the responsible agencies — primarily the coast guard , tsa , and bcbp in dhs , along with marad in the department of transportation — have made strides in implementing the act's security provisions . among the provisions for which marad is responsible are developing standards and curricula for the training of maritime security personnel . three relate primarily to security issues: ( 1 ) the limited number of ports that will be covered by the vessel identification system , ( 2 ) questions about the scope and quality of port security assessments , and ( 3 ) the coast guard's plans not to individually approve security plans for foreign vessels . the remaining two relate primarily to operational and efficiency matters: ( 1 ) potential duplication of maritime intelligence efforts and ( 2 ) inconsistency with port security grant program requirements . another security - related issue involves the coast guard's efforts to address mtsa's security planning requirements through a series of security assessments of individual ports . mtsa required the secretary of transportation to establish a program of grants to ports and other entities to implement area and facility - specific security plans .
