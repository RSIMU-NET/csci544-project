for all three objectives , we reviewed documentary evidence ( such as academic studies , trade reports and databases , and industry literature ) and interviewed staff from ftc , department of justice ( doj ) , and three state offices of attorney general ; consumer organizations ; primary and secondary ticket sellers ; venue operators , event promoters , and artists' managers and agents ; major sports leagues ; and academics who have studied the ticket marketplace — all of whom were selected for their experience and to provide a range of perspectives . in the primary ticket market — where tickets originate and are available at initial sale — ticketmaster is the largest ticketing company . for example , some states restrict the use of bots , several other states impose price caps ( or upper limits ) on ticket resale prices , and states including connecticut , new york , and virginia restrict the use of nontransferable tickets ( tickets with terms that do not allow resale ) . many tickets are resold on the secondary market , typically at a higher price . affordability . we conducted our own review of ticketing fees for a nongeneralizable sample of a total of 31 concert , theater , and sporting events across five primary ticket sellers' websites: in total , the combined fees averaged 27 percent of the ticket's face value , and we observed values ranging from 13 percent to 58 percent . many ticketing websites we reviewed did not clearly display their fees up front , and a subset of websites — referred to as white - label — used marketing practices that might confuse consumers . brokers whose business is to purchase and resell tickets have a competitive advantage over individual consumers because they have the technology and resources to purchase large numbers of tickets as soon as they go on sale . the settlement requires ticketmaster , ticketsnow , and any other ticketmaster resale websites to clearly and conspicuously disclose when a consumer is on a resale site and that prices may exceed face value , and to include “reseller price” or “resale price” with ticket listings . white - label websites often market themselves through paid advertising on internet search engines , appearing at the top of search results for venues . consumer protection advocates , event organizers , and some government entities have expressed concerns about high ticket fees . in addition , some individual teams and venues have an agreement with a third company to use its resale platform , which uses paperless tickets and can facilitate ticket transfers from one consumer to another or restrict transfers altogether ( such as with nontransferable tickets ) . event ticketing is not federally regulated and some industry participants are using or exploring technology and other market - based approaches to address concerns related to secondary market activity . as described earlier , markups on the secondary market can be substantial . the new york state attorney general's report stated that nontransferable paperless tickets “appear to be one of the few measures to have any clear effect in reducing the excessive prices charged on the secondary markets and increasing the odds of fans buying tickets at face value.” but , while we identified evidence that nontransferable tickets limit resale , they may not eliminate resale because sellers may not follow the restriction . inconvenience . when nontransferable tickets are priced below the prevailing market price in the primary market , this creates excess demand , and tickets are sold without regard to consumers' willingness to pay . however , three government studies we reviewed stated that price caps are difficult to enforce and are rarely complied with . some government stakeholders have suggested improving fee transparency through a legal requirement to disclose ticket fees earlier in the purchase process . no federal law expressly addresses fee disclosure in event ticketing . at least one major ticket company has a program to sell tickets to pre - approved “verified fans,” to help ensure that more consumers and fewer brokers can access tickets on the primary market . the objectives of this report were to examine ( 1 ) what is known about primary and secondary online ticket sales , ( 2 ) the consumer protection concerns that exist related to online ticket sales , and ( 3 ) potential advantages and disadvantages of selected approaches to address these concerns . for each event , we analyzed: resale prices and volume , through data obtained from publicly available listings on the websites of two secondary ticket exchanges ; primary market prices and availability , through data obtained from the websites of primary market ticket sellers ; and event capacity , through data obtained from billboard or pollstar ( trade publications ) for concerts , the broadway league for theater , and espn.com ( a media company ) for sporting events . in addition , we reviewed enforcement activity by federal and state agencies related to ticketing and ticket companies . at the federal level , these included the better online ticket sales act of 2016 and relevant provisions of the federal trade commission act .
