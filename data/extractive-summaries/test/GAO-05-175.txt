in addition , the report asserted that a large portion of the campaign's budget pays for outside media and advertising consultants . the drug - free media campaign act of 1998 , 21 u.s.c . 1801 et seq. , required the office of national drug control policy to conduct a national media campaign to reduce and prevent drug abuse among america's youth . the act specified certain uses of funds provided for the media campaign to include ( 1 ) the purchase of media time and space ; ( 2 ) out - of - pocket advertising production costs ; ( 3 ) testing and evaluation of advertising ; ( 4 ) evaluation of effectiveness ; ( 5 ) partnerships with community , civic , and professional groups and with government organizations ; ( 6 ) collaboration with the entertainment industry to incorporate anti - drug messages in movies , television , internet media projects , and public information ; ( 7 ) news media outreach ; and ( 8 ) corporate sponsorship and participation , among other uses . congress has appropriated over $1 billion for ondcp's media campaign since it was initiated in 1998 . this phase also involves measuring the effectiveness of specific advertisements over time within target audiences . these contractors used funds from their contracts to secure additional specialized expertise from subcontractors . according to our analysis , an estimated $520 million was awarded to the prime contractors , of which an estimated $373 million — 72 percent — was committed to purchasing media time and space for advertisements . the remaining $147 million — 28 percent — was for the services provided by the prime contractors . our review of contractor services and contract award amounts associated with the office of national drug control policy's ( ondcp ) national youth anti - drug media campaign covered fiscal years 2002 through 2004 . to describe the services provided by contractors and their subcontractors in support of the media campaign , we analyzed the contracts of the four prime contractors and the subcontracts of the 102 subcontractors . the methods of analysis used to produce estimated award data for subcontractors for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 have many of the same limitations as the method used to analyze the prime contract award data ( i.e. , much of the subcontract award data had to be prorated and some of the subcontract award data represented estimated reimbursements ) .
