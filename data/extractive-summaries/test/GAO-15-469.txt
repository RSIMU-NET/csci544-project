we met with all current military service chiefs and vice chiefs as of september 2014 , including the chief and vice chief of staff of the air force , the chief and vice chief of staff of the army , the chief and vice chief of naval operations , and the commandant and assistant commandant of the marine corps . to assess key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our assessment of these issues , we drew upon our extensive body of work in defense acquisitions and best practices , and reviewed program execution information from all 78 ongoing major defense acquisition programs identified in annual selected acquisition reports . some key recommendations that we have made in the past to improve dod's acquisition process include the following: require that systems engineering that is needed to evaluate the sufficiency of available resources be conducted before weapon system requirements are formalized ; require , as a condition for starting a new weapon system program , that sufficient evidence exists to show there is a match between a weapon's system requirements and the resources the program manager has to develop that weapon ; require program officials to demonstrate that they have captured appropriate knowledge at program start ( milestone b ) , which includes ensuring that requirements for the product are informed by the systems engineering process , and establishing cost and schedule estimates on the basis of knowledge from preliminary design using system engineering tools ; have contractors perform more detailed systems engineering analysis to develop sound requirements before dod selects a prime contractor for the systems development contract ; and define a shipbuilding approach that calls for ( 1 ) demonstrating balance among program requirements , technology demands , and cost considerations by preliminary design review , and ( 2 ) retiring technical risk and closing any remaining gaps in design requirements before a contract for detail design is awarded . most current and former military service chiefs that we interviewed collectively expressed dissatisfaction with the current acquisition process and the outcomes it produces . they were concerned that after validated requirements are handed over to the acquisition process , requirements are frequently added or changed to increase the scope and capabilities of a weapon system . according to a number of both current and former service chiefs , they are not always involved in the acquisition process and are frequently caught by surprise when these problems emerge . however , as we found in our prior review , studies that have advocated for a stronger role for the service chiefs in the acquisition process provide several of little evidence that this would improve program outcomes.these former service chiefs advocated for changes to dod policy and statute , including the goldwater - nichols act.service chief believed that dod acquisition policy should require service chief approval on all major defense acquisition programs prior to program start . acting on the chiefs' concerns , we analyzed all 78 major defense acquisition programs and found that growth in high - level requirements — and consequent cost growth — was rare . the distinction between high - level and lower - level requirements is key . we presented our assessment of the requirements problem to current and former service chiefs and they generally agreed with it . to help ensure that requirements are well defined and well understood before a program is approved to start system development , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the military service chiefs and service acquisition executives to work together to take the following two actions: assess whether sufficient systems engineering expertise is available during the requirements development process ; and develop a better way to make sure sufficient systems engineering is conducted and opportunities exist to better define requirements and assess resource trade - offs before a program starts . we believe that dod must focus on achieving better collaboration between the requirements and acquisition communities such as by ensuring that more systems engineering and other expertise are applied when requirements are being defined . this report reviews further related issues and concerns the military service chiefs have with the department of defense's ( dod ) acquisition process and outcomes it produces . specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the views of current and former military service chiefs on the current acquisition process , and ( 2 ) key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our assessment of these issues .
