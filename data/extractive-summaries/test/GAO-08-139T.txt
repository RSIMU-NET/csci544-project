tsa has primary responsibility for security in all modes of transportation and since its inception has developed and implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure the commercial aviation system . my testimony today will focus on: ( 1 ) the progress tsa and other dhs components have made in securing the nation's commercial aviation system and ( 2 ) challenges that have impeded dhs's ( and , as they relate to transportation security , tsa ) efforts to implement its mission and management functions . my comments are based on issued gao reports and testimonies addressing the security of the nation's aviation system , including an august 2007 report that highlights the progress dhs has made in implementing its mission and management functions . the aviation and transportation security act ( atsa ) , enacted in november 2001 , created tsa and gave it responsibility for securing all modes of transportation.5 tsa's aviation security mission includes strengthening the security of airport perimeters and restricted airport areas ; hiring and training a screening workforce ; prescreening passengers against terrorist watch lists ; and screening passengers , baggage , and cargo at the over 400 commercial airports nation - wide , among other responsibilities . although tsa has taken important actions to strengthen aviation security , the agency has faced difficulties in implementing an advanced , government - run passenger prescreening program for domestic flights , and in developing and implementing technology to screen passengers at security checkpoints and cargo placed on aircraft , among other areas . specifically , we found that dhs has generally achieved 17 performance expectations and has generally not achieved 7 performance expectations . regarding procedures for implementing biometric identification systems , we reported that tsa had not developed a plan for implementing new technologies to meet the security needs of individual airports and the commercial airport system as a whole . aviation security workforce . among other efforts , in december 2005 , tsa reported completing enhanced explosives detection training for over 18,000 tsos , and increased its use of covert testing to assess vulnerabilities of existing screening systems . checked baggage screening . the installation of in - line baggage screening systems continues to be an issue of congressional concern . air cargo security . while it is important that dhs continue to work to strengthen each of its mission and core management functions , to include aviation security , it is equally important that these key issues be addressed from a comprehensive , department - wide perspective to help ensure that the department has the structure and processes in place to effectively address the threats and vulnerabilities that face the nation . dhs has also not fully adopted and applied a risk management approach in implementing its mission and core management functions . in addition to providing federal leadership with respect to homeland security , dhs also plays a large role in coordinating the activities of key stakeholders , but has faced challenges in this regard .
