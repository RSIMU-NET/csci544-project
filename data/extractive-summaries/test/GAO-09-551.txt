in december 2003 , we reported that most of alaska's more than 200 native villages were affected to some degree by flooding and erosion , most commonly caused by severe storm events on alaska's coastline or by river flooding , such as during the spring breakup of river ice . since 2003 , state officials have identified the growing impacts of climate change in alaska — which include melting polar ice , increasing storm intensity , and coastal flooding — increasing the urgency of federal and state efforts to identify imminently threatened villages and assess their relocation options . specifically , we are reporting on ( 1 ) the flooding and erosion threats that alaska native villages currently face , ( 2 ) the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , ( 3 ) the status of village relocation efforts , and ( 4 ) how federal assistance to relocating villages is prioritized . while the flooding and erosion threats to alaska native villages have not been completely assessed , a growing number of imminently threatened villages have been identified , and some have decided to relocate or are exploring relocation options . according to federal , state , and village officials , at least 12 of the 31 imminently threatened villages have decided to relocate — in part or entirely — or to explore relocation options . other federal agencies have individual programs , but there is no single comprehensive proactive federal program to assist villages with their relocation efforts . few federal disaster declarations for flooding and erosion problems: eligibility for fema's two disaster recovery programs and the hazard mitigation grant program is generally limited to areas that have been declared federal disasters , but since many of the villages are facing gradual erosion problems and have not received a declared disaster designation , they do not qualify for these programs . “notwithstanding any other provisions of law , the secretary of the army is authorized to carry out , at full federal expense , structural and non - structural projects for storm damage prevention and reduction , coastal erosion , and ice and glacial damage in alaska , including relocation of affected communities and construction of replacement facilities.” despite this new authority , which was subsequently repealed in march 2009 , the corps' role in village relocation efforts has generally remained unchanged since our 2003 report and has been limited to evaluating potential relocation sites for kivalina , koyukuk , and shishmaref and to designing an evacuation center and road for newtok . in may 2006 , representatives from state , federal , and nongovernmental organizations formed the newtok planning group . the corps issued an environmental assessment that found no significant impacts in july 2008 . specifically , none of these villages have yet identified relocation sites that federal , state , and village officials agree are safe , sustainable , and desirable for the subsistence lifestyle of the villagers ( see table 5 ) . eight of the threatened villages are gradually migrating to a new location over time or considering doing so , although the extent of progress among the villages varies . in the absence of a lead entity , federal agencies individually prioritize assistance to villages on the basis of their programs' criteria , which do not necessarily ensure that the villages in the greatest peril get the highest priority for assistance . the lack of a lead federal entity has impeded village relocation efforts , including the fulfillment of the environmental analysis requirements under nepa . village needs: nrcs prioritizes emergency watershed protection program funding on the basis of a damage survey to determine the village need for assistance ; fema's hazard mitigation grant program provides assistance only if an effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments with a federal disaster declaration ; and hud's imminent threats grants program prioritizes funding for housing assistance to villages with imminent threats to health or safety . because of the concerns raised by the newtok planning group regarding the lack of federal and state lead agencies , the state designated dcced as the lead state coordinating agency for all village relocation assistance in 2008 . to address these concerns , a lead federal entity could identify the most threatened villages , prioritize federal investments and provide guidance to other agencies , assist congress on new legislation or revisions to existing law that could benefit relocating villages , and be the go - to agency to assist and guide villages throughout the relocation process . because the corps' alaska baseline erosion assessment did not consider flooding , the status of the threat to many villages cannot be properly taken into account by federal and state officials when planning and prioritizing assistance to villages , thereby creating the potential that villages may not receive the assistance they need due to a lack of complete information for decision makers .
