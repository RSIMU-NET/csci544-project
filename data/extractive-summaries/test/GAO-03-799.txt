ins's procurement organization will continue to acquire goods and services under dhs . specifically , we assessed whether ins has an adequate infrastructure — including oversight , information , and workforce — to manage its acquisitions . in addition , you asked us to determine whether ins is following sound contracting policies and procedures in awarding and managing individual contracts . it is now in the process of being incorporated into dhs . dhs officials are currently assessing the incoming agencies' ( 1 ) major procurements to determine whether duplication exists and to identify ways of maximizing the dhs's purchasing power by consolidating like procurements where feasible ; ( 2 ) procurement and financial systems to determine whether any of the existing systems are adequate to meet the department's future needs ; and ( 3 ) acquisition workforce to identify gaps and the need for dhs - specific training requirements . ins does not have in place a basic infrastructure to effectively manage its contracts . further , ins's acquisition workforce is not adequate to manage the agency's increased mission requirements . in fact , in some cases , the relationship has been adversarial . ins managers are unable to make strategic procurement decisions because they do not have sufficient information about the goods and services being procured across the agency and who their major vendors are . further , ins did not consistently monitor contractor performance on many of the contracts we reviewed , meaning that ins could not be assured that it received the goods and services it paid for or that the contractors met the quality standards in the contract . when agencies fail to adequately plan for acquisitions , they risk limiting the opportunity for full and open competition and receiving inadequate goods and services at a higher cost . its acquisition workforce is struggling to effectively manage the large and mission - critical procurements for which it is responsible . the creation of dhs brings an opportunity to address these problems . to improve the effectiveness of the procurement function , we recommend that the under secretary for management ensure that cross - functional acquisition teams , consisting of program , procurement , legal , budget , and financial officials , effectively collaborate in planning and administering contracts ; create and review meaningful procurement performance measures and indicators to ensure that management directives are carried out by the large number of field activities in the department ; and as part of its assessment of existing information systems coming into the department , determine what procurement and financial information must be gathered to obtain strategic knowledge of spending behavior across the department . to ensure that the department's contracts are well - managed , we recommend that the under secretary for management develop a system for tracking the status of current detention facility contracts so that contracting officers and program managers are automatically alerted to begin the planning process at least two years before a new contract has to be awarded ; and implement ways of holding designated cotrs responsible for monitoring , reporting , and documenting contractor performance ( e.g. , require them to report on a regular basis to the contracting officer ) . was full and open competition used ? .
