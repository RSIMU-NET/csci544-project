concerned about the progress made to implement performance - based contracting at the national laboratories , you asked us to assess the status of performance - based contracting in doe's national laboratory contracts , and identify efforts being made to determine the impact of performance - based contracting . doe's implementation of performance - based contracting for its laboratories is in a state of transition . also , doe has negotiated performance fees in only 9 of its 18 laboratory contracts because the remaining laboratories are still operating under doe's traditional approach in which fees are not linked to performance . the number of performance measures . in commenting on a draft of this report , doe said that by the end of calendar year 1999 , the majority of laboratory contracts that provide fees will have performance - based fee structures . as a result , it has not determined whether performance - based contracting is achieving the intended objectives of reducing costs and improving performance . moreover , the fees doe negotiates are based on its best judgment of what is needed to motivate contractors and to compensate them for increased risk , but doe's evidence is based primarily on non - laboratory contractors , and doe has not quantified the value of the increased risk assumed by contractors under performance - based conditions . because doe does not know whether performance - based contracting is improving performance at lower cost at its national laboratories and because our previous recommendation to develop criteria for measuring the costs and benefits of paying fees to contractors for incurring increased financial risk was not implemented , we recommend that the secretary of energy evaluate the costs and benefits from using performance - based contracting at the national laboratories . doe also commented that the variability we found in performance - based laboratory contracts reflects many different factors , including differences in the scope of work , the type of contractor , and the experiences the laboratories have with performance - based contracting features . doe plans the new contract to be a fixed - fee arrangement .
