dod uses private sector contractors to develop and maintain the health care provider networks that make up tricare's purchased care system , which complements the health care provided by the u.s. military's health care system â€” a direct care system of military treatment facilities . as of october 1 , 2013 , dod's defense health agency ( dha ) is responsible for awarding , administering , and overseeing tricare's managed care support contracts ( mcsc ) . dod's health care costs have more than doubled from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to its fiscal year 2014 budget request of $49.4 billion . senate report 112-173 , which accompanied the senate committee on armed services' version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 , mandated that gao conduct a comprehensive review of dod's health care contracts and acquisition process . the report raised concerns regarding the growth in dod's health care costs and identified health care contracts with private sector companies under its tricare program as an area for potential savings and efficiencies . in this report we examine: ( 1 ) tma's acquisition process to award tricare's third generation mcscs ; ( 2 ) the extent to which issues were raised in the bid protests involving tricare's third generation mcscs , including the identification of any common themes ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned , if any , from the acquisition of tricare's third generation mcscs and how , if at all , dha plans to use these lessons in future contracting activities . to describe tma's acquisition process for awarding tricare's third generation mcscs , we reviewed relevant statutes and federal regulations , including the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) and defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) .obtained and reviewed dod and tricare policy documents as well as contract documentation specific to tricare's third generation mcsc acquisition process . in addition , we interviewed tricare acquisition officials about the process used to acquire services through these mcscs . four offerors filed five separate bid protests with gao , and one offeror filed an agency - level protest with tma . tricare acquisition officials reported they have identified several areas where changes could be made to improve the acquisition process for future tricare mcsc acquisitions , including those scheduled to be awarded in 2018 . according to tricare acquisition officials , preliminary lessons learned from the third generation acquisition process and resulting bid protests include ( 1 ) improvements in communication and documentation to increase transparency during the evaluation of the proposals and ( 2 ) increases to the length of the acquisition process to allow for additional time to evaluate proposals and for the transition from one mcsc to another . despite the implementation of lessons learned from tricare's third generation acquisition process and the related bid protests , tricare acquisition officials told us that they cannot confirm which , if any , of these lessons will be incorporated into the acquisition process for tricare's fourth generation mcscs scheduled for 2018 . we requested comments from dod , but none were provided . out of the six bid protests filed across the three tricare regions , two protests were sustained by gao , one protest was sustained by the tricare management activity ( tma ) , and the remaining three protests were denied by gao . in response to decisions and recommendations made in the sustained bid protest decisions , tma implemented corrective actions that resulted in new award decisions in each of the three tricare regions.subsequent bid protest challenges that were filed in two of the three tricare regions , the south and the west . in some protests , unsuccessful offerors raised issues that went beyond the evaluation of proposals . other . price / cost . tma then reviewed the revised proposals and , based on this evaluation of revised proposals , awarded the contract to humana , a different offeror than was initially awarded the contract .
