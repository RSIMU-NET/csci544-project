the title i - a program of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act ( nclb ; p.l . 107-110 ) , is the largest source of federal funding for elementary and secondary education . states that receive title i - a funding must comply with certain requirements related to measuring and evaluating student achievement . the primary purpose of this report is to explore issues related to the cost of assessments and to provide an understanding of the factors that influence the overall cost of assessment systems . as congress considers the reauthorization of the esea , it is likely that the standards and assessment provisions within title i - a will be reviewed and debated . state assessments are currently the primary policy tool used to measure whether schools , leas , and states are meeting certain academic targets . as such , the effectiveness of federal policy is dependent upon a valid state assessment system . designing an assessment system requires states to consider certain tradeoffs in order to meet the requirements of the nclb while meeting state requirements and containing costs . decisions made in the design of a state assessment system have direct implications for the validity of the nclb accountability system and direct consequences forÂ schools . the third section provides a discussion of factors that influence the overall cost of student assessment within state assessment systems , which include assessment development , scoring and administration , policy choices , and implementation practices . it focuses on assessment development , scoring , policy choices , and implementation practices . the federal government could , however , develop policies that promote quality and efficiency in state assessment systems . efficiencies may also require balancing state independence with promoting state consortia in order to realize economies of scale . another option that has been proposed to reduce scoring costs is using teachers to score assessments . to accommodate the increase in human scoring , states may need an extended window of time to score assessments . ultimately , decisions regarding the type of state assessments that meet the requirements of title i may be determined by congress during the next reauthorization of the esea . as technology becomes less expensive , online delivery of state assessments may lower the cost of state assessment systems . some technological glitches have already occurred in virginia . under the grants for state assessments program , statutory provisions specify that the secretary shall make grants to states for the following purposes: to pay the costs of the development of the additional state assessments and standards required by section 1111 ( b ) of the nclb , which may include the costs of working voluntary partnerships with other states , at the sole discretion of each state ; and if a state has developed the assessments and standards required by section 1111 ( b ) of the nclb , to administer assessments or carry out other activities related to ensuring that the state's schools and leas are held accountable for the results .
