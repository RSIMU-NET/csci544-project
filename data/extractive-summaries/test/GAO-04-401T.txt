during the 10 years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2001 , flooding resulted in about $55 billion in damages and about 900 deaths . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is the primary federal agency responsible for assisting state and local governments , private entities , and individuals to prepare for , mitigate , respond to , and recover from natural disasters , including floods . i will provide a perspective on ( 1 ) fema's approach to mitigating flood - related losses through the flood insurance program and other grant programs , ( 2 ) the effect of repetitive loss properties on the flood insurance program , and ( 3 ) recent actions taken or proposed to address the impact of repetitive loss properties on the program by fema and the congress . through the flood insurance program , fema identifies and maps flood prone communities and makes insurance available to property owners in communities that agree to adopt and enforce building standards to mitigate the impact of floods . fema also provides funding for mitigation planning activities and projects before and after floods occur through various mitigation grant programs . repetitive loss properties represent a significant portion of annual flood insurance claims . while repetitive loss properties represent only about 1 percent of the current 4.4 million properties insured by the program , they have accounted for about 38 percent of all program claim costs historically and are projected by fema to cost about $200 million annually . since 1978 , the total cost of these repetitive loss properties to the program has been about $4.6 billion . recent federal actions to reduce program claims related to repetitive loss properties include fema's strategy to target the most frequent and costly repetitive loss properties for mitigation and congressional proposals to phase out coverage or begin charging full and actuarially based rates for repetitive loss property owners who refuse to accept fema's offer to purchase or mitigate the affected buildings . floods continue to be the most destructive natural hazard in terms of damage and economic loss to the nation . the program has paid about $12 billion in insurance claims , primarily from policyholder premiums that otherwise would have been paid through taxpayer - funded disaster relief or borne by home and business owners themselves . for example , in texas , since 1978 there have been approximately 45,000 flood claims totaling over $1 billion for repetitive damage . 253 , based on a preliminary assessment , they appear to have the potential to reduce the number and / or vulnerability of repetitive loss properties and , thereby , the potential to help improve the program's financial condition . 253 on these properties .
