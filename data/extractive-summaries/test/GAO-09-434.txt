considering epa's evolving roles and responsibilities , we were asked to identify the major management challenges and program risks that epa faces as it works to accomplish its mission of protecting human health and the environment . these challenges include ( 1 ) improving agencywide management , ( 2 ) transforming epa's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals , ( 3 ) improving implementation of the clean air act , ( 4 ) reducing pollution in the nation's waters , ( 5 ) speeding the pace of cleanup at superfund and other hazardous waste sites , and ( 6 ) addressing emerging climate change issues . our past work has identified several major management challenges at epa , including ensuring consistent environmental enforcement and compliance , addressing human capital issues , and improving the development and use of environmental information . epa's ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment depends on credible and timely assessment of the risks posed by toxic chemicals . created in 1985 to provide epa with consensus opinions within the agency on the health effects of chronic exposure to chemicals , the iris database provides the basic information epa needs to determine whether it should establish controls , for example , to protect the public from exposure to toxic chemicals in the air and water and at hazardous waste sites . because of the importance of this issue , and the lack of progress in implementing much - needed change to tsca , in january 2009 we added transforming epa's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals to our list of high - risk areas needing added attention by congress and the executive branch . epa also faces a number of challenges related to clean air regulatory decisions that have been vacated or remanded to the agency by the courts . these include regulatory proposals or agency decisions related to ( 1 ) mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants ; ( 2 ) long - range transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — pollutants that contribute to acid rain and other air quality problems — emitted by power plants ; ( 3 ) the new source review program , a permitting program that among other goals seeks to prevent air quality degradation from the addition of new and modified factories , industrial boilers , and power plants ; and ( 4 ) whether epa and the states can use existing authority under the clean air act to regulate greenhouse gases . epa partners with federal , state , and local agencies , as well as nongovernmental organizations , to develop and implement approaches that can reduce pollution in our nation's significant water bodies . in addition , in coming years among the most daunting water pollution control problems will be those faced by the nation's water utilities in grappling with the multibillion - dollar costs of upgrading aging and deteriorating infrastructures and building new ones to serve a growing population . of note , epa will receive $6 billion in additional water infrastructure funding from the recently passed stimulus bill . furthermore , citing competing priorities and lack of funds , epa has not implemented a 1980 statutory mandate under superfund to require businesses handling hazardous substances to demonstrate their ability to pay for potential environmental cleanups — that is , to provide financial assurances . we have previously reported that the federal government's approach to climate change has been ad hoc , not comprehensive , and not well coordinated across government agencies . specifically , the federal government lacks a comprehensive approach for targeting federal research dollars at the development and deployment of low - carbon technologies . epa's mission is , without question , a difficult one: its policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy , society , and government , and it is in the unenviable position of enforcing myriad inherently controversial environmental laws and maintaining a delicate balance between the benefits to public health and the environment with the cost to industry and others .
