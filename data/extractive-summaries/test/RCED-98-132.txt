agencies' audits of extramural ( external ) r&d budgets . the number of multiple - award recipients and the extent of their project - related activity after receiving sbir funding . the occurrence of funding for single - proposal awards . the geographical distribution of sbir awards . the agencies' sbir officials reported that they have adhered to the act's requirements that they not use sbir funds to pay for the administrative costs of the program , such as salaries and expenses for support services used in processing awards . however , they added that the funding restriction has limited their ability to provide some needed administrative support . both nsf and nasa audited their extramural r&d budgets in fiscal year 1997 . nsf estimated that these unallowable costs totaled over $100 million . the sbir officials we interviewed felt that neither the application review process nor the current funding cycles are having an adverse effect on award recipients' financial status or their ability to commercialize their projects . while the effects of the review processes and funding cycles on the recipients' financial status and ability to commercialize projects were not specifically mentioned as problems , sbir officials did state that some recipients had said that any interruption in funding awards , for whatever reason , affects them negatively . the respondents indicated that 442 awards , or 32 percent , had resulted in actual sales , while 588 reported that the awards had resulted in additional developmental funding . according to both surveys , however , multiple - award recipients receive additional developmental funding at rates higher than those of the non - multiple - award recipients . all of the agencies we reviewed reported participating in activities targeted at women - owned or socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses . the other agencies believe that the research being conducted falls within one of the two lists . according to our 1991 survey and dod's 1996 survey , sbir projects result in little business - related activity with foreign firms . sbir program officials have said that they are uncertain whether the agencies are correctly adhering to the requirements for establishing their extramural research budgets . public law 102-564 , dated october 28 , 1992 , mandated that the comptroller general of the united states provide the congress with a report on the small business innovation research program that containing the following: ( 1 ) a review of the progress made by federal agencies in meeting the requirements of section 9 ( f ) of the small business act ( as amended by this act ) , including increases in expenditures required by that subsection ;
