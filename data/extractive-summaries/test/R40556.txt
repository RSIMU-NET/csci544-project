proposals in the u.s. congress have generally focused on market - based approaches , but some proposals have included a mix of market and non - market strategies . to some extent , a carbon tax and a cap - and - trade program would produce similar effects: both are estimated to increase the price of fossil fuels , which would ultimately be borne by consumers , particularly households . although members have introduced and debated ghg emission control proposals — both cap - and - trade and carbon tax programs — in previous congresses , the obama administration's stated commitment to ghg emission reduction has spurred interest in developing a workable program . this report focuses on these legislative proposals . h.r . 2454 , introduced may 15 , 2009 , by representatives waxman and markey , passed the house on june 26 , 2009 . 2454 would distribute allowances to both covered and non - covered entities at no cost to support various policy objectives . as with the distribution of no - cost allowances , auction revenues would be used to further various policy objectives . 2454 , s. 1733 would establish an economy - wide ghg cap - and - trade program , while addressing other energy - related matters through numerous energy policy provisions . although the similarities outweigh the differences , six key distinctions include the following: ( 1 ) the senate bill has a more stringent emissions cap between 2017 and 2029 ; ( 2 ) the two bills allocate emissions allowances and auction revenue to different recipients at different levels ; ( 3 ) the bills would treat offsets differently ; ( 4 ) the house bill would establish extensive carbon market regulation ( the senate bill currently has a placeholder for this topic ) ; ( 5 ) the house bill would establish a requirement that importers purchase special emission allowances for certain imports from countries without greenhouse gas controls ( the senate bill currently has a placeholder for this topic ) ; and ( 6 ) both bills would limit epa's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the clean air act , although in different ways . in order to mitigate price volatility in the early years of the program , the bill would establish a climate program oversight and coordination board to set targets for allowance prices and manage quarterly auctions to maintain a smooth allowance price path . the approach may be described as a dynamic carbon - content tax . producers and importers of ghg emission substances — fossil fuels and other ghg emission inputs — would be required to purchase emission permits for each ton of emissions that would occur from the combustion or use of the ghg emission substance . the president would limit ( or cap ) the quantity of carbon shares available for submission each year , and the department of treasury would distribute all of the carbon shares through monthly auctions . offsets would not be allowed for compliance purposes ; however , if the price ceiling is reached during an auction — the possibility of which would be increased by not allowing offsets — revenues from the additional carbon shares would be used exclusively on domestic mitigation activities , including offset - like projects from agriculture and forestry sectors . on may 12 , 2010 , senators kerry and lieberman released a draft of new climate change legislation . a comprehensive energy and climate change policy proposal , the draft would set ghg reduction goals similar to those of h.r . employing a market - based cap - and - trade scheme for electric generators and industry with a separate set - price mechanism to allocate allowances to cover transportation fuels , the proposal allocates a substantial percentage of the allowances created for the benefit of energy consumers and low - income households . on november 5 , the committee approved senator boxer's "manager's amendment" as a substitute , and ordered s. 1733 reported .
