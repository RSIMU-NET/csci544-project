interested in the increased revenues that would result from the proposed regulations , as well as the oil industry's opposition to them , you asked us to address the following: ( 1 ) the information used by mms to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations ; ( 2 ) how mms has addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing these regulations ; and ( 3 ) the feasibility of the federal government's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , as indicated by existing studies and programs . the task force concluded that posted prices were inappropriately used for this purpose and recommended that mms revise its oil valuation regulations . the company also agreed that it would subsequently value oil from state leases on the basis of nymex futures prices . from december 1995 through june 1998 , in five federal register notices and in 14 meetings throughout the country , mms solicited public comments on its proposal to change the way oil from federal leases is valued for royalty purposes , and it has revised the proposed regulations three times in response to the comments received . in total , mms solicited comments on 39 major issues and received 183 letters in response . mms has received 34 letters on its most recent revision of the proposed regulations but has not yet publicly addressed these comments . mms solicited comments on seven major issues and received 25 letters . however , these conditions do not exist for the federal government or for most federal leases: the federal government does not currently have relatively easy access to pipelines , has thousands of leases that produce relatively low volumes , has many gas leases for which competitive processing arrangements do not exist , and has limited experience in oil or gas marketing . to determine what information mms used to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations , we reviewed mms' reasons for proposing new regulations as published in federal register notices and read all of the comments submitted in response to the first notice that solicited information on oil marketing and the relevance of posted prices . to determine what existing studies and programs indicate about the feasibility of the federal government's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , we ( 1 ) identified and read two studies — a 1997 study by mms of the feasibility of royalties in kind and a 1997 analysis by the congressional research service on the oil royalty - in - kind program run by the canadian province of alberta — and interviewed their authors and ( 2 ) identified nine royalty - in - kind programs that are currently in operation and interviewed representatives of these programs: the seven oil royalty - in - kind programs operated by mms , the canadian province of alberta , the city of long beach , the university of texas , and the states of alaska , california , and texas ; and the two gas royalty - in - kind programs operated by texas and the university of texas .
