as a result of our earlier work on interagency coordination in apprehending federal fugitives , we noted that many entries in the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center's ( ncic ) wanted person file were made long after issuance of the arrest warrants.this was generally contrary to the stated policies of the agencies that made the entries and the generally accepted view of ncic officials , the international association of chiefs of police , and others that timely use of the file facilitates apprehension and reduces risks to law enforcement personnel and the general public . on our own initiative , we conducted a follow - up review to identify ( 1 ) how long federal agencies took to enter fugitives onto the wanted person file ; ( 2 ) what information the agencies had on entry times and the means used to monitor entry times ; and ( 3 ) what actions agencies took , considered , or could take to reduce any entry delays . fbi , usms , and atf policies for entering fugitives onto the wanted person file required entry shortly after the arrest warrant , notice of escape , or other document authorizing detention was issued: the fbi and usms required immediate entry , meaning within 24 hours ; atf allowed up to 10 days for entry if the delay served a law enforcement purpose . customs service policy called for entry after reasonable efforts to locate the fugitive had failed and essentially defined “reasonable” as being after all investigative leads on the fugitive's location have been exhausted . for example , 41 percent were entered within 2 days and 61 percent within 1 week . but , it noted that a customs service headquarters official contacted the communications center about taking corrective action . usms officials said they would review their entry times . we focused on the fbi , ins , usms , atf , and the customs service .
