the united states has seen continued growth of electronic card payments ( and a simultaneous decrease in check payments ) . from 2009 through 2012 , debit card transactions have outpaced other payment forms . the interchange fee is paid to the consumer's bank that issued the debit card , covering the bank's costs to facilitate the transaction . section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010 ( title x of p.l . 111-203 , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ) , known as the durbin amendment , authorizes the federal reserve board to mandate regulations to ensure that any interchange transaction fee received by a debit card issuer is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer . the durbin amendment allows the federal reserve to consider the authorization , clearance , and settlement costs of each transaction when setting the interchange fee . by statute , debit card issuers with less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from the regulation , which means that smaller financial institutions may receive a larger interchange fee than larger issuers . the durbin amendment also prohibits network providers ( visa , mastercard , etc. ) . and debit card issuers from imposing restrictions that would override a merchant's choice of the network provider through which to route transactions . on june 29 , 2011 , the federal reserve issued a final rule implementing the durbin amendment by regulation ii , which includes a cap on the interchange fee for large issuers . the final rule went into effect on october 1 , 2011 . h.r . 10 , the financial choice act of 2017 , would repeal the durbin amendment . specifically , section 735 of the financial choice act would repeal section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010 . on may 4 , 2017 , h.r . 10 was ordered to be reported by the house financial services committee . on june 29 , 2011 , the federal reserve issued regulation ii , a final rule , which capped the interchange fee received by large issuers ( with $10 billion or more in assets ) to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction . the federal reserve also allowed for a 1 cent adjustment if the issuer implements fraud - prevention standards . regulation ii does not regulate the merchant discount fee charged to the merchant by the network provider or acquirer ; it only limits the amount of the merchant discount fee that can be remitted in the form of interchange fee revenue t o covered institutions . economists have questioned the sustainability of a two - tiered interchange pricing system over time . in other words , lower revenues that would have been anticipated in light of the interchange fee cap may have been offset by a rise in the quantity of debit transactions as the economy continued its recovery from the 2007-2009 recession .
