section 125 of the uruguay round agreements act ( p.l . 103-465 ) , which is the law that approved and implemented the agreements reached during the uruguay round , provided that the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) must submit to the congress every five years a report that analyzes the costs and benefits of continued u.s. participation in the wto . once congress receives this comprehensive report , any member of congress may introduce a privileged joint resolution withdrawing congressional approval of the wto agreement within 90 days . in addition to possibly considering a withdrawal resolution , the 111 th congress has monitored wto disputes involving u.s. interests and u.s. laws , china's implementation of its wto commitments , and u.s. participation in the doha development agenda , the latest round of multilateral trade negotiations . most observers maintain that u.s. withdrawal from the wto is at best highly unlikely for both substantive and procedural reasons . substantively , the withdrawal of u.s. participation could undermine a multilateral system of trade rules and practices , formulated and implemented under u.s. leadership , that on balance has contributed to increased economic prosperity and security at home and abroad . the reasons for the disapproval provision are explained by the house ways and means committee as follows: the purpose of this provision is to provide an opportunity for the congress to evaluate the transition of the gatt to the wto and to assess periodically whether continued membership in this organization is in the best interest of the united states . the purpose of this report is to analyze some of the main issues in the debate on u.s. participation in the wto and to address some of the criticisms leveled at the organization . following world war ii , nations throughout the world , led by the united states and several other developed countries , sought to establish an open and non - discriminatory trading system with the goal of raising the economic well - being of all countries . unable to secure approval for such a comprehensive agreement , however , they reached a provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules , called the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) . do the most frequently made criticisms of the wto and trade agreements have merit ? . nonetheless , most economists argue that increased trade will have a net positive effect on economies . however , some labor , particularly unskilled labor , likely has lost out from free trade . procedures are clearly set out with specific timetables at each stage . the legislation expresses the sense of congress that the wto appellate body does not have the authority to establish new legal standards that a dispute settlement panel must apply in deciding cases , and that "a dispute settlement panel is obligated to follow the text of an agreement negotiated by the wto members themselves , and not the 'jurisprudence' of the wto appellate body" ( sec . in the debate on u.s. participation in the wto , some advocates for the environment , food safety , labor , development , and financial regulation have been extremely vocal in their criticisms of the wto . this is because a withdrawal resolution would have to pass both the house and senate and then surmount a likely presidential veto via an override with a two - thirds majority vote . the influence and the cohesiveness of the wto as an organization would also be adversely affected as both a forum for settling disputes and for negotiating multilateral trade rules . 2535 ) , beginning with march 1 , 2000 , and every five years thereafter , such report , transmitted by the president , must "include an analysis of the effects of the wto agreement on the interests of the united states , the costs and benefits to the united states of its participation in the wto , and the value of the continued participation of the united states in the wto. .  ( this procedure makes it clear that a resolution of withdrawal cannot be adopted unless it is a house joint resolution. ) .
