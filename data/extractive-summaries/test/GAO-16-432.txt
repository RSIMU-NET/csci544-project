further , the institute of medicine , following a series of reports and workshops identifying gaps between the science of medical product technologies and fda's capacity to regulate those technologies , held a workshop in 2011 on fda's critical role in the area of regulatory science — which is defined by fda as the science of developing new tools , standards , and approaches to assess the safety , efficacy , quality , and performance of all fda - regulated products . this report 1. evaluates fda's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities for medical products , 2. describes fda's funding targeted at regulatory science projects related to medical products , and 3. describes the achievements of selected fda regulatory science projects related to medical products . to evaluate fda's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities for medical products , we analyzed fda documents , including its 2011 and 2013 strategic planning documents , its reports on strategic priorities , and a 2015 progress report . we also interviewed fda officials about how they collected information on and assessed progress within the priority areas they identified . to describe fda's funding targeted at regulatory science projects related to medical products , we analyzed available fda data on funding for grants or other awards ( referred to as “projects” ) targeting regulatory science from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 and interviewed fda officials about these projects . in addition , other offices support the regulatory mission of fda , such as the office of international programs ( oip ) in the office of global regulatory operations and policy , and those under the office of the chief scientist — whose mission is to provide strategic leadership , coordination and expertise — including the national center for toxicological research ( nctr ) , the office of counterterrorism and emerging threats ( ocet ) , the office of minority health ( omh ) , the office of regulatory science and innovation ( orsi ) , and the office of women's health ( owh ) . fda's 2011 and 2013 strategic planning documents do not identify measurable goals , such as targets and time frames , for assessing progress in regulatory science . however , the document neither sets any targets or time frames , nor establishes further outcome - based measures for what fda hopes to achieve for either a given priority area or regulatory science in general . for example , while fda reported one or more related fda priority area for each guidance document included in the progress report , it did not provide the same information for the reported training examples or the projects included in the drug development tool qualification programs . one of the centers that targets funding at regulatory science has a plan to track the progress of its regulatory science activities , but this plan does not include measurable goals that could be used to assess progress . all six had to retrospectively identify associated fda priority areas for our review . standards for internal control in the federal government state that complete and accurate data are needed to make operating decisions and to allocate resources . in addition , to ensure program goals are met , our work encourages agencies to manage efforts that cut across the agency . dissemination of project findings . for 12 selected projects , fda reported that the projects resulted in new information about the topic that fda was using or considering using for future work . other internal impacts were related to changes in agency practices . external impacts . such goals are a best practice for strategic planning and could enable fda to assess and report its progress in addressing its identified priority areas and strategically plan and allocate resources for its broader regulatory science initiative . hhs also concurred with our recommendation to systematically track funding across fda's regulatory science priority areas , and the department identified recent and planned activities of specific centers to improve such tracking we support these efforts and reiterate the importance of fda systematically track funds agency - wide for each of the priority areas it developed . we examined the achievements related to regulatory science for 17 projects funded by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
