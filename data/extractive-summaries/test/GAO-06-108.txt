the centerpiece of this legislation is the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , under which states receive federal funds to design and operate their own welfare programs within federal guidelines . while many former welfare recipients now rely more on their own earnings than on welfare , they often work at low - wage jobs , sometimes with limited benefits and few opportunities for advancement . as agreed with your offices , we are providing information on: ( 1 ) examples of strategies being used to help tanf recipients increase their incomes through employment ; ( 2 ) the key factors related to implementing and operating such strategies ; and ( 3 ) the actions hhs has taken to facilitate the use of these strategies . based on our interviews with experts and our site visits , we identified four strategies used to help tanf clients find well - paying jobs and improve their financial condition: training , post - secondary education , self - employment , and financial asset building . typically , the programs we visited were run by non - profit organizations providing services to tanf clients either under contract with a tanf agency or using a mix of public and private funding sources . in addition to core services , local non - profits and tanf agencies either directly provided or helped link clients to services such as child care , housing , and on - the - job support . as part of the broader network , local non - profit programs and tanf offices often forged partnerships with local employers to open up job opportunities for their clients . hhs is engaging in several research projects focused on helping tanf clients and other low - income individuals find higher - wage employment and build their assets . for example , research could help identify ( 1 ) more information on specific education and training strategies that work and what the key program elements are that lead to success and that can be replicated ; ( 2 ) ways to incorporate education and training strategies into the lives of low - income individuals , whether as part of a welfare - to work program or in combination with part - or full - time work ; ( 3 ) which strategies work best for those with varying skill levels , including how best to target educational and training skills to specific job needs , particularly for those who may not succeed in a classroom setting ; and ( 4 ) which service delivery approaches are the most effective and cost - efficient , including understanding more about the most appropriate provider or access point , such as the welfare , educational , or employment and training systems or some combination of these . in addition to the tanf grant — one of the most significant and likely sources of funding for welfare programs — the agency also offers two smaller grant programs that directly support the employment and asset - building strategies discussed in this report . while hhs has provided some technical assistance to facilitate use of these strategies , the overall emphasis of welfare reform on work rather than education and training is sometimes perceived by programs as a barrier to implementing these strategies for tanf recipients . beyond hhs , a number of other federal agencies also provided research , technical assistance and targeted grants in support of grants designed to help tanf clients and other low - income individuals achieve higher - wage employment and build financial assets , sometimes in conjunction with hhs . this has carved out an important role for the broader workforce development and educational network — local non - profit programs , employers , community colleges , and other organizations . because of these factors , hhs officials may find it increasingly challenging to gather and disseminate information on promising practices or to provide technical assistance for local programs wishing to implement these promising strategies . we disagree .
