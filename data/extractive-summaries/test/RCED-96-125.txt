lenders and developers are wary of investing in such contaminated property because , under the environmental laws , they could be held liable for cleaning up the contamination . to help you evaluate whether these provisions in s. 1285 would encourage redeveloping the brownfields in the nation's cities , you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) what the universe of potential brownfield sites nationwide is , ( 2 ) what legal barriers superfund presents for redeveloping brownfields , and ( 3 ) whether the proposed loans to local governments are likely to be sufficient for conducting site assessments . the abandoned or idled industrial sites that could be classified as brownfields probably number in the tens of thousands , totaling hundreds of thousands of acres , but no official nationwide count exists . to lower the barriers to brownfield redevelopment , s. 1285 would limit the liability of lenders and such property purchasers as developers under certain conditions and also would provide assistance for the state programs that encourage the voluntary cleanup of hazardous waste sites . the congress and epa have already taken some steps to limit lenders' liability . under cercla , a party ( such as a bank ) that holds the evidence of ownership ( such as a mortgage ) in the property to protect its interest , and does not participate in the management of the property , is not considered a property owner . these programs often provide liability relief from the states' hazardous waste laws to developers or property owners that volunteer to clean up contaminated sites . also , it may still be difficult for some of these urban industrial sites to compete with greenfields even if they are not contaminated . before brownfields can be redeveloped , it is necessary to perform a site assessment to determine the nature and extent of the contamination present .
