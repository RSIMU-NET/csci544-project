almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy . many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty . justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is "a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education," noting that "[t]he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body. . in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . restoring a degree of clarity to the law , the supreme court concluded its 2002 term with rulings in the michigan cases . in grutter v. bollinger , a 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the law school had a compelling interest in the "educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body," which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble a "critical mass" of underrepresented minority students . but in a companion decision , gratz v. bollinger , six justices decided that the university's policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny . however , the grutter and gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting . to resolve this question , the court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools . 1 , a consolidated 2007 ruling that resolved both cases , the court ultimately struck down the school plans at issue , holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment . more recently , the court's decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education . in its 2013 ruling in fisher v. university of texas at austin , the court reaffirmed its holding in grutter , but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate court's decision to uphold a race - conscious undergraduate admissions plan at the university of texas at austin . however , on remand , the appellate court upheld the university's admissions program for a second time , a decision that appeared to prompt the court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term . meanwhile , in 2014's schuette v. coalition to defend affirmative action , the court upheld michigan's proposal 2 , which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education . although the court's decision to strike down the seattle and louisville school assignment and transfer plans likely had a profound impact on similar plans at many of the nation's elementary and secondary schools , the parents involved in community schools case did not completely foreclose the possibility that school districts may constitutionally pursue certain measures to avoid racial isolation , prevent resegregation , and promote racial diversity in their schools .
