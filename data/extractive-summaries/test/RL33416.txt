social unrest in china affects ongoing u.s. policies promoting human rights and democracy in china and broader considerations about engagement with the prc . in the medium term , ongoing u.s. efforts to promote civil society and the rule of law in the prc could help people and institutions in china to develop legal understanding and procedures for expressing and resolving social grievances . in the longer run , social unrest may adversely affect the business climate for foreign investment , the pace of economic reforms ( including compliance with wto commitments ) , political stability in the prc , and chinese foreign policy . others argue that social unrest may cause beijing to adopt a more hostile international posture . policy options for congress include monitoring the situation , increasing assistance for local democracy , civil society , and rule - of - law programs in china , supporting a free press and independent judiciary , or pressing the chinese government to respect the rights of protestors and release jailed activists . according to chinese communist party sources , social unrest grew by nearly 50% from early 2004 through 2005 , culminating in a particularly violent episode in december 2005 . china's public security ministry reportedly declared that there were 87,000 cases of "public order disturbance" — including protests , demonstrations , picketing , and group petitioning — in 2005 compared to 74,000 reported cases in 2004 . the december 2005 clash between villagers and people's armed police ( pap ) in dongzhou village ( shanwei city ) , southeastern guangdong province , in which 3-20 villagers were killed , became a symbol of the depth of anger of those with grievances and the unpredictability of the outcomes of social disputes . while social unrest has not placed china in imminent danger of widespread political upheaval , it has caused alarm among the communist party leadership and influenced the policy direction of the national government . economic reforms and growth in china , which took off in the early 1990s , have given rise to a middle class of an estimated 100 million persons as well as a "two - tier" society of haves and have - nots . egregious labor abuses have long been reported in the special economic zones ( sezs ) , where foreign - invested companies produce chinese goods for export . growing numbers of laid - off soe workers , workers in the sezs , peasants and urban residents who have lost their farmland or homes , and others have engaged in mass protests , some of them violent , often after having exhausted legal channels for resolving grievances . however , the state has reserved the authority to arbitrarily determine which protest activities are acceptable . according to some analysts , chinese leaders diverge on how to respond to protest activities: one government view regards peaceful demonstrations as a legitimate way to express grievances and emphasizes developing institutions for protecting rights and resolving disputes . on december 15 , 2005 , a bi - partisan group of u.s. congressional leaders submitted a letter to the prc ambassador to the united states , zhou wenzhong , expressing "deep concern" over the shooting incident in dongzhou .
