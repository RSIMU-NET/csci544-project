in fiscal year 2006 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) spent approximately $4.1 billion or 38 percent of its $10.8 billion budget on processing income tax returns and providing taxpayer assistance , with most of this occurring during the annual tax filing season . however , we also described challenges to continued progress . another challenge is continuing progress on the business systems modernization ( bsm ) program , irs's ongoing effort to replace its aged computer systems . our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs's 2006 filing season performance in processing paper and electronically filed tax returns and providing telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance relative to 2006 goals and prior years' performance ; ( 2 ) identify potential cost savings or other improvements ; and ( 3 ) report on the status of irs's taxpayer assistance blueprint ( tab ) , which is intended to be the long - term strategy for cost effectively delivering services that meet taxpayer needs . to assess irs's 2006 filing season performance in the key filing season activities — paper and electronic processing , plus telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance — compared to goals and past performance , and report on the status of the tab , we reviewed and analyzed irs reports , testimonies , budget submissions , and other documents and data , including workload data and data related to irs's current suite of balanced performance measures and annual goals ; analyzed staffing data for paper and electronic processing , telephone assistance , and walk - in assistance ; tested for statistically significant differences between annual performance measures based on sample data ; observed operations at irs's atlanta and cincinnati paper processing centers , the atlanta call site and joint operations center , and 4 of irs's 400 walk - in locations ; reviewed legislation , policies , and procedures ; reviewed information from organizations that evaluate internet performance ; reviewed related tigta reports and interviewed tigta officials about irs's performance and initiatives ; reviewed prior gao reports and followed up on our recommendations made in prior filing season and related reports ; interviewed irs officials about current operations , performance relative to 2006 performance goals and prior filing season performance , trends , and significant factors and initiatives that affected or were intended to improve performance ; and interviewed representatives of the few larger private and nonprofit organizations that prepare tax returns including h&r block and trade organizations that represent both individual paid tax preparers and tax preparation companies including the american institute of certified public accountants . two other factors that contributed to this year's slower growth in electronic filing were ( 1 ) changes in the free file program , which reduced the number of taxpayers eligible to file electronically for free this year , and ( 2 ) termination of the telefile program , which had allowed taxpayers to file their returns electronically via telephone . in eight of these nine states , the growth rate of electronically filed federal returns increased the year the mandate was implemented . by not requiring electronic filing by paid preparers , irs is missing an opportunity for generating savings and efficiencies . systems modernization has been a key part of irs's efforts to improve taxpayer services . most notably , accounts accuracy and tax law accuracy have improved since 2001 and now both are 90 percent or over , which is a statistical improvement over last year . irs could eliminate underutilized space by consolidating or closing call sites . the decline and shift of taxpayers from walk - in sites to other service options is important because it has allowed irs to transfer time - consuming services , such as return preparation , from irs to other less costly alternatives that can be more convenient for taxpayers . irs used site reviews to measure volunteer sites' adherence to irs's quality standards , but the results could not be generalized across volunteer sites because irs did not use a statistically valid sample . phase ii of the tab includes additional research to build on the strategic improvement themes . irs officials anticipate that the tab phase ii report will be released to the congress by early 2007 . we have identified two such savings opportunities . however , irs lacks the statutory authority to expand its use of mandates . requiring certain paid tax preparers to file individual returns electronically could increase electronic filing and generate savings for irs . however , irs is not reporting on one of the chief benefits already realized from cade , issuing refunds faster . the congress could benefit from knowing this information as it makes decisions about funding the completion of cade .
