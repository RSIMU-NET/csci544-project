the following definition is used by some science and technology policy analysts as a cornerstone of thinking about science and technology ( s&t ) policy decisionmaking: [science and technology policy] is concerned with the allocation of resources for scientific research and technical development . because science and technical knowledge and guidance influences public policy decisionmaking on many other issues , some think that science and technology policy does not need to be a separate field of inquiry . science and technology policy guidance can be used to frame policy issues , craft legislation , oversee federal activities , and govern . at a 2006 workshop , some experts expressed concerns regarding the judiciary's use of scientific evidence and expertise including whether courts sufficiently recognize minority views in science ; appreciate differences among the sciences in collecting , validating , and synthesizing evidence ; understand that much of the available research relates to populations rather than to individuals and that complex questions may arise in extrapolating data to a particular person ; define validity in a way that corresponds with the scientific community's understanding of the term ; provide an appropriate level of scrutiny to forensic evidence in criminal cases . the science and engineering community , however , is not represented by one individual or organization . on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance , its opinions are consensus - based with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence . in the end , consensus is achieved if there is widespread agreement on the evidence and its implications . if this occurs , the knowledge is conveyed to policymakers so they can determine , among other factors , whether or not to take policy actions in response . if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community , however , the lack of consensus adds to the uncertainty facing policymakers responding to a concern . several organizations , when requested by the federal government or congress , provide formal science and technology policy advice: federal advisory committees , congressionally chartered honorific organizations , and federally funded research and development corporations . these organizations are constantly changing ( see box 4 ) . in addition , many other organizations and individuals — policy institutes , the public , professional organizations and disciplinary societies , universities and colleges , advocacy , special interest , industry , trade associations , and labor — also provide their thoughts ( see figure 5 ) . these organizations may agree on the scientific and technical knowledge , but disagree on what actions to take in response on an s&t policy , as their values on a proposed policy may differ . each freely offers sources of knowledge and advice . that staff may develop their opinion based on federal advisory committees , and experts outside the federal government , who in turn rely on peer reviews of the work of individual scientists and engineers , who are not able to be held accountable to the public for public policies based on their knowledge and guidance . policymakers have an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best knowledge and guidance available , along with the other factors they must take into account . an intuitive sense can only go so far in such situations , while scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can help policymakers assess the potential risk and benefits of a decision they make so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigated .
