gao and others have long noted concerns about the design of medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing — the portion of costs for covered services that beneficiaries are responsible for when they receive care . specifically , groups have proposed that medicare ffs's cost - sharing design be simplified and include features found in private plans ( including in medicare advantage ( ma ) , the private plan alternative to medicare ffs ) , which have evolved over time to promote prudent use of health care services and protect beneficiaries from catastrophic care costs . this report describes 1. implications of the current medicare ffs cost - sharing design and options for modernizing while maintaining medicare's and beneficiaries' aggregate share of costs ; 2. how modernized cost - sharing designs could directly affect beneficiaries' cost - sharing responsibilities ; and 3. how modernized cost - sharing designs could indirectly affect beneficiaries' out - of - pocket costs . we also used claims data to develop four illustrative options for modernized cost - sharing designs , each of which included a single deductible , uniform coinsurance , and an annual cap , while maintaining medicare's aggregate share of costs similar to the current design when holding health care utilization and beneficiary enrollment constant . the general design of medicare ffs cost - sharing has been largely unchanged since medicare's enactment in 1965 . modernizing the design could address these concerns , but would involve trade - offs . annual caps are a common design feature of private plans , as most are required to have an annual cap , including those participating in ma . in addition to these implications of the cost - sharing design itself , the american academy of actuaries and others have noted that the complexity and the possibility of unlimited responsibilities increases demand for supplemental insurance , which can lead to added costs for beneficiaries and the medicare program . specifically , as proposed by various groups , revising medicare's cost - sharing design to include a single deductible , modified cost - sharing requirements , and an annual cost - sharing cap could address concerns with the current cost - sharing design . in examining the direct effect of the four illustrative modernized designs we analyzed , we found the following: during year 1 , cost - sharing designs that feature relatively low deductibles and relatively high caps would result in a median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility close to or below that of the current design . in contrast , designs with relatively low caps — and therefore greater beneficiary protection from catastrophic costs — would result in a median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility above that of the current design . by the end of 8 years , there would still be differences in the median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility across different designs , but they would become less pronounced — despite the significantly different levels of catastrophic protection . for example , the median annual cost - sharing responsibility under the design with a cap near $10,000 would increase from below that of the current design in year 1 to 1.1 times higher than the current design by the end of 8 years . these studies and experts identified several types of behavioral responses that would influence the net effect of a modernized design on beneficiaries' out - of - pocket costs , including changes in beneficiaries' demand for , and insurers' supply of , supplemental insurance ; changes in beneficiaries' utilization of services ; changes in medicare beneficiaries' enrollment in ffs versus ma ; and interactions among these and other behavioral responses , including effects on the price of supplemental insurance . we provided a draft of this report to the department of health and human services for comment .
