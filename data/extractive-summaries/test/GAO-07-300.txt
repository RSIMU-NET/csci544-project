in addition to the december 6 testimony , in several prior hearings , we testified that significant control weaknesses in the federal emergency management agency's ( fema ) individuals and households program ( ihp ) and in the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) purchase card program left the government vulnerable to significant fraud , waste , and abuse . specifically , the testimony addressed our findings related to potentially improper and / or fraudulent ( 1 ) rental assistance payments fema made to registrants at the same time it was providing free housing via trailers and apartments ; ( 2 ) duplicate assistance payments to individuals who claimed damages to the same property for both hurricanes katrina and rita ; and ( 3 ) ihp payments to nonqualified aliens who did not qualify for ihp . in our testimony , we stated that our audit and investigative work on fema disaster relief payments associated with hurricanes katrina and rita identified additional indications of fraud , waste , and abuse . specifically , we found that fema made nearly $17 million in potentially improper and / or fraudulent rental assistance payments to individuals after they had moved into fema trailers . because of limitations in fema data , we were not able to identify the full extent of potentially improper rental assistance payments made to individuals in fema - provided apartments . millions of dollars of improper and potentially fraudulent payments also went to nonqualified aliens , including foreign students and temporary workers . for example , fema improperly paid at least $3 million in ihp assistance to more than 500 ineligible foreign students at four universities . in contrast , as of november 2006 , fema had detected through its own processes about $290 million in overpayments . the additional examples of potentially fraudulent and improper payments , totaling tens of millions of dollars , that we highlighted in our december 2006 testimony further show that our estimate of $1 billion in potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments through february is likely understated . dhs and fema also reported that they have taken actions , or plan to take actions , to implement all our recommendations . specifically , with respect to our recommendation on preventing individuals from receiving rental assistance payments while residing in fema - provided housing ( apartments and trailers ) , we continue to believe our work demonstrates a systemic problem exists .
