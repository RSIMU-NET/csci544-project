since the onset of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) in october 2001 and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) in march 2003 , the department of defense ( dod ) has reported that more than 12,000 servicemembers have been injured in combat . in january 2005 , we reported that while va has given high priority to providing services to oef / oif servicemembers , it was challenged in its efforts to identify , locate , and follow up with seriously injured servicemembers . we recommended that va and dod collaborate to reach an agreement for va to have access to dod data for seriously injured servicemembers that both departments agree are needed to promote recovery and return to work and both departments concurred . to do our work on the status of dod's and va's data sharing agreement , we reviewed a draft memorandum of understanding for the sharing of data between dod and va , pertinent provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the hipaa privacy rule , which govern the sharing of individually identifiable health data . in summary , while va has taken steps to expedite services to seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers , va does not have systematic data from dod on those servicemembers who may need vocational rehabilitation and other benefits from va. as a result , va has had to rely on its regional offices to develop informal data sharing arrangements with local mtf staff to identify servicemembers who may need vocational rehabilitation services . however , va staff have no official data source from dod from which to confirm the completeness and reliability of the data obtained through these informal , local arrangements . furthermore , va staff cannot provide reasonable assurance that some seriously injured servicemembers who may have benefited from early intervention by a vocational rehabilitation counselor have not been overlooked . to obtain systematic data from dod on seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers who may need va services , dod and va have been working on an agreement to exchange servicemembers' health data for over 2 years . dod's and va's inability to resolve these differences has impeded coming to an agreement on exchanging seriously injured servicemembers' individually identifiable health data . several va headquarters' officials and regional office staff we interviewed said that systematic data from dod would provide them with a way to reliably identify and follow up with seriously injured servicemembers . additionally , va officials said these data would help them plan for projected increases in services for newly returning oef / oif servicemembers . however , dod and va differ in their understanding of hipaa privacy rule provisions that govern the sharing of individually identifiable health data for servicemembers currently receiving treatment in mtfs without an authorization , and the extent to which the privacy rule would permit that exchange . dod and va officials told us they believe that the memorandum of understanding will move the two departments closer to a data sharing agreement . as a result , even if the memorandum of understanding is finalized , dod and va will still not have a data sharing agreement that specifies what types of individually identifiable health data can be exchanged and when the data can be shared .
