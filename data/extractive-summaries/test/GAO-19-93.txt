among other contracting requirements , pkemra requires fema to develop a contracting strategy that maximizes the use of advance contracts to the extent practical and cost effective ; coordinate advance contracts with state and local governments ; encourage state and local governments to engage in similar pre - planning and contracting ; and submit quarterly reports to the appropriate committees of congress on each disaster contract entered into by the agency using non - competitive procedures . blanket purchase agreements: fema also relies on blanket purchase agreements , such as those established through the general service administration federal supply schedule program , to provide some commercial goods and services needed for disaster response . however , an outdated strategy and lack of guidance to contracting officers resulted in confusion about whether and how to prioritize and use advance contracts to quickly mobilize resources in response to the three 2017 hurricanes and the california wildfires . government - wide contract obligations for the three hurricanes were about $8.2 billion as of may 31 , 2018 . see figure 4 for examples of obligations on goods or services by event . we found that at least 10 of fema's advance contracts used in 2017 were bridge contracts . in august 2011 , we identified challenges with acquisition planning across dhs . by not adhering to fema policy that establishes timeframes for entering data in a disaster response scenario , fema risks reporting incomplete information . our review of the guide found that it does remind contracting officers to coordinate with states and localities over the use of federal advance contracts , but does not provide any details on how often or what types of advance contract information should be shared with states and localities , or provide any instructions to contracting officers on pkemra's requirement to encourage states and localities to establish their own advance contracts for the types of goods and services needed during a disaster . without clear guidance on fema's expectations for coordination with states and localities on advance contracting efforts , and a centralized resource listing up to date information on fema's advance contracts , fema contracting officers and their state and local counterparts lack reasonable assurance they will have the tools needed to effectively communicate about advance contracts , and use them to respond to future disasters .  ( recommendation 5 ) fema's administrator should ensure the head of the contracting activity revises its reporting methodology to ensure that all disaster contracts are included in its quarterly reports to congressional committees on disaster contract actions . in its comments , reprinted in appendix iv , dhs and fema concurred with our nine recommendations . this report specifically addresses the use of advance contracts , assessing the extent to which ( 1 ) the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) used advance contracts , ( 2 ) the planning , management , and reporting of selected fema and usace advance contracts met certain contracting requirements , and ( 3 ) fema and usace identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts . we analyzed the data to identify 10 competed and four h non - competed contracts . to assess what challenges and lessons learned fema and usace identified with the use of advance contracts in 2017 , we reviewed pkemra advance contract requirements , fema and usace documentation on the use of advance contracts , and after - action reports from 2017 and prior years , including the hurricane sandy fema after - action report , and the 2017 hurricane season fema after - action report , and federal internal control standards for information and communications . the information gathered from these officials is not generalizable to all officials .
