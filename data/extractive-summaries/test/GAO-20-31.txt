to aid in its efforts to develop innovative solutions to immediate and diverse threats to national security , the department of defense ( dod ) utilizes 10 federally funded research and development centers ( ffrdc ) . these entities can be nonprofit , university affiliated , or private industry organizations . this report describes: ( 1 ) dod obligations to dod - sponsored ffrdcs from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 ; ( 2 ) factors that led dod to use s&a centers for research ; ( 3 ) how dod uses and assesses the outcomes of s&a center research ; and ( 4 ) dod and s&a center policies and practices related to conflicts of interest . for the purposes of reporting on dod obligations to dod - sponsored ffrdcs , we included dod's 10 ffrdcs ; for subsequent objectives , we focused our review on dod's five s&a centers , which commonly deliver studies and analyses in the form of research reports . we collected and analyzed the last three comprehensive reviews for each s&a center ffrdc and reviewed sponsoring agreements which relate to establishing the relationship between dod and the ffrdc . our selection was based on factors such as obtaining a mix of project costs and sources of work . after the primary sponsor identifies the need for ffrdc work , and has defined ffrdc core competencies , roles , and responsibilities in the sponsoring agreement , the primary sponsor awards a noncompetitive contract to the ffrdc to support the sponsor's research requirements , such as addressing national security issues and systems development . for example: prior to initiating a 2016 assessment of the impact of long - term fiscal trends on army capabilities , the army determined rand arroyo center was uniquely qualified to conduct the research because the project required knowledge of defense planning scenarios that would have given an industry contractor a competitive advantage , potentially leading to a conflict of interest . dod cited ffrdcs' core competencies as factors that contributed to using s&a centers when initiating projects we reviewed , as provided by dod instruction . for example: when initiating a fiscal year 2016 cna assessment on the effects of possible policy changes to a career track program for military officers who are trained to work with other military services , dod's office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness cited cna's core competencies of analysis of maritime resources ; maritime program planning ; and maritime policies , strategies , and doctrines as justification for using cna to perform the work , among other things . inform decision - making . shape guidance , policies , and training . for example , a 2013 study conducted by rand ndri on the root causes related to dod weapons programs cost overruns found , among other things , that dod needed to re - examine its assumptions when estimating a program's cost , schedule , and technical performance . identify opportunities to improve efficiency .
