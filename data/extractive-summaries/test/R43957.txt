prior to the secession of south sudan , sudan was africa's largest nation by area , and the site of its longest running civil war . mistrust between sudan and south sudan lingers , and unresolved disputes still threaten the stability of the region . u.s. sanctions limit sudan's access to u.s. dollars and , alongside debt arrears , impede sudan's access to international financial markets and institutions . relations between sudan and key arab gulf countries , which have been important sources of trade , investment , and project financing for khartoum , had cooled in recent years amid some arab countries' concerns over sudan's ties to iran and its perceived support for the muslim brotherhood in other countries . periodic allegations of sudanese support for islamist militias in neighboring libya may also have contributed to strains in sudan's relations with some countries , including egypt . instead of forging a common national identity , these policies have exacerbated sudan's racial , cultural , and religious differences . these counter - insurgency campaigns did not discriminate between fighters and civilians , and the government repeatedly questioned the neutrality of international aid agencies and restricted access to affected populations . the proximity to the border of rebel activity in sudan's "new south" ( southern kordofan , blue nile , and the southern part of darfur ) and the unresolved status of contested areas such as the abyei region complicates border demilitarization . the deployment of the u.n. interim force for abyei ( unisfa ) defused a violent standoff in 2011 between sudan and south sudan , but tensions among local communities still have the potential to destabilize the border and draw the two countries back into direct conflict . as in darfur , where the sudanese government has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity , khartoum has been accused of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the two areas . according to the u.n. panel of experts , which the u.n. security council created to monitor an arms embargo in darfur and a related sanctions regime , the government's strategy "appears to consist of ( a ) collective punishment of villages and communities from which the armed opposition groups are believed to come or operate ; ( b ) induced or forced displacement of those communities ; and ( c ) direct engagement , including aerial bombardment , of the groups when their location can be identified. . those operations , which president omar al bashir subsequently described as aiming to eliminate armed groups that do not heed the government's call for dialogue , are ongoing . relief agencies are also struggling to assist more than 140,000 south sudanese refugees in sudan who have fled conflict in their own country . access by relief agencies to sudan's conflict zones is at times constrained by government restrictions , fighting , and other forms of insecurity . the ncp government is under pressure . the 2015 elections were controversial and were boycotted by the main opposition parties . more than a year prior , in january 2014 , president bashir had announced that , in preparation for the development of a new constitution , the government would commence a national dialogue on conflict and political issues in the country . many observers have expressed skepticism , however , that the ncp leadership will concede to significant political changes , and efforts to facilitate the participation of armed opposition groups in the process have been , to date , unsuccessful . while the government remains publicly committed to holding a dialogue with unarmed opposition and civil society groups and has rhetorically welcomed the participation of armed groups in that process , it has rejected calls to combine peace negotiations with the srf on darfur and the two areas . sudan was seen as a cold war ally starting in the late 1970s , but after the 1989 coup that brought bashir and the national islamic front to power , the united states downgraded diplomatic relations and cut off aid . u.s. policy shifted under president george w. bush to focus on achieving reforms through increased diplomatic engagement . some sanctions relate to sudan's state sponsor of terrorism designation , others to abuses committed during the north - south war . the obama administration contends that mistrust and miscommunication hinder efforts to improve the bilateral dialogue .
