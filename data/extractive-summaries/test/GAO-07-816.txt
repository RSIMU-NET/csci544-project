concerned about why african american children are overrepresented in foster care , you asked us to analyze: ( 1 ) the major factors that have been identified as influencing the proportion of african american children entering and remaining in foster care compared to children of other races and ethnicities ; ( 2 ) the extent that states and localities have implemented strategies that appear promising in addressing african american representation in foster care ; and ( 3 ) the ways in which key federal child welfare policies may have influenced african american representation in foster care . according to hhs , eight states had been approved to use alternative plans . major factors affecting children's entry into foster care included african american families' higher rates of poverty , families' difficulties in accessing support services so that they can provide a safe home for vulnerable children and prevent their removal , and racial bias and cultural misunderstanding among child welfare decision makers . in responding to our survey , states considered certain groups of factors as contributing to african american children's length of stay in foster care , thereby increasing their disproportionality: these included challenges in finding appropriate adoptive homes for those unable to be reunified with their families , the impact of kinship foster care on length of stay , and other challenges affecting children's ability to exit foster care to be reunified with their families . several child welfare officials said that there is a financial disincentive to adopt children who are only eligible for financial subsidies and services while they are in foster care , especially for grandparents and others living on a fixed income . states generally reported that policies promoting adoption – such as subsidies to families adopting children with special needs and the requirement to recruit minority adoptive parents – have been helpful , but wanted more support for legal guardianship . yet the majority of federal funding for child welfare is distributed as payments for maintaining children already in foster care homes under another part of the law , title iv - e. twenty - five states we surveyed reported that the limited use of title iv - e funds for other purposes besides making maintenance payments to foster care families , such as providing services to families , contribute to the proportion of african american children in care . it may also be cost - effective , given the experiences of the states that implemented this strategy using federal waivers . hhs provides assistance to states on data analysis and practices through its technical assistance network and related web sites , although the agency lacks the directive and funding that department of justice officials said were instrumental to their efforts to analyze data by race and provide guidance on promising practices . we also collected information , reports , and data on disproportionality and initiatives to address this issue from state and local child welfare agencies and others during these visits . this methodology was used for the other four racial categories .
