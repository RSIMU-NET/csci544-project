congress effected a separation of commercial and investment banking through four sections of the banking act of 1933 — sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32 — that were designed "to prevent the undue diversion of funds into speculative operations...." these four statutory provisions are commonly referred to as the glass - steagall act . the glass - steagall debate is not centered on prohibiting risky financial services ; rather , the debate is about whether to permit inherently risky commercial and investment banking activities to be conducted within a single firm — specifically within firms holding federally insured deposits . some have argued that the partial repeal either was a cause of the financial crisis that resulted in the so - called great recession or that it fueled and worsened the crisis's deleterious effect . on the other hand , some policymakers argue that glass - steagall issues were not significant causes of the crisis , and that the glass - steagall act would have made responding to the crisis more difficult if it had remained in place . the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) was congress's primary legislative prescription to prevent a similar financial crisis in the future . it did , however , include some arguably glass - steagall - like provisions , which were designed to , among other things , address perceived inadequacies of the financial regulatory system at the time of the great recession so as to promote financial stability going forward ; reduce various speculative activities of banks ; and reduce the likelihood that the u.s. government would have to provide taxpayer support to avert or minimize a future financial crisis . some believe that a more effective way of accomplishing these policy objectives would be to fully reinstate the glass - steagall act . in fact , multiple bills have been introduced in the 114 th congress with that stated purpose . these bills include: s. 1709 / h.r . 3054 , the 21 st century glass - steagall act of 2015 , and h.r . 381 , the return to prudent banking act of 2015 . others argue that the glass - steagall act is ill - suited for the current financial system and that the recent financial crisis would have occurred even if glba had never partially repealed the glass - steagall act . the glass - steagall act attempted to address some of the specific "[a]buses arising out of the interrelationship of commercial and investment banking" that were identified by the pecora commission , including the following: commercial banks using securities affiliates "to speculate in their own stock , to participate in market operations designed to manipulate the prices of securities , and to conduct other operations in which commercial banks are forbidden by law to engage" ; commercial banks "violating their fiduciary duty to depositors seeking disinterested investment counsel by referring such inquiries to their affiliates" ; and bank - affiliated officers receiving "excessive compensation" for securities deals . over the course of the nearly 70-year - long glass - steagall era , the separation of traditional commercial banking and securities activities gradually eroded . less than a decade after glba's repeal of the glass - steagall act's affiliation restrictions , the united states suffered its worst financial crisis since the great depression . although the dodd - frank act neither reinstated the sections of the glass - steagall act repealed by glba nor eliminated the ability of banking firms to affiliate with securities firms , it included various provisions designed to meet some of the same policy objectives of the glass - steagall act . even if the dodd - frank act had completely re - enacted the repealed provisions of the glass - steagall act , the financial history of the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s shows that regulatory walls could be difficult to maintain or enforce .
