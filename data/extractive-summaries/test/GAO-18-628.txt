in the coming decades , the need for long - term services and supports ( ltss ) to assist individuals with limited abilities for self - care is expected to increase , in part due to the aging of the population . for example , ltss can help individuals perform routine daily activities , such as eating , dressing , bathing , and making meals . while state medicaid programs are required to finance coverage for beneficiary care in nursing homes , coverage for most hcbs is optional , which creates incentives for medicaid to deliver ltss in institutional settings . in recent years the congress , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the federal agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) responsible for overseeing states' medicaid programs — and states have taken steps to expand the use of hcbs and shift the provision of ltss away from institutional settings . however , the extent to which states cover hcbs in their medicaid programs varies , as does the proportion of ltss spending used for hcbs ; the proportion of medicaid ltss spending on hcbs ranged from 27 percent to 81 percent among states in 2016 , a three - fold difference . you asked us to review the approaches states use to provide coverage for hcbs in the medicaid program . this report describes 1. decisions that influenced the structure of selected states' medicaid 2. selected states' challenges providing hcbs to medicaid beneficiaries and efforts to respond to these challenges . we also conducted interviews with state medicaid officials in the five selected states and , as applicable , officials from other state agencies , such as state aging or behavioral health agencies that operate medicaid hcbs programs , to understand how states structured and delivered their hcbs benefits and any challenges faced in providing hcbs . the structure of the 26 hcbs programs we reviewed in selected states reflected decisions about which populations states wanted to cover , whether to limit eligibility for or enrollment in hcbs programs , and whether the state wanted to provide hcbs through managed care ( i.e. , mltss ) . four of our five selected states — florida , mississippi , montana , and oregon — had multiple hcbs programs ( 21 in total ) that targeted specific populations . two of the programs were targeted to individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities , including a state plan benefit that provided services that help beneficiaries develop daily living and social skills , as well as opportunities to participate in community activities , and promote an individual's ability to obtain and maintain employment . all five of the selected states had at least 1 hcbs program that limited eligibility to individuals who require an institutional level of care . specifically , 22 of the 26 hcbs programs we reviewed limited eligibility to this population . four of the selected states — florida , mississippi , montana , and oregon — had enrollment caps for 1 or more of their hcbs programs , namely all of the 19 hcbs programs operated under 1915 ( c ) waivers . specifically , arizona and florida used blended capitation rates , meaning that the rate or amount the states pay mcos to cover expected costs for each ltss beneficiary is the same for all beneficiaries regardless of whether they are in a nursing home or in a home - and community - based setting . to respond to these workforce issues , officials from montana and mississippi and two mcos reported offering higher payment rates to providers . officials from the selected states and mcos we interviewed said that they have responded to the challenge of serving hcbs beneficiaries with complex medical or behavioral health needs by ( 1 ) supporting the development of locations in the community to serve individuals with specific complex needs , ( 2 ) training providers , and ( 3 ) increasing care coordination . officials from four selected states and officials from one of the mcos in the fifth state told us that limits on funding for hcbs programs were a challenge , particularly in the context of the growing number of individuals with ltss needs . officials who cited hcbs funding as a challenge said that they responded to these challenges by , among other things , providing information to their legislatures on the projected need for hcbs to inform future funding decisions . state and mco officials also mentioned other challenges providing hcbs: affordable housing . hhs provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which we incorporated as appropriate . major contributors to this report are listed in appendix ii . gao - 12-649 .
