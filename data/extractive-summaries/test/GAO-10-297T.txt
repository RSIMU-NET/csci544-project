the smithsonian's governing body , the board of regents , is responsible for the long - term stewardship of the smithsonian's mission . in recent years , we and others have documented significant governance and accountability breakdowns at the smithsonian , which could result in a lack of trust from donors , grantors , and appropriators and ultimately put funding and the organization's credibility at risk . in order to assess the smithsonian's efforts to implement these recommendations , we analyzed each reform contained in the recommendations separately ; therefore , we assessed the smithsonian's efforts related to 42 reforms in the following areas: policies on broader smithsonian operations access of senior officials to the board of regents and level of information available to the board of regents transparency of board of regents' and the smithsonian's activities regents' roles and responsibilities the board of regents' structure and composition assessment of the board of regents in our previous report , we found that the board of regents had implemented 30 of the 42 reforms to address these areas of concern , and that it had not completed its implementation of 12 of the recommended reforms . in my statement today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the findings of a report we are releasing today — smithsonian institution: implementation of governance reforms is progressing , but work remains — regarding the smithsonian's efforts to implement governance reforms recommended by the board of regents governance committee and by gao in 2008 , and ( 2 ) provide a brief update on the smithsonian's efforts to implement our 2007 facilities and funding recommendations . information regarding the smithsonian's efforts to implement our 2007 facilities and funding recommendations is based on our september 2007 report on the smithsonian's facilities and our review of updated information provided in smithsonian documents — including office of protection services documents , the smithsonian's draft facilities capital program ( fiscal years 2010-2014 ) , and minutes from the board of regents' november 2007 meeting — and through interviews with smithsonian officials . as shown in figure 1 , the smithsonian has implemented 9 governance committee reforms since may 2008 , including the following: the smithsonian ( 1 ) developed a database to identify potential conflicts of interest ; ( 2 ) implemented a policy requiring the former smithsonian business ventures ( sbv ) — now reorganized and renamed smithsonian enterprises — to follow smithsonian policies except in the case of a few documented exceptions ; ( 3 ) developed an event expense policy covering regent and other smithsonian events ; ( 4 ) completed a review of the smithsonian's internal controls for travel and expense reimbursement and implemented a number of additional accountability measures for travel and expense reimbursement ; ( 5 ) held two regent annual public forums ; ( 6 ) developed a board orientation process ; ( 7 ) completed a review and revision of the board of regents committees' charters ; ( 8 ) completed a review of appointment procedures to board of regents committees , which included clarifying the process for appointing nonregents to committees and making this process publicly available on the smithsonian's web site ; and ( 9 ) implemented a reform calling for a regular assessment of the board , its committees , and its members . structure and composition: the board of regents has not fully implemented gao's recommendation to develop and make public its process for the selection , use , and evaluation of nonregents . however , the board of regents did not make a final decision regarding the use of nonregents on committees when in july 2009 , its governance and nominating committee tabled a proposed bylaw to give nonregent members of committees the same roles and responsibilities as regents . communication and stakeholder relationships: the board of regents took steps to improve its relationship with stakeholders , including advisory boards . however , due to limitations of the efforts thus far — such as their informal nature and focus on dissemination of information from the regents rather than two - way communication — several advisory board chairs with whom we spoke expressed concern that the board of regents still lacked a sufficient understanding of smithsonian museums and other entities to govern as effectively as possible . assessment — evaluation: the board of regents has not yet conducted a comprehensive evaluation of its reforms but plans to do so in fiscal year 2010 . the smithsonian has fully implemented four of the five recommendations we made in our september 2007 report on the smithsonian's facilities , security , and funding challenges . it has not implemented the fifth recommendation regarding submitting a report to congress and the office of management and budget ( omb ) on its funding strategy , but plans to do so . 3. ) . furthermore , although the smithsonian has implemented our recommendation to more comprehensively analyze funding strategies to meet the needs of its facilities projects and is planning to launch a national fundraising campaign , it is unclear what amount of funds will be raised through such a campaign and , more specifically , what amount will be dedicated to facilities .
