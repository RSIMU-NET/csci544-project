on january 5 , 2011 , the house of representatives adopted an amendment to house rule xii to require that members of the house state the constitutional basis for congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution .  ( the amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions. ) . the constitutional authority statement ( cas ) rule , found at house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , was subsequently adopted in the 113th , 114th , 115th , and 116th congresses . it begins by providing a broad overview of ( 1 ) congress's powers under the constitution and ( 2 ) congress's role in interpreting this document . understanding the purpose and logic of the cas rule first requires an understanding of both the powers provided to the congress under the constitution and congress's role in interpreting the constitution . as a result , the supreme court has interpreted article i's vesting clause as creating a congress of specified or "enumerated powers. . in its 1803 decision in marbury v. madison , the supreme court held that the logic of having a written constitution that enumerates the legal limits imposed on the federal government , coupled with the tenure protections provided to the federal judiciary under the constitution , confirmed the supreme court's role in interpreting the constitution and invalidating acts of other branches of government that contravene this document in the context of a live case or controversy . while marbury firmly established that the judicial branch has a role in interpreting the constitution , including the power to strike down laws held to be incompatible with the founding document , it did not , however , expressly state that the judiciary has a final or even exclusive role in defining the basic powers and limits of the federal government . to the contrary , the early history of the united states is replete with examples of all three branches of the federal government playing a role in constitutional interpretation , with congress and the executive openly questioning the supreme court's pronouncements on constitutional law , such as the court's rulings on the national bank or slavery . in recent decades , a number of legal scholars and government officials have criticized the judicial supremacy view , instead advancing the view that the constitution should more regularly be the subject of interpretation by those outside of the judicial branch . supporters of this view point to the fact that the constitution requires all members of congress to "be bound by oath or affirmation ... to support [the] constitution ... ," a requirement that presumes senators and representatives must understand and interpret the constitution in their work in congress . originally adopted as an amendment to house rule xii on january 5 , 2011 , the cas rule prohibits members from introducing a bill or joint resolution without a "statement citing as specifically as practicable the power or powers granted to congress in the constitution to enact the bill or joint resolution. . the submitted cas appears in the congressional record and is published electronically on congress.gov . second , the section suggests potential constitutional bases for various types of legislation . a house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , statement regarding the constitutionality of legislation is required only when a member of the house introduces legislation . while the customary practice with regard to cass , to date , has been to provide a short citation to the provision in the constitution that affirmatively grants congress the authority to enact the underlying legislation , it is not unprecedented for members to cite sources beyond the text of the constitution , such as supreme court case law , primary source materials on the constitution , or a constitutional law treatise .
