subsequently , the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) required dhs to develop a strategy for management integration . this testimony , which summarizes our report to you , discusses: the extent to which dhs has developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that includes the characteristics recommended in our 2005 report , how dhs is implementing management integration , and the extent to which dhs's usm is holding the department and component management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships . to address the extent to which dhs developed a management integration strategy , we assessed whether dhs documents and plans included the characteristics recommended in our 2005 report for a management integration strategy , which required that the strategy: look across the initiatives within each of the management functional units ; clearly identify the critical links that must occur among these initiatives ; identify trade - offs and set priorities ; set implementation goals and a time line to monitor the progress of these initiatives to ensure the necessary links occur when needed ; and identify potential efficiencies , and ensure that they are achieved . although dhs stated at that time that it was developing an integration strategy , it has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that is consistent with statute and that contains all of the characteristics we identified in 2005 . according to dhs's usm , the department has not yet done so because , in part , the management directorate has focused on building the management operations capacity within the functional areas , such as financial management and information technology . in addition , although dhs has developed some performance goals and measures to measure management activities , it has not yet established measures for assessing management integration across the department . for example , dhs has increased the number of departmentwide performance measures for the management directorate in support of goal 5 of dhs's strategic plan . these measures relate to activities in functional areas but do not help to measure management integration . while dhs does not have a comprehensive management strategy , its management directorate is working to consolidate management policies , processes , and systems and it has instituted a system of management councils and governance boards . the usm and department and component management chiefs are held accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships at three levels — between the secretary and the usm , the usm and department management chiefs , and the department and component management chiefs — in which , among other things , the secretary of homeland security , usm , and department chiefs are required to provide input into performance plans and evaluations . in our review , we found that performance management practices for management integration between dhs's department and component management chiefs are not consistently in place . department chiefs are not consistently providing the guidance and input required by department management directives and in accordance with performance management leading practices . we also recommended that the under secretary take several actions to implement existing performance management mechanisms — such as having the departmental management chiefs provide written input into component chiefs' performance plans and evaluations , and strengthening linkages between department goals and objectives in individual performance plans for component management chiefs — to ensure that the management directorate can exercise its authority and leadership to implement a management integration strategy .
