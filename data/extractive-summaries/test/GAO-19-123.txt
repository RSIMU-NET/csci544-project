you asked us to examine superfund sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , and epa's consultation with tribes regarding cleanup actions at these sites . this report ( 1 ) examines the extent to which epa has reliable data identifying npl sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , ( 2 ) examines the extent to which epa has reliable data on the agency's consultation with tribes regarding npl sites , and ( 3 ) describes what actions , if any , epa has taken to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions at npl sites . to examine the extent to which epa has reliable data identifying npl sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , we obtained epa data on npl sites currently proposed , final , or deleted , that ( 1 ) epa data indicate are associated with indian tribes , ( 2 ) the agency has determined to have native american interest ( nai ) , and ( 3 ) epa officials told us may be within 10 miles of tribal property . npl site listing process . npl deletion . epa memorandum on considering traditional ecological knowledge during the cleanup process ( 2017 ) . using its sems and tcots data systems , epa tracks npl sites that are on tribal property or that affect federally recognized indian tribes , as well as the agency's efforts to consult with indian tribes regarding cleanup decisions at npl sites . this variable identifies sites that may be of interest to one or more native american entities whose members or land would be directly affected by the release of hazardous materials . it also does not specify what types of tribal interests to consider . without clear guidance to regional offices on how to determine whether sites have nai — including criteria to assist regions in determining when a site should be designated as having nai in the sems database and how , if at all , to adjust the nai data for sites that no longer have tribal interest — epa does not have reasonable assurance that its data on tribes that may be affected by hazardous releases at npl sites are accurate or complete . we found eight sites with nai for which epa did not identify an interested tribe in sems . however , tcots data are incomplete and did not include records for 7 npl sites where , based on our interviews with epa regional officials and a review of agency documents , we determined that consultation had occurred since 2011 . the policy initially states that it is epa's policy to “consult on a government - to - government basis with federally recognized tribal governments when epa actions or decisions may affect tribal interests.” according to the policy , the broad scope of consultation contemplated by the policy creates “a large number of actions that may be appropriate for consultation.” to provide “a general framework from which to begin the determination of whether any particular action or decision is appropriate for consultation,” the policy provides a list of general epa activity categories , including superfund response actions . for example , it does not specify any particular points in the superfund process at which consultation should be considered or any further detail on what tribal interests should be considered when determining if tribal interests are affected . without clarifying guidance on tribal consultation to clearly identify the circumstances under which the agency should consider consulting with tribes , epa does not have reasonable assurance that regions are applying the consultation policy consistently and uniformly . these actions include efforts to minimize tribal members' exposure to contaminants and limit potential damage to tribal archeological sites . for example , epa officials we interviewed described instances in which a tribe provided epa with selected information about their traditional hunting sites and their traditional use of plants , and epa was able to use this information when developing risk assessments and standards for safe consumption of fish and wildlife . data on sites that are on tribal property are not accurate , and there is no regular , standardized review process officials can use to review the quality of these data .  ( recommendation 4 ) . human exposure under control . cleanup is ongoing . epa is in the remedial investigation stage of the cleanup . this report ( 1 ) examines the extent to which the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has reliable data identifying national priorities list ( npl ) sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , ( 2 ) examines the extent to which epa has reliable data on the agency's consultation with tribes and ( 3 ) describes what actions , if any , epa has taken to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions at npl sites . however , these officials told us that they are developing their relationship with epa region 8 .
