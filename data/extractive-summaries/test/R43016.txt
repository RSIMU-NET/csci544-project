on march 16 , 2010 , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) released connecting america: the national broadband plan . accordingly , the nbp identified significant gaps in broadband availability and adoption in the united states , and in order to address those gaps and other challenges , the nbp set six specific goals to be achieved by the year 2020 . goal no . 5: to ensure the safety of the american people , every first responder should have access to a nationwide , wireless , interoperable broadband public safety network . national broadband map data monitor the availability and extensiveness of wireless broadband networks in the united states . many of the key telecommunications issues that are currently being considered by the 113 th congress are focused on improving broadband deployment , and thus are intended to have a positive impact on the nation's progress towards reaching one ( or in many cases , several ) of the nbp goals . three years after the rollout of the national broadband plan , available data indicate that there has been progress towards reaching the 2020 goals . the following observations can be made: the united states is much closer to reaching broadband availability goals than broadband adoption goals , which remain a major challenge ; the united states is much closer to achieving broadband download speed goals than upload speed goals ; while the 100 squared goal seems well within reach ( at least for download speeds ) , its price remains high — affordability could improve in the future depending on technological advances and consumer demand for 100 mbps plus speeds ; recent rollouts of next generation wireless technologies ( 4g lte ) have led the fcc to state that the united states leads the world in mobile innovation ; on the other hand , the latest oecd data indicate that the united states remains in the middle of the pack with respect to wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 population ; while broadband data are incomplete for community anchor institutions , available information indicate that the number of cais with 1 gigabit connections remains relatively low ; and two major initiatives — firstnet and smart grid — are currently underway in order to help reach goals 5 and 6 . finally , as the 113 th congress considers contentious telecommunications issues such as universal service reform , wireless technology and spectrum policy , and telecommunications regulatory reform , the ongoing progress towards meeting the nbp goals is likely to be part of that debate .
