section 1051 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 ( public law 106-398 ) requires that we review the working capital fund activities of the department of defense ( dod ) to ( 1 ) identify any potential changes in current management processes or policies that , if made , would result in a more efficient operation and ( 2 ) evaluate various aspects of the dod policy that allow defense working capital fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next . excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations are subject to reductions by dod and the congressional defense committees during the budget review process . specifically , our objectives were to review ( 1 ) the basis for dod's 3-month carryover policy , ( 2 ) the military services' implementation of this policy , ( 3 ) the military services' budgeted versus reported actual carryover amounts and whether there were any instances when the reported year - end carryover exceeded the 3-month policy , and ( 4 ) the potential financial and operational impact of reducing the amount of permitted carryover . a 1987 dod carryover study also raised questions about the use of a uniform carryover standard . unless this is done , the number of months will be understated . further complicating the congressional budget review of carryover is that some activity groups have underestimated their budgeted year - end carryover year after year , thereby providing decisionmakers misleading carryover information and resulting in more funding being provided than was intended . we also requested and reviewed documentation and / or analysis that supported the rationale for the 3-month carryover standard . to determine whether applying the carryover authority to not more than a 30-day quantity of work would be sufficient to ensure uninterrupted operations at the working capital fund activities early in a fiscal year and what the impact on these activities would be if the carryover policy were reduced from 3 months to 30 days , we calculated what the potential financial impact on customer orders would have been if a 30 , 60 , 75 , or 90- day carryover standard had been in effect for fiscal year 2001 .
