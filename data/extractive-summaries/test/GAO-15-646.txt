federal , state , and local agencies play an important role in improving outcomes for our society's most vulnerable populations , who often face complex social or economic problems . a small number of foreign and u.s. state and local governments are employing a contracting mechanism known as a social impact bond ( sib ) or a pay for success ( pfs ) program to fund preventive efforts designed to more effectively serve vulnerable populations . this report examines ( 1 ) how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; ( 2 ) how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and ( 3 ) the potential roles for the federal government's involvement in pfs projects . we interviewed officials from each of these agencies about their involvement in pfs . however , stakeholders said that pfs can also be used to contract for outcomes that a government deems worthwhile , even if the outcomes do not generate savings . for example , in its review , the maryland dls concluded that in practice there are significant challenges to transferring risk to investors , such as identifying investors who are willing to invest in pfs projects and designing contract mechanisms to fully transfer risk . as a result of the perverse incentive to focus on those that are easiest to serve , those that are most in need and most difficult to serve could receive fewer services or a diminished focus . the project will make grants to intermediary organizations that will work with state and local governments and service providers to implement pfs projects and will include an evaluation to determine if this model of delivering supportive housing can achieve savings by decreasing government spending on corrections systems , homeless services , medicaid , and crisis care services , some of which are federally funded . a stakeholder from the centre for social impact bonds said these grants have helped improve the technical and financial capacity of key players in pfs projects . a mechanism for agencies to share knowledge and information on pfs could give agencies interested in potential pfs projects access to leading practices and current information on how federal participation is evolving . pfs is most likely an appropriate tool for prevention programs that address entrenched social problems . to identify and broadly disseminate information on leading practices and lessons learned , the director of omb should establish a formal means for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs . this could include creating a formal working group and providing collaboration technologies , such as shared databases or web portals . the office of management and budget ( omb ) provided written comments concurring with our recommendation and is working with agencies to explore options for continued collaboration on pay for success . during the interviews , we asked the interviewees , among other things , about the potential benefits and risks of pfs ; the advantages and disadvantages that pfs has compared to other program funding mechanisms ; the specific roles their organizations play in pfs projects ; the pfs project contract negotiations , including the establishment of outcome payment and governance structures ; and the potential roles that the u.s. federal government or uk national government could play in pfs projects . to provide examples of how federal agencies are using evidence to inform decision making , we asked the agencies in our study to provide us with examples of existing programs or program proposals that were consistent with office of management and budget ( omb ) guidance on areas in which agencies could improve their use of evidence .
