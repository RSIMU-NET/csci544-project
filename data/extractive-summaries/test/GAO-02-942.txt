the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) administers a direct loan program that , among other things , provides loans to farmers who are unable to obtain private commercial credit to buy and operate farms . fsa is required to administer this program in a fair , unbiased manner . in light of these concerns , you asked us to ( 1 ) compare the processing times and approval rates for direct loans for hispanic farmers with those for non - hispanic farmers , ( 2 ) describe usda's policies for staying foreclosures and how these policies have been implemented , and ( 3 ) assess usda's progress in addressing previously identified problems associated with untimely processing of discrimination complaints and human capital issues within usda's office of civil rights . although the average direct loan application processing time was longer for hispanic farmers than for non - hispanic farmers during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , over 90 percent of loan applications from hispanic farmers ( and 94 percent from non - hispanic farmers ) were processed within the agency's 60-day requirement . specifically , the final report noted that the time period from the completion of loan applications to the applications' approval was significantly longer for minorities in three of the four fsa service centers it reviewed . during this period , hispanic farmers made up about 4 percent of the agency's direct loan portfolio . specifically , usda's internal requirements direct ocr to complete its investigative reports within 180 days after accepting a discrimination complaint . to identify hispanic farmers who had had filed discrimination complaints against fsa and whose complaints were processed during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , we obtained a list of hispanic farmers from the ocr and reviewed available fsa state office direct loan and complaint files to determine whether the fsa farm loan chiefs had been notified when a farmer had filed a complaint and whether or not fsa had implemented a stay of adverse action . 4 . gao did not mean to imply that ocr's productivity is declining .
