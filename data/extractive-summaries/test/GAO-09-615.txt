chief among dod's programs is the commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) . cerp duties are performed at the headquarters , provincial reconstruction teams ( prt ) , brigade and unit levels and include identifying projects , preparing statements of work , awarding contracts , and monitoring projects during and after completion . due to significant congressional interest in this issue , we conducted a review of the cerp in afghanistan under the authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative and examined the following questions: to what extent ( 1 ) does dod have the capacity to manage and oversee the cerp in afghanistan and ( 2 ) has dod established mechanisms to coordinate its cerp projects with usaid ? . the reports are compiled based on information about the projects that is entered by unit officials into the combined information data network exchange , a classified dod database that not only captures operations and intelligence information , but also tracks information on cerp projects such as project status , project start and completion date , and dollars committed , obligated , and disbursed . u. s. efforts to enhance afghanistan's development is costly and requires some complex projects , underscoring the need to effectively manage and oversee the cerp program , including effectively managing and overseeing contracting as well as contractor efforts . although dod has used cerp funds to construct roads , schools , and other projects that commanders believe have provided benefits to the afghan people , dod faces significant challenges in providing adequate management and oversight of cerp because of an insufficient number of trained personnel to execute and manage the program . we have frequently reported on several long - standing problems facing dod as it uses contractors in contingency operations including inadequate numbers of trained management and oversight personnel . dod has not conducted a workforce assessment of cerp to identify how many military personnel are needed to effectively and efficiently execute and oversee the program . rather , commanders determine how many personnel will manage and execute cerp . personnel at all levels , including headquarters and unit personnel that we interviewed after they returned from afghanistan or were in afghanistan in november 2008 , expressed a need for more personnel to perform cerp program management and oversight functions . due to a lack of personnel , key duties such as performing headquarters staff assistance visits to help units to improve contracting procedures and site visits to monitor project status and contractor performance were either not performed or not consistently performed . as we have reported in the past , poorly written contracts and statements of work can increase the department's cost risk and could result in the department paying for projects that do not meet project goals or objectives . also , in november 2008 , the integrated civilian - military action group which consists of representatives from the department of state , usaid , and u.s. forces - afghanistan was established at the u.s. embassy in kabul , to help unify u.s. efforts in afghanistan through coordinated planning and execution , according to a document provided by usaid . despite these interagency teams , military and usaid officials lack a common database that would promote information sharing and facilitate greater visibility of all development projects in afghanistan . while usaid officials have conducted some assessments for the development of the centralized database , as of yet no specific milestones have been established for when that database will be complete . in addition , this report will be available at no charge on gao's web site at http: / / www.gao.gov . to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has the capacity to provide adequate management and oversight of the cerp in afghanistan , we reviewed guidance from dod , combined joint task force - 101 ( cjtf - 101 ) , and combined joint task force - 82 ( cjtf - 82 ) to identify roles and responsibilities of cerp personnel , how personnel are assigned to the cerp , the nature and extent of the workload related to managing and executing the cerp , and the training curriculum provided to familiarize personnel with the cerp . stabilization and reconstruction: actions needed to improve governmentwide planning and capabilities for future operations . goals .
