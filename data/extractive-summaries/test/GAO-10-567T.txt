nevertheless , this past february , we testified that overall the bureau's readiness for a successful headcount is mixed . on the other hand , the rollout of other key enumeration activities is generally on track , and the bureau has taken action to address some previously identified problems . in particular , i will provide an update on the progress the bureau is making in addressing issues that prompted us to designate the 2010 census a high - risk area , including ( 1 ) the reliability of key it systems ; ( 2 ) a broad range of activities critical to an effective headcount , some of which were problematic in either earlier 2010 operations or in the 2000 census ; and ( 3 ) the quality of the bureau's cost estimates . the broad range of activities i will discuss today include procedures for fingerprinting temporary employees ; the rollout of key marketing efforts aimed at improving the participation of hard - to - count populations and how american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) funds are being used as part of that effort ; the bureau's plans for mailing a second , follow - up questionnaire and the removal of late mail returns ; and the bureau's plans to enumerate people who are vulnerable to being missed by the census , including the homeless and those displaced by recent economic conditions and the hurricanes that slammed the gulf coast . aside from the mail response rate , which is outside of the bureau's direct control , the most significant risk jeopardizing the cost and quality of the enumeration lies in the performance problems that continue to plague dapps and pbocs . indeed , neither system has yet demonstrated the ability to function reliably under full operational loads , and the limited amount of time that remains to improve the reliability of these systems creates a substantial challenge for the bureau . while the bureau has finalized its reexamination of nonresponse follow - up ( nrfu ) costs , it continues to update the costs for other nrfu - related operations . more generally , now that the census has moved to the operational phase , it will be important for the bureau to stay on schedule . although the bureau has made progress in testing and deploying it systems for the 2010 census , significant performance issues need to be addressed with both pbocs , the work flow management system , and dapps , the automated system the bureau is using to process applicants and handle the payroll of the more than 600,000 temporary employees who are to work on the census during peak operations . under the revised policy , the bureau plans , wherever operationally feasible , to digitally capture a third and fourth set of fingerprints if the fbi cannot classify the first two sets . further , the bureau targeted the paid advertising messages based on market and attitudinal research . also , the bureau plans to mail approximately 12 million replacement questionnaires to nonresponding households in other census tracts that had low - to - moderate response rates in 2000 ( known as targeted replacement ) . to help ensure that these individuals are counted , the bureau plans to employ several initiatives . for example , service based enumeration ( sbe ) is designed to count people who lack permanent shelter at soup kitchens , regularly scheduled mobile food vans , and other locations where they receive services . moreover , the bureau's be counted program is designed to reach those who may not have received a census questionnaire , including people who do not have a usual residence , such as transients , migrants , and seasonal farm workers . since then , two early census field operations have experienced major differences between their estimated and actual costs . however , the bureau's analyses of cost are not complete . on the other hand , certain operations , such as the communications campaign and efforts to enumerate group quarters , generally appear to be on track and more robust compared to similar efforts for the 2000 census , better positioning the bureau for a complete and accurate headcount . 2010 census: census bureau continues to make progress in mitigating risks to a successful enumeration , but still faces various challenges .
