since its creation in 1958 , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has owned and operated a small fleet of aircraft to provide passenger transportation . in this regard , you requested that our audit address ( 1 ) the relative cost of nasa passenger aircraft services compared with commercial coach costs , ( 2 ) whether nasa's retention and operation of aircraft for passenger transportation was in accordance with applicable governmentwide guidance , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of nasa's oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services . nonetheless , based on our work , it is clear nasa's current policies and practices result in significant waste of taxpayer funds . specifically , estimated costs associated with nasa's passenger aircraft operations during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 were almost $25 million , while we estimated the cost of commercial coach tickets for the same number of travelers would have been approximately $5 million — about $20 million more to provide nasa passenger aircraft services than if commercial airlines were used to provide passenger transportation over the 2-year period . our analysis of available flight data showed that an overwhelming majority ( 86 percent ) of the flights taken during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 using nasa passenger aircraft services were to support routine business operations , including attending meetings , conferences , and site visits . nasa's studies compared its aircraft ownership costs against costs of nasa leasing aircraft to provide passenger transportation services because “commercial airlines cannot effectively meet all mission requirements.” for example , nasa's march 2004 a - 76 study was based on the assumption that nasa aircraft would be required to support mission requirements of an estimated 400-450 flight hours a year - - essentially the total number of flight hours flown by that nasa center's passenger aircraft during 2003 and 2004 . this may include nasa employee spouses and relatives , contractors , or other federal agency personnel . although , as mentioned previously , we obtained evidence that nasa also utilized at least two additional program support aircraft to meet its passenger air transportation needs , the limited data on use and costs associated with flights using these aircraft did not allow us to include data on these flights in our database . as discussed previously , our analysis of available estimates of nasa's aggregate costs associated with its passenger aircraft services in comparison with commercial airline ticket costs showed that nasa's passenger aircraft services cost about $20 million more than commercial airlines . to the extent that congress determines that nasa should continue to retain aircraft or passenger aircraft charter services to provide passenger transportation , we recommend that the administrator of nasa take the following six actions: establish policies and procedures for accumulating and reporting on its passenger aircraft services to provide complete and accurate agencywide cost and utilization data to support oversight and decision making on operating and retaining such aircraft services .
