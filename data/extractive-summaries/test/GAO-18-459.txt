this report examines: the extent to which aphis and nih provided federal agencies with guidance for reporting on their animal use programs , the extent to which aphis and nih share information on animal use with the public , and stakeholders' views on federal agencies' sharing of additional information . we reviewed the animal welfare act and its implementing regulations and interviewed agency officials to identify relevant reporting requirements and determine whether they were consistent with aphis's reporting instructions . such information could include data on all vertebrate animals used , information on the purpose of specific research activities , and general descriptions of the agency's animal care program . institutional animal care and use committees . the animal welfare act and reporting facilities animal welfare act regulations “the reporting facility shall be that segment of the research facility , or that department , agency , or instrumentality of the united states , that uses or intends to use live animals in research , tests , experiments , or for teaching.” aphis's 2017 instructions for completing the annual report the instructions do not instruct federal research facilities to report activities involving animal use outside the united states . aphis and nih publicly report some information about federal agencies' use of research animals . the health research extension act does not require nih to make such information available through a public website , but nih policy directs the agency to provide to public health service agencies a list of facilities with such assurances . the list includes facilities that receive public health service funding and facilities that have voluntarily requested nih's review and approval of their programs . for those stakeholder groups that generally expressed the view that federal agencies should make additional information available to the public on a proactive and routine basis , the most frequently cited reasons were the importance of transparency to allow the public to assess and understand animal use in federal research facilities and the need for oversight and accountability of federal agencies' use of animals . by defining the birds that need to be reported , by instructing federal research facilities to report research activities outside the united states , and by working with the research community to develop clear criteria for identifying field studies , aphis would have greater assurance that the data it receives from research facilities fully reflect the activities covered by the animal welfare act . in particular , aphis does not explain issues related to the completeness and accuracy of the data it provides to the public , for example , issues such as inconsistencies in the types of field studies reported by federal agencies . regarding our first recommendation that the administrator of aphis develop a timeline for ( 1 ) defining birds that are not bred for research and that are covered by the animal welfare act , and ( 2 ) requiring that research facilities report to aphis their use of birds covered by the act , usda stated that aphis will submit a recommendation and timeline by september 30 , 2018 , to usda officials regarding the development of a definition for birds . usda's comments stated that , beginning with the fiscal year 2017 summary activities , aphis will describe how it compiles annual report data from research facilities , what the data represent , and any potential limitations to the data's completeness and accuracy . however , we did not include those activities in our review . in the process of identifying federal agencies that conducted research with animals , we also identified the wide range of vertebrate animal species that these agencies used from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 . agencies are not required by the animal welfare act to report their use of animals that are not covered by the act to the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) . gao also asked stakeholder groups in the survey about their opinion regarding whether the animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) should modify how it collects and posts annual report data under the animal welfare act .
