the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , accelerated the deployment of advanced imaging technology ( ait ) systems , commonly referred to as full - body scanners , in response to the december 25 , 2009 , attempted terrorist attack on northwest airlines flight 253 . according to tsa , by the june 1 , 2013 , deadline , all deployed ait systems have been equipped with atr software . we also recommended that tsa make future we also found that tsa had acquired ait systems that were not used on a regular basis , and thus were not providing a security benefit . dhs concurred with this recommendation . to what extent has tsa made progress toward enhancing ait capabilities to detect concealed explosives and other threat items , and what challenges , if any , remain ? . to determine the extent to which tsa collects and analyzes available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of the entire ait - atr system , we analyzed improvised explosive device ( ied ) checkpoint drills conducted by tsa personnel at airports that submitted data to tsa from march 1 , 2011 , through february 28 , 2013 , under tsa's ied checkpoint drill operational directive . qualification testing . tsa does not collect or analyze ied checkpoint drill data , because it does not ensure compliance with its operational directive that requires each airport to conduct ied checkpoint drills each week . tsa is not enforcing compliance with its directive , and as a result , data on so performance are not being consistently collected or reported by approximately half of airports with ait - atr systems . data on ied checkpoint drills could provide insight into how well sos resolve anomalies detected by the ait systems , information that could be used to help strengthen the existing screening process . however , tsa does not collect or analyze those data at headquarters . tsa officials agreed that it is important to analyze performance by including an evaluation of the technology , operators , and processes , and stated that tsa is planning to assess the performance of all layers of security . tsa has met milestones as documented in its roadmap pertaining to the installation of atr software upgrades that were intended to address privacy concerns and improve operational efficiency for all deployed ait systems in accordance with the statutory deadline included as part of the federal aviation administration modernization and reform act of 2012.however , it did not meet proposed milestones documented in its ait roadmap to provide enhanced capabilities to meet the agency's mission needs . however , tsa officials stated that they did not use available scientific research or evidence to help assess how long it would take to develop enhanced capabilities . given these challenges , tsa will be unable to ensure that its roadmap reflects the true capabilities of the next generation of ait - 2 systems without the use of scientific evidence and information from dhs's science and technology directorate , and the national laboratories , as well as nonproprietary information and data provided by vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve tsa's tier iv end state . to help ensure that tsa improves so performance on ait - atr systems and uses resources effectively , the administrator of the transportation security administration should take the following two actions: clarify which office is responsible for overseeing tsa's ied screening checkpoint drills operational directive , direct the office to ensure enforcement of the directive in conducting these drills , and analyze the data to identify any potential weaknesses in the screening process , and establish protocols that facilitate the capturing of operational data on secondary screening of passengers at the checkpoint to determine the extent to which ait - atr system false alarm rates affect operational costs once ait - atr systems are networked together . to help ensure that tsa invests in screening technology that meets mission needs , the administrator of the transportation security administration should ensure that the following two actions are taken before procuring ait - 2 systems: measure system effectiveness based on the performance of the ait - 2 technology and screening officers who operate the technology , while taking into account current processes and deployment strategies , and use scientific evidence and information from dhs's science and technology directorate , and the national laboratories , as well as information and data provided by vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve tsa's tier iv end state . further , dhs stated that tsa's testing process enables tsa to determine if technologies meet required standards and are feasible for use in the airport environment , and that the system evaluation report for ait - 2 — which will document system effectiveness using information from the laboratory and operational test reports — will state whether or not the next - generation ait system has an acceptable operationally effective and suitable rating for use within an airport environment . tsa expects this roadmap to be completed by september 30 , 2014 . additionally , we evaluated airport compliance with tsa's operational directive and standards for internal control in the federal government to determine the extent to which tsa is monitoring we also reviewed tsa's ait deployment compliance with its directive.schedules to determine which type of ait - atr system airports had , the dates those systems were first deployed , and the dates systems were upgraded with atr capability to assess how airport performance varied at resolving anomalies identified by the ait - atr system .
