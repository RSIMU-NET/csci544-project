pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has established regulations regarding the transport , treatment , storage , and disposal of hazardous wastes . many states have opted to do so — particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households . households and certain small businesses are essentially exempt from rcra . this means that under federal law , hazardous wastes generated by those entities may be disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators . one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regulate more strictly is electronic waste , commonly referred to as "e - waste. . there is no universally accepted definition of e - waste , but it generally refers to obsolete , broken , or irreparable electronic equipment such as televisions , computers and computer monitors , laptops , printers , cell phones , vcrs , dvd players , copiers , fax machines , stereos , and video gaming systems . state and local agencies , particularly municipal waste management agencies , have become increasingly concerned about the landfill disposal or incineration of e - waste because of the large volumes in which it is being generated and because of the hazardous constituents the waste may contain . to date , 14 states have enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect e - waste recycling and disposal practices . as more states propose such legislation , potentially regulated stakeholders ( particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers ) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states . with increased legislative activity in the states , it is anticipated that stakeholders will increase their call for federal legislation regarding e - waste management . to illustrate the issues associated with individual state action , this report discusses the key issues that have led to state action , describes common elements in state waste laws and proposals , and provides an overview of each enacted state law . fourteen states have enacted some form of e - waste management law . although the goals of each law are similar — to avoid landfill disposal of certain e - waste — the approaches taken to achieve those goals differ significantly . however , most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common , such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law , how a collection and recycling program will be financed , collection and recycling criteria that must be implemented to minimize impacts on human health and the environment , and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be lawfully sold in the state . they are required to ensure that a system is in place for delivering residential waste televisions and computer monitors to a consolidation facility in maine .
