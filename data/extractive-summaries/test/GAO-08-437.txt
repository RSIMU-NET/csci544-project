the number of policies in force increased 36 percent and the average amount of coverage increased 78 percent from 1997 through 2006 , consistent with average rising home values . the average premium per flood - insurance policy decreased 3 percent , but when analyzed by flood risk zone , average premiums increased in the high - risk coastal flood zone , from about $1,039 in 1997 to more than $1,400 in 2006 . for 2005 , as a result of the gulf coast hurricanes , fema paid out more than $17.7 billion in losses . from 1997 through 2006 , 79 percent of the funds paid out in losses were for hurricane - related claims , but the percentages in individual years varied widely ( correlating to hurricane activity ) . however , fema does not routinely track how many of these properties have been acquired until a project closes , which can take several years . the completion of a mitigation project , which can include mitigation activities for multiple properties , may take several years . coupled with lack of a requirement for staff to consistently and promptly record acquisitions data , the lack of comprehensive data impedes fema's ability to account for the properties acquired through its mitigation programs and hinders its ability to provide congress with timely information with which to assess the impact of these programs on mitigating losses to nfip and ensure that limited resources are appropriately allocated . while fema relies upon contractors to implement the nfip , our review of fema's monitoring documentation for the bsa contract showed that fema did not consistently follow its own monitoring procedures for preparing , maintaining , and reviewing monitoring reports , and was unable to provide copies of the majority of the monitoring reports we requested . as a result , fema could not ensure adherence to contract requirements and lacked information critical for effective oversight on key nfip contractors . according to the bsa contract , in effect from october 2005 through december 2007 , fema monitors were to review the bsa's performance in 10 specific performance areas . various statistical trends reveal that while nfip is growing and becoming more widely purchased enabling it to more widely diversify its risks , fema continues to face a number of challenges in managing this program including a growing number of claims on repetitive loss properties , insufficient information to readily track the property acquisitions of its mitigation programs , inconsistent application of contract monitoring procedures , and inconsistent documentation and coordination of contractor oversight . ensure implementation of written guidance for all nfip - related contracts on how to consistently handle the failure of a contractor to meet standards in performance areas and establish written policies and procedures about the coordination between fema officials and offices ( including the cotr , the program management office , and the contracting officer ) when addressing contractor deficiencies , including determining whether and under what circumstances to issue discrepancy reports , and ensuring that financial disincentives are appropriately and consistently applied . our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe trends for national flood insurance program ( nfip ) policies , insurance amounts , premiums , and losses from 1997 through 2006 and the extent to which nfip losses were attributable to hurricanes and repetitive loss properties ; ( 2 ) assess how the amounts available for the purchase of flood - damaged properties changed over time , and the extent to which the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) purchased flood - damaged properties ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the extent to which fema followed its procedures for monitoring selected nfip - related contracts . according to fema officials , claims are not coded or notated as being hurricane - related . because fema's grant management system does not track project closures or property acquisitions in real time , the data we report is likely an undercount of the actual number of properties that have been acquired through the fma and rfc mitigation programs . we excluded data on these policies from our analysis because they have coverage limits that differ from other flood insurance policies .
