multiple studies have shown that children in foster care may have more mental health conditions than those in the general population , and prior gao reports have looked at the rate at which these children are prescribed psychotropic medications , which affect mood , thought , or behavior . as part of that review , we also reported on the prevalence of certain prescribing patterns not supported by research that could pose health risks . this report examines: 1. how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states work to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care ; 2. what is known in selected states about the results of their efforts to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for these children ; and 3. the extent to which hhs helps states support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care . to address all objectives , we conducted in - person and telephone interviews with officials in seven selected states , including those from child welfare and medicaid agencies , and with nine national professional and research organizations selected to represent a variety of views on child welfare , medicaid , and mental health - related policy and research . however , because these states use different methodologies to collect data , the data are not comparable among them . we also examined applicable federal laws , regulations , and guidance . state officials in all seven of the selected states said they work to educate relevant stakeholders on mental health conditions and treatments . states may offer other types of informational resources as well . to increase children's access to mental health services , state and county officials in five of the selected states said they provide remote consultation services . through this program , officials said they identified a lack of mental health knowledge and access to mental health specialists as two causes of inappropriate prescriptions . two other selected states — arizona and maryland — had steady rates of medication use . ohio did not have data for this time period . these officials said matching such data can be difficult and time - consuming , and state child welfare and medicaid officials in three selected states discussed limitations with data gathering due to resource and time constraints , given other competing priorities . state child welfare and medicaid officials in some selected states that were able to share data said they overcame privacy concerns through negotiating written agreements and educating stakeholders about sharing data consistent with state and federal privacy requirements . according to samhsa officials , the medical director , with input from the listserv community , is developing guidance on how to take youth off medication , an issue that child welfare officials in one selected state said can be a challenge . although hhs has a variety of efforts to assist states in overseeing psychotropic medication use among children , since 2014 the agency has not convened meetings with all the relevant stakeholder groups needed to share information and work together on these issues . however , hhs's assistance to states around collaboration has generally focused on a limited number of states or certain stakeholder groups . officials we spoke with said it helped them develop prescribing guidelines and expand reporting on psychotropic medications . while the states included in our review have made efforts to improve medication oversight , selected state officials and their partners discussed a need for continued collaboration and information sharing to help effectively implement oversight practices , improve access to mental health services , share data , and monitor outcomes . while hhs has made efforts to help support states in their oversight activities , additional support from hhs to convene state child welfare and medicaid agencies and other stakeholders could create opportunities for state agencies to learn from one another's experience , collaboratively develop solutions to mitigate common challenges , strengthen oversight practices for psychotropic medications , and more effectively ensure appropriate treatments for children in foster care . to help states effectively address ongoing challenges related to ensuring the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care , the secretary of hhs should consider cost - effective ways to convene state child welfare , medicaid , and other stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing within and across states on psychotropic medication oversight . finally , hhs provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing three research questions: ( 1 ) how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states work to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care ; ( 2 ) what is known about the results of their efforts , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the department of health and human services ( hhs ) helps states support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care . our selection criteria included: ( 1 ) a high percentage of children in foster care and congregate care in the state when compared nationwide in fiscal year 2014 ; ( 2 ) variation in the type of medicaid delivery system covering psychotropic medications and other mental health services for children in foster care ( i.e. , fee - for - service versus single or multiple managed care organizations ) and in the type of child welfare system ( i.e. , state - versus county - administered ) ; ( 3 ) recommendations from national organizations we interviewed for states that have or are in the process of implementing practices to oversee and monitor psychotropic medications ; and ( 4 ) diversity in geographic location .
