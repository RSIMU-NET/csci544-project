one source of counterfeit drugs is internet pharmacies . while some internet pharmacies are legitimate businesses that offer consumers a safe , convenient , and cost - effective way to obtain their medications , the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) have reported that thousands are fraudulent enterprises . consumers who have taken prescription drugs purchased from rogue internet pharmacies have experienced health problems , required emergency treatments , and died . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting the illegal importation of goods , including prescription drugs that have not been approved for marketing in the united states by fda . among other things , our report identified ( 1 ) how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal laws , ( 2 ) challenges associated with federal investigations and prosecutions of rogue internet pharmacies , ( 3 ) efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and ( 4 ) efforts to educate consumers about the risks of rogue internet pharmacies and how to recognize legitimate online pharmacies . to identify how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal laws , we interviewed officials from federal agencies such as fda , cbp , ice , and doj , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency documents . although the exact number of rogue internet pharmacies is unknown , most operate from abroad . federal officials and other stakeholders we interviewed consistently told us that most rogue internet pharmacies operate from abroad , and many have shipped drugs into the united states that are not approved by fda , including counterfeit drugs . many also illegally sell certain medications without a prescription that meets federal and state requirements . to sell drugs to their u.s. customers , foreign rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated methods to evade scrutiny by customs officials and smuggle their drugs into the country . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting those involved . according to federal agency officials , piecing together rogue internet pharmacy operations can be difficult because they may be composed of thousands of related websites , and operators take steps to disguise their identities . officials also face challenges investigating and prosecuting operators because they are often located abroad , with components of the operations scattered in several countries . however , rogue internet pharmacies often deliberately and strategically locate components of their operations in countries that are unable or unwilling to aid u.s. agencies . federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions , fines , and asset seizures from rogue internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them . for example , fda and other federal agencies have participated in operation pangea , an annual worldwide , week - long initiative in which regulatory and law enforcement agencies from around the world work together to combat rogue internet pharmacies . in 2013 , fda took action against 1,677 rogue internet pharmacy websites during operation pangea . in september 2012 , fda launched a national campaign to raise public awareness about the risks of purchasing drugs online . other federal agencies have also taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of purchasing drugs online ; for example , by posting information on their websites . nabp also posts information about its quarterly review of internet pharmacies , which most recently showed that 97 percent of the over 10,000 internet pharmacies that it reviewed were out of compliance with federal or state laws or industry standards . despite these actions of agencies and stakeholders , consumer education efforts face many challenges . in particular , many rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated marketing methods to appear professional and legitimate , making it challenging for even well - informed consumers and health care professionals to differentiate between legitimate and rogue sites . despite fda warnings to consumers that the agency could not ensure the safety of drugs not approved for sale in the united states that are purchased from other countries , the prevalence of such programs may have contributed to a perception among u.s. consumers that they can readily save money and obtain safe prescription drugs by purchasing them from canada .
