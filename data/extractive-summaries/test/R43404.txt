in response to the disclosure of various national security agency ( nsa ) surveillance and data collection programs , a number of legislative changes to the government's intelligence operations authority have been suggested . many of these proposals include amendments to the practices and procedures of the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) , and the fisa court of review , which reviews rulings of the fisc . a number of proposals seek to increase government transparency by requiring public disclosure of fisa opinions . these proposals might be understood to raise separation of powers issues , namely , the scope of the executive branch's control over national security information . this analysis will include an examination of judicial doctrine and statutory practice regarding control of national security information , concluding that neither branch enjoys exclusive power over the matter ; rather , authority is shared between congress and the executive branch . requiring the public disclosure of fisa opinions concerns many policy questions involving national security ; this report , however , is limited to the legal implications of such a requirement . under the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) , the fisc reviews government applications to , inter alia , conduct surveillance and engage in data collection for foreign intelligence purposes . pursuant to 50 u.s.c . while the fisa court of review has not publicly released any more specific security procedures , the fisc's particular procedures took effect november 1 , 2010 , and specify that the court comply with various executive branch regulations governing classified material , in particular , executive order 13526 — "classified national security information. . in sum , according to the fisc , "the collective effect of these provisions is that applications , orders , and other records ... whether in the possession of the fisc , the court of review , [or] the supreme court ... shall , as a rule , be maintained in a secure and nonpublic fashion. . however , most filings made to the fisc are classified as secret or top secret by the executive branch before being sent to the court , and the fisc's orders and opinions in the possession of the executive branch are similarly classified . legislation that requires the executive branch to publicly disclose fisa opinions might raise separation of powers questions . both congress and the executive branch claim some power in this area . the central issue is the extent to which congress may regulate control over access to national security information , including mandating that the executive branch disclose specific materials — a question not definitively resolved by the courts . congress and the president thus share power over access to national security information . fisa opinions and orders , most of which contain at least some sensitive facts pertaining to national security , are a mixture of legal reasoning and sensitive national security information . proposals that allow the executive branch to first redact classified information from fisa opinions before public release appear to be on firm constitutional ground . such laws , in line with statutes like foia , allow the executive branch to protect sensitive information and likely satisfy the executive branch's view of its constitutional obligations under article ii . the executive branch has historically enjoyed some protection from releasing properly classified information — via statutory exemptions and the common law .
