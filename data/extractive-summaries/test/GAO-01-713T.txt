medicare provides valuable and extensive coverage for beneficiaries' health care needs . nevertheless , recent discussions have underscored the significant gaps that leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out - of - pocket costs . privately purchased medigap is an important source of this supplemental coverage because it is widely available to beneficiaries . specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) beneficiaries' potential financial liability under medicare's current benefit structure and cost - sharing requirements , ( 2 ) the cost of medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage , and ( 3 ) concerns that medigap's so - called “first dollar” coverage undermines the cost control incentives of medicare's cost - sharing requirements . in summary , medicare's benefits package and cost - sharing requirements leave beneficiaries liable for high out - of - pocket costs . while these policies pay for some or all medicare cost - sharing requirements , they do not fully protect beneficiaries from potentially significant out - of - pocket costs . in addition , medigap first - dollar coverage eliminates the effect medicare's cost - sharing requirements could have to promote prudent use of services .
