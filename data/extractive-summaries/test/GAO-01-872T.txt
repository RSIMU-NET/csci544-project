i am pleased to be here today to discuss the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) . over the last decade , the congress , the office of management and budget ( omb ) , and executive agencies have worked to implement a statutory framework to improve the performance and accountability of the executive branch and to enhance executive branch and congressional decisionmaking . as a result of this framework , there has been substantial progress in the last few years in establishing the basic infrastructure needed to create high - performing federal organizations . the issuance of agencies' fiscal year 2000 performance reports , in addition to updated strategic plans , annual performance plans , and the governmentwide performance plans , completes two full cycles of annual performance planning and reporting under gpra . however , much work remains before this framework is effectively implemented across the government , including transforming agencies' organizational cultures to improve decisionmaking and strengthen performance and accountability .
