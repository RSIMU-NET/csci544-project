currently , the united states has active economic sanctions imposed on three major oil - producing and exporting countries: iran , russia , and venezuela . only a portion of these supply volumes might be directly affected by u.s. economic sanctions in the near termâpotentially ranging from 3.3 million to 4.0 million bpd from both iran ( estimated to be 2.8 million bpd ) and venezuela ( estimated to range from 0.5 million to as much as 1.2 million bpd ) . estimated oil production volumes affected to date have been approximately 1.7 million bpd from iran . venezuela oil production has likely also been affected , although accurately quantifying volumes is challenging due to monthly oil production declines that had been occurring over a period of years prior to u.s. sanctions affecting oil trade in january 2019 . a sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both upward and downward ) for crude oil and related petroleum products ( e.g. , gasoline and diesel fuel ) . generally , sanctions - related supply losses have been counterbalanced by increased production and exports from the united states , russia , and other countries ; petroleum trade flow adjustments ; indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates ; and design elements of oil - related sanctions . oil sanctions frameworks can include wind - down periods , requirements to consider and certify that global oil supply is adequate to compensate for supply reductions , and engagement with other oil producers before applying certain sanctions . since 2011 , sanctions targeting iran's oil sector have aimed to eliminate the country's oil export revenue . sanctions applied to russia's oil sector generally target long - term , high - risk oil production projects . venezuela sanctions imposed to date prohibit petroleum trade with the united statesâhistorically one of the primary destinations for venezuela's oil exportsâand have the potential to affect venezuela's petroleum trade with other countries . for each country , this report provides general background and historical information about the oil sector , followed by an overview of each oil - related sanctions framework and a discussion of oil production , supply , and trade impacts resulting from u.s. sanctions . following that operation , a consortium of u.s. and european oil companies effectively took control of iran's oil production and exports . u.s. oil companies began seeking agreementsâalso referred to as concessionsâto explore for and produce oil in venezuela as early as 1919 . as part of this program , international oil companiesâincluding u.s. - firms chevron , exxon , and conocoâwere allowed to either control certain oil field operations or establish majority - owned oil production joint ventures with pdvsa . oil production in venezuela increased to approximately 3.4 million bpd by 1998 . some companies ( e.g. , chevron ) complied with the new requirement . in 2017 , president trump declared a national emergency in e.o . 13808 and the administration imposed financial sanctions on pdvsa , including limiting pdvsa's access to u.s. debt finance . these sanctions effectively terminate u.s. - venezuela petroleum trade and potentially make it difficult for pdvsa to sell crude oil to and obtain petroleum products from non - u.s. entities . in terms of benchmark prices ( i.e. , west texas intermediate and brent futures contracts that are often quoted in the media ) , potential price escalation that might be expected from iran and venezuela supply reductions appear to have been averted to date by an increase in oil production in other countries , trade flow adjustments , and indications of slowing oil demand growth rates . should sanctions relief be provided to iran , such an action could contribute to a market condition that could result in lower oil pricesâactual price levels would depend on market conditions at such a timeâand could adversely affect u.s. oil production and exports . regarding russia , some members of congress have called for additional sanctions , and several bills have been introduced in the 116 th congress with certain provisions that could affect russia's oil sector . finally , the administration has continued to strengthen oil - related sanctions on venezuela through the use of e.o.s and administrative actions . in some cases , u.s. economic sanctions that target oil sectors in iran , russia , and venezuela have observably affected oil markets in several ways , including reductions in supply , changes in price relationships , and adjustments to trade flows . should oil market conditions change to a persistent undersupply condition and benchmark prices escalate to levels deemed too high for u.s. consumers , sanctions relief is one available policy option that could possibly be considered to increase oil supply with the goal of rebalancing markets and moderating price levels ; however , such an action could potentially conflict with broader foreign policy objectives .
