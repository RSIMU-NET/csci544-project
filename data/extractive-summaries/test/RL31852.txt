under current tax law , firms may expense ( or deduct as a current rather than a capital expense ) up to $1 million of the total cost of new and used qualified assets they purchase and place in service in tax years beginning in 2018 under section 179 of the federal tax code . they also have the option under section 168 ( k ) of expensing the entire cost of qualified assets they acquire and place in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022 . p.l . specifically , the new tax law permanently increased the annual dollar limitation for expensing under section 179 to $1 million , raised the phaseout threshold to $2.5 million , indexed both amounts for inflation , and expanded the range of assets eligible for the allowance . 115-97 also increased the section 168 ( k ) bonus depreciation allowance to 100% of the cost of eligible assets acquired and placed in service from september 28 , 2017 , through the end of 2022 and made certain changes in the property eligible for the allowance . many lawmakers view the section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation allowances as effective policy tools for promoting the growth of small firms and stimulating the economy during periods of slow or negative growth . as the most accelerated form of depreciation , expensing lowers this cost by reducing the tax burden on the discounted returns to an eligible investment . or the company may have to rely on retained earnings since it has limited access to debt and equity markets . according to the results of a 2005 study by matt knittel from the department of the treasury , small businesses did not increase their use of the section 179 expensing allowance and the bonus depreciation allowance after both were expanded in 2003 . in a related analysis , house and shapiro also found that the allowance had a strong impact on investment in qualified assets relative to other assets , and on investment in longer - lived qualified assets relative to those with relatively short depreciation lives . fifth , the firm - level benefit from the section 179 expensing and section 168 ( k ) bonus depreciation allowances depends on the length of a qualified asset's recovery period . one way to illustrate the potential tax benefit is to show how expensing affects the marginal effective tax rate on the returns to an investment . given that the expensing allowance lowers the cost of capital and can boost the cash flow of firms claiming it , and that investment in many of the assets eligible for the allowance seems at least somewhat sensitive to changes in the cost of capital , it would be reasonable to conclude that the allowance may have caused domestic investment in those assets to be greater than it otherwise would have been . under the reasonable assumption that the amount of capital in the economy is fixed in the short run , a tax subsidy like the allowance is likely to divert some capital away from relatively productive uses and into tax - favored ones . the two expensing allowances address this concern by simplifying tax accounting for depreciation . similarly , a study by four researchers of 2004 business tax return data , which was included in the proceedings of the national tax association's 100 th annual conference on taxation , found that the direct monetary cost per employee of complying with the federal income tax ranged from $805 for firms with less than $10,000 in total assets to $264 for firms with more than $1 million in assets .
