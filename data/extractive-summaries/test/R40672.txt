title i , part a , of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) authorizes federal aid to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged children . title i - a grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other pupils attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from low - income families . in recent years , they have also become a "vehicle" to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k - 12 education for all pupils have been attached as a condition for receiving title i - a grants . these include requirements for assessments of pupil achievement ; adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) standards and determinations for schools , leas , and states ; consequences for schools and leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more ; plus teacher and paraprofessional qualifications . the esea was initially adopted in 1965 , and was most recently reauthorized and amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ) , p.l . 107-110 . currently , although the authorization for esea title i - a has expired , appropriations have continued to be provided , and the program continues to be implemented under the policies established by the most recent authorization statute . the 111 th congress is expected to consider proposals to extend and amend the esea . in summary , major title i - a reauthorization issues regarding allocation formulas are likely to include the following: should annual variations in the poverty estimates used to calculate title i - a grants be reduced through multi - year averaging or other methods ? . has the targeting of title i - a funds on high poverty leas increased since 2001 ? . should the population weighting factors of the targeted and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas be modified to more equally favor leas with large numbers of school - age children in poor families and leas with high poverty rates ? . should the expenditure factor continue to play a major role in the title i - a formulas ? . should there be some consolidation of the four different allocation formulas ? . should the authorization level for title i - a continue to be specified for future years , and if so , at what levels ? . should the effort factor in the efig formula be modified ? . should the equity factor in the efig formula be modified ? . title i - a grants to puerto rico would be substantially higher if remaining special constraints were removed . should the temporary assistance to needy families ( tanf ) formula factor be eliminated ? . for the allocation of funds to states and leas , esea title i - a has four separate formulas: the basic , concentration , targeted , and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas . once these funds reach leas , they are no longer treated separately ; they are combined and used without distinction for the same program purposes . distinctive allocation patterns illustrated in table 7 , all of which will be discussed further in the issue analyses at the end of this report , include the following: grants per formula child are much higher than average under the targeted and efig grant formulas for the selected leas with very large numbers of formula children ; the selected leas with very high percentages of formula children receive higher than average grants per formula child under the targeted and efig formulas , but much lower than the leas with very large numbers of formula children , partially due to their treatment under these formulas but primarily because they are located in states with low expenditure factors ; the selected leas in minimum grant states receive higher grants per formula child than leas in any other category under all formulas except possibly concentration grants ; the selected leas with relatively large numbers , but relatively low percentages , of formula children receive concentration , targeted , and efig grants per formula child that are above the national average , in spite of their low formula child percentages ; and the selected leas with low numbers and percentages of formula children receive grants per formula child that are well below average under all formulas except basic grants . with respect to the allocation of funds to schools , it would be theoretically possible for the affected leas to comply with the multi - county lea provision of title i - a by either establishing varying school eligibility thresholds in each county , then allocating the same dollar amount per low - income child to each eligible school , or by setting the same eligibility threshold for schools lea - wide and allocating varying amounts per low - income child to eligible schools in each county , or a combination of these two types of adjustments . arguments in favor of the current special rule regarding multi - county leas include: the individual counties of new york city have been treated as separate entities in the allocation of title i - a funds to ( although not always within ) the city ever since the program was initiated in 1965 ( previous to implementation of the current multi - county lea policy , grants were calculated nationwide by county ) .
