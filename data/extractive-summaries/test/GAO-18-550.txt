poorly defined key performance parameters can increase the risk that end users — such as border patrol agents or first responders in a disaster — receive capabilities that do not meet their missions . you asked us to examine dhs's components' requirements development practices . we selected this non - generalizable sample of programs based on different factors , such as the acquisition phase and component to have a mix of the types of programs that we reviewed . we focused on the presence of policies for requirements development , independent requirements organizations , and requirements - specific workforce and training in components as our past work on major acquisitions has shown that these are the fundamental building blocks required to develop well - informed operational requirements . the number and cost of acquisition programs vary by component . dhs concurred and implemented our recommendation . among the seven dhs components we reviewed , each of which is responsible for managing major acquisition programs , only the u.s. coast guard has a formalized policy in place for developing requirements . of the other six components , some are developing such policies and others rely on jrims guidance . dhs officials indicated to us that one factor which contributes to a component's lack of finalized requirements policies is the prioritization of starting an acquisition over developing requirements . dhs officials said that in the past , some program offices would contract out the capability assessment and requirements development , have them approved by dhs , but not use the resulting documentation to guide the acquisition . two component requirements officials told us that their components' previous acquisition and requirements processes focused on obtaining funding before developing requirements . without component - level requirements policies that are aligned with the jrc and jrims standards , dhs is missing an opportunity to help ensure that components' programs are set - up from the beginning to meet end user needs and close capability gaps . the three components that established requirements organizations did so at various times . regardless of size , components need to ensure that requirements development is independent of acquisitions in order to guard against possible bias by acquisition officials toward a specific materiel solution . until the components assess their needs and take appropriate action , acquisition programs may continue to be at risk of not meeting end user needs , as they will not have a trained workforce to develop requirements . as most components recognize the need for requirements development , it is important that they assess their needs for a workforce and align those needs with training to develop a workforce that can help ensure that requirements match end user needs . however , dhs remains at risk until such training and certification are fully implemented throughout dhs and its components .  ( recommendation 25 ) . this report discusses ( 1 ) how often selected department of homeland security ( dhs ) programs changed requirements ; and assesses the extent to which the selected components have ( 2 ) developed policies for requirements development , ( 3 ) established independent requirements organizations , and ( 4 ) taken steps to assess and train a requirements workforce . we assessed the components' requirements development practices against gao's standards for internal control and additional supporting criteria .
