some of the largest federal programs , including medicare , social security , and postal services , are funded through trust funds and other dedicated funds , which link collections that have been dedicated to a specific purpose with the expenditures of those collections . although trust funds and other dedicated funds have their own dedicated collections and the ability to retain accumulated balances , these collections do not necessarily fund the full current or future cost of the government's commitments to the designated beneficiaries . this report examines ( 1 ) how the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds in the federal budget have changed over time , ( 2 ) the extent to which federal trust funds and other dedicated funds are supported by their dedicated collections , and ( 3 ) the extent to which federal trust funds and other dedicated funds support mandatory programs , including major entitlement programs . in addition to this report , we are providing an online dataset of accounts that are classified as trust and other dedicated funds by the office of management and budget ( omb ) , which can be accessed on our public website at https: / / www.gao.gov / products / gao - 20-156 . we reviewed agency reports , including agency performance , financial , and budget reports , congressional budget office ( cbo ) trust fund projections , the 2019 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old - age and survivors insurance and federal disability insurance trust funds ( social security trustees ) , the 2019 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance trust funds ( medicare trustees ) , and our prior reports and interviewed officials from each of the case study agencies . an account designated as a “trust fund” by law that is credited with dedicated collections , which can often , but not always , be used without further appropriation action . each department has at least two such accounts . the total balance in federal trust funds and other dedicated funds grew about 13 percent in nominal terms from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2018 . fund balances are affected by complex interactions of various economic , demographic , and programmatic factors , but these changes are reflective of some overarching trends . the medicare supplementary medical insurance trust fund sets medical insurance premium rates for medicare part b to cover 25 percent of expected costs for the year . the roughly 75 percent remaining expected program cost is funded through general revenue . two of our case study accounts did not receive income from general revenue in recent years . even funds that rely primarily on their dedicated collections may not be fiscally sustainable . cbo does not estimate projected balances for public enterprise funds . as overall trust and special fund balances are projected to decrease , our projections and those from the fiscal year 2018 financial report of the united states government , and cbo show that the federal government will have to borrow more from the public to offset the decrease in intragovernmental debt . for example , the social security trust funds have mandatory budget authority , which authorizes the program to continue to make payments to beneficiaries during lapses in appropriations . although entitlements represent a current legal commitment and trust funds and other dedicated funds demonstrate the government's intent to restrict the use of those funds to a specific purpose , the government can change the terms of entitlement programs , including those financed through trust funds or other dedicated funds , by changing the substantive law . to examine trends in the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds , we used office of management and budget ( omb ) budget data to identify the income , outgo ( i.e. , outlays and transfers to another government account ) , and end of year balances for all revolving trust funds , special funds , non - revolving trust funds , and public enterprise funds reported in omb's budget database , omb max , for fiscal years 2014 to 2018 in nominal terms . we found these data reliable for our purposes . mandatory . sequestration status .
