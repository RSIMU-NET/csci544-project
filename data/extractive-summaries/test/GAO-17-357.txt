for example , federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities in conducting fuel reduction projects that span multiple jurisdictions , in some cases under nationwide federal agency programs intended to facilitate such collaboration . the subsequent national cohesive wildland fire management strategy ( cohesive strategy ) , issued in 2014 , provides a nationwide framework designed to more fully integrate fire management efforts across jurisdictions , manage risks , and protect firefighters , property , communities , and landscapes by setting “broad , strategic , and national - level direction as a foundation for implementing actions and activities across the nation.” rather than viewing fire management solely as keeping fire away from communities , the cohesive strategy treats wildland fire as a part of the natural landscape , assuming that it is unavoidable and that communities must take action to become “fire - adapted” — that is , be able to withstand a wildfire without loss of life or property . this report examines ( 1 ) factors federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders cited as affecting federal - nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and ( 2 ) actions federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders said could help improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities . state and local governments can also adopt laws requiring homeowners and homebuilders to take measures to help protect structures from wildland fires . to help provide information about fire prevention , federal agencies work with nonfederal entities . in some cases these factors enhanced collaboration , according to officials , while in other cases they hindered collaboration . some federal officials and stakeholders said that federal and nonfederal entities are reluctant to use the good neighbor authority and the tribal forest protection act of 2004 because the authorities are unclear or because not all agency staff are aware of how to use them . in contrast , some federal officials and stakeholders identified several potential impediments to community engagement . officials and stakeholders also identified actions that , while not necessarily within federal agencies' control , could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities . the cohesive strategy states that its successful implementation depends in part on monitoring and accountability , noting that “a set of national outcome performance measures will allow congress , the national wildland fire management community , and other stakeholders to monitor and assess progress toward achieving the results for each of the three national goals.” this emphasis on monitoring and accountability is consistent with key characteristics we have described for developing and implementing effective national strategies . more broadly , the wildland fire leadership council ( wflc ) — the interagency organization responsible for oversight and leadership in implementing the cohesive strategy ( and which includes the forest service and interior as members ) — has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the cohesive strategy . to help determine the extent to which the goals of the cohesive strategy are being met , we recommend that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior direct the chief of the forest service and the director of the office of wildland fire , respectively , to work with wflc to develop measures to assess national progress toward achieving the strategy's goals . in its letter , and in a subsequent discussion with the forest service audit liaison , the forest service stated that it generally agreed with our findings and recommendation , and that it is committed to implementing the cohesive strategy and will continue to work with wflc and other entities towards reducing the risk of wildland fire on all lands in the united states . interior did not concur with our recommendation , citing three primary areas of disagreement . we also interviewed headquarters officials from each of the five federal land management agencies responsible for wildland fire management — the forest service in the department of agriculture and the bureau of indian affairs , bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , and national park service in the department of the interior — as well as interior's office of wildland fire . we also interviewed representatives of nongovernmental organizations that were identified by federal officials we interviewed or in reports we reviewed as being involved in federal - nonfederal efforts to reduce wildland fire risk .
