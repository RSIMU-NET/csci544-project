since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent anthrax incidents , there has been concern about the ability of the federal government to prepare for and coordinate an effective public health response to such events , given the broad distribution of responsibility for that task at the federal level . the president's proposed homeland security act of 2002 would bring many of these federal entities with homeland security responsibilities — including public health preparedness and response — into one department , in an effort to mobilize and focus assets and resources at all levels of government . in order to assist the committee in its consideration of this extensive reorganization of our government , this statement focuses on titles iii and v of the president's proposal and the implications of ( 1 ) the proposed transfer of specific public health preparedness and response programs currently housed in hhs into the new department , ( 2 ) the proposed transfer of control over certain other public health preparedness assistance programs from hhs to the new department , and ( 3 ) the proposed transfer of responsibility for research and development on chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear threats to the new department . in summary , we believe that the proposed reorganization has the potential to repair the fragmentation we have noted in the coordination of public health preparedness and response programs at the federal , state , and local levels . we expect that , in addition to improving overall coordination , the transfer of programs from multiple agencies to the new department could reduce overlap among programs and facilitate response in times of disaster . we do not believe that the president's proposal is sufficiently clear on how both the homeland security and the public health objectives would be accomplished . federal , state , and local government agencies have differing roles with regard to public health emergency preparedness and response . one of its main functions is to provide support for the primary responders at the state and local level , including emergency medical service personnel , public health officials , doctors , and nurses . although there is a clear need for the new department to have responsibility for setting policy , developing a strategy , providing leadership , and overall coordinating of research and development efforts in these areas , we are concerned that control and priority - setting responsibility will not be vested in those best positioned to understand the potential of basic research efforts or the relevance of research being carried out in other , non - biodefense programs . critical infrastructure protection: significant homeland security challenges need to be addressed . homeland security: responsibility and accountability for achieving national goals . homeland security: a framework for addressing the nation's efforts . national preparedness: technologies to secure federal buildings . national preparedness: integration of federal , state , local , and private sector efforts is critical to an effective national strategy for homeland security . combating terrorism: intergovernmental partnership in a national strategy to enhance state and local preparedness .
