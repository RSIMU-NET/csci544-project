there are approximately 500 va - employed crnas ( va crna ) who provide anesthesia care to veterans in va medical facilities . given the increased demand for crnas and the important role they play in providing anesthesia services in va medical facilities , concerns have been raised about the challenges va may face in making va crna salaries competitive in order to maintain its va crna workforce , particularly in some local markets where the labor market for crnas can be highly competitive . my remarks today are based on this report . specifically , i will ( 1 ) identify workforce challenges that va medical facilities experience related to va crnas , and ( 2 ) identify a key mechanism that va medical facilities have to help make va crna salaries competitive for recruitment and retention purposes and the extent to which va facilities use this mechanism . we visited eight va medical facilities and interviewed chief anesthesiologists , va crnas , hr officers , and other facility officials about their efforts to recruit and retain va crnas . in december 2007 we also reported that va's locality pay system ( lps ) is a key mechanism that va medical facilities can use to determine whether to adjust va crna salaries to help the facilities remain competitive with crna salaries in local market areas . the problems some va medical facilities had fully following va's lps policy , along with the explanations of facility officials , indicated that va had not provided adequate training on its lps policy . as a result , va medical facility officials cannot ensure that va crna salaries have been adjusted as needed to be competitive in local market areas . training on the lps is necessary to help ensure that va medical facilities are competitive as an employer . to improve va's ability to recruit and retain va crnas , we recommended that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the assistant secretary for human resources and administration to expedite development and implementation of a training course on va's lps policy for va medical facility officials responsible for compliance with the policy . va generally agreed with our conclusions and recommendation and stated that it had developed a draft action plan for training staff on this policy and anticipated that an online training course would be available by the end of fiscal year 2008 . on the basis of our survey results , we found that va medical facilities had challenges in recruiting va crnas at their facilities and will likely face challenges in retaining va crnas in the next 5 years due to the number of va crnas projected to either retire from or leave va. va medical facility officials reported in our survey that the recruitment and retention challenges were caused primarily by the low level of va crna salaries when compared with crna salaries in local market areas . the recruiting challenges also affected va medical facility officials' ability to reduce existing va crna vacancy rates at their medical facilities . however , at the eight va medical facilities we visited , we found that although the facilities used va's lps , the majority of them did not fully follow va's lps policy correctly in either 2005 or 2006 . in december 2007 we reported that according to va , the majority — 86 out of 120 — of the va medical facilities that employ va crnas used va's lps to determine whether to adjust salaries of va crnas at their facilities .
