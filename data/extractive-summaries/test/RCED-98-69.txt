the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) , the component of the national institutes of health that does research on environment - related diseases , moved into a new facility at research triangle park , north carolina , in april 1981 . accordingly , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the quality of the air inside the niehs building when it was first occupied in 1981 , ( 2 ) identify the health effects associated with exposure to formaldehyde , and ( 3 ) describe the current management practices at niehs for air handling and air monitoring . the initial monitoring , which took place on september 28 and 29 , 1981 , found that the formaldehyde levels on the second floor of module a ranged from 0.1 to 0.34 ppm — well below osha's standard in effect in 1981 . niehs officials said that adjustments were made to balance the air flow and introduce more outside air in module a during the first 5.5 months to alleviate respiratory problems that some employees reported . moreover , the effects it has on the eyes and respiratory tract usually pass quickly once the exposure ends . long - term exposure of laboratory animals to formaldehyde at a concentration of 2.0 ppm has not been shown to produce nasal cancer . according to the toxicological profile for formaldehyde , “the overall conclusion to be drawn from these and other studies is that there is not a firm relationship between formaldehyde and the induction of cancers in humans.” the three agencies that are responsible for determining whether substances should be categorized as carcinogens — that is , as cancer - causing substances — have placed formaldehyde in an intermediate classification because of the clear evidence that formaldehyde causes cancer in the nasal linings of laboratory animals and the limited evidence from the epidemiological studies of humans . niehs' current management is more aware of the need to have adequate air handling systems in buildings and to better monitor indoor air levels to reduce employees' exposure to indoor air pollutants . for example , before moving into a recently completed laboratory module at research triangle park , niehs initiated a number of health and safety measures to ensure the quality of the module's indoor air , including improved air handling and monitoring measures and the use of less polluting building materials and furnishings . in addition , according to epa officials , the manufacturing standards for building materials and office furnishings are more stringent today to ensure that the off - gassing levels of chemicals , such as formaldehyde , are much lower than in past years . niehs officials also said that they ensured that the air handling system installed would meet the air exchange rate for the new laboratory space ( i.e. , 100-percent exchange ) recommended by the american society of heating , refrigeration , and air - conditioning engineers , inc. before the new module was occupied by employees in 1996 , niehs conducted several air monitoring tests of all areas of the building to ensure that the air handling system was functioning properly and that any off - gassing of pollutants from the building materials and furnishings was below osha's standards .
