to provide states with fiscal relief and to help maintain state medicaid programs so beneficiaries are assured continuity of services during this most recent recession , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) provided states with $89 billion through an increased federal share of medicaid funding from october 2008 through december 2010 . in a march 2011 report , we reviewed how past economic downturns affected states' ability to fund medicaid , examined the responsiveness of past increased fmap assistance to state medicaid needs , and identified options for adjusting the increased fmap formula for use during future economic downturns . in keeping with the general framework provided in our past reports , we use the period of the most recent national economic downturn — from december 2007 through june 2009 — to evaluate the three components of our prototype formula , including the start of assistance , the methods used to target funds based on states' medicaid program needs , and the end of assistance . the prototype formula we outlined in our march 2011 report provides a more targeted approach than the increased fmap formula used in the recovery act . in response to the mandate , our prototype formula offers an automatic , timely , and targeted option for providing states temporary assistance during national economic downturns . once a threshold number of states show a sustained decrease in their employment - to - population ( epop ) ratio , temporary increases to states' fmaps would be triggered automatically and targeted to each state's medicaid program . the prototype formula would end the temporary assistance once fewer than the threshold number of states shows a decline in their epop ratio over 2 consecutive months . because our prototype formula relies on readily available labor market data to automatically trigger the beginning and end of the increased fmap , assistance would have begun earlier and extended longer than that provided by the recovery act during the most recent national recession . to assist states in addressing both challenges , our prototype formula includes two components for targeting funding: one for a state's increase in unemployment as a proxy for increased medicaid enrollment , and a second for a state's decrease in total wages and salaries as a proxy for the loss of revenue . by providing this predictability to states , an automatic trigger would facilitate budget planning and provide states with greater fiscal stability . to ensure that federal funding efficiently and effectively responds to the countercyclical nature of the medicaid program , congress could consider enacting an fmap formula that is targeted for variable state medicaid needs and provides automatic , timely , and temporary increased fmap assistance in response to national economic downturns . hhs on behalf of the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation ( aspe ) provided written comments on the draft , which are reprinted in appendix v. cms officials stated that they agreed with the analysis and goals of the report , and they emphasized the importance of aligning changes to the fmap formula as closely as possible to individual state circumstances in order to avoid unintended consequences for beneficiaries and to provide budget planning stability for states . in their comments , aspe officials also offered several considerations to guide policy choices regarding appropriate thresholds for timing and targeting of funds . our prototype formula relies on changes in the employment - to - population ( epop ) ratio to identify the start of a national economic downturn , and to provide a trigger for a targeted temporary increase in states' federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) .
