107-16 ) , among other tax cuts , provided for a gradual reduction in the estate tax . under egtrra , the estate tax exemption rose from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009 , and the top tax rate fell from 55% to 45% . the gift tax exemption was , however , restricted to $1 million . as with other provisions of egtrra , the tax revisions expire in 2011 , returning the tax provisions to their pre - egtrra levels . the exemption would revert to $1 million ( a value that had already been scheduled for pre - egtrra law ) and the rate to 55% ( with some graduated rates ) . president obama proposed a permanent extension of the 2009 rules ( a $3.5 million exemption and a 45% tax rate ) , and the house provided for that permanent extension on december 3 , 2009 ( h.r . 4154 ) . at the end of 2010 , a temporary extension for two years , with a $5 million exemption , a 35% rate , and inheritance of unused spousal exemptions was enacted in p.l . one of these proposals , to reform the grantor retained annuity trust ( grat ) , is included in h.r . after a brief description of the estate and gift tax and of options , this report compares the alternatives , focusing largely on a $1 million exemption and 55% rate , a $3.5 million exemption and a 45% rate , and a $5 million exemption and a 35% rate . for 2010 , there is no estate tax , although the gift tax remains and there is a tax on gains accumulated during the decedent's lifetime when assets are sold by heirs ( with a $1.3 million exemption plus $3 million for a spouse ) . an election can be made for 2010 to apply either 2010 or 2011 rules . because the exemption from gains is smaller than the overall estate tax exemption for 2011 , some estates would have lower tax liability by electing the 2011 rules . as indicated earlier , the exemption in 2009 was $3.5 million , the exemption is scheduled at $5 million for 2011 and 2012 , and in 2013 the estate tax will revert to an exemption of $1 million , absent a change in the statute . the level of the exemption affects not only the revenue but the number of estates that are subject to the tax . 4849 , the small business and infrastructure jobs tax act of 2010 . relevant economic issues include the scope and effect of the tax on the total population and the distribution of the tax , the revenue yield , and the potential effects on family businesses , savings , administration and compliance , and charitable giving . while empirical evidence can demonstrate that the estate tax is highly progressive , the degree to which taxes should be applied to large amounts of wealth in pursuit of reducing inequality in society , much like the question of whether it is wrong for death to trigger a tax , is a value judgment . under the proposals under consideration ( the $3.5 million exemption and the $5 million exemption ) , the majority of the tax falls on estates of $20 million or more , which in turn constitute only three - hundredths of 1% of decedents . for the $3.5 million exemption , 45% rate effective in 2009 , 96% of the tax falls on the top quintile of the income distribution , 72% falls in the top 1% , and 42% in the top 0.1% . effects on savings are uncertain in direction but likely small . costs of estate planning and administration are relatively small as a percentage of estate tax revenue . several provisions to deal with perceived abuses might be considered , with the most important one relating to the use of discounts when assets are left to a family partnership and no one heir controls the property .
