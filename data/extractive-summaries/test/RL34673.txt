as of june 2009 , the general schedule ( gs ) covered roughly 59.8% of federal employees . federal employees rise within grades in the gs pay scale based on performance and length of service . the department of defense ( dod ) , however , operates a pay system called the national security personnel system ( nsps ) , which attempts to link pay increases more closely to employee performance without the use of grades or steps . on october 7 , 2009 , house and senate conferees reported a version of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2010 that included language to terminate nsps by 2012 . on october 8 , 2009 , the house agreed to the conference report . the senate agreed to the conference report on october 22 , 2009 . 111-84 ) . dod must now return employees to the pay system in which they were formerly enrolled prior to the installation of nsps . this report reviews the creation of the nsps , examines how nsps operates , and discusses litigation against it . the report then analyzes lessons that can be learned from nsps and that may be applied to future attempts to create a federal performance - based pay system . this report will be updated as necessary . 110-181 ) was enacted . more specifically , the law required nsps employees with satisfactory ratings to receive at least 60% of the annual pay increase given to gs employees , and ensured that all employees receive a pay supplement to keep pace with growing labor costs . each employee in the nsps system is assigned to a career group , a pay band , and a pay schedule . prior to his election on november 4 , 2008 , then - presidential candidate barack obama wrote a letter to afge president john gage saying that he had "several concerns about the nsps pay system," including "restrictions of bargaining rights , the disconnection between pay and performance despite what employees have been told , the requirement that performance ratings be pushed into a forced distribution , or bell cure , the suppression of wages by permitting bonuses to be paid instead of base salary increases , and the virtual elimination of merit consideration in the promotion process. . on october 28 , 2009 , president obama signed into law a bill that eliminated nsps ( p.l . the areas cited for possible improvement were as follows: to involve employees in the system's design and implementation ; to link employee objectives and the agency's strategic goals and mission ; to train and retrain employees in the system's operation ; to provide ongoing performance feedback between supervisors and employees ; to better link individual pay to performance in an equitable manner ; to allocate agency resources for the system's design , implementation , and administration ; to include predecisional internal safeguards to determine whether rating results are consistent , equitable , and nondiscriminatory ; to provide reasonable transparency of the system and its operation ; and to impart meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance . dod is one of many federal departments and agencies seeking to create a more effective workforce . congress may choose to keep the gs as the primary pay system for federal employees , or it may choose to create a new performance - based pay system in the future .
