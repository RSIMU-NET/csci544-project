according to fema — a component within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — these disasters affected 47 million people , or about 15 percent of the nation's population . fema has obligated billions of dollars on contracts in response to the 2017 disasters . according to our analysis of federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) data , federal agencies had obligated about $9.5 billion in response to the three 2017 hurricanes and the california wildfires as of june 30 , 2018 — the most recent and complete data available . fema obligated about $2.9 billion of this total through advance contracts , and roughly an additional $1.6 billion through post - disaster contracts . my statement today addresses key challenges fema faced contracting for goods and services in response to these disasters . for the reports cited , among other methodologies , we reviewed fpds - ng data through june 30 , 2018 — the most recent and complete data available — to identify fema contract obligations for the 2017 disasters . we also analyzed fema guidance and documentation and interviewed fema officials to discuss the use of contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters . however , in december 2018 , we found that fema used bridge contracts for at least 10 of its advance contracts used in response to the 2017 disasters — with some of these contracts lasting for several years . dhs concurred with these two recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address them . coordination is critical to ensuring that states and localities have their own tools in place to facilitate disaster response , and that contracting needs are clearly communicated and considered among federal agencies . yet without a centralized and up - to - date resource on advance contracts , fema contracting officers and their state and local counterparts may not be able to effectively communicate about advance contracts and use them to respond to future disasters . given fema's recent emphasis on the importance of states and localities having the capability to provide their own life - saving goods and services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster , we concluded that clearly communicating consistent and up - to - date information on the availability and limitations of federal advance contracts is imperative to informing state and local disaster response efforts . as the federal disaster coordinator , fema obtains requirements from states and localities . it then tasks the appropriate federal agencies with specific missions , based on their emergency support functions . further , a fema official told us that contracting considerations are not necessarily built into mission assignments . in our april 2019 report , we made two recommendations , including that gsa , in coordination with dod and dhs , assess whether the criteria in the current nia code agreement meets the long - term needs for high visibility events and account for the needs of users , such as fema , other agencies , and congress ; and in the interim , dhs , in coordination with dod and gsa , should keep the existing nia codes for disasters open , reopen the nia codes for hurricanes harvey , irma , florence , and michael , and request that agencies retroactively update applicable contract actions to reflect these codes , to the extent practicable . dhs did not comment on that recommendation . our work has shown that without effective planning on the use of contracts , fema may face challenges in quickly providing critical goods and services to survivors following a disaster . implementing our recommendations to update its planning guidance and advance contract strategy ; assess acquisition workforce needs ; improve coordination with state , local , and federal partners ; and improve tracking of disaster contracting actions will help fema overcome key challenges it faces in contracting during a disaster , and improve future response efforts .
