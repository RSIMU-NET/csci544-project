this report discusses the impact that peace operations have on u.s. military forces , force structure limitations that may affect the military's ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations , and options for increasing force flexibility and response capability . the continuing force drawdown has compounded challenges for the u.s. military in responding to extended peace operations . the adverse impact on these support forces has been further exacerbated because the army frequently borrows people from one unit to supplement another that lacks sufficient personnel to deploy and assigns some personnel to the same operation more than once , or to consecutive operations , because of the high demand for their capability . certain navy and marine corps units have experienced increased operating tempo and reduced time to prepare for deployments due to their participation in peace operations . these capabilities would be needed in a major regional conflict . although planners have been able to minimize the use of these forces in peace operations , they have had to use a large portion of some of the army's cfp 1-3 support forces in large - scale and / or multiple peace operations because there is a limited number of such forces in the active component . in order to redeploy ground personnel and equipment from the peace operations , the already limited number of airlift assets flying from the united states to the mrc would have to divert to the peace operation , in some cases pick up personnel and equipment , and take them to the mrc . there are options available to allow dod to meet the demands of participation in numerous and / or sizable sustained peace operations on military forces while maintaining the capability to rapidly respond to mrcs . making greater use of the reserves would ease the burden on army active support forces and air force airlift and combat forces .
