these issues relate to ( 1 ) the reasonableness of cost structures and agent practices in the title insurance market that are not typical of other insurance markets ; ( 2 ) activities identified in recent investigations that may have benefited real estate or other professionals rather than consumers ; and ( 3 ) proposed regulatory changes that would affect the way that title insurance is sold . we also had discussions with officials from national organizations whose members are involved in the marketing or sale of title insurance ; the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) ; the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) ; several state regulatory officials ; title insurers and agents ; and industry consultants . first , while the amount of premium paid to or retained by title agents — generally to pay for title search and examination costs and agents' commissions — is commonly title insurers' largest expense , most states do not take these costs into account during premium rate reviews . second , although title agents play a key role in the underwriting process , the extent to which state insurance regulators review their operations is unclear . few states regularly collect information on title agents' operations , and three states do not license title agents . third , while the competition among agents for their share of the business can be intense , the extent to which a competitive environment that benefits consumers exists within the title insurance market is also not clear . consumers generally lack the knowledge necessary to “shop around” for a title insurer and often rely on real estate professionals for referrals that may not always be the most cost - effective choices . fourth , real estate brokers , lenders , and builders are increasingly becoming full or partial owners of title agencies in what are called “affiliated business arrangements.” these arrangements may benefit consumers to some extent , but also create potential conflicts of interest . in addition , recent state and federal investigations have identified potentially illegal activities — primarily involving alleged kickbacks — that also merit further study . the investigations alleged instances of real estate agents , mortgage brokers , lenders , and attorneys receiving referral fees ( or other inducements ) in return for steering business to particular title insurers or agents . these activities may have violated federal or state anti - kickback laws . participants used several methods to convey the fees or inducements , including captive reinsurance agreements , allegedly fraudulent business arrangements , and free or discounted business services . for example , hud is considering revisions to regulations that implement the real estate settlement procedures act ( respa ) , and naic is considering changes to the model laws for title insurers and title agents . we identified several important items for further study , including the way policy premiums are determined , the role played by title agents , the way that title insurance is marketed , the growth of affiliated business arrangements , and the involvement of and coordination among the regulators of the multiple types of entities involved in the marketing and sale of title insurance . instead , they often rely on the advice of a real estate or mortgage professional in choosing a title insurer . for example , one state insurance regulator with whom we spoke told us that the agency coordinated to some extent with the state real estate commission and at the federal level with hud , but only informally . these involve a “shell” title agency that generally has no physical location , employees , or assets , and does not actually perform title and settlement business . as a result , the insurer allegedly did not issue 6,400 title policies to consumers who had paid for them . in june 2005 , hud announced that it was again considering revisions to the regulations . finally , some consumer advocates have suggested that requiring lenders to pay for the title policies from which they benefit might increase competition and ultimately lower costs for consumers , because lenders could then use their market power to force title insurers to compete for business based on price .
