at the same time , three current technology portal monitors were also tested . to ensure that dhs's substantial investment in radiation detection technology yields the greatest possible level of detection capability at the lowest possible cost , in a march 2006 gao report , we recommended that once the costs and capabilities of asps were well understood , and before any of the new equipment was purchased for deployment , the secretary of dhs work with the director of dndo to analyze the costs and benefits of deploying asps . my testimony is based upon our october 2006 report that evaluated dndo's cost - benefit analysis . in summary , dndo's 2006 cost - benefit analysis does not provide a sound analytical basis for its decision to purchase and deploy the new advanced spectroscopic portal monitor technology . regarding the performance of the portal monitors: instead of using the results of its performance tests conducted in 2005 , dndo's analysis simply assumed that asps could detect highly enriched uranium 95 percent of the time , a performance level far exceeding the capabilities of the new technology's current demonstrated capabilities . to determine the current generation of portal monitors' performance in detecting heu , dndo used data from limited tests carried out in 2004 that test officials concluded was unreliable for such purposes . dndo's analysis of the new technology portal monitors' performance was deficient because it focused on detecting and identifying heu , but did not fully consider other dangerous radiological or nuclear materials . in comparing the costs of the new and current technologies , the procurement costs of the current generation portal monitors were highly inflated because dndo assumed a unit cost of about $131,000 , while the contract price at the time of the analysis was about $55,000 . according to officials who manage the contract , it was to expire and while they expected portal monitor prices to increase , they did not believe the cost would be as much as the price used in dndo's analysis . dndo stated that the primary benefit of deploying the new portal monitors is reducing unnecessary secondary inspections . however , dndo's analysis did not fully estimate today's baseline costs for secondary inspections , which makes it impossible to determine whether the use of the new portal monitors as currently planned will result in significant cost savings for these inspections . the new portal monitor contract price has exceeded dndo's total cost estimate by about $200 million . the cost - benefit analysis shows the total cost for deploying both current and new portal monitors to be about $1 billion . however , in july 2006 , dhs announced that it had awarded contracts to develop and purchase up to $1.2 billion worth of the new portal monitors over 5 years . dndo's cost - benefit analysis omitted many factors that could affect the cost of new portal monitors , such as understating the life - cycle costs for operating and maintaining the equipment over time . dhs is developing new portal monitors , known as asps that , in addition to detecting nuclear or radiological material , can also identify the type of material . for these reasons , dhs's cost - benefit analysis does not meet the intent of our march 2006 report recommendation to fully assess the costs and benefits before purchasing any new equipment .
