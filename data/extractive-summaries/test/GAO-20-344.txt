improper payments — payments that should not have been made or that were made in incorrect amounts — continue to be an area of fiscal concern in the federal government . improper payments have been estimated to total almost $1.7 trillion government - wide from fiscal years 2003 through 2019 . from fiscal years 2003 through 2016 , a government - wide improper payment estimate and rate had been included in the government - wide financial reports based on the programs and activities that reported estimates . however , government - wide financial reports for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 did not include a government - wide improper payment estimate or improper payment rate . the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 ( ipera ) , among other things , requires federal agencies' inspectors general ( ig ) to annually determine and report on whether the agencies under their jurisdiction have complied with ipera criteria . this report ( 1 ) summarizes federal agencies' reported improper payment estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 , and the reasons they identified for substantial changes between years , and ( 2 ) discusses the extent to which chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) agencies complied with the six ipera criteria for fiscal year 2018 , and overall ipera compliance trends evident for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 , as reported by their igs . based on the cfo act agencies' afrs and pars and their igs' ipera compliance reports for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 , we identified the agency programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years as of fiscal year 2018 and the related estimate of improper payments associated with those programs for fiscal year 2018 . the six criteria are as follows: 1. publish a financial report in the form and including all content required by omb — typically an afr or a par — for the most recent fiscal year , and post that report on the agency website ; 2. conduct a program - specific risk assessment , if required , for each program or activity that conforms with ipia , as amended ; 3. publish improper payment estimates for all programs and activities deemed susceptible to significant improper payments ; 4. publish corrective action plans for those programs and activities assessed to be susceptible to significant improper payments ; 5. publish and meet annual reduction targets for all programs and activities assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments ; and 6. report a gross improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for each program and activity for which an improper payment estimate was published . however , the government's ability to understand the full scope of its improper payments is hindered by incomplete , unreliable , or understated estimates ; risk assessments that may not accurately assess the risk of improper payment ; and noncompliance with criteria listed in ipera . key information contained in agency afrs and pars regarding the types and causes of fiscal year 2019 estimates of improper payments , and reasons for significant changes in reported estimates from fiscal year 2018 , are summarized as follows: the $175 billion total reported government - wide estimates for fiscal year 2019 is broken down per omb's paymentaccuracy.gov data call instructions by type as follows: overpayments , totaling about $79.1 billion ( approximately 45.2 underpayments , totaling about $12.9 billion ( approximately 7.4 unknown , totaling about $74.1 billion ( approximately 42.4 technically improper due to statute or regulation , totaling about $8.7 billion ( approximately 5 percent ) . based on the igs' fiscal year 2018 compliance reports , agencies were most frequently reported as noncompliant with the ipera requirement to publish and meet annual targets for improper payment reduction . out of the 14 agencies for which this requirement was applicable , igs for eight agencies ( 57 percent ) reported that their agencies were noncompliant . out of the 15 agencies for which this requirement was applicable , igs for five agencies ( 33 percent ) reported that their agencies were noncompliant . improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $78 billion , representing approximately 52 percent of the $151 billion government - wide reported improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2018 .
