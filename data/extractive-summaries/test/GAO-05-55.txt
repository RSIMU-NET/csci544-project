accordingly , these alternative financing mechanisms have been used by agencies to acquire assets by spreading the cost over a number of years in their budgets . partnerships must conform with omb's scorekeeping instructions . espcs finance energy - saving capital improvements such as lighting retrofits and ventilation systems for federal facilities without the government recording the full cost up - front . although these arrangements represent long - term commitments , funds for espcs are obligated on an annual basis . for example , case study agencies incurred a higher rate of interest by using espcs and partnerships than if they had obtained that same capital through timely , full , and up - front appropriations . however , there are insufficient data to measure this effect . third - party financing can make it easier for agencies to manage in the short term within a given amount of budget authority but may have additional long - term costs . such relationships increase the need for effective implementation and monitoring by agencies to ensure the government's interests are protected . officials explained that their agencies did not request full , up - front appropriations since appropriations might not have been made available in a timely manner and the use of espcs had been authorized . one or more of the following features were used by case study agencies: ( 1 ) the transfer of government land to third parties , ( 2 ) use of a third - party rather than the u.s. treasury to finance assets over time , ( 3 ) use of short - term leases for potentially long - term needs , ( 4 ) noncash transactions , ( 5 ) contractually guaranteed savings , and ( 6 ) statutory authority to enter into espcs without funds to obligate the full contract price . using a proxy of their cost to the government , ecms obtained through espcs we reviewed at the navy and gsa cost between 8 and 56 percent more than the same ecms funded through up - front appropriations . implementation and monitoring of espcs is a relatively uniform process . since partnerships take a variety of forms , their implementation and monitoring is more complex . the objectives of this study were to determine ( 1 ) what specific attributes of energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnerships ( partnerships ) contributed to budget scoring decisions , ( 2 ) the costs of financing through espcs and partnerships compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and ( 3 ) how espcs and partnerships are implemented and monitored . however , we exclude m&v from our proxy estimate of the cost if the ecms were acquired through timely , full , and up - front appropriations because agency officials told us that m&v is an expense that would not be incurred if the ecms were acquired through timely , full , and up - front appropriations . we recognize that it is not always possible to undertake energy conservation measures as stand - alone projects .
