given a large - scale organizational change initiative , such as the national given a large - scale organizational change initiative , such as the national security personnel system ( nsps ) , is a substantial commitment that will security personnel system ( nsps ) , is a substantial commitment that will take years to complete , it is important that the department of defense take years to complete , it is important that the department of defense ( dod ) and congress be kept informed of the full cost of implementing ( dod ) and congress be kept informed of the full cost of implementing nsps . 12 , 2005 ) . federal financial accounting standards state that reliable information on the costs of federal programs and activities is crucial for effective management of government operations and recommend that full costs of programs be reported so that decision makers have information necessary to make informed decisions on resources for programs , activities , and outputs , and to ensure that they get expected and efficient results . according to the standards , the full cost of a program or activity includes both those costs that are specifically identifiable to carry them out , or direct costs , and those costs that are common to multiple programs or activities but cannot be specifically identified with any particular program or activity , or indirect costs . while the standards emphasize that cost information is essential for managing federal programs , their activities , and outputs , the standards also provide that items may be omitted from cost information if that omission would not change or influence the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the cost information . dod's estimate included several broad cost categories . for example , peo and component officials agreed that the estimate does not include the full salary costs of all civilian and military personnel who directly support nsps activities departmentwide and any of the direct costs that the various organizations and defense agencies expect to incur to implement the system , such as salaries and benefits for employees who work directly on nsps activities and materials and supplies used in nsps activities . the total amount of funds dod has expended or obligated to design and implement nsps during fiscal years 2005 through 2006 cannot be determined because dod has not established an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that all these costs are fully captured . this guidance does not , however , define the direct and indirect costs that dod requires the components to capture . gao first designated dod financial management as high risk in 1995 . based on discussions with peo and component officials and our review of the quarterly reports of nsps implementation costs submitted for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , the components' official appropriation accounting systems do not capture the total amount of funds reported expended or obligated to design and implement nsps . without a full cost estimate , decision makers within dod and congress will not have the complete cost information they need to make decisions about whether adequate resources are being provided for implementing nsps . without an effective oversight mechanism , dod and congress do not have adequate visibility over the actual cost to design and implement nsps . while the peo does capture funds it expended or obligated to design and implement nsps , we continue to believe that the total amount of funds dod has expended or obligated to design and implement nsps cannot be determined because dod has not established an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that the cost information reported is accurate and complete . we interviewed officials from the peo and the nsps program management offices for the navy ( which is also responsible for the marine corps ) , the army , the air force , and the washington headquarters services to discuss how they had interpreted the guidance directing them to estimate nsps costs , and we obtained and reviewed documents of the estimates provided by the nsps program management offices to the peo .
