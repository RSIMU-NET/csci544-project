however , market timing can constitute illegal conduct if , for example , it takes place as a result of undisclosed agreements between mutual fund investment advisers ( companies that provide management and other services to mutual funds ) and favored customers who are permitted to trade frequently and in contravention of stated company trading limits . more specifically , my testimony covers ( 1 ) the reasons that sec did not detect the market timing abuses at an earlier stage and lessons learned from the agency not doing so , ( 2 ) the steps sec has taken to strengthen its oversight of the mutual fund industry and strengthen industry business practices , and ( 3 ) enforcement actions taken by sec and criminal prosecutors in response to these abuses and sec management procedures related to the making of criminal referrals and ensuring staff independence from the mutual fund industry . before september 2003 , sec did not examine fund companies for market timing abuses because agency officials ( 1 ) viewed other activities as representing higher risks , ( 2 ) concluded that companies had financial incentives to control frequent trading because it could lower fund returns , and ( 3 ) were told by company officials that the companies had established controls over frequent trading . first , without independent assessments of controls over areas such as market timing during examinations ( through interviews , reviews of exception reports , reviews of independent audit reports , or transaction testing as necessary ) , the risk increases that violations may go undetected . sec has taken several steps to strengthen its oversight of mutual fund companies , but it is too soon to assess the effectiveness of certain initiatives . to better ensure the independence of company compliance staff , sec recently adopted a rule that requires compliance officers to report directly to the funds' boards of directors . in addition , although the rule also requires compliance officers to prepare annual reports on their companies' compliance with laws and regulations , sec has not developed a plan to routinely receive and review the reports . in contrast , penalties obtained in settlements for securities law violations before 2003 were typically under $20 million . in reviewing a sample of cases involving investment advisers , we found that sec followed a consistent process for determining penalties and that it coordinated penalties and other sanctions with interested states . second , sec must develop the institutional capacity to identify and evaluate evidence of potential risks and deploy examination staff as necessary to review controls and potentially detect violations in these areas . for example , academic studies indicated that market timing , while legal , remained a persistent risk prior to september 2003 and by one estimate was costing mutual fund shareholders approximately $5 billion annually in certain funds . third , ensuring the independence and effective operation of mutual fund companies' compliance staff is central to preventing violations of the securities laws , regulations , and fund policies . we also found that routine communication with compliance staff could potentially enhance sec's capacity to detect potential violations at an earlier stage if such staff are forthcoming with relevant information . sec agreed with this recommendation . since nysoag announced its discovery of the trading abuses in the mutual fund industry in september 2003 , sec has brought 14 enforcement actions against investment advisers primarily for market timing abuses and 10 enforcement actions against broker - dealer , brokerage - advisory , and financial services firms for market timing abuses and late trading . without proper documentation , sec cannot readily determine and verify whether staff make appropriate and prompt referrals . however , sec does not require departing staff to report where they plan to work as do other financial regulators . although our may 2005 report found that sec consistently applied its penalty setting procedures in the cases we reviewed , it also identified weaknesses in the agency's procedures relating to the referral of securities cases to other agencies for potential criminal violations and ensuring that departing employees compiled with conflict - of - interest laws and regulations .
