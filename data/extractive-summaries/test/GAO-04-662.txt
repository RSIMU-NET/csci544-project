this report ( 1 ) describes doe's efforts to manage and implement the program since it was transferred from dod , ( 2 ) assesses the challenges that doe faces in achieving its goal of shutting down the reactors , and ( 3 ) identifies doe's current expenditures and projected costs to implement the program . however , u.s. and russian officials expressed concern that the large number of u.s. and russian organizations , 17 , involved in the overall management of the program makes coordination difficult and has led to delays . in addition to minatom , numerous russian participants in the program include the following: rosatomstroi , the primary russian contractor working for minatom on building the replacement fossil fuel plants ; tvel - finance supports wgi on the seversk fossil fuel plant project and is a subcontractor to rosatomstroi ; the siberian chemical combine in seversk operates the two reactors there and owns the fossil fuel plant that doe plans to refurbish ; tomsk teploelectroproekt is a subcontractor to rosatomstroi and is responsible for developing the refurbishment design for the replacement fossil fuel plant at seversk ; the mining and chemical combine operates the reactor in the experimental design bureau for machine building ( okbm ) was involved in the development of many of doe's planned safety upgrades for the reactors and is involved in developing the reactor shutdown plan . doe and u.s. contractor officials also told us that the primary russian contractor , rosatomstroi , has not previously worked with u.s. contractors on large - scale construction projects and does not currently have staff to effectively implement its part of the program , which may lead to additional program delays . final shutdown of russia's three plutonium production reactors is uncertain because doe faces challenges in implementing its program . russia's recent rejection of doe's initiatives to reduce the amount of plutonium being produced by the reactors and to improve the safety of the reactors prior to their shutdown raises serious questions about russia's commitment to the fundamental nonproliferation and safety goals of the program . finally , thousands of russian nuclear workers who are currently employed at the reactors and related facilities will be displaced when the reactors are closed . as of december 31 , 2003 , doe had spent $7.8 million , about 4 percent of the funds available , to begin work on planning and developing the program . in addition , doe officials told us that they expect the final cost of the program to be significantly higher than their initial estimate . to increase the chances for program success by clarifying the existing reactor shutdown agreement , we recommend that the secretary of energy , working with the administrator of the national nuclear security administration and secretary of state , do the following: reach agreement with russia on the steps that must be taken to permanently shut down the reactors and the specific requirements that must be met to complete the replacement fossil fuel plants ; identify any additional costs that may surface as a result of refining the scope of work associated with shutting down the reactors and completing the replacement fossil fuel plants and revise cost and schedule estimates for the program accordingly ; and amend the march 2003 reactor shutdown agreement as soon as practicable to accurately reflect doe's more realistic shutdown dates for russia's three plutonium production reactors . we interviewed officials from doe's office of engineering and construction management and from the elimination of weapons - grade plutonium production program .
