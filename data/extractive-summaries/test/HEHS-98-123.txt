also , all cases terminated because families did not cooperate with ssa in processing the claim , such as by failing to provide requested medical information or to take the child for a consultative examination , will be rereviewed . ssa has not identified how many children may have been awarded benefits on the basis of these less severe listings . we would expect ssa to be monitoring the decisions ; identifying areas of difficulty for adjudicators ; and providing additional clarification , guidance , and training to improve the accuracy of decisions . ssa has made substantial progress in implementing the new childhood definition of disability through its rapid redetermination of most of these cases , its action to ensure that the redetermination process is fair , and its ongoing review of the implementation of the new regulations . moreover , we noted the need to revise the listings 3 years ago . in view of the fact that many of ssa's medical listings for children are outdated and allow eligibility to be based upon multiple standards of severity , we recommend that the commissioner act immediately to update and modify its medical listings to incorporate advances in medicine and science and to reflect a uniform standard of severity . supplemental security income: review of ssa regulations governing children's eligibility for the program ( gao / hehs - 97-220r , sept. 16 , 1997 ) . social security: rapid rise in children on ssi disability rolls follows new regulations ( gao / hehs - 94-225 , sept. 9 , 1994 ) .
