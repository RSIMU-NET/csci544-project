in january 2006 , the 109 th congress enacted the first in a series of legislative provisions to enable certain iraqi and afghan nationals to become u.s. lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) based on their service to the u.s. government . special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment - based admissions under the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) . it discusses the legislative changes to the individual iraqi and afghan special immigrant programs since their initial authorization , provides statistics on visa issuances , and considers challenges that have faced the programs . there are two special immigrant classifications specifically for nationals of iraq and afghanistan: one for individuals who worked as translators or interpreters and one for individuals who were employed by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government in iraq or by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government or by the international security assistance force in afghanistan . a prospective iraqi or afghan special immigrant must submit a petition for classification ; be otherwis e eligible to receive an immigrant visa ; and be otherwise admissible to the united states , as specified . the process of applying for an iraqi or afghan special immigrant visa has multiple steps . to apply , the principal applicant must submit documentation to the department of state ( dos ) , including , among other required information , a letter from the applicant's employer confirming employment ; a letter of recommendation from the applicant's direct u.s. citizen supervisor ; and a statement from the applicant describing the threats he or she received as a result of his or her u.s. government employment . if approval is granted , the applicant receives a chief of mission approval letter . the next step for applicants under the special immigrant programs for iraqis and afghans who worked for , or on behalf of , the united states — and the first step for applicants under the program for translators and interpreters — is to file a petition with the department of homeland security's u.s . the interview is required to determine eligibility for a visa . upon admission to the united states , siv recipients obtain lpr status . while the special immigrant category is unique , it does bear similarities to other admission categories that are authorized by other sections of the ina . through the end of fy2018 , more than 79,000 individuals had been issued special immigrant visas abroad , or been adjusted to lpr status in the united states , under the special immigrant classifications for iraqi and afghan nationals . principal applicants accounted for about 26,000 of the total ; dependent spouses and children accounted for the remaining 53,000 . overlaying this dynamic is the structure of the siv programs themselves , with statutory timeframes and numerical limitations . given the seeming consensus that the u.s. government should assist its iraqi and afghan employees in need , an ongoing question for congress is whether the existing siv provisions are sufficient to accomplish this , or whether further extensions of the temporary siv programs for iraqis and afghans who worked for , or on behalf of , the u.s. government , or other changes to the siv provisions are warranted . the tables here present visa issuance data under this program for iraqis and afghans separately . these are dependents ( 477 in total ) who received a special immigrant visa or adjusted status under these programs and are iraqi or afghan nationals but were born in a third country .
