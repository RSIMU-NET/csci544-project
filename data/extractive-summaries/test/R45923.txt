for at least four decades , congress has been concerned about the coast guard's ability to maintain an adequate staff of experienced marine safety personnel with technical knowledge of vessel construction and accident investigation . recent incidents , particularly the 2015 sinking of the u.s. - flag cargo ship el faro with the loss of 33 lives during a hurricane near the bahamas , have revived questions about the coast guard's persistent difficulty with hiring and training a marine safety workforce . the safety inspections of the vessel were found to have been inadequate . in the hamm alert maritime safety act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-265 , â§210 ) , congress directed the coast guard to brief congressional committees of jurisdiction on its efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff , the staff responsible for ensuring that vessels are meeting safety standards . in the frank lobiondo coast guard authorization act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-282 , â§501 ) congress requested a report from the coast guard detailing the courses and other training a marine inspector must complete to be considered qualified , including any courses that have been dropped from the training curriculum in recent years . accident investigation . the prevention policy workforce is especially critical for the commercial u.s. - flag fleet because a majority of this fleet is much older than the 15 to 20 years of age at which ships in the worldwide oceangoing fleet are typically scrapped . in general , older vessels require more frequent inspection ; the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) raised questions about the quality of the coast guard's inspections in its investigation of the el faro sinking , after which the coast guard revoked the safety certificate for another vessel of the same design and similar age , forcing its removal from service . vessels transporting cargo or passengers domestically ( from one u.s. point to another u.s. point ) must be u.s. - built , as required by the jones act . congress's request for information about the coast guard's inspection staff comes at a time when the number of vessels requiring inspection is increasing by about 50% because towing vessels have been added to the list . congress has been increasing the agency's role in fishing vessel safety as well , putting additional demands on the safety workforce . adding to the coast guard's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals , whose siting , operations , and security are partly or entirely under coast guard jurisdiction , as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel . the coast guard repeatedly has made statements in recent decades laying out its plans to improve the quality of its inspection workforce . as employees of a military organization , coast guard personnel typically change mission assignments and / or locations every two or three years , so they do not develop the knowledge and experience required of a proficient marine inspector or investigator . consequently , each commandant's initiative or plan to revamp marine inspections has stated a goal of boosting the civilian inspector and investigator workforce and creating more attractive long - term career paths by extending promotion potential . however , a perception inside the agency that marine safety is an area that retards promotion could be thwarting efforts to boost the inspection workforce . this is asserted in a study by a career coast guard official who spent his last several years working in human resources for the agency: [t]he coast guard's internal manpower management processes are considered to be at odds with the need to build and maintain a competent marine safety officer corps â¦ the perception for decades is that it is difficult for marine safety officers to succeed in the coast guard's military officer promotion system . civilian agencies with inspection workforces covering technically demanding industries also have had difficulty retaining experienced staff .
