officials who serve in senior or acquisition positions and then leave dod for jobs with defense contractors are subject to laws restricting their new employment activities . in response , this report ( 1 ) provides information on how many former dod military and civilian personnel worked for major defense contractors in 2006 and an estimate of how many of these were former dod senior or acquisition officials who worked on defense contracts for these employers that were the responsibility of their former agency or their direct responsibility at dod and ( 2 ) identifies the practices used to monitor compliance with post - government employment restrictions and the information challenges that contractors and dod face in monitoring the movement of former dod employees to defense contractors . to estimate how many former dod officials subject to post - government employment restrictions these contractors may have assigned to work on dod contracts related to their former dod positions , we drew a stratified random sample of former dod officials for whom contractor - provided information indicated direct employment in 2006 and used a questionnaire to obtain job histories ( both dod and contractor ) from their contractor employers . while there may be proper justification for their post - government employment with a contractor , on the basis of this sample we estimate that at least 422 individuals could have been working on defense contracts directly related to their former dod agency and we estimate at least nine could have been working on the same defense contracts for which they had program oversight responsibilities or decision - making authorities while at dod . specifically , our analysis of the status of major defense contractors' employment of former dod officials in 2006 , which was based on matching contractor - supplied information with dod personnel data , found that the contractors employed a total of 1,263 former dod senior and acquisition officials , while our match of irs information and dod personnel data showed the contractors employed a total of 2,435 former dod officials , or almost twice as many . in our view , and dod ethics and procurement officials agree , the information currently available to dod from providing written ethics opinions to former dod senior and acquisition officials who request them regarding prospective employment restrictions has limited utility for monitoring compliance with post - government employment restrictions once former dod officials go to work for defense contractors for several reasons: while officials have been encouraged to seek an ethics advisory opinion , they were not required to obtain them , nor were contractors required to ask for them ; dod's record - keeping for its written ethics opinions is decentralized at the many defense ethics offices that issued them ; and dod lacks a mechanism for providing the information to contracting officers or program managers for a particular contract . key contributors to this report are listed in appendix vi . the survey was designed to obtain information on contractors' reported practices to ensure awareness and compliance in various key ways such as ( 1 ) how contractors identified new hires with potential post - government employment restrictions , ( 2 ) how they tracked post - dod assignments of former dod officials during their cooling off periods , ( 3 ) whether they collected and maintained copies of dod ethics advisory letters for former dod officials , and ( 4 ) whether they provided training in post - government employment restrictions to various employee categories in their workforce . we analyzed responses from the 47 contractors who responded to the survey .
