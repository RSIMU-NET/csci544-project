each year , about 2.5 million people file claims with ssa for disability benefits . if this is the case , adjudicators at the two levels may be making inconsistent decisions that result in similar cases receiving dissimilar decisions . specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the status of ssa's process unification initiative , ( 2 ) ssa's assessments of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels , and ( 3 ) whether ssa's new proposal incorporates changes to improve consistency in decisions between adjudication levels . some of the factors the board suggested as potentially affecting consistency included: the fact that most claims are decided based on a paper review of case evidence without face - to - face contact with an adjudicator until a claimant has an alj hearing , involvement of attorneys and other claimant representatives at the alj hearing , the fact that claimants are allowed to introduce new evidence and allegations at each stage of the appeals process , differences in quality assurance procedures applied to initial - and differences in the training given to aljs and state examiners , and lack of clear and unified policy guidance from ssa . ssa has partially implemented its process unification initiative . finally , the agency also began two tests of process changes to help improve the consistency of decisions , but one ongoing test with design problems is not likely to lead to any conclusive results and the other test has been abandoned . as part of its initiative , the agency has also implemented a quality review of alj decisions , but the review has not proved useful for identifying any new changes to ssa's policies or training that would help to address the inconsistency of decisions . for example , rather than reviewing a random sample of all alj decisions , this review focused on allowances . the two measures ssa uses to monitor changes in the extent of inconsistency of decisions have weaknesses and therefore do not provide a true picture of the changes in consistency . however , although ssa continues to collect information that would support this analysis , it has not repeated this initial effort , nor has it expanded on it by employing more sophisticated assessment techniques . another tool ssa has not sufficiently employed for identifying areas and causes of inconsistency is in - depth case studies involving both levels of adjudication . however , past difficulties in improving the process , as well as stakeholder concerns about limited resources and other obstacles , indicate that some difficulties may arise in the development and implementation of ssa's new proposal . ssa told us that several aspects of the new proposal may improve the consistency of decisions , and although opinions varied among stakeholder groups , most thought the following four proposed changes have the potential to improve the consistency of decisions between adjudication levels: ( 1 ) requiring state adjudicators to more fully develop and document their decisions , ( 2 ) centralizing the agency's approach to quality control , ( 3 ) providing both adjudication levels with equal access to more centralized medical expertise , and ( 4 ) requiring aljs to address agency reports that either recommend denying the claim or outline the evidence needed to fully support the claim . we provided information on the various reviews and analyses of disability decisions to assess the consistency of decisions between adjudication levels conducted by ssa over the last 10 years , but none of these reviews have clearly identified the causes of inconsistency in decisions between adjudication levels . additional analysis is needed because a myriad of factors , such as changes in the economy , can affect allowance rates .
