nanotechnology — a term encompassing nanoscale science , engineering , and technology — is focused on understanding , controlling , and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers . while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believed by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits , some research results have raised concerns about the potential environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) implications of nanoscale materials . congressionally - mandated reviews of the nni by the national research council ( nrc ) and the president's council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) have concluded that additional research is required to make a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials . nevertheless , most stakeholders agree that these concerns about the potential detrimental effects of nanoscale materials and devices — both real and perceived — must be addressed . proponents maintain that nanotechnology also offers the potential for significant ehs benefits , including: reducing energy consumption , pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions ; cleaner , more efficient industrial processes ; remediating environmental damage ; curing , managing , or preventing deadly diseases ; and offering new materials that protect against impacts , self - repair to prevent catastrophic failure , or change in ways that protect or aid soldiers on the battlefield . some critics are concerned , however , that nanoscale particles might unintentionally pass through the blood - brain barrier causing harm to humans and animals . successfully addressing ehs issues is seen as vital for those potentially exposed to nanoscale materials ( e.g. , consumers , researchers , manufacturing workers , the general public ) , businesses , and investors for a variety of reasons: protecting and improving human health , safety , and the environment ; enabling accurate and efficient risk assessments , risk management , and cost - benefit trade - offs ; ensuring public confidence in the safety of nanotechnology research , engineering , manufacturing , and use ; preventing a problem in one application area of nanotechnology from having negative consequences for the use of nanotechnology in unrelated application areas due to public fears , legislative interventions , or an overly - broad regulatory response ; and ensuring that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnology is believed by many to offer . among its provisions , the bill: requires the nnp to solicit and draw upon the perspectives of the industrial community to promote the rapid commercial development of nanoscale - enabled devices , systems , and technologies and to coordinate research in determining the key physical and chemical characteristics of nanoparticles and nanomaterials that may pose environmental , health , and safety risks ; r equires the nnco and other appropriate agencies and councils to issue guidance to agencies that describes a strategy for transitioning research into commercial products and technologies and how the program will coordinate or conduct research on the environmental , health , and safety issues related to nanotechnology ; requires each participating agency to provide funds to support the work of the nnco .
