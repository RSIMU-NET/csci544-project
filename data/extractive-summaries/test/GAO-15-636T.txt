the environmental research , development , and demonstration authorization act of 1978 ( erddaa ) mandated that epa establish the sab and required the sab to provide the epa administrator with scientific advice as requested . casac was established pursuant to amendments to the clean air act in 1977 to , among other things , provide advice to the administrator with regard to epa's national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) . this testimony reflects our preliminary observations from our ongoing review that examines ( 1 ) the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa and ( 2 ) the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs . responses to the committee's requests for scientific advice were handled by the sab staff office and epa's ocir . epa's written procedures for processing congressional committee requests to the sab are found in the sab charter and in the following two documents that establish general policies for how epa's federal advisory committees are to interact with outside parties: epa policy regarding communication between members of federal advisory committee act committees and parties outside of the epa ( the april 2014 policy ) , and clarifying epa policy regarding communications between members of scientific and technical federal advisory committees and outside parties ( the november 2014 policy clarification ) . the sab charter briefly noted how congressional committees could access sab advice , stating ; “while the sab reports to the epa administrator , congressional committees specified in erddaa may ask the epa administrator to have sab provide advice on a particular issue.” ( gao italics ) beyond what the charter states , however , no epa policy specified a process the administrator should use to have the sab review a congressional request and provide advice . however , under the agencies are to clearly document federal standards of internal control,internal controls and the documentation is to appear in management directives , administrative policies , or operating manuals . specifically , officials told us that epa considers whether the questions are science or policy driven , whether they are important to science and the agency , and whether the sab has already undertaken a similar review . as epa has not fully responded to the committee's two 2013 requests to the sab , by clearly documenting its procedures for reviewing congressional requests to determine which questions should be taken up by the sab and criteria for evaluating requests , the agency can provide reasonable assurance that its staff process these and other congressional committee requests consistently and in accordance with both faca and erddaa . such specificity would be consistent with federal standards of internal control that call for clearly documenting internal controls . by modifying the charter or other policy documents to reflect when it is and when it is not appropriate for the epa administrator to forward the advice to the requesting committee , epa can better ensure transparency in its process . we will continue to monitor these issues and , as we finalize our work in this area , we will consider making recommendations , as appropriate . we plan to issue our final results in june 2015 . the clean air act requires casac to review air quality criteria and existing naaqs every 5 years and advise epa of any adverse public health , welfare , social , economic , or energy effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of naaqs . according to a senior epa official , casac has carried out its role in reviewing the air quality criteria and the naaqs but has never provided advice on adverse social , economic , or energy effects of strategies to implement the naaqs because epa has never asked it to . in a june 2014 letter to the epa administrator , casac indicated that , at the agency's request , it would review the impacts ( e.g. , the economic or energy impacts ) of strategies for attaining or maintaining the naaqs but stressed that such a review would be separate from reviews of the scientific bases of naaqs . according to a senior epa official , the agency has no plans to ask casac to provide advice on adverse effects .
