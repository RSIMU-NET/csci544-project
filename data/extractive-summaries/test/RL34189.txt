the increased international attention given to the situation of north koreans seeking refuge , primarily in china , has led congress to take a greater interest in the refugee situation and the underlying causes within north korea and across its borders . north korea has been viewed as a threat to u.s. interests for a number of important security reasons that go well beyond refugee concerns and human rights issues . the situation raises the questions of what more , if anything , can and should be done — by the united states and the international community — not only to focus attention on the abuses of the dprk regime , but to alleviate the suffering of north koreans . china generally refuses international agencies and non - governmental organizations ( ngos ) access to the north koreans who cross its border ; this and its periodic practice of deportation , have led many to ask about international law and the protection of refugees in china . putting aside the significant humanitarian concerns about north korean refugees , some commentators have advocated the use of refugee flows for the political ends of weakening the regime in pyongyang . south korea recognizes that once refugees are on south korean territory , it has an obligation to protect them ; however , it cannot protect the north korean refugees while they are in china . unfettered travel in north korea is difficult and both countries have demonstrated their ability to control their respective borders . china clearly does not want a political confrontation or fallout with north korea . states accused of human rights violations frequently cite this provision in response to criticisms by other states ( or international organizations ) relating to human rights conditions within their borders . supporters of the nkhra point out the value of having u.s. officials raise human rights issues to the international community . although there were few direct exchanges between high - level north korean and u.s. officials when the six - party talks stalled , a revival in direct bilateral contact may provide more opportunities to discreetly raise human rights concerns . in addition , quiet pressure on other regional countries not to repatriate north korean refugees and to streamline asylum seekers' cases with the south korean government and unhcr could help alleviate humanitarian concerns for fleeing north koreans . the bush administration's hope that a normalization of diplomatic relations between the united states and dprk could begin after the successful elimination of north korea's nuclear weapons and related programs is further demonstrated by discussion of other plans , such as the negotiation of a permanent peace treaty on the korean peninsula , development of a multinational security organization for northeast asia , and economic aid to north korea . the conditions set forth in the burmese freedom and democracy act for the lifting of sanctions show that the sentiment in congress favors maintaining the full range of u.s. sanctions ( once again renewed in august 2007 ) until the ruling state peace and development council ( spdc ) and the burmese military terminate major human rights abuses and make fundamental political concessions to the democratically elected government . these priorities are separate and distinct from whether such persons qualify for refugee status .
