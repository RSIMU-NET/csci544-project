in fiscal year 2017 , the federal government is expected to spend more than $90 billion on information technology ( it ) , including software applications . to address the first objective , we identified four practices for establishing complete inventories . the 24 chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 agencies provided us with their software application inventories . application rationalization is the process of streamlining the portfolio to improve efficiency , reduce complexity and redundancy , and lower the cost of ownership . specifically , 4 agencies fully met all four practices ; 9 agencies fully met three practices and 8 of these partially met the 6 agencies fully met two practices and 5 of these partially met the 2 agencies fully met one practice and partially met the three others , 3 agencies did not fully meet any practice . furthermore , both of its inventories do not include applications used by all of its components . omb's requirement for agencies to complete an it asset inventory by the end of may 2016 greatly contributed to most of the agencies including business systems and enterprise it systems for all of their organizational components and specifying key attributes for them . not accounting for them may result in missed opportunities to identify savings and efficiencies . it is also inconsistent with omb guidance for implementing fitara which requires that cios have increased visibility into all it resources . however , five of the six agencies acknowledged that their processes did not always allow for collecting or reviewing the information needed to effectively rationalize all their applications . while it is encouraging that 13 of the 24 cfo act agencies fully met at least three of the four practices for establishing a complete software application inventory , most could improve their software applications inventories — albeit to varying degrees — by taking steps to fully meet the practices we identified as being either partially met or not met . in addition , while the remaining five agencies' processes did not allow for rationalizing all applications , only one — nasa — had plans to address identified weaknesses . to improve federal agencies' efforts to rationalize their portfolio of applications , we are recommending that: the heads of the departments of agriculture , commerce , education , energy , health and human services , housing and urban development , the interior , labor , state , transportation , the treasury , and veterans affairs ; and heads of the environmental protection agency ; national aeronautics and space administration ; national science foundation ; nuclear regulatory commission ; office of personnel management ; small business administration ; social security administration ; and u.s. agency for international development direct their cios and other responsible officials to improve their inventories by taking steps to fully address the practices we identified as being partially met or not met ; and the secretaries of defense , homeland security , the interior , and labor ; and the director of the national science foundation to direct the cios and other responsible officials to modify existing investment management processes to address applications more completely . specifically , the secretary of defense should direct the responsible official to modify the department's existing processes to collect and review cost , technical , and business information for the enterprise and business it systems within the enterprise information environment mission area applications which are currently not reviewed as part of the department's process for business systems ; the secretary of homeland security should direct the department's cio to identify one high - cost function it could collect detailed cost , technical , and business information for and modify existing processes to collect and review this information ; the secretary of the interior should direct the department's cio to document and implement a plan for establishing policy that would define a standard analytical technique for rationalizing the investment portfolio ; the secretary of labor should direct the department's cio to consider a segmented approach to further rationalize and identify a function for which it would modify existing processes to collect and review application - specific cost , technical , and business value information ; and the director of the national science foundation should direct the cio to consistently document evaluations for all applications and report cost information for them in the roadmap or other documentation . in written comments , the social security administration agreed with our recommendation to the agency , but disagreed with the partially met rating for regularly updating the inventory , including implementing quality controls , stating that it had provided evidence supporting its implementation of the practice . regarding application attributes , we determined that , at a minimum , agencies should have a name , a description , an owner , and function supported for each application . we selected the agencies based on three factors: whether they had an application rationalization process ; in our initial set of structured questions to agencies , we asked whether they had a plan or process for rationalizing applications and selected those that reported having one ; the size of the agency based on fiscal year 2015 it spending ; we selected two large agencies ( i.e. , with spending equal to or greater than $3 billion ) , two medium agencies ( i.e. , with spending between $1 billion and $3 billion ) , and two small agencies ( i.e. , with spending of less than $1 billion ) for a full range of it spending ; and if they were known for effectively rationalizing their applications based on omb observations and our research on it acquisition reform recognizing agencies for their application rationalization efforts .
