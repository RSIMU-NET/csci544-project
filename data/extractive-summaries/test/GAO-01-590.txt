the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , through its federal housing administration ( fha ) , annually insures billions of dollars in home mortgage loans made by private lenders . in 1997 , hud issued its 2020 management reform plan , which provided for downsizing and reforming the department , including its single - family mortgage insurance program . as part of its 2020 reforms , hud consolidated the single - family program's field activities — such as processing mortgage insurance and overseeing lenders — at four new regional homeownership centers and specified resources for the centers . although hud has substantially streamlined fha's single - family mortgage insurance programs , human capital issues remain a concern . because the location of center field office staff was determined more by the location of staff who remained unassigned after the 2020 reorganization than by the centers' needs , the centers have had difficulty making effective use of staff that remain in field offices . hud's deputy assistant secretary for single family housing told us that the centers have difficulty using all of their training funds because the training academy provides the funds late in the fiscal year and then pulls some funds back before the centers have a chance to use them . the centers' reliance on contractors has grown , but the ability of hud staff to monitor contractors has not kept pace . to address the human capital challenges facing hud's homeownership centers , we recommend that the secretary of housing and urban development direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to assess the deployment of the centers' workforce in light of current organizational needs , develop a plan for locating center staff where they are needed , and deploy the staff accordingly ; develop a training curriculum for center staff that ensures that available training funds are allocated and used to develop the skills that the staff need to perform their responsibilities ; and use tools , such as our human capital self - assessment checklist , to develop a strategic human capital management plan for the homeownership centers that considers all areas of human capital management , including the size of the workforce , workforce deployment , training , and oversight of contractors .
