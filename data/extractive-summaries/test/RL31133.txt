to buttress the nation's ability to prosecute a war or armed conflict , congress has also enacted numerous statutes which confer standby authority on the president or the executive branch and are activated by the enactment of a declaration of war , the existence of a state of war , or the promulgation of a declaration of national emergency . it ( 1 ) provides historical background on each of the declarations of war and on several major authorizations for the use of force that have been enacted ; ( 2 ) analyzes the implications of declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force under both international law and domestic law ; ( 3 ) lists and summarizes the more than 250 standby statutory authorities that can come into effect pursuant to a declaration of war , the existence of a state of war , and / or a declaration of national emergency ; ( 4 ) describes the procedures in congress governing the consideration of declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force , including the procedures under the war powers resolution ; and ( 5 ) sets forth in two appendices the texts of all of the declarations of war and the major authorizations for the use of force that have been enacted . the report will be updated as circumstances warrant . from the washington administration to the present , there have been 11 separate formal declarations of war against foreign nations enacted by congress and the president , encompassing five different wars â€” the war of 1812 with great britain , the war with mexico in 1846 , the war with spain in 1898 , the first world war , and the second world war . in each case the enactment of a formal declaration of war has been preceded by a presidential request to congress for such an action , either in writing or in person before a joint session of congress . in each such message requesting a war declaration , the president has cited what he deemed compelling reasons for doing so . that has been the case even if no hostilities actually occur . authorizations for the use of force , in contrast , have not been seen as automatically creating a state of war under international law . but its other legal consequences seemingly have become less determinate . an authorization for the use of force does not automatically trigger any of these standby statutory authorities . but an authorization for the use of force , in itself and in contrast to a declaration of war , does not trigger any of these standby authorities . many of following provisions can be triggered by circumstances other than a declaration of war . under another section of the war powers resolution , congress can also adopt a bill or joint resolution at any time requiring the president to remove the armed forces unless a declaration of war or statutory authorization has been enacted . whereas the primary purpose of the united states , in its relations with all other nations , is to develop and sustain a just and enduring peace for all ; and whereas certain territories in the west pacific under the jurisdiction of the republic of china are now under armed attack , and threats and declarations have been and are being made by the chinese communists that such armed attack is in aid of and in preparation for armed attack on formosa and the pescadores , whereas such armed attack if continued would gravely endanger the peace and security of the west pacific area and particularly of formosa and the pescadores ; and whereas the secure possession by friendly governments of the western pacific island chain , of which formosa is a part , is essential to the vital interests of the united states and all friendly nations in or bordering upon the pacific ocean ; and whereas the president of the united states on january 6 , 1955 , submitted to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification a mutual defense treaty between the united states of america and the republic of china , which recognizes that an armed attack in the west pacific area directed against territories , therein described , in the region of formosa and the pescadores , would be dangerous to the peace and safety of the parties to the treaty: therefore be it resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled , that the president of the united states be and he hereby is authorized to employ the armed forces of the united states as he deems necessary for the specific purpose of securing and protecting formosa , and the pescadores against armed attack , this authority to include the securing and protection of such related positions and territories of that area now in friendly hands and the taking of such other measures as he judges to be required or appropriate in assuring the defense of formosa and the pescadores . congressional priority procedures for amendments sec . reports to congress .
