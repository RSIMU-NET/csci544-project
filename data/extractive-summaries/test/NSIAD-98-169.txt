specifically , this report discusses opportunities for offsetting the budget request for fiscal year 1999 , including the validity of two proposed military construction ( milcon ) projects included in that request . the first account , the dod base closure account , funded brac activities for the 1988 round and the second account , the dod base closure account 1990 , funded brac activities for the 1991 , 1993 , and 1995 rounds . our analysis of the base closure account and the fiscal year 1999 brac budget request raises questions about the need for $131.1 million included in the request . during march and april 1998 , the military services allocated $8.5 million from the 1990 base closure account for brac 1991 environmental requirements that no longer existed ( see table 5 ) . our questions center on the potential ( 1 ) use of unreported proceeds from brac actions , unused funds allocated to the brac 1991 round , and withheld brac appropriations from fiscal year 1998 to offset equivalent amounts of funding included in the 1999 budget request and ( 2 ) need for funding requested for two milcon projects , where the requirements for one project have not been determined and the other has already been funded . specifically , dod stated that ( 1 ) $35.7 million in unreported proceeds generated by brac activities is unavailable to offset fiscal year 1999 requirements because the proceeds have been or will be reprogrammed to cover unfunded requirements , ( 2 ) $54.8 million in unobligated balances is unavailable as an offset since it has already been earmarked for other unfunded requirements , ( 3 ) $40.6 million for two separate milcon projects is unavailable for offset because previously approved actions that were deferred until 1999 still need to be fully funded , and ( 4 ) reductions of this magnitude will eliminate the management flexibility envisioned by the congress and , adversely impact dod's ability to close installations and speed the economic recovery of affected communities . dod's fiscal year 1999 budget request did not reflect $35.7 million in proceeds that was collected but not included in the request . military bases: closure and realignment savings are significant , but not easily quantified ( gao / nsiad - 96-67 , apr .
