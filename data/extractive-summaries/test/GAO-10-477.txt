however , funding is often limited for the indirect costs associated with providing these services ( indirect costs are generally costs such as rent or utilities that cannot be readily identified with a particular service or product ) . as such , we have reported that nonprofits often struggle to cover the costs of doing business , which raises concerns about the long - term financial health and durability of the sector and its ability to effectively deliver federal services and programs . responding to your request for more information on indirect cost reimbursement , especially when federal funding is passed through to nonprofits from other entities such as state and local governments , we reviewed , for selected federal grant programs and nonprofits , ( 1 ) how indirect cost terminology and classification vary , ( 2 ) how indirect costs are reimbursed , and ( 3 ) if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed , steps nonprofits take to bridge the gaps . recognizing that nonprofit organizations have diverse characteristics and accounting practices , the guidance states that it is not possible to specify the types of cost that may be classified as indirect costs in all situations . when grants and grantees classify similar costs differently it can also result in the same cost activity being covered for some nonprofits but not others , and can increase the complexity of administering the grants . these differences , including whether nonprofits are reimbursed at all , largely depend on the policies and practices of the state and local governments that award federal funds to nonprofits . variations in cost coverage exist not only among different grants across different states , but also within the same grant across different states . for some nonprofits the decline comes at a time when their services may be in greater demand , which can further strain resources . many nonprofits compromise vital facilities maintenance and “back - office” support functions , such as information technology systems , to avoid reducing their services . officials at a louisiana nonprofit said that their ability to build a financial safety net is limited because they struggle to cover their costs and do not have money left over to save . factors such as untimely reimbursements and high grant administration costs can place stress on the nonprofit sector , diminishing its ability to continue to provide services to vulnerable populations . one maryland nonprofit official said delays such as these create a “cash - flow nightmare” for her organization . a 2002 study that reviewed prior research on this topic noted that when government agencies are delayed in approving contracts or grant payments , recipient organizations often experience cash flow problems . gao recommends that the director of omb bring together federal , state , and local governments , and nonprofit representatives to propose ways to clarify and improve understanding of how indirect costs should be treated , particularly for grants passed through state and local governments to nonprofits by clarifying the definitions of indirect costs and administrative costs and their relationship to each other and considering ways to help nonprofits improve their understanding and ability to better capture , categorize , report , and recover indirect and administrative costs . key contributors to this report are listed in appendix ii .
