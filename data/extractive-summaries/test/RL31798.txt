data mining involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown , valid patterns and relationships in large data sets . data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors . however , the proliferation of data mining has raised some implementation and oversight issues as well . to be successful , data mining requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output that is created . although data mining can help reveal patterns and relationships , it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patterns . these types of determinations must be made by the user . another limitation of data mining is that while it can identify connections between behaviors and / or variables , it does not necessarily identify a causal relationship . industries such as banking , insurance , medicine , and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs , enhance research , and increase sales . in the public sector , data mining applications were initially used as a means to detect fraud and waste , but they have grown also to be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance . some observers suggest that data mining should be used as a means to identify terrorist activities , such as money transfers and communications , and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves , such as through travel and immigration records . initiatives that have attracted significant attention include the now - discontinued terrorism information awareness ( tia ) project conducted by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) , and the now - canceled computer - assisted passenger prescreening system ii ( capps ii ) that was being developed by the transportation security administration ( tsa ) . other initiatives that have been the subject of congressional interest include the able danger program and data collection and analysis projects being conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) . as data mining initiatives continue to evolve , there are several issues congress may decide to consider related to implementation and oversight . these issues include , but are not limited to , data quality , interoperability , mission creep , and privacy . as with other aspects of data mining , while technological capabilities are important , other factors also influence the success of a project's outcome . 1502 , information regarding the technology and data being used ; information on how the technology would be used and the target dates for deployment ; an assessment of the likely efficacy of the data mining technology ; an assessment of the likely impact of the activity on privacy and civil liberties ; a list and analysis of the laws and regulations that would apply to the data mining activity and whether these laws and regulations would need to be modified to allow the data mining activity to be implemented ; information on the policies , procedures , and guidelines that would be developed and applied to protect the privacy and due process rights of individuals , and ensure that only accurate information is collected and used ; and information on how individuals whose information is being used in the data mining activity will be notified of the use of their information , and , if applicable , what options will be available for individual to opt - out of the activity . these reports would have been required to include a variety of details about the data mining project , including a description of the technology and data to be used , a discussion of the plans and goals for using the technology when it will be deployed , an assessment of the expected efficacy of the data mining project , a privacy impact assessment , an analysis of the relevant laws and regulations that would govern the project , and a discussion of procedures for informing individuals their personal information will be used and allowing them to opt out , or an explanation of why such procedures are not in place . one difference is that the initial description used to partially define data mining is changed to include "a program involving pattern - based queries , searches , or other analyses of 1 or more electronic databases...." another difference is that the data mining reporting requirement excludes data mining initiatives that are solely for "the detection of fraud , waste , or abuse in a government agency or program ; or the security of a government computer system. .
