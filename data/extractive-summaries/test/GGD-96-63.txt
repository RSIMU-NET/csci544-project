as part of our ongoing work examining how federal agencies have used buyouts to downsize the federal workforce , you asked that we compare the projected costs and savings of buyouts with an alternative downsizing strategy , reductions - in - force ( rif ) , over a 5-year period . buyouts would generate over $60,000 ( up to 50 percent ) more in net savings than rifs for each vacated position over the 5 years . employees separated from the federal government through buyouts are typically at higher grade levels than those separated through rifs , thereby producing greater savings in salaries and benefits . however , if employees separated from the federal government through rifs are retirement eligible and do not displace lower - graded employees , savings from rifs could marginally exceed savings from buyouts over a 5-year period . while these comparisons are examples of what savings might accrue for each separated employee under various scenarios , experience at individual agencies will largely depend on ( 1 ) how effectively the agency had planned its workforce restructuring , including the likelihood that bumping and retreating would take place with rifs ; ( 2 ) employee demographics , including who would likely be separated under a rif versus who would likely take a buyout ; ( 3 ) how effectively the agency had used rifs or buyouts to eliminate specific positions ; and ( 4 ) how the agency defined its competitive levels and areas for rifs . in such instances , any savings from buyouts or rifs could be reduced by the cost of refilling the position or contracting out the work . more buyouts may be needed because normal attrition slows considerably during the time period preceding a buyout , since some employees delay their planned separations in order to receive a buyout . these effects included the ability to use buyouts to restructure agency workforces , retain or improve workforce diversity , and avoid lowering productivity and morale .
