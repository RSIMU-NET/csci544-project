the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act of 2000 ( eeoicpa ) was passed by congress , in part , to provide for timely compensation of former nuclear weapons workers who sustained illnesses that could be linked to exposure to toxic substances while employed at a department of energy ( energy ) facility . specifically , we determined whether ( 1 ) internal controls over program payments were adequately designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper payments to contractors would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business and ( 2 ) program payments were properly supported as a valid use of government funds . ssc nola received reimbursement from energy . specifically , contractor services were not adequately monitored , labor categories were not verified , and other direct costs were not adequately reviewed . further , energy did not take steps to ensure that ssc nola implemented appropriate verification procedures or effective compensating control strategies . since the contract did not fully reflect actual duties that were subsequently performed , energy did not have an adequate basis on which to determine if amounts billed for labor were appropriate and consistent with the contract terms . nearly $15 million of $92 million in owa program costs were incurred by subcontractors . further , we questioned whether certain other payments toward the end of the program for furniture and computer equipment , totaling nearly $1.2 million , were an efficient use of government funds . given energy's poor control environment and the fact that we only reviewed selected energy payments , other improper and questionable payments may have been made that have not been identified . the questionable and improper payments we identified during our review represent nearly 30 percent of total program funds spent through september 30 , 2005 . in light of the findings in this report , we recommend that the commanding officer , space and naval warfare systems center , new orleans , reassess the organization's procedures for carrying out its delegated responsibilities in connection with interagency agreements for delegated contract administration responsibilities , including the following: assess the adequacy of the review and approval process for contractor invoices , including ( 1 ) oversight and monitoring of contractor services and linkage of these activities to the invoice review and approval process , ( 2 ) verification that labor hours are billed in the appropriate categories at the appropriate rates , and ( 3 ) determining that contractor travel and other direct costs are in accordance with the contract and applicable federal regulations . in particular , energy ( 1 ) disagreed with our view that it was ultimately responsible for the issues that we identified relating to payments and controls for sea , a contractor obtained through an interagency agreement ; ( 2 ) stated that it was engaging the defense contract audit agency ( dcaa ) to audit the costs of two contractors that we reported as having a number of issues related to improper payments , and that it considers this to be a control that addresses some of our findings ; ( 3 ) disagreed with our findings that energy improperly paid $557,429 to westwood for add - on rates and $98,305 to tdi for base fees ; and ( 4 ) stated that its june 2004 transfer of $21.2 million was proper and that the large purchases of furniture and equipment near the end of the program were also proper .
