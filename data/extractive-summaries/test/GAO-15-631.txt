in particular , state insurance regulators and consumer groups have raised questions about the high cost of lpi , citing investigations and studies saying that the amount of claims that lpi insurers pay does not justify the premium rates . these groups also expressed concerns that borrowers had little influence over the price of lpi because the lender selects the insurer . we also reviewed aggregated financial data that lpi insurers report annually to state regulators to compare premiums and claims data for lpi to that of borrower - purchased insurance , but we determined that the data were unreliable for our purposes . most servicers purchase the same amount of coverage that was available under the lapsed borrower - purchased policy . these services include providing detailed insurance data to help regulators understand insurance sales and practices ; maintaining a range of databases useful to regulators ; and coordinating state regulatory efforts by providing guidance , model laws and regulation , and information - sharing tools . the rules: prohibit servicers from charging borrowers for homeowners lpi unless they have a reasonable basis for believing that the borrower has not maintained homeowners insurance as required by the loan contract ; require all charges to be bona fide and reasonable ( does not cover charges subject to state regulation as the “business of insurance” and those authorized by the flood disaster protection act ) ; require servicers to send two notices to borrowers before placing lpi ; specify the content of the notices with model forms ; generally prohibit servicers from obtaining homeowners lpi for borrowers with escrow accounts for the payment of hazard insurance whose mortgage payments are more than 30 days overdue unless the servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance premiums are paid on time . mortgage servicers and lpi insurers use tracking and notification processes to determine when required coverage lapses and lpi is necessary . servicers and insurers said that they use the tracking and notification systems to ensure that lpi placement is as accurate as possible , but that they must refund premiums when the borrower provides proof of coverage , which occurs on about 10 percent of policies . finally , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) offers flood lpi through its mortgage portfolio protection program ( mppp ) , but servicers generally said that they prefer private flood lpi coverage for a number of reasons , including more comprehensive coverage and lower premium rates . they said that placement rates were often under 2 percent prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis but peaked at about 3 percent at the height of the crisis due to increased delinquencies . by the end of this process , the insurer is generally able to confirm borrower - purchased coverage for most of the mortgages in a servicer's portfolio , but servicers ultimately place new coverage on the approximately 1 percent to 2 percent of borrowers who do not respond to the notifications . they also cited other reasons , including a history of large losses on the property , a change in the condition or risk of the property , the borrower's failure to maintain or repair the property , a misrepresentation of the property's characteristics on the insurance application or other violations of the insurance contract , or a desire by the insurer to limit their concentration of risk in a particular high - risk geographic area . they said that these commissions contribute to higher premium rates . this limited competition , they said , could contribute to higher premium rates . for example , they said lpi offers more limited coverage than borrower - purchased insurance . also , data in some states and for some years were incomplete . given recent state and federal actions regarding the lpi industry , it has become more important for naic and state regulators to have adequate data to effectively oversee the industry . as a result , state and federal regulators lack the comprehensive and reliable data necessary to assess lpi industry practices and premium rates and their effects on consumers . to help ensure that adequate data collection efforts by state insurance regulators produce sufficient , reliable data to oversee the lpi market , we recommend that naic: work with the state insurance regulators to develop and implement more robust policies and procedures for the collection of annual data from lpi insurers to ensure they are complete and reliable ; and work with the state insurance regulators to complete efforts to obtain more detailed national data from lpi insurers . to discuss stakeholder views on the cost of lpi , we interviewed state insurance regulators , consumer advocates , and industry officials about their opinions on the reasons for differences in premium rates between lpi and borrower - purchased insurance and their opinions on the effects on consumers . however , the total number of lpi insurers as well as the total lpi premium volume are unclear because of a lack of comprehensive national data on the lpi industry .
