this agency , located within the department of health and human services , arranges the provision of health care services for native americans across 12 federally designated areas that cover all or part of 35 states . for fiscal year 2005 , the congress appropriated approximately $2.6 billion for health care services to be made available through ihs , which included primary care services ( medical , dental , and vision ) ; ancillary services , including laboratory , diagnostic imaging , and pharmacy services ; and specialty care , including services provided by cardiologists , surgeons , and other physician specialists . primary care , ancillary , and specialty services are offered through a combination of direct care , which is provided on site at ihs - funded facilities , and care purchased from other public and private providers — referred to here as “contract care.” ihs - funded facilities have varied in the health care services they have provided for native americans , and in some cases this has adversely affected the ability of native americans to obtain needed services . we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which primary care services were available to native americans , ( 2 ) the extent to which ancillary and specialty services were available to native americans , ( 3 ) the underlying factors associated with variations in service availability among ihs - funded facilities , and ( 4 ) strategies used by ihs - funded facilities to increase the availability of services . to assess the accessibility of services , we considered ( 1 ) the length of time between the call to make an appointment and the delivery of a service , ( 2 ) the travel distances to facilities , and ( 3 ) the amount of time spent waiting at a facility for services . the 13 facilities we visited generally offered primary care — medical , dental , and vision — services ; however , native americans' access to these services was not always assured . all 13 facilities we visited offered medical services , such as initial physical examinations for pregnant women and well - baby checkups , while 12 facilities offered dental services , such as oral examinations , cleanings , and sealants . twelve of 13 facilities offered vision care . for example , one facility offered cast inlays and crowns only to children . four of these six facilities did not offer inpatient substance abuse treatment to all patients . most of the facilities we visited lacked the equipment necessary for certain ancillary services and had few medical specialists on site . ancillary and specialty services that were unavailable on site or at other ihs - funded facilities could be obtained only through contract care , which was rationed by 12 of the 13 facilities on the basis of relative medical need . five facilities reported that they were unable to pay for any services that were not deemed emergent or acutely urgent ( services categorized as priority level i services in ihs headquarters' guidance ) , and two others paid for only a few additional services , such as cancer screenings . from our visits to facilities and interviews with ihs area officials , we found that differences in the availability of services among facilities were associated primarily with three distinct factors: how a facility was structured , where it was located , and the amount of reimbursements and tribal contributions it received . in terms of facility structure , we found differences in the amount and range of services available on site , depending on the type of facility ( whether it was a hospital , health center , or health station ) , its age , and whether it was tribally or federally operated . three hospitals also offered some specialty services on site — such as some obstetric services — that were not offered on site at the health centers we visited . nature of insurance offered by tribes . for example , four facilities reported that while hospitals generally agreed to offer discounted rates for contract care , physicians were not always willing do so . we received written comments from ihs . in the first tier , we selected 3 of the 12 ihs areas to represent a mix in the size of the population served in the areas , geographic location , health status of native americans in the areas , the entities operating the facilities ( tribal or federal ) , and the contract care dollars as a percentage of total clinical care dollars ( table 8 compares the selected areas to the range across all 12 areas ) .
