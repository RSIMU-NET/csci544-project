cpsc obtains most of its information on injuries from its national electronic injury surveillance system ( neiss ) , which gathers information from a nationally representative sample of about 100 hospital emergency rooms . cpsc estimates product - related injury and death rates by age group , but because neither emergency room nor death certificate data provide complete information about both race and ethnicity and related products , cpsc has not analyzed product - related injury and death rates by race and ethnicity or other characteristics that could identify particularly vulnerable populations . as shown in figure 2 , our analysis of cpsc's neiss data found that race and ethnicity data were not coded in about 31 percent of cases in 2007 . in addition , neiss hospitals that have recorded race and ethnicity information do so inconsistently , in part because of limited cpsc guidance . a panel convened by the national academy of sciences conducted a survey of hospitals and found that many hospitals report collecting race and ethnicity information , but these data are not reported to state and federal programs in a standardized format , and the information reported for racial and ethnic groups other than white and black may be unreliable . cpsc has incorporated some elements of key consumer education practices to provide consumer product safety information to minority populations , such as periodically using consumer and other stakeholder input to inform its outreach efforts , but it has not specifically defined goals or developed measures to assess whether these efforts are effectively reaching minority populations ( see app . cpsc has also identified and established relationships with other organizations to help disseminate consumer safety information to additional minority communities through electronic , broadcast , and print media . some organizations also expressed interest in collaborating more closely with cpsc on its consumer information efforts . cpsc has also established goals for its overall consumer information efforts , but not for its messages targeted to specific populations . cpsc relies on the neighborhood safety network to share product safety information with audiences that can be hard to reach , but the agency has not formally assessed whether these populations are receiving and using the information . despite limited information on racial and ethnic differences in product - related injury and death , cpsc has made some special efforts to deliver some of its consumer information to audiences the agency identified as hard to reach , including minority groups . the objectives of this report were to examine ( 1 ) what is known about the relative incidence of preventable injuries and deaths related to drowning , poisoning , and suffocation associated with products intended for children's use among minority children compared with nonminority children , and ( 2 ) what actions the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) has taken through its public information and education initiatives to minimize child injuries and deaths , including those in minority populations , related to products intended for children's use . in addition , we interviewed representatives of injury prevention programs , consumer groups , and members of cpsc's neighborhood safety network to obtain their views on cpsc's efforts to provide product safety information to minority communities .
