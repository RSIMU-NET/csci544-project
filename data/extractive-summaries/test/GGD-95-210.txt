other functions of the board include choosing the administrator , who generally acts as the fund's manager by keeping the books and records , filing necessary reports with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and calculating nav ; the distributor or “underwriter,” who either sells the fund's shares directly to the public or enters into agreements with broker - dealers or banks that will in turn sell them to retail customers ; the transfer agent , who keeps track of fund shareholders and maintains information about the number of shares owned by investors ; and the custodian , who is responsible for safeguarding the cash and securities assets of the fund , paying for securities when they are purchased by the fund , and collecting the income due when securities are sold . our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the extent and nature of bank and thrift involvement in mutual fund sales , ( 2 ) assess whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds , and ( 3 ) analyze whether the existing framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund sales practices and proprietary fund operations adequately protects investors . to determine whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds , we developed and mailed a questionnaire to a random sample of banks and thrifts asking these institutions to provide information concerning how and by whom mutual funds are sold to retail customers , how sales personnel are compensated , whether written policies and procedures have been established , and the types of disclosures that are made to retail customers . since restrictions on banks' mutual fund activities were liberalized in the 1980s , banks and thrifts have rapidly expanded their participation in the mutual fund industry . as of december 31 , 1993 , about 114 bank and thrift companies had established proprietary mutual funds . in response to the rapid growth of sales of mutual funds by banks and concerns that bank customers may be confused or ill - informed about the differences between mutual funds and traditional bank products , the federal banking regulators have increased their regulatory and supervisory oversight of banks' mutual fund sales activities . during our visits to the institutions we found that these employees complied with statements in the guidance about not providing investment advice . banking regulators also have issued guidance to banks that sell mutual funds through these affiliates . this creates a potential for different regulatory treatment of the same activity and a potential for conflict and inconsistency among banking and securities regulators .
