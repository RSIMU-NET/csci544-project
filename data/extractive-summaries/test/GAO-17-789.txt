for example , the number of amphibious ships in the navy's fleet has been in decline , dropping from 62 in 1990 to 31 today . both the senate and house reports accompanying bills for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included provisions for us to review navy and marine corps training requirements . this report is a public version of a classified report that we issued in august 2017 . the navy uses a phased approach to training , known as the fleet response training plan . navy and marine corps units that are deploying as part of an arg - meu completed their required training for amphibious operations , but several factors have limited the ability of marine corps units to conduct training for other amphibious operations â€“ related priorities . however , while the marine corps has completed amphibious operations training for the meu , based on our review of unit - level readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016 we found that the service has been unable to fully accomplish training for its other amphibious operations priorities , which include home - station unit training to support contingency requirements , service - level exercises , and experimentation and concept development for amphibious operations . specific details of these shortfalls were omitted because the information is classified . marine corps officials from the 23 units we interviewed also cited other factors that limit opportunities for amphibious operations training , such as the following: access to range space: seventeen of 23 marine corps units we interviewed identified access to range space as a factor that can limit their ability to conduct amphibious operations training . the navy and marine corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services , but the services have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations . in addition , while the navy and marine corps have taken a number of positive steps to improve coordination between the two services , they need to define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration . to better mitigate amphibious operations training shortfalls , we recommend the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy , in coordination with the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps , to develop an approach , such as building upon the amphibious operations training requirements review , to prioritize available training resources , systematically evaluate among training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities , and monitor progress toward achieving them . to more effectively and efficiently integrate virtual training devices into operational training , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the commandant of the marine corps to develop guidance for the development and use of virtual training devices that includes developing requirements for virtual training devices that consider and document training tasks and objectives , required proficiency , and available training time ; setting target usage rates and collecting usage data ; and conducting effectiveness analysis of virtual training devices that defines a consistent process for performing the analysis , including the selection of the devices to be evaluated , guidelines on conducting the analysis , and the data that should be collected and assessed . in its comments , dod concurred with all three recommendations . the objectives of this report are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the navy and marine corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls , ( 2 ) the navy's and marine corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaborative practices , and ( 3 ) the marine corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into its operational training .
