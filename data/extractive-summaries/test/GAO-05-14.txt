incomplete or inaccurate real estate appraisals resulting in property overvaluations could expose the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) — which insured about 3.7 million single - family mortgage loans with a total value of about $425 billion in fiscal years 2001 to 2003 — to greater financial risks . we conducted this review at the initiative of the comptroller general and as a follow up to our 1999 report . specifically , this report examines ( 1 ) how hud ensures that appraisers it approves to perform appraisals under its single - family mortgage insurance programs are qualified to be placed on the appraiser roster ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hud uses a risk - based approach when monitoring the appraisers participating in its single - family mortgage insurance programs ; and ( 3 ) hud's efforts to take enforcement actions against appraisers it identifies as not complying with its requirements . although hud has strengthened its criteria for approving appraisers to perform appraisals , quality control over the approval process is limited . before 1999 , hud relied largely on the states' licensing processes to ensure that appraisers were qualified to perform appraisals . however , the states' minimum licensing standards did not include proficiency in hud appraisal requirements . according to hud's new guidance , in order to be eligible for placement on the roster , an appraiser must ( 1 ) pass an examination on hud appraisal methods and reporting ; ( 2 ) be state licensed or state certified , with credentials based on the minimum criteria issued by the appraiser qualifications board of the appraisal foundation ; and ( 3 ) not be listed on the general services administration's suspension and debarment list , hud's limited denial of participation list , or hud's credit alert interactive voice response system . the hocs may also review appraisers based on complaints from homebuyers and referrals from other hud offices . we found that hud staff do not routinely visit appraised properties to verify the work of the field review contractors . hud reviews and quantifies appraisers' work by using a web - based tool , the appraisal review process , a system that scores each appraiser on several appraisals , weighting the scores to capture violations that pose the greatest risk to fha's mortgage insurance fund . figure 5 illustrates the extent to which the department has made use of each type of enforcement action available , as reported by hud . to reduce the financial risks assumed by hud and to further enhance its oversight of appraisers participating in hud's single - family mortgage insurance programs , we recommend that the secretary of hud direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to institute reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the appraiser roster to ensure that applicants' conformance to eligibility criteria is verified ; consider a requirement to include , when targeting appraisers for review , those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period in order to ensure that these appraisers have corrected their relevant deficiencies ; maintain the historical information , particularly early loan default information , used to target appraisers for review in order to ensure that the hocs target and review appraisers based on the criteria in hud guidance ; and implement a cost - effective field review contractor oversight process that includes on - site monitoring . with respect to hud's adoption of a new risk - based approach for monitoring appraisers , we reported that hud's process for monitoring appraisers is risk based and that hud modified its approach to target for review appraisers who are associated with known risks to fha's mortgage insurance fund . we reviewed hud's risk - based targeting guidance and obtained data for fiscal year 2003 through the first half of fiscal year 2004 from each of the hocs . we focused this analysis on removals because removals are the strongest type of action that can be taken at the hoc level .
