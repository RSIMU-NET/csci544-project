as organisms die and sink to the bottom , they are consumed ( decomposed ) by oxygen - dependent bacteria , depleting the water of oxygen . when this eutrophication is extensive and persistent , bottom waters may become hypoxic , or even anoxic ( no dissolved oxygen ) , while surface waters can be completely normal and full of life . marine dead zones become most noticeable when and where natural eutrophication has been accelerated by human - influenced increases in nutrient loads . hypoxic zones frequently occur in coastal areas where rivers enter the ocean ( e.g. , estuaries ) . human activities that increase nutrient loading can increase the intensity , spatial extent , and duration of hypoxic events . although the extent of effects of hypoxic events on u.s. coastal ecosystems is still uncertain , the phenomenon is of increasing concern in coastal areas . hypoxia has become more frequent and widespread in shallow coastal and estuarine areas . about 21% to 43% of the area of the united states' estuaries have experienced a hypoxic event ; more than half of the affected area is in the mississippi / atchafalaya river plume . in response to an integrated scientific assessment of hypoxia in the northern gulf of mexico by the multi - agency watershed nutrient task force , a plan of action for addressing hypoxia was released in january 2001 . near the end of the 105 th congress , provisions of the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act of 1998 were incorporated into the coast guard authorization act of 1998 . this measure was signed into law as p.l . 105-383 on november 13 , 1998 ; title vi authorized appropriations through noaa to conduct research , monitoring , education , and management activities for the prevention , reduction , and control of hypoxia , harmful algal blooms , pfiesteria , and other aquatic toxins . in 2004 , title i of p.l . 108-456 , the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia amendments act of 2004 , expanded this authority and reauthorized appropriations through fy2008 . legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress to reauthorize and amend the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act . in the last few years , the u.s. department of agriculture's cooperative state research , education , and extension service has provided a special research grant of around $220,000 annually to iowa state university's leopold center for sustainable agriculture for a project to define and implement new methods and practices in farming that reduce impacts on water quality and the hypoxia problem in the gulf of mexico .
