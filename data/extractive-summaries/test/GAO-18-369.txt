as a federal nutrition assistance program , the primary purpose of the sfsp is to provide food service to children in low - income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation . in the last decade , federal expenditures have increased as the program has expanded , according to fns data . 3 . the total number of sfsp meals served nationwide during the summer — one indicator of program participation — increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016 , or by 32 percent , according to our analysis of fns data . the number of sfsp meals served has generally increased from year to year over this 10-year period . for example , state agency officials in one of the three selected states we visited said they believe that reductions in state and local funding for summer programs that also provide meals , and turnover of sponsors , including losing one of the state's largest sponsors in a recent summer , affected the total number of sfsp meals served in their state in 2016 . in july 2016 , in addition to the 70 million meals provided through the sfsp , 26 million meals were provided to low - income children through school food authorities participating in the nslp's seamless summer option , according to fns data . similarly , officials from fns and two regional organizations we interviewed said they were aware of children receiving summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith - based and other community organizations . states and sfsp providers reported challenges with meal sites , participation , and administration , though federal , state , and local entities have taken steps to improve these areas . fns has used its available authorities to grant some states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site , such as when safety at the site is a concern ; however , fns has not clearly communicated to all states and sponsors the circumstances it considers when deciding whether to grant this flexibility . further , states and sponsors reported challenges obtaining the specific data needed for approval of a site for this type of flexibility , hampering some providers' efforts to ensure safe delivery of meals .  ( recommendation 4 ) . and ( 3 ) what challenges exist , if any , in providing summer meals to children , and to what extent does the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges ? . to further examine what is known about participation in the sfsp , we also reviewed fns's data on estimates of children's participation in the program and determined that these estimates have been calculated inconsistently and are unreliable . we used u.s. census bureau data to select states and local areas within those states based on a high proportion of children in poverty , a mix of urban and rural locations , as well as a mix of sponsor and site type and diverse locations . using semi - structured questions , we also interviewed the state agencies responsible for administering the sfsp in the site visit states to gather further information on how the sfsp is administered in each state , statewide participation in the program , related data collection activities , any challenges to administering the program and any efforts to address such challenges , related outreach efforts , alternative meal delivery models being employed by sfsp sponsors , fns guidance or technical assistance , and the availability of nonfederally funded programs that provide meals to low - income children over the summer .
