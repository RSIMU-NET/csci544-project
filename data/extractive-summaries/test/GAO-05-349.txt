“predatory lending” has no precise definition , but is generally used to describe cases in which a lender takes unfair advantage of a borrower , sometimes through deception , fraud , or manipulation , to make a loan that contains terms that are disadvantageous to the borrower . these include payday loans , rent - to - own loans , automobile title pawn loans , and tax refund loans . these tools include: ( 1 ) the armed forces disciplinary control boards , which can make recommendations to installation commanders who can then use or threaten to use their “off - limits” authority to prohibit servicemembers from using a business that engages in predatory lending practices ; ( 2 ) free legal assistance with contracts and other financial transactions ; and ( 3 ) personal financial management ( pfm ) programs that offer servicemembers assistance , such as financial management training and counseling . for this report , we agreed with your staff to answer two questions: ( 1 ) to what extent do active duty servicemembers use consumer loans considered to be predatory in nature ? . and ( 2 ) are dod and active duty servicemembers fully utilizing the tools that dod has to curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices ? . effective interest rates are generally very high . the fees for loans such as the payday loans provide a general indication of the loans' potential detrimental financial effects on servicemembers' finances . while dod has some data on servicemembers' use of four types of loans , dod is unable to quantify the extent to which these types of loans have associated predatory practices , the frequency of borrowing , the amounts borrowed , or the effects of the loans . in the august 2004 dod survey , 12 percent of servicemembers indicated that , during the last 12 months , they or their spouse had used at least one of the four specified types of financial loans that dod says may have associated predatory practices . although not generalizable to all active duty servicemembers and their spouses , some of the more than 400 participants in our 60 focus groups reported encountering problems when they used the short - term consumer loans ; while other servicemembers said such loans have positive elements such as being quick , easy , and obtainable even if servicemembers had a bad credit history ( see app . other important issues not addressed in the survey but needed to quantify the extent and effects of borrowing from lenders that may use predatory lending practices include questions on the frequency of use , amounts borrowed , negative and positive effects of the loans , and any problems encountered during the transactions . the board at fort drum , new york , had not met in about 4 years because the board's director did not see a reason to convene . the business avoided being placed on the installation's off - limits list by terminating two employees and changing some of its business practices . some servicemembers in our focus groups said they were confused about whether the military endorses the businesses that advertise in installation newspapers , and the confusion could lead servicemembers to use a type of business that dod has labeled as potentially having predatory lending practices . a dod instruction requires installation publications to run disclaimers warning readers that advertisements do not constitute endorsement by the u.s. government . as we have discussed , failure to utilize this valuable tool fully and appropriately for curbing unfair or illegal commercial or consumer practices can have negative , but difficult - to - quantify , consequences on servicemembers' finances as well as unit morale and readiness . we are making the following two recommendations to the secretary of defense: to improve dod's ability to curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to amend existing regulations to require installation commanders to convene the armed forces disciplinary control boards at least semiannually to investigate and make recommendations to commanders on matters related to eliminating conditions which adversely affect the health , safety , morals , welfare , morale , and discipline of the armed forces , to include servicemembers' use of lenders who may use predatory lending practices . to ensure dod provides servicemembers a clear message about whether it endorses advertisers in official installation newspapers that may use predatory lending practices , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs to clarify the regulations pertaining to advertisements in installation publications by requiring disclaimers to be more prominent and taking steps to ensure advertisements reflect stated dod policies regarding what it considers to be predatory lending . example: rent - to - own businesses are widely used by soldiers . military personnel: bankruptcy filings among active duty service members .
