my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) trends in degree attainment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , ( 2 ) trends in the levels of employment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , and ( 3 ) federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in stem - related fields . for that report we ( 1 ) analyzed survey responses from 13 federal departments and agencies with stem education programs ; ( 2 ) analyzed data on students and graduates from the department of education's ( education ) national center for education statistics ( nces ) and on employees from the department of labor's ( labor ) bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) ; ( 3 ) interviewed educators and administrators at eight colleges and universities , federal agency officials , and representatives from associations and education organizations ; ( 4 ) conducted interviews via e - mail with 31 students from five universities we visited ; and ( 5 ) reviewed reports on various topics related to stem education and occupations . in summary , our findings are as follows: while postsecondary enrollment has increased over the past decade , the proportion of students obtaining degrees in stem fields has fallen . in academic year 1994 – 1995 , about 519,000 students obtained stem degrees , about 32 percent of all degrees awarded . more students — approximately 578,000 — obtained stem degrees in academic year 2003 – 2004 , but such degrees accounted for only 27 percent of those awarded . further , despite increases in the overall enrollment and degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level , the number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several stem - related fields from academic year 1994 – 1995 to academic year 2003 – 2004 . from 1994 to 2003 , overall employment in stem fields increased by an estimated 23 percent , compared to an estimated 17 percent increase in non - stem fields . mathematics and computer science showed the highest increase in stem - related employment — estimated at 78 percent — while employment in science - related fields increased an estimated 20 percent . however , in certain stem fields , including engineering , the number of employees did not increase significantly over the 1994 – 2003 period . key factors affecting stem employment decisions include mentoring for women and minorities and opportunities abroad for foreign employees . the federal government spent approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2004 to fund over 200 programs designed to increase the numbers of students in stem fields and employees in stem occupations and to improve related educational programs . however , only half of these programs had been evaluated or had evaluations underway , and coordination among stem education programs was limited . since our report was issued in october 2005 , several initiatives to improve federal support have taken place . for example , congress established national science and mathematics access to retain talent ( smart ) grants to encourage students from low - income families to enroll in stem fields and foreign languages critical to the national security of the united states . in addition to teacher quality , students' high school preparation in mathematics and science was cited by university officials and researchers as a factor that influenced students' participation and success in the stem fields . the estimated number of minorities employed in the stem fields as well as the proportion of total stem employees they constituted increased , but african - american and hispanic employees remained underrepresented relative to their percentages in the civilian labor force . for example , it had surveyed federal agency education programs designed to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in stem studies , and it had coordinated the excellence in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics education week activities , which provide an opportunity for the nation's schools to focus on improving mathematics and science education . given the trends in the numbers and percentages of graduates with stem degrees — particularly advanced degrees — and recent developments that have influenced international students' decisions about pursuing degrees in the united states , it is uncertain whether the number of stem graduates will be sufficient to meet future academic and employment needs and help the country maintain its technological competitive advantage . however , before expanding the number of federal programs , it is important to know the extent to which existing stem education programs are appropriately targeted and making the best use of available federal resources — in other words , these programs must be evaluated — and a comprehensive evaluation of federal programs is currently nonexistent .
