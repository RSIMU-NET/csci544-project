furthermore , we are required to report annually on the implementation of the act . this report , our eighth , discusses ( 1 ) the auditors' assessments of agency systems' compliance with ffmia for fiscal year 2003 and the financial management systems problems that continue to affect systems' ffmia compliance and ( 2 ) the challenges agencies have faced when implementing financial systems to help move toward ffmia compliance . specifically , this guidance calls for auditors to provide negative assurance when reporting on an agency system's ffmia compliance . for fiscal year 2003 , oigs and their contract auditors reported that the systems of 17 of the 23 cfo act agencies did not substantially comply with at least one of ffmia's three requirements â€” federal financial management systems requirements , applicable federal accounting standards , or the sgl at the transaction level . the cfo act calls for agencies to develop and maintain an integrated accounting and financial management system that complies with federal systems requirements and provides for ( 1 ) complete , reliable , consistent , and timely information that is responsive to the financial information needs of the agency and facilitates the systematic measurement of performance ; ( 2 ) the development and reporting of cost management information ; and ( 3 ) the integration of accounting , budgeting , and program information . agencies face significant challenges implementing these standards . in an effort to address problems such as nonintegrated systems , inadequate reconciliations , and lack of compliance with the sgl , a number of agencies have efforts under way to implement new financial management systems or to upgrade existing systems . agencies anticipate that the new systems will provide reliable , useful , and timely data to support managerial decision making and assist taxpayer and congressional oversight . however , our work at dod , hhs , and nasa has shown that agencies face significant problems in implementing financial management systems and are not following the necessary disciplined processes for efficient and effective implementation of such systems . disciplined processes have been shown to mitigate some of the risks associated with software development and acquisition efforts to acceptable levels . the ffmia - related problems reported in agency audit reports indicate that federal financial management systems are not currently providing federal managers the financial data needed for day - to - day management of their programs or for external reporting in an efficient or timely manner . vi ) on a draft of this report , omb agreed with our assessment that while federal agencies continue to make progress in addressing financial management systems weaknesses , many agencies still lack the ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and effectively manage day - to - day operations .
