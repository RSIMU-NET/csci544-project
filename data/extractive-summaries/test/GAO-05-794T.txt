more broadly , pension reform represents a real opportunity to address part of our long - term fiscal problems and reconfigure our retirement security systems to bring them into the 21st century . this opportunity has many related pieces: addressing our nation's large and growing long - term fiscal gap ; deciding on the appropriate role and size of the federal government — and how to finance that government — and bringing the wide array of federal activities into line with today's world . continuing on our current unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security . we therefore must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that our government can respond to a range of current and emerging security , social , economic , and environmental changes and challenges . the pbgc's situation is an excellent example of the need for the congress to reconsider the role of government organizations , programs , and policies in light of changes that have occurred since pbgc's establishment in 1974 . our recent work on db pension funding rules provides important insights in understanding the problems facing pbgc and the db system . to summarize our findings , while pension funding rules are intended to ensure that plans have sufficient assets to pay promised benefit to plan participants , significant vulnerabilities exist . although from 1995 to 2002 most of the 100 largest db plans annually had assets that exceeded their current liabilities , by 2002 over half of the 100 largest plans were underfunded , and almost one - fourth of plans were less than 90 percent funded . additionally , on average over 60 percent of sponsors of these plans made no annual cash contributions to their plans . one key reason for this is that the funding rules allow a sponsor to satisfy minimum funding requirements without necessarily making a cash contribution each year , even though the plan may be underfunded . further , very few sponsors of underfunded plans were required to pay an additional funding charge ( afc ) , a funding mechanism designed to reduce severe plan underfunding . finally , our analysis confirms the notion that plans sponsored by financially weak firms pose a particular risk to pbgc , as these plans were generally more likely to be underfunded , to be subject to an additional funding charge , and to use assumptions to minimize or avoid cash contributions than plans sponsored by stronger firms . under erisa , the termination of a single - employer db plan may result in an insurance claim with the single - employer program if the plan has insufficient assets to pay all benefits accrued under the plan up to the date of plan termination . the recent decline of pbgc's single - employer program has occurred in the context of the long - term stagnation of the db system . furthermore , because of leeway in the actuarial methodology and assumptions sponsors can use to measure plan assets and liabilities , underfunding may actually have been more severe and widespread than reported at the end of the period . 1 ) . the bethlehem steel corporation in 2002 reported that its plan was 85.2 percent funded on a current liability basis ; yet , the plan terminated later that year with assets of less than half of the value of promised benefits . further , it reduces the transparency of plan financial information to stakeholders , such as participants , and investors . 3 ) . our analysis here suggests that certain aspects of the funding rules have contributed to the general underfunding of pensions and , indirectly , to pbgc's recent financial difficulties . ideally , effective reform would improve the accuracy of plan asset and liability measurement while minimizing complexity and maintaining contribution flexibility ; develop a pbgc insurance premium structure that charges sponsors fairly , based on the risk their plans pose to pbgc , and provides incentives for sponsors to fund plans adequately ; address the issue of severely underfunded plans making lump - sum distributions ; resolve outstanding controversies concerning cash balance and other hybrid plans by safeguarding the benefits of workers regardless of age ; and improve plan information transparency for pbgc , plan participants , unions , and investors in a manner that does not add considerable burden to plan sponsors .
