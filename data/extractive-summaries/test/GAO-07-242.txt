no bank or thrift failed from june 2004 through january 2007 . for the sample of banks and thrifts we reviewed , we found that regulators generally implemented pca in accordance with section 38 . regulators also have some discretion in how they enforce pca restrictions and requirements — they may issue a pca directive ( a formal action that requires an institution to take one or more specified actions to return to required minimum capital standards ) or delineate the restrictions and requirements in a new or modified enforcement order , such as a section 8 ( b ) cease - and - desist order . the bank merged into an affiliate in early 2005 , in accordance with its capital restoration plan . although pca requires regulators to take regulatory action when an institution fails to meet established minimum capital requirements , capital is a lagging indicator and thus not necessarily a timely predictor of problems at banks and thrifts . as a result , regulatory actions focused solely on capital may have limited effects because of the extent of deterioration that may have already occurred in other areas . under section 39 , regulators can require institutions to implement plans to address deficiencies in their compliance with regulatory safety and soundness standards . the regulators acknowledged that section 38 permits them to reclassify an institution's capital category to dismiss an officer or director ; however , they said that because section 38 only allows them to dismiss individuals from institutions that are undercapitalized or worse by pca standards , the tool generally is not available to them in these good economic times when all or most of the institutions they regulate are well capitalized . fdic's recent changes to the deposit insurance system more closely tie an individual bank or thrift's deposit insurance premium to the risk it presents to the insurance fund . to tie institutions' insurance premiums more directly to the risk each presents to the insurance fund , fdic created a system that generally ( 1 ) differentiates between large and small institutions , specifically between institutions with current credit agency ratings and $10 billion or more in assets and all other institutions ; ( 2 ) for institutions without credit agency ratings , forecasts the likelihood of a decline in financial health ( referred to throughout this report as the general method ) ; ( 3 ) for institutions with credit agency ratings , uses those ratings , plus potentially other financial market information , to evaluate institutional risk ( referred to throughout this report as the large - institution method ) ; and ( 4 ) requires all institutions to pay premiums based on their individual risk . in our review of selected comments to fdic's proposed rule and interviews with bankers , industry trade groups , and academics , we found that the industry generally supported the concept of a more risk - based insurance premium system . seven others expressed similar concerns in comment letters to fdic . the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) describe trends in the financial condition of banks and thrifts and federal regulators' oversight of these institutions since the passage of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 ( fdicia ) , ( 2 ) evaluate how federal regulators used the capital or prompt corrective action ( pca ) provisions of fdicia to resolve capital adequacy issues at the institutions they regulate , ( 3 ) evaluate the extent to which federal regulators use the noncapital provisions of fdicia to identify and address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate , and ( 4 ) describe the federal deposit insurance corporation's ( fdic ) deposit insurance system and how recent changes to the system affect the determination of depository institutions' risk and insurance premiums . to supplement our sample , we also reviewed material loss reviews from 14 banks and thrifts that failed with material losses from 1992 through 2005 and in which regulators used pca to address capital deficiencies . to determine the extent to which federal regulators have used the noncapital supervisory actions of sections 38 and 39 of fdia to address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate , we reviewed regulators' policies and procedures related to sections 38 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( f ) and 38 ( g ) — the provisions for dismissal of officers and directors and reclassification of a capital category , respectively — and section 39 , which gives regulators authority to address safety and soundness deficiencies .
