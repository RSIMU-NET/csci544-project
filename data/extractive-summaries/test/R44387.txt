authority to spend recovery act funds expired on september 30 , 2015 . of the $3.4 billion allocated for ccs activities , approximately $1.4 billion went unspent as of the 2015 spending deadline . the largest portion of the unspent funds , $795 million , was intended for doe's flagship ccs project , futuregen , which doe suspended in february 2015 . since fy2008 , it has appropriated more than $7 billion for ccs activities at doe . several bills introduced in the 114 th congress address ccs directly or indirectly ( e.g. , s. 601 , s. 1283 , h.r . 3392 , and others ) . the obama administration has promulgated rules on co 2 emissions from current and future fossil fuel - burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit co 2 emissions . congress remains divided over those executive branch decisions . doe , however , has continued to embrace ccs as part of the administration's strategy to reduce co 2 emissions from power plants: roughly one - third of u.s. carbon emissions come from power plants and other large point sources . under the 2010 doe ccs roadmap , and with the large infusion of funding from the recovery act , doe's goal has been to develop the technologies that will allow for commercial - scale demonstration in both new and retrofitted power plants and industrial facilities by 2020 . nine individual projects garnered approximately $2.65 billion of the $3.4 billion — about 78% — made available under the recovery act for ccs projects and activities . the projects in each category were awarded more than $100 million . some stakeholders argue that doe ccs programs have been inadequately funded , and that the doe incentive programs for deploying ccs are not as effective as they should be . one study concluded that even the financial boost from the recovery act was insufficient support for development and commercialization of ccs technology: while the $3.4 billion allocated for ccs in the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009 was a good start in providing the kind of federal funding assistance needed for ccs technology development , much of those funds were returned to treasury due to canceled projects . large - scale ccs projects are complex endeavors , requiring large capital investment and multiyear planning and construction schedules . nevertheless , the conclusion that more federal funding by itself — per the quote above — is what is needed to support development and commercialization of ccs technology may be overly simplistic . as briefly discussed above ( see " challenges and delays " ) , these impediments included delays in receiving the required injection - well permits from the environmental protection agency , court challenges to its plan to sell electricity , and a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy group . doe acknowledges that many of the recovery act - funded projects were technologically difficult and challenging , but it does not consider the relinquishment of unspent funds to signify project failure ; rather , doe takes the relinquishment of funds to mean that the projects simply did not meet the requirement to spend the funds by the deadline . doe notes that due to its spending on ccs and its partnerships with industry , the costs of capturing co 2 have dropped significantly and its projects have stored more than 10 million metric tons of co 2 . given that a substantial amount of appropriated funding through the recovery act for ccs demonstration projects went unspent , congress may examine the broader policy , financial , and regulatory factors that posed challenges to several large recovery act - funded demonstration projects and led to their delay or cancellation .
