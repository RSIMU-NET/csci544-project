we recently issued a report , entitled medicare: focus on physician practice patterns can lead to greater program efficiency , which discusses an approach to analyzing physicians' practice patterns in medicare and ways the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) could use the results of such an analysis to modify inefficient physician behavior . this topic has been of significant interest to the congress , as medicare's current system of spending targets used to moderate physician spending growth and annually update physician fees has been problematic . we focused the analysis on generalists — physicians who described their specialty as general practice , internal medicine , or family practice — and selected metropolitan areas that were diverse geographically and in terms of medicare spending per beneficiary . although we did not include specialists in the analysis , our method does not preclude profiling specialists , as long as enough data are available to make meaningful comparisons across physicians . we based our analysis on 2003 medicare claims data . outlier generalists and other generalists saw similar numbers of medicare patients and their respective patients averaged the same number of office visits . however , after taking health status and location into account , we found that medicare patients who saw an outlier generalist — compared with those who saw other generalists — were more likely to have been hospitalized , more likely to have been hospitalized multiple times , and more likely to have used home health services . the agency also has wide experience in conducting educational outreach to physicians with respect to improper billing practices and potential fraud — providing individual physicians , in some cases , comparative information on how the physician varies from other physicians in the same specialty or in other ways . a physician education effort based on efficiency profiling results would therefore not be a foreign concept in medicare . cms agreed with the need to measure physician resource use in medicare but raised concerns about the costs involved in reporting the results and was silent on other strategies discussed beyond physician education . we concur that resource use measurement and reporting activities would require adequate funding ; however , we are concerned that efforts to achieve efficiency that rely solely on physician education without financial or other incentives for physicians to curb inefficiencies will be suboptimal . having considered the efforts of other health care purchasers in profiling physicians for efficiency , we conducted our own profiling analysis of physician practices in medicare and found individual physicians who were likely to practice medicine inefficiently in each of 12 metropolitan areas studied . in 2003 , outlier generalists' medicare practices were similar to those of other generalists , but the beneficiaries they treated tended to experience higher utilization of certain services . by contrast , they were 10 percent less likely to have been admitted to a skilled nursing facility . this would enable physicians to see whether their practice style is outside the norm . having considered the tools cms has available and the structural challenges the agency would likely face in seeking to implement certain incentives used by other purchasers , we recommended in our april 2007 report that the administrator of cms develop a profiling system — seeking legislative authority , as necessary — that includes the following elements: total medicare expenditures as the basis for measuring efficiency , adjustments for differences in patients' health status , empirically based standards that set the parameters of efficiency , a physician education program that explains to physicians how the profiling system works and how their efficiency measures compare with those of their peers , financial or other incentives for individual physicians to improve the efficiency of the care they provide , and methods for measuring the impact of physician profiling on program spending and physician behavior .
