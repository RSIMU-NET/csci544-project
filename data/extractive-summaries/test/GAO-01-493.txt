according to the department of the navy , the primary purpose of forward - deployed naval forces is to project power from the sea to influence events ashore . to be successful , our naval forces must be able to gain access to , and operate in the littoral regions of , potential adversaries . consequently , they must be able to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines and submarines , and to protect themselves against cruise missiles and other antiship weapons . finally , they must be able to launch and support offensive operations against enemy forces ashore . specifically , we assessed the navy's existing mine countermeasures , antisubmarine warfare , ship self - defense , and surface fire support capabilities , and the progress of the acquisition programs the navy is pursuing to address shortfalls in these areas . the navy has had two systems in development since 1993 to address this shortfall . although the navy is making some progress in overcoming shortfalls identified in the 1997 anti - submarine warfare assessment , a lack of resources and priorities among competing programs is still prevalent . the navy's ship defense capabilities against currently deployed cruise missiles are marginal , and none of the acquisitions that the navy is currently pursuing will provide adequate protection against improved versions of these weapons . consequently , surface ships will be at risk when operating within the range of these weapons . the marine corps will not have the ship - based fire support it needs for at least another decade . to identify the progress the navy is making to improve antisubmarine warfare capabilities we obtained and analyzed data from the 1997 anti - submarine warfare assessment and the 1999 antisubmarine warfare “roadmap.” we obtained and discussed information on antisubmarine warfare capabilities and selected antisubmarine warfare programs with officials of the office of the chief of naval operations ; the naval sea and air system commands ; and the submarine , surface , air , anti - submarine warfare and naval training and education divisions under the deputy chief of naval operations for warfare requirements and programs .
