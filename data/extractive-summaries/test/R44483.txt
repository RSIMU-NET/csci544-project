on the consumption side , china is the third largest consumer of natural gas behind the united states and russia , which are also the two largest natural gas producers , respectively . china's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which congress has expressed a strong interest . those issues include the following: the prospects for u.s. energy exports , including exports of natural gas and coal ; prospects for u.s. energy companies' investments in china ; chinese investment in the u.s. energy sector ; manufacturing competitiveness between the united states and china ; china's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change ; china's ability to reduce the severe air pollution that hangs over parts of the country , and thus reduce the airborne pollutants that have been shown to travel from china to the west coast of the united states ; china's political and economic relationships with such regions as central asia , a major supplier of natural gas to china via pipelines , and the middle east , currently a major supplier of oil and lng to china ; china's plans for disputed waters in the south china sea , which may contain significant hydrocarbon resources ; and china's management of its energy - rich but troubled xinjiang region , which has a large ethnic turkic population and has been the subject of human rights concerns from governments and groups outside china , and of chinese government concerns about separatism , terrorism , and religious extremism . in the 114 th congress , members have expressed interest in chinese policy related to natural gas in hearings , such as the senate committee on energy and natural resources' january 2015 hearing on s. 33 , the lng permitting certainty and transparency act , and the same committee's february 2015 hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the u.s. department of energy . these targets were not achieved . by 2025 , energy firm bp projects that natural gas consumption in china will reach almost 400 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) , more than double china's estimated 2015 natural gas consumption of 191 bcm . china has made significant strides in diversifying its natural gas supplies . domestic production has risen 164% in the last ten years , to 135 bcm in 2014 . natural gas imports , which did not begin until 2006 , have grown from one bcm to over 58 bcm in 2014 . growth in china's demand for natural gas has slowed in recent years . state media reported that annual consumption in 2015 was 191 bcm , up 3.7% from 2014 . this represented the lowest rate of annual growth in a decade ( see figure 8 ) . china's government expects its overall energy consumption to grow in 2016 , with natural gas rising to 6.2% of primary energy needs . part of the slowdown in consumption growth is attributed to the sluggish economy . in november 2015 , china cut natural gas prices to spur demand .
