one of the majority's prerogatives is writing the house's rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber's rules on the day the new house convenes . although each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous congress , each new house also adopts changes to those rules . the major topical headings for this part of the report are as follows: " rules changes affecting committees " " rules changes affecting the chamber and floor " " rules changes affecting budgetary legislation " " rules changes affecting administrationof the house " " rules changes affecting ethics standards " each of these major headings is further subdivided by topic or by congress . legislative branch appropriations bills and budgetary legislation contained organizational , procedural , and other changes that were temporary or permanent . this report is the first in a series on house rules changes . a second report currently covers changes for the 110 th through 112 th congresses: crs report r42395 , a retrospective of house rules changes since the 110 th congress , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . it also advanced proposals for governing as an alternative to democratic legislation . while in the minority , republican complaints included being denied the opportunity to offer amendments to measures because of restrictive rules , an inability to routinely offer a motion to recommit with instructions , the increased volume of commemorative legislation , and a floor schedule that was neither family friendly nor conducive to deliberation . some offices were abolished , while others were created . responsibilities were shifted , and accountability was increased . again , this report analyzes the rules , special orders , and speaker's announcements at the convening of a congress and not all of the actions taken during a congress . as stated earlier in this report , the house rules changes made in the 104 th congress , and since , including changes affecting the organization of committees and the administration of the house , reflected a republican frame of reference that was built over many years as the minority party . republican criticisms of changes in the house made at the direction of the democratic caucus beginning after the 1974 election and continuing through the 103 rd congress , the ideas of the conservative opportunity society in the 1980s , the republican '92 group , the republican rules package of the 103 rd congress , the recommendations of the bipartisan joint committee on the organization of congress , the contract with america , and other sources came together in the rules package the republicans put before the house in the 104 th congress . at the same time , a number of rules did not change , either at all or substantially . with the events of 9 / 11 and the anthrax attacks on capitol hill , publication of the 9 / 11 commission report , the return of the federal budget deficit , a republican president in the white house and republican control of both houses of congress , and a widening of republican margins in the house and senate , house republicans made more extensive changes in house rules in the 108 th and 109 th congresses and adapted to changed conditions . rules changes do not necessarily enable a majority to pass legislation , to keep all the party's members together , to work smoothly with the minority , to achieve the same outcomes as the other body , or to overcome voter sentiments . rules facilitate the majority's organization and operation of the house , but they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the house .
