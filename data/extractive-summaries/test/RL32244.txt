on august 11 , 2006 , revised grazing regulations of the bureau of land management ( blm ) took effect ( 43 c.f.r . part 4100 ) . some of the regulations have been enjoined . among the changes made in 1995 , many of which were reexamined by blm during the development of the 2006 regulatory changes , are those that: separated grazing preference from permitted use , so that a permittee's preference for receiving a grazing permit was not tied to a specific amount of grazing based on historic levels ( described as animal unit months , or aums ) ; allowed permittees up to three years of nonuse of their permits ; authorized suspending or canceling a permit if a permittee is convicted of violating certain state or federal environmental laws ; eliminated the express requirement that a permittee be engaged in the livestock business ; replaced the term affected interest with interested public ; allowed conservation use for the term of a grazing permit , thereby excluding livestock grazing from all or a portion of an allotment ; required title of permanent structural improvements to be held in the name of the united states ; required that water rights for livestock grazing be held in the name of the united states , to the extent allowed by state law ; imposed a surcharge on a permittee who allows livestock not owned by the permittee or the permittee's children to graze on public land ; eliminated grazing advisory boards and replaced them with the broader interest resource advisory councils ; and adopted rangeland management standards called fundamentals of rangeland health . blm took a two - pronged approach to the 2003-2006 iteration of grazing reform on public lands , by issuing changes to grazing regulations and considering changes to grazing policies . they also contended that blm had not justified a need for regulatory and policy changes and that the changes adopted remove important environmental protections and opportunities for public comment . blm asserted that regulatory changes were needed to increase flexibility for grazing managers and permittees , to improve blm's relationship with ranchers , to improve rangeland management and permit administration , to promote conservation , and to comply with court decisions . further , the final rule recognizes the benefits of grazing , including the economic and social benefits to rural communities and the preservation of open space , according to blm . changes to regulations became effective august 11 , 2006 , although some of the changes were subsequently enjoined . among them are changes to allow shared title to range improvements , allow private acquisition of water rights , reduce requirements for public involvement , modify the administrative appeals process , broaden the definition of grazing preference , change the timeframe and procedures for remedying rangeland health problems , remove the limit on permit nonuse , and eliminate conservation use grazing permits . the changes met with mixed reaction . public comment on the proposed regulatory changes , together with the deis assessing their impact , was accepted through march 2 , 2004 . blm evaluated the comments over many months , before publishing an feis on june 17 , 2005 . the agency postponed developing a final grazing rule to consider public comment received after the closing date , particularly from the fish and wildlife service . the blm addressed this comment in an addendum issued march 31 , 2006 . key policy issues that were considered related to rcas , conservation partnerships , voluntary allotment restructuring , conservation easement acquisition , and landscape habitat improvement .
