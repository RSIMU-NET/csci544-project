the violence against women act ( vawa ) was originally enacted in 1994 ( p.l . it addressed congressional concerns about violent crime , and violence against women in particular , in several ways . among other things , it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders ; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses ; and authorized grants to state , local , and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women . 103-322 ) , which included vawa as title iv . the shortfalls of legal responses and the need for a change in attitudes toward violence against women were primary reasons cited for the passage of vawa . most recently , congress passed and president obama signed the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-4 ) , which reauthorized most of the programs under vawa , among other things . vawa programs generally address domestic violence , sexual assault , dating violence , and stalking , although some vawa programs address additional crimes . vawa grant programs largely address the criminal justice system and community response to these crimes , but certain programs address prevention as well . more recently , however , there has been a focus on ensuring that the needs of all victims are met through provisions of vawa programs . the fundamental goals of vawa are to prevent violent crime ; respond to the needs of crime victims ; learn more about crime ; and change public attitudes through a collaborative effort by the criminal justice system , social service agencies , research organizations , schools , public health organizations , and private organizations . the federal government tries to achieve these goals primarily through federal grant programs that provide funding to state , tribal , territorial , and local governments ; nonprofit organizations ; and universities . as previously mentioned , ovw administers the majority of vawa - authorized programs , while other federal agencies , including ojp and the cdc , also manage vawa programs . since its creation in 1995 through fy2018 , ovw has awarded more than $8 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to state , tribal , and local governments ; nonprofit organizations ; and universities . since it was enacted in 1994 , vawa has been reauthorized three times . there are several issues that congress may consider in current reauthorization efforts . these include , but are not limited to , improvements to data collection , assessing tribal jurisdiction over non - tribal members who commit vawa - related crimes on tribal lands , new approaches for law enforcement in assisting victims , and enforcement of the federal prohibition on firearms for those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and those who are subject to a domestic violence protective order . congress may also consider further changes to vawa programs . the violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r . among other things , it would reauthorize funding for vawa programs and authorize new programs ; amend and add definitions used for vawa programs ; amend federal criminal law relating to firearms , custodial rape , and stalking ; and expand tribal jurisdiction over certain crimes committed on tribal lands . congress may address issues concerning limited law enforcement data at the national level on the crimes of domestic violence and stalking . 1585 , as passed by the house , would authorize several new activities related to increasing or improving data collection . 1585 would reauthorize funding for most vawa programs for fy2020-fy2024 . 113-4 ) authorized appropriations for most vawa programs for fy2014 through fy2018 .
