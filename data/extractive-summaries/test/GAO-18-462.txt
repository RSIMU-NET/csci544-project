however , in march 2018 the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 , provided the program with more than $2.6 billion , and required fta to continue to administer the capital investment grants program in accordance with the program's procedural and substantive requirements . the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) , enacted in 2012 , included a provision for us to biennially review fta's processes and procedures for evaluating and rating projects seeking funding through the capital investment grants program . we reported that fta was taking steps to implement map - 21 , such as by implementing a provision directing fta to issue policy guidance outlining the review and evaluation process for new fixed - guideway projects and core capacity improvement projects ( hereafter core capacity projects ) , and reported that fta intended to take action to address other provisions over the next few years . fta's progress in addressing outstanding statutory provisions as amended by map - 21 and the fast act , and how fta's evaluation and rating process enables it to verify that statutory requirements are met before recommending a core capacity project for funding . the six project sponsors we interviewed represented seven of the eight core capacity projects in the program at the time we initiated this review . the program is governed by statutory provisions , and funding is provided in the form of a construction grant agreement , which is subject to congressional appropriations . projects that compete for funding through the capital investment grants program are designed and implemented by project sponsors , which are usually local transit agencies . fta has not addressed three of four outstanding statutory provisions concerning the capital investment grants program . when we initiated our review , fta officials told us fta did not have immediate plans to address the outstanding statutory provisions due to the administration's stated intent to phase out the capital investment grants program . since then , fta's annual reports to congress , which contain funding recommendations for the program , have reflected this direction . during our review , fta officials told us that other factors have also influenced fta's decisions . however , issuing regulations to address this provision is important . in the case of the fast act's provision establishing a pilot program — called the “expedited project delivery for capital investment grants pilot program,” designed to create a fast - track approval process for projects that meet specific statutory criteria , such as having a maximum federal share of 25 percent — fta published a notice in the federal register in 2016 stating that it would publish guidance describing the process project sponsors should follow to apply for consideration as a pilot project . based on our review of fta's policy guidance , instructions for applying to the capital investment grants program , and interviews with fta officials and six core capacity project sponsors , we found that fta has established a process to verify that proposed core capacity projects meet statutory requirements before recommending projects for funding . in addition , based on our review of documentation supporting fta's funding recommendations for the two core capacity projects with grant agreements as of june 2017 , as well as interviews with fta officials and both project sponsors , we found that fta took steps to verify that the statutory requirements were met before recommending those two projects for full funding grant agreements . under statute , to assign a project rating , fta must evaluate and rate core capacity projects against specific project justification criteria and local financial commitment criteria , as well as ensure that the project has satisfied the project eligibility and other statutory requirements , such as having been selected as the locally preferred alternative and adopted into the appropriate regional transportation plans . by not addressing those provisions , fta runs the risk of failing to implement provisions of federal law , and the federal government or project sponsors may be missing opportunities to deliver transit projects more efficiently .
