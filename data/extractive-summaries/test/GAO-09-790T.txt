i am pleased to participate in this hearing on u.s . my statement will ( 1 ) update usps's financial condition and outlook and explain our recent decision to place usps's financial condition on our high - risk list , and ( 2 ) discuss the need for usps to restructure its mail processing , retail , and delivery networks and its efforts to improve their efficiency . my statement is based upon on our past and ongoing work , including the report being released today on usps efforts to improve delivery efficiency , and our report adding usps to the high - risk list , as well as our continued monitoring of usps's financial condition and outlook . usps's financial condition and outlook continue to deteriorate with a worsening outlook for mail volume and revenue . as a result , usps is projecting the following for fiscal year 2009: a net loss of about $7 billion , even if it achieves record cost savings of about $6 billion ; an increase in outstanding debt by the annual statutory limit of $3 billion ; and , despite this borrowing , an unprecedented $1 billion cash shortfall . usps has reported that it does not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fully make its mandated payment of $5.4 billion for future retiree health benefits that is due by september 30 , 2009 . the long - term challenge is to restructure usps operations , networks , and workforce to reflect changes in mail volume , use of the mail , and revenue . accordingly , we have called for usps to develop and implement a broad restructuring plan — with input from the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) and other stakeholders , and approval by congress and the administration — that includes key milestones and time frames for actions , addresses key issues , and identifies what steps congress and other stakeholders may need to take . we stated that usps's restructuring plan should address how it plans to realign postal services , such as delivery frequency , delivery standards , and access to retail services , with changes in the use of mail by consumers and businesses ; better align costs and revenues , including compensation and benefit costs ; optimize its operations , networks , and workforce ; increase mail volumes and revenues ; and retain earnings , so that it can finance needed capital investments and repay its growing debt . usps needs to optimize its retail , mail processing , and delivery networks to eliminate growing excess capacity and maintenance backlogs , reduce costs , and improve efficiency . usps has a window of opportunity to further reduce the cost and size of its workforce through attrition and the large number of upcoming retirements to minimize the need for layoffs . we recognize that usps would face formidable resistance to restructuring with many facility closures and consolidations because of concerns that these actions would impact service , employees , and local communities . usps senior management will need to provide leadership and work with stakeholders to overcome resistance for its actions to be successfully implemented . usps must use an open and transparent process that is fairly and consistently applied ; engage with its unions , management associations , the mailing industry , and political leaders ; and demonstrate results of actions . in turn , these stakeholders and congress need to recognize that major changes are urgently needed for usps to be financially viable . to its credit , usps recently began a national initiative to consolidate some of its 3,200 postal retail stations and branches in urban and suburban areas . usps has begun efforts to consolidate some mail processing operations , but much more needs to be done to restructure this network , particularly since usps has closed only 1 of its approximately 400 major mail processing facilities . first , usps is realigning city carrier routes to remove excess capacity and improve efficiency , which is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in annual savings . area mail processing ( amp ) study initiated 34 .
