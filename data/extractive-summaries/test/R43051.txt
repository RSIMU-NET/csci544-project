in the 1970s , the number of requests for tribal recognition by the department of the interior ( department ) increased exponentially in the wake of the decisions in united states v. washington , which recognized tribal treaty fishing rights in the pacific northwest , and joint tribal council of passamaquoddy v. morton , which recognized a tribal land claim on the east coast . faced with many requests for tribal recognition , in 1978 , the department adopted a uniform process and uniform criteria for considering whether a group should be acknowledged as an indian tribe . acknowledgment or recognition as an indian tribe has important legal and practical significance . one scholar on tribal acknowledgment explains the significance of tribal recognition as follows: an administrative determination that a group is a tribe ( i.e. , that it merits federal acknowledgment or recognition ) establishes a government - to - government relationship between it and the united states . a group acknowledged under the regulations has continuously existed throughout history . general prohibitions or limitations also apply to federally recognized tribes . the process set forth in 25 c.f.r . part 83 includes procedures that the department must follow and establishes the burden of proof for petitioners and the criteria that indian groups must satisfy in order to be acknowledged as indian tribes . the acknowledgment process is available to "american indian groups indigenous to the continental united states. . only "groups that can establish a substantially continuous tribal existence and which have functioned as autonomous entities throughout history until the present" may be acknowledged . groups that were subject to congressional termination may not use the process to be acknowledged . first , the proposed rule would change criterion ( a ) from identification as an indian entity from 1900 to the present to a narrative explaining , and proof of , tribal existence at some point in 1900 or before . current criteria 87.3 ( b ) and ( c ) require proof of community and proof of political authority from historical times to the present . second , the proposed rule would change the requirement of proof that the tribe's membership descends from a historical tribe to proof that 80% of the membership descends from a historical tribe . third , the proposed rule would establish that criterion ( e ) may be satisfied by a roll prepared either by interior or at the direction of congress , and that interior will rely on such a roll as an accurate roll of descendants of the tribe that existed in historical times . criterion 83.7 ( f ) requires that the petitioner is composed principally of persons who are not members of federally recognized tribes . finally , criterion 83.7 ( g ) now requires petitioners to establish that they are not subject to legislation forbidding or terminating the tribal - federal relationship . under the current practice , ofa makes recommendations to the assistant secretary , whom the current regulations charge with making proposed findings and final determinations . under the proposed rule , ofa would issue proposed findings and the assistant secretary would make final determinations . the proposed rule would provide for consideration of the criterion in stages and provide that petitioners receiving a negative proposed finding at any stage could appeal the finding to a judge within the office of hearings and appeals ( oha ) . second , if a petitioner did not seek review by the ibia or a federal court , or it did but there was no opposing party , a petitioner could re - petition if an oha judge determined that the petitioner had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that changes in the rules warranted a reconsideration of the final determination or that the wrong standard of proof was used in the final determination .
