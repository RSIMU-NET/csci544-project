the farm commodity provisions of the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , as amended ( p.l . on may 14 , 2013 , the senate agriculture committee reported its version of the bill ( s. 954 , the agriculture reform , food and jobs act of 2013 ) , which was approved by the full senate on june 10 , 2013 ( vote of 66-27 ) . on july 11 , the full house approved a revised bill , h.r . 2642 , which excluded a nutrition title , and on september 19 approved a nutrition title ( h.r . the house adopted a resolution ( h.res . 361 ) on september 28 that combined the texts of h.r . 2642 ) for purposes of resolving differences with the senate . conference on the two measures is pending . the broader farming community uses the term farm safety net to refer to the combination of ( 1 ) farm commodity price and income support programs in the 2008 farm bill , ( 2 ) federal crop insurance ( permanently authorized ) under the federal crop insurance act of 1980 as amended , and ( 3 ) five disaster assistance programs in the 2008 farm bill , which are currently unfunded . title i of both versions of the 2013 farm bill contains commodity and disaster program provisions , and modifications to the current crop insurance program are in title xi of the senate bill and title x of the house bill . both bills would reshape the structure of farm commodity support , reauthorize several disaster programs , and expand crop insurance coverage . direct payments — made to producers and landowners based on historical production and fixed payment rates for corn , wheat , soybeans , cotton , rice , peanuts , and other "covered" crops — have accounted for most farm program spending in recent years . in both bills , approximately three - fourths of the 10-year , $46 billion - $47 billion in savings ( as estimated by the congressional budget office ) associated with the proposed elimination of current farm programs would be used to offset the cost of updating farm programs ( title i ) , enhancing crop insurance ( title xi ) , and retroactively reauthorizing four disaster programs ( beginning fy2012 ) . these titles address the issue of "shallow losses" ( losses incurred by crop producers that are not covered currently by crop insurance ) and provide disaster assistance for livestock producers . 2642 would eliminate direct payments . importantly , the senate bill covers only crop years 2014-2018 . it also suspends permanent price support authority under the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 and agricultural adjustment act of 1949 , which would increase price supports well above current market levels and create substantial government outlays . in contrast , the house bill covers crop year 2014 and each succeeding crop year ( i.e. , no program expiration date ) and repeals permanent law . 2642 ) 2013 farm bills , farm support for traditional program crops is restructured by eliminating direct payments , the counter - cyclical price ( ccp ) program , and the average crop revenue election ( acre ) program . authority is continued for marketing assistance loans , which provide additional low - price protection at "loan rates" specified in current law ( with an adjustment made to the cotton loan rate ) . both 2013 farm bills retroactively reauthorize four programs covering livestock and tree assistance , specifically fy2012-fy2018 for the senate bill and beginning fy2012 and continuing without an expiration date for the house bill . the crop disaster program from the 2008 farm bill ( i.e. , supplemental revenue assistance , or sure ) is not reauthorized in either bill , but an element of it has been folded into the new arc program in the senate bill by allowing producers to protect against farm - level revenue losses ( the house bill has only a county - based revenue program ) . under h.r .
