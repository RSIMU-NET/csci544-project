the u.s. electricity and natural gas industries' transition to competitive markets has not been smooth . in august 2002 , the ferc chairman declared that omoi , with about half of its planned personnel in place , was a formal , functioning office within the agency . omoi has taken a significant step forward in setting out its vision , mission , and primary functions as a framework for comprehensively overseeing the markets ; developing its basic work processes ; and beginning to use an array of tools to oversee the markets . the office also has almost completed its staffing to authorized levels . ferc has described the role of the market monitoring units in various terms , including as the “first line of defense” against market problems , its “eyes and ears,” its “soldiers on the front line,” and as “practically an extension of , or a surrogate for , the commission's own market monitoring and investigative staff.” the significance of the monitoring units' role is illustrated by omoi's response to our request for information on how the office's market oversight approach will identify certain trading schemes , such as those used by the enron corporation in the california electricity market and other manipulations of the energy markets . by its very nature , the transformation process entails fundamental change . it is difficult to judge the validity of the staff's concerns until omoi has clearly defined its role . accordingly , we recommended that ferc develop a comprehensive strategic human capital management plan to include the following: a skills assessment program that would identify gaps in skills currently held by the workforce that are necessary to carry out the agency's evolving regulatory and oversight responsibilities ; a recruitment and retention initiative , based on priorities for meeting future regulatory and oversight staffing needs , which addresses filling skill gaps in the current workforce ; a training effort targeted at increasing staff knowledge in the areas of market functions and market structures so that ferc staff will be better prepared to regulate and oversee competitive energy markets ; and a comprehensive succession plan for solving challenges posed by the large number of impending retirements within the agency , including reliable projections of the number of eligible staff who may actually retire . however , work remains to be done to ensure ferc's plan is successful . in our june 2002 report , we noted that although ferc had taken steps to acquire and develop the staff knowledge and skills it needed to effectively regulate and oversee energy markets , it had not fully explored all the human capital flexibilities that are available to federal agencies for responding to workforce challenges . since our prior report , ferc has expanded its use of some existing human capital flexibilities to improve its ability to recruit and retain employees . in addition , ferc has expanded its use of recruitment and retention bonuses . while these initiatives are important to omoi's success , the activities that the office needs to engage in , the information and other resources it needs to carry out these activities , and the working relationships it needs to establish with others depend on the role that it has defined for itself to achieve its mission . in addition , omoi has not clearly defined market power , although market power is a major oversight concern and an issue that omoi has to make sure is adequately addressed . thus , we do not disagree with the office's decision to begin its work with few formal processes and written procedures as it , in effect , was developing and testing them . establishing formal processes and developing written procedures are important to help ensure that they are systematic , understood , and implemented effectively . although ferc's recently completed human capital plan begins to lay the foundation for the agency to strategically manage its human capital , it does not yet contain key elements that could increase the likelihood that the plan will be effective . to strengthen ferc's human capital plan , we recommend that the chairman of ferc revise the agency's plan to ( 1 ) identify specific activities , resources , and time frames to implement the human capital initiatives and ( 2 ) provide results - oriented measures to track the agency's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness . survey results will be reported in summary form .
