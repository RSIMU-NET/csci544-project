at the time the executive order and february 2017 memo were issued , the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) was also operating under an august 2016 memo , titled identification and monitoring of pregnant detainees , that stated that pregnant women would generally not be detained except in extraordinary circumstances or as mandated by law . this report examines ( 1 ) what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in dhs facilities ; ( 2 ) policies and standards that dhs has to address the care of pregnant women , and the extent to which they are applicable across all facilities ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in dhs facilities . to address all three objectives , we interviewed dhs officials from ice and u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) in headquarters and four field locations , pregnant detainees , and non - governmental organizations ( ngo ) to obtain their perspectives on the care of pregnant women in dhs custody . cbp temporarily holds individuals to complete general processing and determine the appropriate course of action , such as transferring them to a court , jail , prison , or another agency ; relocating them into ice detention facilities ; removing them from the country ; or releasing them — as cbp has discretion to release individuals with a notice to appear in court . detention facility . cbp has some policies and standards regarding the care of pregnant women held in their short - term facilities . although these policies and national standards do not cover the full range of the 16 pregnancy - related care topics we identified , cbp facilities are designed for holding individuals for no more than 72 hours ; therefore , cbp's facilities are not equipped to provide long - term care . pregnancy testing performed at intake: 93 percent pregnancy testing performed prior to x - rays or initiating medication: 100 percent obstetrician - gynecologist ( ob - gyn ) consult ordered within 7 days of pregnancy confirmation: 98 percent patient seen by ob - gyn within 30 days of pregnancy confirmation: prenatal vitamins prescribed: 100 percent screened for hiv , sexually transmitted infections , and viral hepatitis: instances of non - compliance — which were 9 percent or less for each measure — occurred at 16 detention facilities subject to a range of detention standards . three of these facilities were ihsc - staffed facilities , and 13 were non - ihsc facilities . cbp generally relies on offsite care for pregnant women , and as a result , has limited available information on care cbp provided to pregnant women . however , they have efforts underway to enhance its medical support at selected facilities . as shown in figure 2 , some of these complaints were under investigation as of august 2019 , and some were substantiated ; however , in most cases there was not enough information for the investigating agency to determine if proper care had been provided , among other things . investigations partially substantiated one complaint regarding delays in medical care being provided . investigations found that five complaints were unsubstantiated , and one was partially unsubstantiated . these women who experienced such outcomes while detained may include the same women reported in our study population of more than 4,600 pregnant women detentions from calendar years 2016 through 2018 , as well as pregnant women detained in calendar year 2015 and january through june 2019 . to address our third objective , we analyzed reports and data from five ice inspections that address compliance with pregnancy - related policies and detention standards from 2015 through july 2019 — the most recent information available at the time of our review . the following ice policies address pregnant detainees and ice supervision of pregnant detainees: ice directive 11032.3: identification and monitoring of pregnant detainees ( 2017 ) ice directive 11065.1: review of the use of segregation for ice detainees ( 2013 ) ice directive 11002.1: parole of arriving aliens found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture ( 2010 ) ice memorandum: use of gps monitoring devices on persons who are pregnant or diagnosed with a severe medical condition ( 2009 ) ice ero policy 11155.1: use of restraints ( 2012 ) enforcement and removal operations national detainee handbook ( 2016 ) these ice - wide policies do not apply to contract or facility staff unless ice modified the facility's contract or if these are already included in the facility's detention standards to which they are obligated . numerous professional associations , non - governmental organizations , and federal agencies have issued guidance on care to be provided to pregnant women .  ( 2018 ) national women's law center: women behind bars: a state - by - state report card and analysis of federal policies on conditions of confinement for pregnant and parenting women and the effect on their children ( 2010 ) united nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non - custodial measures for women offenders ( the bangkok rules ) ( 2010 ) u.s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) : report of the dhs advisory committee on family residential centers ( 2016 ) u.s. department of justice , bureau of justice assistance: best practices in the use of restraints with pregnant women and girls under correctional custody ( 2014 ) u.s department of justice report and recommendations concerning the use of restrictive housing ( 2016 ) because the specificity of the guidance varies across entities , we summarized the recommended guidance for our report purposes . table 10 shows results from december 2016 through march 2019 . we identified 50 unique complaints submitted from january 2015 through april 2019 regarding cbp's care of pregnant women .
