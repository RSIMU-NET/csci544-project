sometimes perceived to be a foreign issue , human trafficking — the exploitation of a person typically through force , fraud , or coercion for such purposes as forced labor , involuntary servitude or commercial sex — is occurring in the united states . the justice for victims of trafficking act ( jvta ) of 2015 includes a provision for gao to report on federal and selected state efforts to combat human trafficking in the united states , as well as identify federal grant programs that can be used to assist victims of trafficking . 3 . duplication occurs on multiple levels . in 2015 , the president signed into law the jvta , which , among other things , required the attorney general to ensure that law enforcement officers and federal prosecutors receive anti - trafficking training ; required the federal judicial center , the research and education agency of the federal judicial system , to provide training for judges on ordering restitution for victims of certain trafficking - related offenses under chapter 77 of title 18 , u.s. code ; mandated that the secretary of homeland security implement a human trafficking training program for department personnel ; and required the attorney general to implement and maintain a national strategy for combating human trafficking . federal agencies have begun efforts to assess the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states and develop data standards and definitions to help facilitate prevalence studies . the purpose of the project is to inform the development of an integrated data collection platform regarding human trafficking victimization ; establish baseline knowledge of human trafficking and victim needs ; and support effective prevention and intervention responses . hhs , in consultation with key stakeholders , has developed draft data fields and definitions for human trafficking and expects to begin piloting the data collection effort in fall 2016 . according to federal , state , and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors we interviewed , investigating and prosecuting human trafficking crimes is challenging for multiple reasons , including a lack of victim cooperation , limited availability of victim services , difficulty identifying human trafficking , and others . federal , state and local agencies have taken or are taking some actions to address these challenges , such as increasing the availability of services , primarily by providing funding through grants . officials in 25 of the 32 interviews we conducted with law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies reported that they faced challenges with victim cooperation . in general , officials stated that obtaining the victim's cooperation is important for human trafficking investigations and prosecutions because the victim is generally the primary witness and source of evidence . for example: virginia's department of social services is required to develop a plan providing for , among other things , preparation and dissemination of educational and training programs and materials to increase awareness of human trafficking and services available to victims among local departments of social services , public and private agencies and service providers , and the public ; and north dakota's department of transportation is required to display in every transportation station , rest area , and welcome center , a public - awareness sign that contains state or local human trafficking resource information as well as the nhtrc hotline number . according to fbi and ice hsi officials , the agencies are taking steps to address this challenge . in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 , 123 organizations were awarded funds under these grant programs . further , doj has taken action to implement recommendations from a prior gao report to identify overlapping grant programs and mitigate the risk of unnecessary grant award duplication in its programs . in response to these recommendations , doj also requires grant applicants to identify in their applications any federal grants they are currently operating under as well as federal grants for which they have applied . the department of labor and the equal employment opportunity commission did not provide comments . to address the first objective , we reviewed prior gao human trafficking reports , the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 and other federal laws related to human trafficking , and we interviewed department of justice ( doj ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) officials , to learn whether their component agencies had efforts underway to collect human tracking data that could be used to determine the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states . t nonimmigrant status may be available for victims of severe forms of trafficking who meet the following criteria: physical presence in the united states on account of such trafficking ; compliance with any reasonable request for assistance by law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of the trafficking ( unless the victim is unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma , or is under 18 years of age ) ; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm if removed from the united states.the number of t visas that may be granted each fiscal year is limited by statute to 5,000 for victims . fifteen are intended solely for these purposes .
