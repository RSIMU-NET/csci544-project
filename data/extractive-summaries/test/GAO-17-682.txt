generally , the types of contracts that have been used for fms are firm - fixed - price contracts — where the government pays the contractor a set amount regardless of the contractor's costs — and fixed - price - incentive contracts — where the government and contractor share in cost savings and risks and the contractor's ability to earn a profit is tied to performance . this report addresses 1 ) how the use of firm - fixed - price contracts compares to other contract types awarded for fms procurements and the reasons they were used and 2 ) the factors that may contribute to delays and potentially increase costs for fms procurements . to determine trends in the contracts used by dod to support fms procurements over the past 10 years , we analyzed contracting data from fpds - ng for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 , which represented the most current and complete data available to analyze trends over time . for each of the seven acquisition programs and 32 fms cases in our sample , we reviewed contracts and other related documentation , fms case documentation such as letters of request from foreign governments and letters of offer and acceptance provided by military departments , and interviewed contracting and acquisition program officials to discuss the challenges that programs may have faced when procuring items for fms customers . at times , dod may combine fms purchases with its own procurements . however , in recent years , there has been an increase in the use of fixed - price - incentive contracts for fms procurements , which is consistent with dod guidance that has emphasized the use of these contracts . dod is in the early stages of implementing the fiscal year 2017 ndaa requirement to use firm - fixed - price contracts and is weighing various factors such as how waivers will be reviewed and approved . while there was a decrease in obligations on fixed - price - incentive contracts awarded for dod's requirements from fiscal year 2013 to 2014 , obligations on these contracts for dod and fms have generally increased and consistently stayed above the levels prior to when guidance emphasizing use of fixed - price - incentive contracts , where appropriate , was issued in 2010 . for example , on an individual fms case to acquire the joint air - to - surface standoff missile ( jassm ) , the program office first awarded a cost - plus - fixed - fee contract because the scope of work to customize the missile with new hardware and software to meet the foreign customer's needs was broad and requirements could not be sufficiently defined for a firm - fixed - price contract . the fiscal year 2017 ndaa called for dod to revise its acquisition regulations to require the use of firm - fixed - price contracts for items procured under the fms program , unless a waiver is granted or the foreign customer states a preference for an alternate contract type . dod is in the early stages of implementing these changes . officials from multiple programs noted that using checklists helped to facilitate quicker requirements development . existing dod guidance suggests , but does not require , that program offices use checklists to help facilitate requirements definition . program officials noted that various extenuating factors can hinder timely fms acquisitions ; however , they also acknowledged there are benefits to using checklists to expedite requirements definition , which is a key first step in the fms process . as such , programs may be missing opportunities to realize efficiencies in the fms process by not using readily available checklists that can help facilitate timely requirements definition . finally , the joint standoff weapon program reported that fms deliveries will be missed because of delays in providing government furnished equipment resulting from export controls issues that arose in a separate procurement for warheads . to help increase efficiency when defining fms requirements to be placed on contract , we recommend that the secretary of defense issue department - wide guidance for the military departments and dod components to expand the use of requirements checklists to develop more comprehensive letters of request for fms cases . the house report 114-537 that accompanied the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2017 included a provision for gao to review certain aspects of department of defense's ( dod ) acquisition process , including contract type selection , to determine their effect , if any , on foreign military sales ( fms ) .
