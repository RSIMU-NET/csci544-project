to support the education and training of health professionals , the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , administers numerous health professions education and training programs authorized under title vii of the public health service act . in reports accompanying hhs appropriations bills for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 , congressional appropriations committees with responsibility for hhs programs noted with approval that hrsa had given “priority consideration for hcop grants to minority health professions institutions.” in the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2005 appropriations act , however , the conference committee expressed concern that several applications for new or competitive continuation grants from historically minority health professions schools had not been funded for fiscal year 2004 . in addition , we interviewed hrsa officials and reviewed relevant federal laws , congressional committee reports , and agency documents . to determine whether applicants and grantees that were institutions of higher education met criteria for designation as minority - serving institutions , we used department of education documents and other sources . the 1998 reauthorization of hcop emphasized the importance of outreach activities by adding a funding preference for hcop applications for projects that “involve a comprehensive approach by several public or private nonprofit health or educational entities to establish , enhance and expand educational programs that will result in the development of a competitive applicant pool of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who desire to pursue health professions careers.” applications qualifying for this funding preference have an advantage because they must be considered for funding ahead of applications that do not . according to hrsa officials , in the 1990s , the agency allocated additional points to the scores of applications from historically black colleges and universities , hispanic - serving institutions , and tribal colleges and universities to improve their chances of receiving an hcop grant . for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , hrsa followed a standard process to award hcop grant funds , distributing the program's available funds on a noncompetitive basis to continue funding existing grant projects , then awarding the remaining funds on a competitive basis . these noncompetitive continuation awards were subject to hrsa officials' approval after the agency reviewed each grantee's annual progress report . for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , hrsa's standard process for awarding competitive hcop grants relied on independent reviewers to assess applications against the agency's published review criteria . for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , minority - serving institutions submitted a total of 25 percent of all applications for competitive hcop grants and received about 30 percent of awards . iii ) , hrsa stated that the report met the goals of describing the award process and outlining the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees .
