as you requested , this report discusses large bank holding company ( bhc ) mergers and the impact of such mergers on lending in low - and moderate - income ( lmi ) areas . in reviewing bhc merger applications , the federal reserve board ( frb ) has a statutory responsibility , established by the bank holding company act of 1956 ( bhc act ) and the community reinvestment act of 1977 ( cra ) , to take into account an institution's record of community credit performance when evaluating the application . as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to analyze ( 1 ) frb's legal responsibilities in assessing bhc mergers for cra performance ; ( 2 ) frb's process for assessing the cra performance of six large bhc merger applicants , including how frb addressed the principal public concerns related to the cra performance ; and ( 3 ) the premerger and postmerger mortgage lending in lmi and minority communities for three large bhc mergers . in reviewing an application filed by a bank holding company , frb is required to consider several factors , including the financial and managerial resources of the applicant , the future prospects of both the applicant and the bank holding company that is to be acquired , the competitive effects of the merger , and the convenience and needs of the community to be served . in acting on a bhc merger application , frb must consider the convenience and needs of the community to be served under the bhc act and take into account the records of the relevant depository institutions under cra . the federal regulators , including frb , have developed guidance on how to assess a depository institution's cra performance . frb conducted analyses with hmda and cra small business data to address concerns of insufficient home mortgage and small business lending , respectively . frb's consideration of branch closures was generally limited to a determination of whether the applicant had an adequate branch closure policy and its past branch closure record . the four principal cra concerns raised in the six mergers were ( 1 ) an insufficient amount of home mortgage lending in lmi areas , ( 2 ) an insufficient amount of small business lending in lmi areas , ( 3 ) expected bank branch closures in lmi areas , and ( 4 ) the lack of specificity in cra agreements . frb's lack of written guidance for how it addresses public comments contributed to the concerns voiced by some community groups and two bhcs regarding the lack of transparency in the merger application process . in the six bhc merger applications that we reviewed , it appeared to us that frb attempted to balance the cra performance ratings of the bank subsidiaries of the merging bhcs with information presented through public comments that raised concerns with the institutions' cra records . nbd corporation acquired first chicago corporation in 1995 . commenters raised cra concerns for both chemical and chase manhattan .
