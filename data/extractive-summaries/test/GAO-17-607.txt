in contrast , opponents of the provision maintained that swaps trading by banks did not significantly contribute to the 2007 â€” 2009 financial crisis . for example , an airline may enter into a commodity swap to lock in its fuel price over a certain time horizon , so that it can better manage its costs . as such , a bhc can continue to engage in those swaps through its nonbank subsidiaries . we estimated that these banks continue to hold about $10.5 trillion of such swaps in notional value ( or around 6 percent of their total derivatives ) due to the section 716 amendment . amended section 716 operational costs . the bhcs stated they incurred some legal costs in establishing new isda master agreements when needed . like the amended section 716 , the original section 716 did not require a bank swap dealer to move legacy swaps to its affiliated nonbank swap dealer to remain eligible for federal assistance , but as discussed later , the bank's clients might have requested their swaps to be moved to the nonbank swap dealer to take advantage of netting efficiencies . our analyses indicate the 11 u.s. banks that would have been affected by the original section 716 held financial resources needed to support their swap - related credit , liquidity , and market risk exposures as of september 30 , 2016 . section 716 seeks to reduce the risk of the federal government having to provide assistance backed by taxpayers to cover losses of a failed bank , but other dodd - frank act provisions also mitigate this risk . federal banking regulators and large bhcs are developing resolution strategies that seek to resolve a large bhc , if it were to fail , in an orderly manner and without federal assistance . these strategies , if successful , could help enable the bhc and its bank swap dealer to unwind or sell its swaps in an orderly manner and avoid value destruction . specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the number of u.s. banks and the value of their swaps affected under the amended section 716 and that would have been affected under the original section 716 ; ( 2 ) the actual and potential costs or negative effects of the amended and original section 716 for u.s. banks and swap end - users , ( 3 ) u.s. banks' risks associated with swap activities that continue to be carried on by the banks due to the section 716 amendment and mitigating factors , and ( 4 ) the effects of section 716 and other dodd - frank act requirements on risk to taxpayers in the event of a bank failure . to examine the number of u.s. banks and the value of their swaps affected under the amended section 716 and that would have been affected under the original section 716 , we reviewed both versions of the provision ; analyses of section 716 prepared by the federal bank regulators ( the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) , and office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) ) and four large banks ; regulations issued by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) on the registration of swap and security - based swap dealers and major swap and security - based swap participants ; list of entities provisionally registered as swap dealers with cftc ; and reports , studies , and other materials on section 716 , swaps , or asset - backed securities issued by gao , law firms , market participants , and others . to examine the banks' risks associated with swap activities that continue to be carried on by the banks due to the section 716 amendment and the effects of section 716 and other dodd - frank act requirements on risk to taxpayers in the event of a bank failure , we reviewed the dodd - frank act's prudential and resolution reforms and related regulations , including on risk - based and leverage capital requirements , liquidity requirements , total loss - absorbing capacity , global systemically important bank holding companies , the volcker rule , orderly liquidation authority , and resolution plan requirements ; joint feedback and guidance provided by the federal reserve and fdic to bank holding companies on their resolution plans ; federal reserve's and occ's bank examination manuals and related derivatives guidance ; publicly available regulatory filings submitted by u.s. banks registered as swap dealers or their parent holding companies , including sec annual or quarterly filings and resolution plans ; and industry , academic , and other studies or reports examining the role of derivatives in the recent financial crisis and ways to mitigate risks posed by derivatives under the u.s. bankruptcy code . in 2015 and 2016 , all section 716 banks and their bhcs were market risk firms . the original section 716 of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) generally prohibited the provision of federal assistance to banks registered as swap dealers that engaged in equity swaps , commodity ( except for precious metals ) swaps , and noncleared credit default swaps activity , unless , among other things , the institution limited its swap activities to hedging and other similar risk mitigating activities directly related to the institution's activities . also , we recognize that our estimates likely overestimate the banks' counterparty credit and liquidity exposures associated with section 716 originally covered swaps , in part because they do or likely include ( 1 ) swaps that were used for hedging and , thus , would have been permissible under the original section 716 , ( 2 ) swaps that the banks entered into before section 716 would have taken effect and thus could have been retained by the banks , and ( 3 ) swaps that were not covered by the original section 716 , such as commodity swaps referencing bullion or cleared credit default swaps . for the other seven bank swap dealers that would have had to stop engaging in swaps activity for swaps covered by the original section 716 had it not been amended , in order to retain access to federal assistance , we used the total net derivatives trading assets and liabilities as reported in the september 30 , 2016 , call reports . these reforms , if successful , can help bhcs with banks that are large swap dealers wind - down their swaps in an orderly manner and preserve their value .
