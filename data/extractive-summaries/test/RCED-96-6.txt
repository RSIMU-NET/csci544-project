in discussion with the congressional committees identified in section 1098 , we agreed to address ( 1 ) the way the formula works and the relevancy of the data used for the formula and ( 2 ) the major funding objectives implicit in the formula and the implications of alternative formula factors for achieving these objectives . funding for these demonstration projects is not distributed by formula . the formula for apportioning federal - aid highway funds established in istea is a complex arithmetic tool used by fhwa to determine each state's share of the funds . not only is the total funding for the four major programs fixed over the life of istea , but the funding for the two largest programs — the nhs and stp , together accounting for 40 percent of all the funding apportioned in fiscal year 1995 — is based , in part , on underlying factors that are largely irrelevant to the highway system's needs . therefore , these adjustments essentially increase the funding calculated for a state up to that point . for major highway programs , the data underlying the distribution of highway funds to the states are generally outdated , unresponsive to changing conditions , and often not reflective of the nation's highway system or its usage . on the basis of our analysis and discussions with federal and state transportation officials , istea's myriad objectives for highways can be placed into four overarching categories: ( 1 ) maintaining and improving the highway infrastructure , ( 2 ) returning the majority of funds to the state where the revenue was generated , ( 3 ) fostering social benefits , and ( 4 ) safeguarding the states' historical funding shares . however , a formula based on direct measures of need could prove problematic .
