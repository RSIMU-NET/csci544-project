however , neither the va nor other government agencies report information specifically on the housing conditions or housing costs of veterans who rent . the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) is the primary federal provider of rental housing assistance through its housing choice voucher , public housing , and project - based programs . specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households ; ( 2 ) how hud's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( that is , whether a person is a veteran or not ) and veteran - specific benefits in determining eligibility and subsidy amounts ; ( 3 ) the extent to which phas and property owners participating in hud's rental assistance programs establish a veterans' preference in their administrative and tenant selection plans ; and ( 4 ) the extent to which hud's rental assistance programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005 . to determine how hud's rental assistance programs treat households veteran status in determining eligibility and subsidy amounts , we reviewed hud's eligibility policies and regulations on rental assistance programs and interviewed officials from hud and va. to determine whether phas and property owners participating in hud's programs have established a veterans' preference for households , we conducted interviews with officials from the 41 largest phas that administer the public housing program ( 34 phas ) and the voucher program ( 40 phas ) , and from the 13 largest performance - based contract administrators ( pbca ) that oversee property management under project - based rental assistance programs . as shown in figure 3 , the percentages of veteran renter households that were low income in 2005 also varied considerably by state . specifically , of the 22 million other low - income renter households , an estimated 13.9 million , or about 63 percent , had a housing affordability problem , with these households somewhat evenly distributed between those with moderate and severe affordability problems . further , hud policies generally do not distinguish between income sources that are specific to veterans , such as va - provided benefits , and other sources of income . an estimated 11 percent of all low - income veteran renter households received hud rental assistance , compared with 19 percent of other low - income households . although the reasons for this difference are unclear , various factors — such as different levels of need for affordable housing among veteran and other households — could contribute to the disparity . the assistant secretary's letter states that “hud objects to the characterization that policies for its three major rental assistance programs generally do not take veteran status into account when determining eligibility or assistance levels” and notes that “hud cannot mandate that a pha establish any particular type of preference” for their voucher program . accordingly , we did not change our report in this regard . to determine the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran households , we analyzed data from the u.s. bureau of the census's ( census ) 2005 american community survey ( acs ) , which identified households' veteran status , income , and other demographic characteristics , in conjunction with hud's defined income categories: low ( 80 percent or less of area median income or ami ) , very low ( 50 percent or less of ami ) , and extremely low ( 30 percent or less of ami ) .
