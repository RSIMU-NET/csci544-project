in january 2002 , dod issued policy encouraging the use of such public - private partnerships in order to combine the best commercial processes and practices with dod's extensive depot maintenance capabilities with the objective of improving the efficiency and viability of dod's depots . of the 90 partnerships we reviewed , 28 either improved some aspects of repair performance or showed potential for doing so . appendix iv provides six examples of partnerships that are achieving these improvements . on the other hand , 19 partnerships thus far have generated no work for the depots . however , dod's ability to measure the partnerships' overall success is limited because it has not yet developed baseline data and measurable goals for assessing the outcomes of its partnering efforts and the metrics that it has developed sometimes will not provide the clear data needed to fully assess the partnerships . the opportunities available for dod to expand its use of public - private partnerships may be limited by external factors that the services cannot replicate or create at will . although dod expects private - sector partners to contribute to developing these capabilities , the extent to which the private sector will make such investments is uncertain . the department's january 2002 partnership policy encourages public - private partnerships to be structured to improve the deteriorating condition of depot facilities and equipment by “leveraging private - sector investments , such as facilities and equipment , to contribute to re - capitalization of depot maintenance activities.” however , dod's data on the investments made by the private sector in military depots to support partnership as of the end of fiscal year 2002 show only about $6.9 million in private - sector investment at all dod depots . even with the significant increase in the number of dod's public - private partnerships from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002 , the existing partnerships represent only 2.2 percent of dod's $19 billion depot maintenance program . without initially establishing both clear and measurable goals to define success in improving the efficiency and viability of its depots and the metrics that provide the relevant data for the measurement , dod has limited objective means to assess whether the partnerships are working as intended . to improve the management , direction , potential for success , and assessment of its public - private partnerships , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics to establish baseline data and overarching goals for expected outcomes of partnership efforts , including the partnership initiative's desired improvements to depot operations and develop or refine metrics as needed to provide a more complete basis to assess the results of the depot partnering arrangements as well as ensuring that they differentiate between improvements to a weapon system's support resulting from partnering and from other factors or changes affecting the weapon system . dod and contractor officials have identified 14 characteristics that they believe over time will contribute to a partnership's success in achieving dod's objective of improved depot efficiency and viability . balanced workload .
