the health care reform debate raises many complex issues including those of coverage , accessibility , cost , accountability , and quality of health care . underlying these policy considerations are issues regarding the status of health or health care as a moral , legal , or constitutional right . it may be useful to distinguish between a right to health and a right to health care . "health care" connotes the means for the achievement of health , as in the "care , services or supplies related to the health of an individual. . for purposes of this report , discussion will be limited to constitutional and legal issues pertaining to a right to health care . the debate on these and other questions may be informed by a summary of the scope of the right to health care , particularly the right to access health care paid for by the government , under the u.s. constitution , and under interpretations of the u.s. supreme court . while the united states constitution and supreme court interpretations do not identify a constitutional right to health care at the government's expense , congress has enacted numerous statutes which establish and define statutory rights of individuals to receive medical services from the government . congress' power to tax and spend for the general welfare and its power to regulate interstate commerce have been the primary sources of constitutional authority for most health care legislation . thirteen state constitutions contain provisions which specifically refer to health . as a general matter , state constitutional rights may be more expansive than those found under the federal bill of rights , since federal rights set the minimum standards for the states . states are always free to provide for greater protections for their citizens than are provided on the national level . the provision of health care services under a state health care program may be subject to limitations under equal protection provisions in a state constitution . the court noted that the state was undergoing a financial crisis at the time the commonwealth care program was amended , and that the motivation for the provision appeared to be fiscal , which could not constitute a compelling justification for the exclusion of certain classes of legal aliens from the subsidized insurance program .
