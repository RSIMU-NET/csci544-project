according to tsa , in fiscal year 2017 , more than 771 million passengers were screened at 440 airports across the united states . as of january 2016 , nhtp was replaced by tso basic training , an intensive two - week training program at the tsa academy ( academy ) located at the federal law enforcement training centers ( fletc ) campus in glynco , georgia . in 2015 and 2017 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) inspector general identified vulnerabilities in tsa checkpoint screening , after agents carried metallic ( inoperable handguns ) and nonmetallic ( simulated explosive ) test items concealed on their body through tsa passenger security checkpoints and into the sterile areas of airports . as a result , you asked us to review tsa's training of new tsos through the tso basic training program . this report: ( 1 ) describes the reasons why tsa established tso basic training ; ( 2 ) discusses factors otd considers when updating the tso basic training curriculum ; and ( 3 ) assesses the extent to which tsa evaluates its tso basic training program . to describe the reasons tsa established the tso basic training program at the tsa academy , we reviewed documents related to the establishment of the program , such as agency training plans , a management directive , and the business case for tso basic training submitted by tsa to congress . we also interviewed officials from the office of security operations ( oso ) , the office that manages tsos at the nation's airports , the office of inspection ( ooi ) , which conducts covert testing to evaluate checkpoint effectiveness , and otd to determine why modifications were made and how the offices communicate regarding updates to standard operating procedures and other processes that may impact tso basic training . the act established tsa as the agency with responsibility for securing all modes of transportation , including civil aviation . otd is responsible for developing initial and ongoing training curricula for tsos based in part on sops . tso basic training includes a full suite of dedicated checkpoint equipment and x - ray image simulators for students to practice learned skills , eliminating the challenge of finding available equipment and training times in a busy airport environment ( see figure 2 ) . according to tsa officials , before tso basic training , training at individual airports was often conducted by tsos for whom instruction was a collateral duty , whereas instructors at the academy have full - time training responsibilities and enhanced opportunities to learn from each other , increase their professional training skills , and provide feedback on the delivery of course curriculum . centralized facility and shared logistics . tsa anticipates that centralized , standardized training will not only provide trainees with an increased focus on the tsa mission and operational environment , but can serve to instill a common culture and sense of belonging among the broader community of tsos nationwide . once tsos are able to perform these initial tasks , they will attend tso basic training at the academy , officials told us they are preparing for the change by modifying the tso basic training curriculum to eliminate subjects that will be covered at the airports and to emphasize skills that more experienced tsos will need , such as performing physical searches of passengers . for example , two tsa offices — oso and the office of inspections — perform regular effectiveness testing of airport checkpoints through covert testing and share the results with otd . officials told us that oso and otd hold regular meetings to discuss the analyses of covert testing failures and ways in which training curriculum can be modified to address the reasons for the failures , which are then incorporated into the tso basic training curriculum . to evaluate the tso basic training program , tsa uses the kirkpatrick model , which is a commonly accepted training evaluation model endorsed by the office of personnel management and used throughout the federal government . while tsa reported potential benefits of tso basic training in its business case and implemented the kirkpatrick model to assess training , it has not yet identified specific goals that the tso basic training program is expected to achieve , nor has it developed performance measures to evaluate progress toward goals . although tsa has implemented a framework to assess participant reactions to the training and their knowledge of course content , it has not yet established goals for the tso basic training program or measures to gauge effectiveness of the training tsos receive to determine the extent to which they can fulfill their crucial role in ensuring passenger safety .
