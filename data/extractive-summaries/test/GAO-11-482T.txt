in march 2011 , we reviewed documentation provided by state and iaea and interviewed state and department of energy ( doe ) officials to obtain updated information on actions taken to implement our 2009 recommendations . the tc program is a main pillar of iaea's mission to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy . doe provides technical input to this process using the technical expertise of its national laboratories to assess the projects' proliferation risks and reports its findings to state . in our 2009 report , we identified potential proliferation concerns with the tc program , including concerns about certain countries receiving tc assistance — such as those designated by the united states as state sponsors of terrorism — and lack of sufficient and timely information from iaea on tc project proposals to allow the united states or other member states to assess the proliferation risks of the proposed projects . we also identified several limitations in how the tc program is managed , which could undermine its long - term effectiveness , including the use of outdated program metrics and financial resource constraints . in our 2009 report , we found that neither state nor iaea sought to systematically limit or prevent tc assistance to countries that ( 1 ) have been identified as sponsors of terrorism , ( 2 ) are not parties to the npt , and ( 3 ) have not completed comprehensive safeguards or additional protocol agreements with iaea . shortcomings in u.s. policies and iaea procedures related to tc program fellowships . based on our findings , we asked congress to consider directing state to withhold a proportionate share of future u.s. voluntary contributions to the tc program that is equivalent to the amounts of tcf funding that would otherwise be made available to u.s. - designated state sponsors of terrorism and other countries of concern , as it currently does with cuba and has done in the past with iran , libya , and the territories under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority . in addition , we recommended that the secretary of state , working with iaea and member states through the board of governors , explore undertaking the following eight actions to address the range of proliferation and management concerns related to the tc program: establish a formal mechanism to facilitate greater and more timely information sharing on tc project proposals between iaea and the united states and other countries — including detailed information on the tc proposals themselves , as well as the results of iaea's internal proliferation reviews of the proposals — so that proliferation and other concerns can be identified and addressed early in the project development cycle . in its comments on our 2009 report , state objected to the matter for a number of reasons , noting that ( 1 ) it would be counterproductive to a separate recommendation we made in the report encouraging all states to pay their full share to the tcf ; ( 2 ) it would not stop tc projects in targeted countries because tcf funding is fungible ; ( 3 ) congress has exempted iaea contributions from this type of proportionate withholding ; ( 4 ) none of the tc projects in state sponsors of terrorism have been shown to have contributed to a wmd program ; ( 5 ) there are adequate safeguards within iaea's secretariat to prevent tc projects from contributing to a wmd program ; and ( 6 ) it would negatively impact the ability of the united states to achieve other critical objectives within iaea . we continue to believe that congress should give serious consideration to this matter , and that it is not unique or unprecedented . to avoid the appearance of an inconsistent approach and to foster greater cohesion in u.s. policy toward such nations , we believe that it is fair for congress to consider requiring state to withhold a share of the u.s. contribution to the tcf for program activities in countries that the united states chooses not to engage directly in trade , assistance , and other forms of cooperation . state has developed formal guidance establishing criteria for accepting or denying applications from tc fellows from foreign countries requesting opportunities to study nuclear issues at institutions in the united states . we are making no new recommendations at this time .
