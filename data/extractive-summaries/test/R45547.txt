it examines historical and recent trends in aid to the region ; the trump administration's fy2019 budget request for aid administered by the state department , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the inter - american foundation ; and fy2019 foreign aid appropriations legislation . that amount would have been $581 million , or 34% , less than the estimated $1.7 billion of assistance congress appropriated for the region in fy2018 ( see table 1 ) . the administration also proposed eliminating the inter - american foundation — a small , independent u.s. foreign assistance agency that promotes grassroots development in latin america and the caribbean — and consolidating its programs into usaid . on february 15 , 2019 , nearly four and a half months into the fiscal year , president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) . the measure was preceded by three short - term continuing resolutions ( p.l . 115-245 , p.l . 116-5 ) , which funded foreign assistance programs at the fy2018 level , and a 35-day lapse in appropriations from december 22 , 2018 , to january 25 , 2019 . although the house and senate appropriations committees had approved their fy2019 foreign assistance appropriations measures ( h.r . 6385 and s. 3108 , respectively ) in june 2018 , neither bill received floor consideration prior to the end of the 115 th congress . p.l . 116-6 and the accompanying joint explanatory statement do not specify foreign assistance appropriations levels for every latin american and caribbean nation . nevertheless , the amounts designated for key u.s. initiatives in central america , colombia , and mexico significantly exceed the administration's request ( see table 4 ) . according to the joint explanatory statement , the act provides $527.6 million to continue implementation of the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america . that amount is $92 million more than the administration requested but $99 million less than congress appropriated for the initiative in fy2018 . colombia . the act provides "not less than" $418.3 million for colombia , which is nearly $153 million more than the administration requested and $27 million more than congress appropriated in fy2018 . mexico . that amount is nearly $84 million more than the administration requested and $10 million more than congress appropriated for mexico in fy2018 . the trump administration's efforts to scale back u.s. foreign assistance could have significant implications for u.s. policy in latin america and the caribbean in the coming years . in particular , they could accelerate u.s. efforts to transition countries in the region away from traditional development assistance and toward other forms of bilateral engagement . they also could result in the department of defense ( dod ) taking on a larger role in u.s. security cooperation with the region . moreover , many argue the administration's proposed foreign assistance cuts , combined with other u.s. policy shifts and the region's growing economic ties with other countries , such as china , could contribute to a relative decline in u.s. influence in latin america and the caribbean . although the relative importance of foreign assistance in u.s. relations with latin american and caribbean nations has declined since the end of the cold war , the u.s. government continues to use assistance to advance key policy initiatives in the region . 115-829 , for example , the house appropriations committee asserted that "the magnitude of the reductions proposed for united states diplomatic and development operations and programs in the fiscal year 2019 request would be counterproductive to the economic and security interests of the nation and would undermine our relationships with key partners and allies. . appendix a. u.s. foreign assistance to latin america and the caribbean by account and country or regional program: fy2017 appendix b. u.s. foreign assistance to latin america and the caribbean by account and country or regional program: fy2018 estimate appendix c. u.s. foreign assistance to latin america and the caribbean by account and country or regional program: fy2019 reques .
