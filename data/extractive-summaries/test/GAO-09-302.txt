congress has provided about $808 billion in supplemental and annual appropriations for gwot since 2001 , and dod has reported total gwot costs of about $654.7 billion as of september 2008 . in contrast to the guidance for small - scale contingency operations , the amended guidance for large - scale contingencies allows dod components to include expenses in their cost reporting beyond direct incremental costs , but provides no guidance on what costs beyond those attributable to the operation can be considered incremental and reported . we prepared this report under the comptroller general's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative . to assess dod's progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its gwot cost reporting , we analyzed information reported in dod's monthly supplemental and cost of war execution report ( cost - of - war report ) and cost data in the military services' individual accounting systems . to assess dod's methodology for reporting gwot costs by contingency operation , including the types of costs reported for those operations , we analyzed gwot cost data in dod's monthly cost - of - war reports , including the source data for those reports in the military services' individual accounting systems . the military services have also taken actions to correct weaknesses in the reliability of their gwot cost data . although dod has taken steps to improve certain aspects of its gwot cost reporting , its approach to identifying the costs of specific operations has , in some cases , resulted in the overstatement of costs , particularly for operation iraqi freedom , and in other cases , for both contingencies . furthermore , the military services have reported some costs that are not directly attributable to the support of either operation iraqi freedom or operation enduring freedom . these officials further stated that marine corps headquarters instructed them to code these costs as part of operation iraqi freedom . furthermore , reported costs for both operations may be overstated and costs not directly attributable to either operation may continue to be included in dod's gwot funding requests rather than the base budget . although dod has reported significant costs for operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom , the cost for operation iraqi freedom may be overstated , since dod does not have a methodology to determine what portion of its total reported gwot obligations for procurement and certain operation and maintenance costs is attributable to each operation . in order to improve the transparency and reliability of dod's reported obligations for gwot by contingency operation , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to ( 1 ) ensure dod components establish an auditable and documented methodology for determining what portion of gwot costs is attributable to operation iraqi freedom versus operation enduring freedom when actual costs are not available , and ( 2 ) develop a plan and timetable for evaluating whether expenses not directly attributable to specific gwot contingency operations are incremental costs and should continue to be funded outside of dod's base budget . we analyzed gwot obligation data from these accounting systems to determine how the military services captured costs for specific contingency operations , including the types of costs they included as part of these contingency operations .
