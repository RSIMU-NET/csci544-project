while congress enjoys the legislative power under article i of the constitution , which includes substantial authority to investigate the executive branch pursuant to its oversight function , criminal investigations and prosecutions are generally considered core executive functions entrusted with the executive branch un der article ii . because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself , however , there have often been calls for prosecutors with independence from the executive branch . in response , congress and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries . these responses have attempted , in different ways , to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials . for instance , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the since - expired independent counsel statute in the 1988 case of morrison v. olson , but has not applied the reasoning of morrison in subsequent cases raising related issues . the constitutional status of a statutory framework analogous to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate . several bills introduced in the 116 th congress ( including s. 71 and h.r . 197 , which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115 th congress , s. 1735 and s. 1741 ) statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal , echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute's provisions . whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in morrison . following these events , congress enacted a new mechanism — discussed in the following section — for the use of special prosecutors who would be appointed by a three - judge panel upon the request of the attorney general . two of the most commonly known examples of appointments of independent counsels under the statute involved incidents known generally as iran - contra and whitewater . rosenstein indicated in the public order that the appointment had been made pursuant to general statutory authority to manage doj investigations , but directed that the investigation would be subject to the agency's regulations governing the scope and administration of special counsel investigations . while an individual referred to as a "special counsel" thus may be appointed under either the general statutory authority or under the specific special counsel regulations , those named under the regulations might be viewed as possessing more independence , as they are appointed from outside the agency and are insulated by the regulations from removal except for cause . for example , recently , in response to concerns raised by some members of congress with respect to "certain prosecutorial and investigative determinations made by the [department of justice] in 2016 and 2017," attorney general sessions considered , but declined to pursue , a separate special counsel inquiry related to allegations of potential misconduct within the department , noting that special counsel appointments are "by design , . in this vein , congress is entrusted with the legislative power , and may establish executive branch agencies and conduct oversight of those entities . that provision requires "officers of the united states" to be appointed by the president "with the advice and consent of the senate," although congress may vest the appointment of "inferior" officers "in the president alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments. .
