when it rains or snow melts , the runoff from those roads can be environmentally harmful , depositing large amounts of sediment and other pollutants into streams and rivers . how , under the federal clean water act ( cwa ) , should logging road runoff be addressed ? . on march 20 , 2013 , the supreme court answered a key aspect of that question . in decker v. northwest environmental defense center , the court held that epa had permissibly construed a prior version of its industrial stormwater rule to exempt stormwater runoff from logging roads that is channeled — that is , collected in ditches , culverts , or other channels — from the discharge permit scheme in the clean water act ( cwa ) . the ninth circuit decision had prompted immediate reaction in congress , which enacted legislation barring epa from requiring discharge permits for logging road runoff until september 30 , 2013 , and now has enacted permanent legislation to that effect ( the 2013 farm bill , h.r . 2642 , p.l . on the merits , the court rejected the state's and timber companies' two arguments — that epa's silvicultural rule , as construed by epa , exempts logging road runoff collected in ditches , culverts , and channels from the npdes permit requirement , and , alternatively , that the 1987 stormwater amendments to the cwa exempt such discharges . in short , channeled logging road runoff , in the ninth circuit's view , requires a npdes permit . on the merits , recall that the cwa requires timber companies to have npdes permits for channeled logging road runoff only if the discharges are , in the words of the cwa , "associated with industrial activity" — as that phrase is defined in epa's industrial stormwater rule . the rule's references suggested to the court that its natural reading was confined to traditional industrial buildings , and so did not extend to logging operations . moreover , epa had espoused this reading for a long time ; it had not been adopted recently in response to this litigation . in light of these factors , the court viewed the precept that courts owe deference to agency interpretations of their own rules as applying in full force . finally , the state of oregon had invested much effort in developing best management practices for stormwater runoff from logging roads , so epa , as the court saw it , could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be unnecessary . as noted above , however , a petition for review of the amended rule has been filed . however , even before the supreme court's ruling , epa indicated that it would not begin development of a general permit in response to the ninth circuit ruling . in the november 2012 rule , epa indicated that the range of flexible approaches available under section 402 ( p ) ( 6 ) may be well - suited to address the complexity of forest road ownership , management , and use . 112-74 ) , with a provision that barred epa from requiring a permit for stormwater runoff associated with silvicultural activities until september 30 , 2012 . 113-79 ) , includes a provision similar but not identical to the house - passed language .
