finally , given historical challenges to gao's ability to audit the intelligence community's programs and activities , i would like to discuss gao's views on senate bill s. 82 , known as the intelligence community audit act of 2007 . first , gao has assisted congress for decades in its oversight role and helped federal departments and agencies with disparate missions to improve the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of their operations . second , if the odni assumes management of governmentwide personnel security clearances , then gao's ability to continue to review personnel security clearances could be impaired unless greater cooperation is forthcoming from the intelligence community . if odni were to assume leadership or oversight responsibilities for governmentwide personnel security clearances , then it might be prudent to incorporate some legislative provision to reinforce gao's access to the information needed to conduct audits and reviews in the personnel security clearance area . the reaffirmation provisions in the bill should also help to ensure that gao's audit and access authorities are not misconstrued in the future . for decades , we have assisted congress in its oversight role and helped agencies with disparate missions to improve the economy , effectiveness , and efficiency of their operations and the need for interagency collaboration in addressing 21st century challenges , and we could assist the intelligence and other appropriate congressional committees in their oversight of the intelligence community as well . our work also provides important insight on matters such as best practices to be shared and benchmarked and how government and its nongovernmental partners can become better aligned to achieve important outcomes for the nation . in addition , gao provides congress with foresight by highlighting the long - term implications of today's decisions and identifying key trends and emerging challenges facing our nation before they reach crisis proportions . gao has identified a number of human capital transformation and management issues over the years , such as acquisition , information technology , strategic planning , organizational alignment , financial and knowledge management , and personnel security clearances , as cross - cutting , governmentwide issues that affect most federal agencies , including those within the intelligence community . although the federal government made progress in addressing these issues in the years that followed , we found that more can be done in four key areas: ( 1 ) top leadership in agencies must provide the attention needed to address human capital and related organizational transformation issues ; ( 2 ) agencies' human capital planning efforts need to be fully integrated with mission and program goals ; ( 3 ) agencies need to enhance their efforts to acquire , develop , and retain talent ; and ( 4 ) organizational cultures need to promote high performance and accountability . in addition to our work on human capital transformation and personnel security clearance issues , our recent work has also addressed management issues — such as isr systems , space acquisitions , and the space acquisition workforce — that directly affect the intelligence community and illustrate our ability to further support the intelligence and other appropriate congressional committees in their oversight roles . first , in 2006 , omb's deputy director for management has suggested that the agency's oversight role of the governmentwide security clearance process might be transferred to the odni . this resistance to providing us access to information has taken on new prominence and is of greater concern in the post - 9 / 11 context , especially since the director of national intelligence has been assigned responsibilities addressing issues that extend well beyond traditional intelligence activities . specifically , s. 82 would , if enacted , reaffirm gao's authority , under existing statutory provisions , to audit and evaluate financial transactions , programs , and activities of elements of the intelligence community , and to access records necessary for such audits and evaluations . gao has clear audit and access authority with respect to elements of the intelligence community , subject to a few limited exceptions . the bill includes , for example , provisions ( 1 ) requiring gao to perform our work and use agency documents in facilities provided by the audited agencies ; ( 2 ) requiring gao to establish , after consultation with the select committee on intelligence of the senate and the permanent select committee on intelligence of the house of representatives , procedures to protect such classified and other sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure ; and ( 3 ) limiting gao's reporting of results of such audits and evaluations strictly to the original requester , the director of national intelligence , and the head of the relevant element of the intelligence community . gao strategic plan 2007-2012 . dod personnel clearances: some progress has been made but hurdles remain to overcome the challenges that led to gao's high - risk designation .
