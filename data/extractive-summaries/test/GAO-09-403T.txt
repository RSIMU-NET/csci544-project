i am pleased to be here today to discuss the future of the missile defense agency's ( mda's ) testing program . additionally , in september 2008 , we issued a report on mda's target program . due to the complexity , scale , safety constraints , and cost involved , mda is unable to conduct a sufficient number of flight tests to fully understand the performance of the system . in addition to testing , modeling and simulation , and performance assessments , mda also has a formal process for determining when a newly fielded asset or group of assets can be declared operational — that is , cleared for use by the warfighter in operational situations . during fiscal year 2008 , while several tests showed progress in individual elements and some system level capabilities , all bmds elements experienced test delays or shortfalls . in the next gmd end - to - end flight test — ftg - 06 in fourth quarter fiscal year 2009 to first quarter fiscal year 2010 — mda is accepting a higher level of risk than it previously expected in conducting this first test of an enhanced configuration of the kill vehicle called the capability enhancement ii ( ce - ii ) because it will include several objectives that had planned to be previously tested , but have not been . mda embarked on this major development without estimating the cost to develop the family of target missiles . specifically , the reduced productivity of testing has delayed understanding the overall performance of bmds , production and fielding have in some cases gotten ahead of testing , and declarations of capabilities ready for fielding have been made based on fewer tests and less modeling and simulation than planned . the overall performance of the bmds cannot yet be assessed because mda lacks a fully accredited end - to - end model and simulation capability and , according to the bmds operational test agency , it will not have that capability until 2011 at the earliest . testing problems have contributed to a concurrent development , manufacturing and fielding strategy in which assets are produced and fielded before they are fully demonstrated through testing and modeling . for example , although a test of the ability of the sm - 3 block 1a missile to engage and intercept a long range ballistic target was delayed until the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 , mda purchased 20 of the missiles in fiscal year 2008 ahead of schedule . while the gmd program has only been able to conduct two intercepts since 2006 for assessing the fielded configuration , the production of interceptors has continued . according to mda , the three phases involve identifying critical variables that have not been proven to date , determining what test scenarios are needed to collect the data , and developing an affordable and prioritized schedule of flight and ground tests . nonetheless , the review appears to offer a sound approach for closing the gaps that exist between testing , modeling , and simulation . in addition to linking the critical modeling and simulation variables with test events , the review will have to address the factors that have limited the productivity of the current test approach , such as the availability and performance of targets . mda's current approach to testing could be characterized as a just - in - time approach to having the test assets , such as targets , ready . other contingencies that a new approach to modeling , simulation , and testing should anticipate include unexpected or incomplete test results , and problems in accrediting the models that are needed for aggregated simulations , such as performance assessments . an important consideration in this regard is for modeling , simulation , and testing events to be re - synchronized so that they properly inform decisions on producing , fielding , and declaring assets operational . contingency plans could then be formed for adjusting the pace of these decisions should shortfalls occur in modeling , simulation , or testing . in the mean time , mda will have to be prudent in making decisions to produce and field additional assets .
