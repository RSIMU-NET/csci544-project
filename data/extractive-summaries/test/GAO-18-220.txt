under section 1115 of the social security act , the secretary of health and human services may waive certain federal medicaid requirements and approve new types of expenditures that would not otherwise be eligible for federal medicaid matching funds for experimental , pilot , or demonstration projects that , in the secretary's judgment , are likely to promote medicaid objectives . because medicaid section 1115 demonstrations ( hereafter referred to as demonstrations ) are intended to test new approaches to providing coverage and delivering medicaid services , evaluations of the demonstrations are essential to determining whether the new approaches are having their intended effect . in evaluating this information , we compared cms's policies and procedures against standards for internal control in the federal government , including those related to control activities and communication , and the american evaluation association's recommendations for evaluations of federal programs , which include recommendations related to the scope , quality , and transparency of evaluations . demonstration end: cms requires states to submit a final evaluation report for review and approval generally after the end of the demonstration , at which time the agency can work with the state to , for example , add clarity and disclose the limitations of the evaluation before the final evaluation report is made public . state - led evaluations of demonstrations in selected states often had significant methodological weaknesses and gaps in results that affected their usefulness for federal decision - making . though cms has been taking steps since 2014 to improve the quality of these evaluations , the agency has not established written procedures to help implement some of these improvements . more explicit expectations for rigor . cms officials told us that in spring 2017 , cms began requiring states to submit a comprehensive evaluation report for demonstrations in its high priority policy areas for evaluation at the end of each demonstration cycle , rather than after the expiration of the demonstration . further , cms's efforts to improve the quality of state - led evaluations and its plan to require final reports after each demonstration cycle are consistent with evaluation guidance from the american evaluation association that recommends that federal agencies conduct evaluations of public programs and policies throughout the programs' life cycles , not just at their end , and that agencies use evaluations to improve programs and assess their effectiveness . for example , by 2015 , a large number of states had stopped submitting data through the legacy information system until they established t - msis submissions , which meant cms had to obtain data directly from individual states for the multi - state evaluation . new data challenges have also emerged as states under demonstrations have enrolled newly eligible beneficiaries in health insurance exchange coverage .  ( see table 3. ) . it is also uncertain when cms will make interim and final evaluation reports from the multi - state evaluation public . cms officials stated that federal evaluations provide a unique cross - state perspective that states typically do not have the capacity to provide in their own state - led evaluations ; however , if these reports are not made public in a timely fashion , opportunities may be missed to inform federal and state policymakers and other stakeholders on the effects of medicaid demonstrations . federal evaluations led by cms also show promise .  ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of cms should issue written criteria for when cms will allow limited evaluation of a demonstration or a portion of a demonstration , including defining conditions , such as what it means for a demonstration to be longstanding or noncomplex , as applicable . hhs concurred with all three recommendations . regarding our third recommendation that cms establish and implement a policy for publicly releasing findings from federal evaluations of demonstrations , hhs said that cms is in the process of establishing such a policy . the medicaid section 1115 demonstrations ( referred to as demonstrations ) in our eight selected states varied in terms of the number of years the demonstrations had been in effect and cost , among other things .
