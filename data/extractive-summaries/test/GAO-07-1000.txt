effective management of its delegations is critical for gsa to help ensure that federal dollars are well - spent and adequate workspace is provided for federal employees . gsa officials told us that they believe the lack of complete data for delegations of repair and alteration project authority up to $100,000 was not problematic . in addition , pbs did not collect data on categorical and special purpose delegations . federal agencies using these delegations may lack experience in acquiring office space , which could result in offices being housed in substandard buildings and the government not receiving the best deal . gsa's policies and procedures for issuing and managing delegations are described in the following documents: federal regulations and internal gsa policy letters and memorandums , gsa's “desk guide — delegations of authority for real property management and operating and leasing,” which states that it “is a reference guide on policies , procedures , and practices for individuals engaged in implementing the terms and conditions of the general services administration delegation program and delegation agreements for real property management authorities in federally owned and operated space.” chapter 8 of gsa's “customer guide to real property,” which , according to gsa officials , serves as formal guidance to explain the general procedures for issuing the different types of delegations , and gsa's “standard operating procedures for operation and maintenance of delegated real property,” which describes the agency's responsibilities under a delegation of operations and maintenance authority . gsa did not always use mandated cost - effectiveness criteria when delegating activities , as shown in table 4 . further , the central office does not routinely request information on these activities . all of the agencies we interviewed that received real property delegations said their decisions to seek delegations were not based on a lack of satisfaction with gsa's performance in the given service but rather were useful in certain circumstances where gsa's knowledge and expertise were less critical . officials from all six agencies that we interviewed said they planned to seek delegations in the future . however , department officials said they would like to increase the number of administrative contracting officer authority delegations , but gsa has been reluctant to issue additional delegations . gsa is currently implementing several changes to improve its data collection for lease delegations and will issue separate oversight procedures that include a requirement to reconcile the two sources of lease delegation data . however , it is unclear when the oversight procedures will be issued . while gsa officials said updates to some of the guidance are in process , it is unclear when these updates will be finalized . to improve gsa's ability to oversee the various delegated authorities , we recommend that the administrator of gsa take the following two actions: develop written procedures for reviewing the different sources of its lease delegation data to identify and determine an accurate count of the leases awarded using all three types of leasing delegations and update the guidance for managing delegations , including procedures for assessing the cost - effectiveness of individual repair and alteration delegations above $100,000 , operations and maintenance delegations , general purpose leasing delegations , and special purpose leasing delegations that exceed 2,500 square feet . to determine what real property authority gsa delegated to its tenant agencies and the criteria gsa used when deciding to delegate those activities , we reviewed , among other materials , the law , the federal management regulation , and the federal acquisition regulation related to gsa's authority to delegate real property functions ; existing policies and procedures for managing the delegations , including internal public buildings service ( pbs ) guidance on delegations of real estate leasing authority and pbs's “standard operating procedures for operation and maintenance of delegated real property ; ” previous office of governmentwide policy reviews of delegations of real estate leasing authority ; pbs summaries of the lease delegation program ; and data on the number of delegations by type and agency from fiscal years 1996 to 2006 .
