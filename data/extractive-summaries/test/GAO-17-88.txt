specifically , the commercial space launch act amendments of 1988 ( cslaa ) requires launch companies — firms that operate launch vehicles for launches licensed by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) — to purchase insurance to cover damage to the uninvolved public , or “third parties,” as well as damage to federal government property , in case of a launch mishap . furthermore , the national aeronautics and space act ( space act ) authorizes the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) to enter into legal agreements with spaceport operators — entities that host launches at their launch sites ( i.e. , spaceports ) — for use of nasa property in support of commercial space launches , which may include insurance requirements for companies involved in those launches . § 50914 , which covers liability insurance and financial responsibility requirements . to examine stakeholder views on the need to change the current insurance approach and options for revising it , we first conducted semistructured interviews with all stakeholders as described earlier and based on their inputs , we sent a follow - up questionnaire to the stakeholders for their opinions on the options identified through interviews . although commercial activity has traditionally been from federal ranges , as of july 2016 there were 10 faa - licensed spaceports to support private sector involvement in space - related activity . 3 ) . operators of spaceports that are located on federal government properties , however , could have federal contracts or agreements that require them to have insurance to protect their own property from damage resulting from space launch mishaps . while operators of the three commercially active spaceports were able to obtain or receive property and liability insurance coverage , five of the nine spaceport operators we interviewed — including two of the three commercially active spaceports — reported encountering difficulties in obtaining these kinds of insurance for commercial space launches or expressed concerns about their affordability . as a result , this spaceport operator , in negotiations with the launch company that operates from their site , pressed for a provision in their contract specifying that the launch company would include the spaceport operator as an additional insured in its insurance policy to protect the spaceport infrastructure against any damage resulting from the launch company's activities under the contract . faa officials said they think the financial responsibility regulations are clear as - is . specifically , they said they are unsure whether they are considered third parties or involved parties to launches . spaceport operators may also have a stake in spaceports they themselves do not operate . congress has stated that state participation in the commercial space industry is in the national interest and of public benefit , and faa has the dual mission of both regulating and promoting this industry . federal internal control standards state that managers should communicate information externally to achieve the entity's objectives . uninsured losses , which could result from such misunderstandings , can be detrimental in several ways . the complicating factors that generate additional uncertainty for spaceport operators — mixed ownership of spaceport assets and the potential for a spaceport operator to be both an involved party and a third party or for their status to vary by launch — also underscore the need for faa to provide clear guidance to spaceport operators . as previously discussed , spaceport operators currently are not required to hold insurance to cover their own property , and launch companies are not explicitly required to purchase insurance to protect spaceport property . few ( 3 of 10 ) faa - licensed spaceports have had commercial activity in the last 5 years . however , concerns about the current insurance approach lacking certainty were not shared by all stakeholders . some stakeholders said that the current approach is less efficient because currently insurance coverage has to be negotiated for every launch or set of launches , whereas if insurance were required by law or regulation , such negotiations would be unnecessary . greater flexibility . based on interviews with faa , spaceport operators , launch companies , and insurance industry stakeholders , we identified two primary options for implementing a revised insurance approach as it relates to state and municipal spaceports: require launch companies to purchase insurance to cover spaceport property against damage resulting from launch accidents . in general , stakeholders tended to oppose options where the burden of purchasing the insurance was on them . increased certainty . higher costs . some stakeholders also noted that one or both options could increase costs or shift them to certain participants , depending on which option was implemented . both spaceport operators and insurance industry stakeholders said that the responsibility should be on the entity that has the most control over launch activities and is in the best position to avoid causing damage . to better ensure spaceport operators' understanding of faa's financial responsibility regulations for commercial space launches , we recommend that the secretary of transportation ensure that the faa administrator provides additional communication to clarify faa's interpretation of the financial responsibility regulations for commercial space launches . the report examines ( 1 ) the insurance coverage spaceport operators have in place to protect themselves from losses resulting from space launch mishaps and ( 2 ) stakeholder views on the need to change the current insurance approach and options for revising it .
