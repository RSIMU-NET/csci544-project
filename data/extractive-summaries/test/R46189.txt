cannabidiol ( cbd ) , a compound in the cannabis sativa plant , has been promoted as a treatment for a range of conditions , including epileptic seizures , post - traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , inflammation , and sleeplessness . however , limited scientific evidence exists to substantiate or disprove the efficacy of cbd in treating these conditions . in the united states , cbd is being marketed in food and beverages , dietary supplements , cosmetics , and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ends , the overarching term encompassing electronic cigarettes ) âproducts that are primarily regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) . cbd is derived from the cannabis sativa plant ( commonly referred to as cannabis ) , which includes both hemp and marijuana ( defined further below ) . marijuana is a schedule i controlled substance under the controlled substances act ( csa ) and is regulated by dea . schedule i substances are subject to the most severe csa restrictions and penalties ; with exceptions for federally approved research , it is a federal crime to grow , sell , or possess the drug . until december 2018 , hemp was included in the csa definition of marijuana and was thus subject to the same restrictions as marijuana . the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( 2018 farm bill ; p.l . instead , hemp production is now subject to regulation and oversight as an agricultural commodity by usda . changes enacted in the 2018 farm bill related to hemp were expected by many to generate additional market opportunities for hemp - derived consumer products such as hemp - derived cbd . however , the farm bill also explicitly preserved fda's authorities under the ffdca and section 351 of the public health service act , including for hemp - derived products . as described below , fda has determined that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added cbd into interstate commerce , or to market cbd as or in dietary supplements . as mentioned previously , the 2018 farm bill removed hemp and hemp derivatives ( including hemp - derived cbd ) from the csa definition of marijuana , making them no longer subject to regulation and oversight as a controlled substance by dea . although fda has determined that cbd ( and thc ) may not be added to food or marketed as a dietary supplement , the agency has not made this same determination for other compounds derived from cannabis , although those compounds may be subject to dea restrictions ; fda's determination is specific to cbd and thc because both are active ingredients in fda - approved drugs . epidiolex is marketed by gw pharmaceuticals . the agency has generally prioritized enforcement against companies and products that pose the greatest risk to consumersâfor example , products making claims that cbd can treat alzheimer's or stop cancer cell growth . â§1639o . in 2018 , cbd sales in the united states were estimated at $534 million , according to the hemp business journal . this amount includes sales from hemp - derived cbd products , marijuana - derived cbd products ( currently a schedule i controlled substance ) , and the fda - approved drug epidiolex . in 2018 , more than 1,000 companies were producing and marketing cbd products for the u.s. market . such sales are expected to exceed $1 billion in 2020 and reach nearly $2 billion in 2022 , roughly split between the three markets ( hemp - derived , marijuana - derived , and pharmaceutical cbd ; see figure 3 ) . more specifically , the explanatory statement accompanying the enacted fy2020 appropriation states that [t]he agreement includes $2,000,000 for research , policy evaluation , market surveillance , issuance of an enforcement discretion policy , and appropriate regulatory activities with respect to products under the jurisdiction of the fda which contain cbd and meet the definition of hemp , as set forth in section 297a of the agricultural marketing act of 1946 ( 7 u.s.c . in addition to the activities directed in the explanatory statement , congress also could take further legislative action , such as requiring fda to issue a regulation , under its ffdca authorities , expressly permitting cbd that meets the definition of hemp to be used as a food additive or dietary supplement . congress also could consider amending the ffdca provisions that fda has identified as restricting marketing of cbd in food and dietary supplements . given this fact , in determining whether a legislative approach is appropriate , congress may consider the potential for adverse health effects and other unintended consequences . 115-334 ) . a food additive petition must include , in addition to any explanatory or supporting data , the following information: the name and all pertinent information relating to the food additive , including its chemical identity and composition ( if possible ) ; a statement of the conditions of its proposed use , including directions , recommendations , and suggestions , and the proposed labeling ; "all relevant data bearing on the physical or other technical effect such additive is intended to produce , and the quantity of such additive required to produce such effect" ; a description of methods for determining the quantity of such additive in or on food , and any substance formed in or on food , because of its use ; and full reports of safety investigations , including the methods and controls used in conducting such investigations . fda may not issue such a regulation if a fair evaluation of the data "fails to establish that the proposed use of the food additive , under the conditions of use to be specified in the regulation , will be safe," subject to specified limitations , or if a fair evaluation of the data "shows that the proposed use of the additive would promote deception of the consumer in violation of [the ffdca] or would otherwise result in adulteration or in misbranding of food. .
