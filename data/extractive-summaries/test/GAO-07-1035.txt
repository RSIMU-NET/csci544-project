years , and about 4,500 of these schools had not made ayp for 4 or more years . and ( 4 ) how has the department of education ( education ) supported states in their efforts to assist schools in corrective action and restructuring status ? . to measure their progress , states were required to establish academic proficiency goals for making ayp and to administer an annual assessment to students in most grade levels . during these site visits , states are monitored to ensure that they are complying with title i program requirements , which includes providing the necessary guidance and support to schools that are in improvement , including those in corrective action and restructuring . schools in corrective action and restructuring status in the 2005-2006 school year were more frequently located in urban school districts and a few states and served higher percentages of minority , poor , and middle - school students than other title i schools . ii for a comprehensive list of the number of schools in corrective action and restructuring in each state. ) . these schools took corrective action in earlier years of improvement and did not implement any further corrective actions after entering corrective action status . similar to our finding that many schools may not be implementing a restructuring option , education's 2006 interim report on title i stated that very few schools in restructuring status implemented a restructuring option prescribed by nclba , though many implemented actions nclba specifies for the corrective action stage of school improvement . we estimate that more than 40 percent of the schools in corrective action and restructuring did not receive all of the required technical assistance , such as data analysis and professional development , through their school district , but most of the schools received some technical assistance from their state . officials in some districts also reported reviewing school budgets to ensure that resources are allocated to programs that target student performance . we estimate that about 65 percent of schools received assistance from their state educational agency in developing the school improvement plan , and 60 percent received assistance from a school support team ( fig . although state educational agencies generally are not required to provide specific kinds of technical assistance to schools in corrective action and restructuring , they are required to ensure that districts are providing all of the required assistance to schools identified for improvement , and if the district has not , state educational agencies must step in and provide the assistance . while this course of action may be a reasonable and appropriate path for some schools to take , education has not provided guidance to districts delineating when continuing a corrective action — and not taking an additional one — is appropriate and when it is not . the secretary of education should: ensure that guidance is provided to states and districts about when it may be appropriate to allow schools to continue corrective action implemented in earlier years of improvement and not take a new activity as the school moves into corrective action status . to address the second objective on school's implementation of corrective action and restructuring and the third objective on district and state assistance , we designed and administered two web - based surveys to a nationally representative sample of school principals: one for schools in corrective action and one for schools in restructuring , as of the 2005-2006 school year . in developing the web survey , we conducted several pretests of draft instruments . no child left behind act: states face challenges measuring academic growth .
