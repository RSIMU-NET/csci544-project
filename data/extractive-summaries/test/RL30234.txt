on june 30 , 1999 , u.s. and canadian officials signed a new comprehensive agreement to resolve long - standing disputes and to ensure implementation of the conservation and harvest - sharing principles of the 1985 pacific salmon treaty ( pst ) . the provisions in this agreement's annex iv outline , in detail , the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the five species of pacific salmon . this report provides historical background about the pst , discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime , summarizes the 1999 salmon accord , and outlines issues relevant to the renegotiation of annex iv . the 1999 agreement ( 1 ) established abundance - based fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst ; ( 2 ) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation , improve fishery management , and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts ; and ( 3 ) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation , improve the scientific basis for salmon management , and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission ( psc ) . for many years , the parties strongly disagreed over the meaning of benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters , as specified in article iii of the pst , most notably in terms of what benefits should be considered . 7 ; 16 u.s.c . §§3631-3634 ) . subsection ( g ) defines the voting requirements for the u.s . obligations under the 1999 agreement were contingent upon legislative authority and appropriations from the u.s. congress for these two funds . endangered species act . from the perspective of the department of state , a salient way to measure the relative success of the 1999 pacific salmon agreement is to compare the nature and tenor of relations with canada concerning the shared pacific salmon resource during the period before the conclusion of the 1999 agreement with the period since . several complex issues challenged the psc and the parties . several of these were considered in the renegotiation of the expiring annex iv fisheries regimes . the problems arising from the status ( e.g. , u.s. endangered and threatened species listing ) of certain runs of chinook salmon in washington , oregon , idaho and perhaps british columbia posed particular challenges for the negotiators . an additional issue of concern to canada was the increasing bycatch of yukon river chinook salmon by the u.s. pollock fishery in the bering sea concurrent with declining numbers of chinook salmon migrating into canada to spawn in upper yukon river tributaries .
