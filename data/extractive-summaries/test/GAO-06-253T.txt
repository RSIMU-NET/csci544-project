in 2004 , an estimated 35.7 million foreign - born people resided in the united states , and many legitimately have ssns . in light of concern that foreign - born individuals may have been given ssns inappropriately as well as recent legislation that changes how ssa assigns numbers and awards benefits for foreign - born individuals , you asked us to address two questions . first , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for an ssn ? . some foreign - born individuals are eligible for one of three kinds of social security cards depending in part on their immigration status: ( 1 ) regular cards , ( 2 ) those valid for work only with authorization from the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and ( 3 ) those that are not valid for work — nonwork cards . as of 2003 ssa had issued slightly more than 7 million nonwork cards to people who needed them to receive benefits for which they were otherwise entitled . both ssa's inspector general and gao have identified weaknesses in ssa procedures for assigning ssns and issuing cards , also known as enumeration . for example , working undercover and posing as parents of newborns in 2003 , gao investigators were able to obtain social security cards by using counterfeit documents . congress has enacted recent legislation strengthening the ssn enumeration process and documentation requirements . ssa is implementing the law and is improving document verification and now requires third - party verification of noncitizen documents such as birth certificates and visual inspection of documents before issuing an ssn . ssa also continues to strengthen program integrity by , for example , restricting the number of replacement cards it issues . congress and ssa have also improved laws and procedures designed to strengthen program integrity in the payment of benefits to the foreign - born . due to provisions of the social security protection act of 2004 , some foreign - born individuals who were not authorized to work will no longer be eligible for benefits . amendments to the social security act in 1996 require individuals to be lawfully present in the u.s. to receive social security benefits , though some noncitizens can receive benefits while living abroad , such as noncitizens who have worked in the u.s. and in a country with which the u.s. has a totalization agreement . the agreements help eliminate dual taxation and social security coverage that multinational employers and employees encounter when workers temporarily reside in a foreign country with its own social security program . successful implementation of these agreements requires the countries involved to carefully coordinate and verify data they exchange . computer matches with foreign countries , for example , may help protect totalization programs from making payments to ineligible individuals . ssa is exploring options for undertaking such exchanges . irtpa also required that ssa limit the number of replacement cards it issues annually ; adopt measures to improve verification of documents presented to obtain an original or replacement social security card ; independently verify any birth record presented to obtain an ssn ; prevent the assignment of ssns to unnamed children and adopt additional measures to prevent assignment of multiple ssns to the same child ; form an interagency taskforce to establish standards to better protect social security cards and ssns from counterfeiting , tampering , alteration , and theft ; and provide for implementation of security requirements by june 2006 . in coordination with the state department and dhs , ssa determines who is eligible for an ssn by verifying certain immigration documents and determining if an individual's card requires a work restriction . nonwork card: the third type of card is for people not eligible to work in the u.s. ssa sends recipients of these ssns a card showing their name , ssn , and the inscription “not valid for employment.” to be issued these cards , noncitizens who are legally in the u.s. and do not have dhs permission to work must have been found eligible to receive a federally - funded benefit or are subject to a state or local law that requires them to have an ssn to get public benefits .
