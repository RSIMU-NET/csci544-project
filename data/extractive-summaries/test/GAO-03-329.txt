the department of defense ( dod ) relies on a broad array of intelligence systems to study the battlefield and to identify and hit enemy targets . these systems include reconnaissance aircraft , satellites , and ground - surface - based stations that receive , analyze , and disseminate intelligence data . a key problem facing dod is the inability of these systems to operate effectively together for technical reasons ( such as incompatible data formats ) and / or operational reasons . such problems can considerably slow the time involved with identifying and analyzing a potential target and deciding whether to attack it , as well as delivering an order to the war fighter in charge of the attack . one multibillion - dollar initiative underway since 1998 is to pare down the number of ground - surface systems that process intelligence data and upgrade them to enhance their functionality and to ensure that they are interoperable with other dod systems . the eventual goal is the migration to an overarching , interconnected family of systems for processing intelligence data known as the distributed common ground - surface system ( dcgs ) . given the importance of the dcgs initiative to the war fighter , you asked us to assess ( 1 ) whether dod has adequately planned for these processing systems and ( 2 ) whether dod's process for testing and certifying the interoperability of the systems is working effectively . this delay has hampered dod's ability to ensure interoperability in the systems now being developed and deployed . dod has a process in place to test and certify that systems are interoperable , but it is not working effectively for ground - surface - based intelligence processing systems . in fact , at the time of our review , only 2 of 26 dcgs systems have been certified as being interoperable . the certification process is important because it considers such things as whether systems can work with systems belonging to other military services without unacceptable workarounds or special interfaces , whether they are using standard data formats , and whether they conform to broader architectures designed to facilitate interoperability across dod . because 21 systems that have not been certified have already been fielded , there is greater risk that the systems cannot share data as quickly as needed . but dod has been slow to plan for this initiative and it has not addressed important questions such as how and when systems will be pared down and modified as well as how the initiative will be funded . to ensure that an effective distributed common ground - surface system is adequately planned and funded , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications , and intelligence to expand the planning efforts for dcgs to include a migration plan or road map that at a minimum lays out ( 1 ) current system capabilities and desired capabilities ; ( 2 ) specific initiatives , programs , projects and schedules to get dod and the services to their goal ; ( 3 ) measures to gauge success in implementing the migration plan as well as the enterprise architecture ; and ( 4 ) mechanisms for ensuring that the plan is followed .
