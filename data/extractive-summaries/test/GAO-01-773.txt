more than one - third of students had credit cards before they entered college , and another 46 percent acquired them during the first year . except for charges for tuition and fees , their spending patterns resembled those of nonstudents . we did not find a uniform response to the controversial issue of on - campus credit card marketing among the universities we visited . in response to complaints about aggressive marketing techniques , a few universities had adopted policies restricting credit card solicitation on campus . the credit card issuers that responded to our inquiries participated actively in the student market , but again they did not have a uniform set of policies or practices . credit cards offer clear advantages to college students because they provide an interest free loan for students until the payment is due and a convenient noncash payment option for both routine transactions and emergencies . if used responsibly , credit cards allow students to build up credit histories that will facilitate increased access to credit in the future . however , if college students have not learned financial management skills in their secondary education or from their parents and misuse their credit cards or mismanage their credit card debt , the disadvantages can outweigh the advantages . the proposed legislation in several states would regulate credit card solicitation in a variety of ways including 1. a ban on the use of incentives to entice students to apply for credit 2. a requirement that a student's parent or legal guardian give written consent to the student's credit card application ; 3. a provision to protect parents of college students from the debt collection actions of credit card issuers ; 4. a requirement that credit card issuers register with the college or university before soliciting on campus ; 5. a requirement that credit card issuers , universities , or organizations provide debt education materials or a program for students ; 6. a provision that colleges , universities , or education departments set policies and procedures for controlling credit card solicitation on campus ; and 7. a prohibition against the dissemination of information on students to credit card issuers or extenders of credit for compensation .
