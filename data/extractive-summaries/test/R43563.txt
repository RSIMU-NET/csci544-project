many hold requests take the form of a letter addressed to the majority or minority leader ( depending on the party affiliation of the senator placing the hold ) expressing reservations about the merits or timing of a particular policy proposal or nomination . an example of a hold letter is displayed in appendix a . more often than not , senate leaders — as agents of their party responsible for defending the political , policy , and procedural interests of their colleagues — honor a hold request because not doing so could trigger a range of parliamentary responses from the holding senator ( s ) , such as a filibuster , that could expend significant amounts of scarce floor time . unless the target of a hold is of considerable importance to the majority leader and a supermajority of his colleagues — 60 of whom might be required to invoke cloture on legislation under senate rule xxii — the most practical course of action is often to lay the matter aside and attempt to promote negotiations that could alleviate the concerns that gave rise to the hold . holds can be used to accomplish a variety of purposes . informational holds , for instance , request that the senator be notified or consulted in advance of any floor action to be taken on a particular measure or matter , perhaps to allow the senator to plan for floor debate or the offering of amendments . until recently , many holds were considered a nonymous ( or secret ) because the source and contents of the request were not made available to the public , or even to other senators . written hold requests emerged as an informal practice in the late 1950s under the majority leadership of lyndon b. johnson as a way for senators to make routine requests of their leaders regarding the senate's schedule . "the hold started out as a courtesy for senators who wanted to participate in open debate," two senators wrote in 1997 . the senate has considered a variety of proposals targeting the senate hold in recent years , two of which the chamber adopted . both sought to eliminate the secrecy of holds by creating a process through which holds — formally referred to in the new rules as "notices of intent to object to proceeding" — would be made public within some period of time if certain criteria were met . prior to these rules changes , hold letters were written with the expectation that they would be treated as private correspondences between a senator and his or her party leader . senate holds are predicated on the unanimous consent nature of senate decision - making . the influence they exert in chamber deliberations is based primarily upon the significant parliamentary prerogatives individual senators are afforded in the rules , procedures , and precedents of the chamber . as such , efforts to regulate holds are inextricably linked with the chamber's use of unanimous consent agreements to structure the process of calling up measures and matters for floor debate and amendment . for this reason , rules changes that require enforcement on the part of senate leaders — as both efforts discussed here do — tend to conflict with the managerial role played by contemporary senate leaders and the expectation on the part of their colleagues that leaders will defend their interests in negotiations over the scheduling of measures and matters for floor consideration . an objection to a unanimous consent request transmitted through the "hotline" represents another common method of communicating preferences to senate leaders . the "notice of intent to object" section of the calendar of business appendix c. a notice of intent to objec .
