the internal revenue service ( irs ) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with the tax laws governing this voluntary system . in spite of irs' efforts to enforce compliance , each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid , which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs , higher tax rates , or both . there are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance , which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner ; payment compliance , which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner ; and reporting compliance , which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns . this report reviews reporting compliance . in light of the controversy surrounding irs' last effort to measure voluntary reporting compliance by randomly auditing taxpayers , we initiated this review to determine the status of irs' current efforts . as of march 2001 , irs had a draft business plan that contained information on four different approaches for measuring voluntary reporting compliance , including two that use random audits . the nrp office has developed objectives and established several guiding principles to direct its efforts to plan and implement this program . we contacted officials from these agencies and reviewed information from the random sampling programs . also , briefly discusses other sources of data on voluntary compliance and the relevance of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals . interviews are conducted at the client's home , or workplace .
