commercial snf accounts for about 85 percent of the nation's nuclear waste . according to doe , in 1985 , president reagan found that there was no basis to conclude that a defense - only repository was required . specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) what doe cited as the benefits of a separate defense hlw repository in its recommendation to the president ; ( 2 ) the reliability of doe's cost and schedule estimates for its new plan to site , license , and construct a defense hlw repository ; and ( 3 ) doe's efforts to site a defense hlw repository and key challenges , if any , to siting the repository . additionally , we reviewed doe's project management orders on “pre - conceptual” planning activities and other doe documents that provide direction for front - end planning activities . this section describes the public's longstanding opposition to siting nuclear waste repositories , doe's efforts to develop a repository under the nwpa and its amendments , and doe's efforts since terminating the yucca mountain repository to develop other strategies to manage and store nuclear waste . in the information doe provided to the president , doe cited benefits of a separate defense hlw repository but did not quantify the benefits when possible , nor did it provide detailed support demonstrating that the benefits it cited could be achieved or show the risks if certain benefits could not be realized as planned . furthermore , this guidance states that benefits and cost estimates involve some degree of uncertainty and that the risk that a benefit may not be realized as planned should be factored into the cost - benefit analysis . how the department of energy evaluated the six factors under the nuclear waste policy act ( nwpa ) the department of energy ( doe ) reported that in evaluating the six factors required under the nwpa , it included ( 1 ) a summary of the 1985 evaluation conclusions ; ( 2 ) a discussion of post - 1985 changes and new information bearing on the cost efficiency factor ; and ( 3 ) conclusions as to whether each factor supports a finding that a defense high - level radioactive waste repository is required . cost efficiency . public acceptability . regulation . national security . health and safety . according to doe officials , they did not develop reliable estimates to reflect all likely costs and schedule activities because their plan was still at the conceptual stage , and doe officials did not have enough information to generate cost and schedule estimates that met best practices ; however , industry best practices documented by gao state that it is possible to generate reliable estimates of cost and schedule even when information is limited . waste transportation . also , doe's estimates exclude site selection and site characterization , which could add decades to the time frames , based on past doe experience and plans . moreover , doe is planning to develop a consent - based siting process before it has addressed certain prerequisites — such as the possible need for epa to update health and safety regulations — which are necessary to solicit public comment on its consent - based siting process , screen potential sites for a repository , and engage in site selection discussions with local communities . without updated regulations , the public cannot provide meaningful input into a consent - based siting process , doe may not be able to effectively screen potential sites for a repository , and local communities cannot be effectively engaged in a meaningful discussion on hosting a nuclear waste repository . these experts and stakeholders added that it would be premature for doe to site a defense hlw or a subsequent , mostly commercial snf repository until health and safety regulations are revised . doe faces significant public opposition in developing a consent - based siting process and engaging in site selection discussions with local communities , in part because doe has not yet addressed certain prerequisites that are needed for the site selection process , such as the possible need to revise health and safety regulations . the secretary of energy should direct the office of nuclear energy to conduct a comprehensive assessment , which adheres to omb guidance and best practices , of the benefits , costs , and schedules of the options it reviewed and provided to the president in 2015 , and , in light of the new information and results of its assessment , revise — if needed — the report's conclusion that a strong basis exists to find that a defense hlw repository is required . regarding our second recommendation , doe disagreed . therefore , we believe that doe should reassess its decision to simultaneously pursue such activities until key prerequisites have been addressed . for each of these two cost estimates , doe provided estimates for different geological media .
