the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the ssi program , which is the nation's largest cash assistance program for the poor . last year , ssi provided $33 billion in benefits to 6.8 million aged , blind , and disabled persons . in 2001 , outstanding ssi debt and newly detected overpayments totaled $4.7 billion . for example , to better deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients' financial eligibility for benefits ; enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads ; and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities . however , because a number of initiatives are still in the planning or early implementation stages , it is too soon to assess their ultimate impact on ssi payment accuracy . in addition to improving its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities , ssa has also made recovery of overpaid benefits a higher priority .
