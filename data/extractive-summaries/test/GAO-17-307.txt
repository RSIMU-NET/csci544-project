these requirements , for example , may prohibit drilling during certain months of the year to minimize wildlife disturbance . this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which blm approved requests for exceptions to lease and permit requirements intended to mitigate environmental impacts , and how these decisions were made and documented ; ( 2 ) the extent to which blm involved the public in the development of lease and permit requirements and in the approval of exception requests ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which blm implemented its best management practices policy and assessed its effectiveness in mitigating environmental impacts . to determine the extent to which blm involved the public in developing lease and permit requirements and in the approval of exception requests , we analyzed documents related to lease sales held during calendar years 2012 through 2015 by the 6 blm field offices we visited , conducted follow - up interviews with blm field office officials based on responses to our semistructured interview , reviewed relevant blm policies and guidance , and interviewed blm's program contact for its eplanning initiative . operators may purchase a lease for land identified by the land use plan as available for oil and gas development . in addition , the public may protest a lease before it is offered for sale . blm's policy identifies four key practices that should be considered as lease or permit requirements in nearly all circumstances: ( 1 ) painting of facilities to blend with the surrounding environment , ( 2 ) design and construction of roads in accordance with blm guidance , ( 3 ) interim reclamation , and ( 4 ) final reclamation . additionally , blm's processes for considering exception requests and documenting its decisions vary across its field offices . these officials further stated that blm does not have a policy requiring its field offices to consistently track these exception data . standardized request form . in these instances , blm's actual process for considering the request was unclear . while blm has some written guidance on considering and documenting exception requests , it may not result in blm staff documenting exception decisions fully or clearly because the november 2007 guidance does not specify the format for documenting the exception requests and decisions . according to the handbook , such public involvement may include external scoping , public notification before or during preparation of an environmental assessment , public meetings , or public review and comment of the completed environmental assessment and unsigned “finding of no significant impact.” blm field offices are not required to produce a draft environmental assessment in all cases , but if a draft is produced , the offices are required to post the document for public review on eplanning . according to blm's policy , public notification is not required unless granting an exception would result in a substantial modification or waiver of a lease requirement . our review of 109 randomly selected well files at six blm field offices found that at least one of the four key practices had been included as a permit requirement in nearly all of the files we reviewed . although blm's 2009 monitoring policy requires that field offices track the number of monitoring inspections completed , it does not provide guidance on how data collected during monitoring inspections should be tracked or used . a representative from an association of oil and gas operators stated that in some instances blm requires operators to conduct surveys and provide the agency with survey data , but the agency does not always use the data provided to assess the effectiveness of best management practices . moreover , blm field offices have generally implemented blm's best management practices policy but have not consistently documented environmental inspections to verify that operators have implemented the practices as required , in part because the guidance for documenting inspections is unclear . without such a requirement , blm cannot ensure that employees understand how to carry out monitoring inspections , that environmental inspection documents will be prepared consistently by field office staff , or that the data will be used to assess the effectiveness of best management practices . develop a policy to ensure that field offices consistently track exception data .
