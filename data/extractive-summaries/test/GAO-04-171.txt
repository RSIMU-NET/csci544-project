microenterprises — small businesses owned and operated by poor entrepreneurs — have potential to help the least advantaged populations in the developing world . in 2001 , the agency reported that it was conducting microenterprise projects in 52 countries and had obligated almost $2 billion since 1988 to support its program . the key objectives of usaid's microenterprise development program are to reduce poverty among microenterprise owners , workers , and families ; target the poor and the very poor ; encourage participation by women ; and develop sustainable microfinance institutions ( mfi ) . since 1996 , usaid has annually surveyed missions and implementing institutions regarding their microenterprise activities and issued a report to congress . to assist your committee in overseeing the agency's management of its microenterprise development program , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine the extent to which usaid's microfinance activities are meeting the program's key objectives , ( 2 ) assess the reliability of the agency's reporting on its overall microenterprise activities , and ( 3 ) examine the agency's role in identifying and disseminating microenterprise best practices . third , the program appears to have succeeded in encouraging the participation of women through micro loans . although microfinance can help alleviate some of the impacts of poverty , the research literature does not show conclusively that it has lifted large numbers of people above the poverty line . moreover , some evidence suggests that micro loans can have unintended negative consequences among very poor borrowers . in fiscal year 2001 , 294 usaid - supported mfis reported sustainability levels ; of these , 112 , or 38 percent , said that they were fully sustainable , a percentage that had remained consistent since 1999 . specifically , it may not be reporting accurately ( 1 ) the actual amounts obligated to microenterprise activities , ( 2 ) whether 50 percent of usaid's resources went to the very poor , and ( 3 ) the sustainability of usaid - supported mfis . guidance . technical assistance . however , evidence suggests that microfinance alone has not lifted large numbers of the poor over the poverty line . despite the general reliability of its data , certain methodological weaknesses in usaid's mrr system may prevent the agency from reporting with precision its program expenditures , the percentage of its funds going to the very poor , the percentage of mfis that are sustainable , and the extent of usaid's contributions to the institutions it supports . offer an array of services . provide necessary training . further , usaid requires annual financial reports of implementing organizations . this could potentially improve this aspect of usaid's reporting . in addition to our assessment of its impact on poverty alleviation and poverty reduction , there are sections focused on reaching the poor and very poor and other services these groups may need ; outreach to women ; the sustainability of mfis ; the reliability of the mrr ; best practices identified by the microenterprise development industry ; usaid's efforts to identify and promote best practices ; whether usaid incorporates best practices in their projects ; and a synopsis of 22 key studies .
