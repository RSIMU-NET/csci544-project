within the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , the office of diversion control is directly responsible for enforcing the provisions of the csa as they pertain to ensuring the availability of substances such as prescription drugs and listed chemicals for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion . how does dea manage its investigation efforts to address the growing and evolving nature of prescription drug diversion ? . these field divisions were selected on the basis of a mix of criteria such as the range of the highest volumes of regulatory and criminal cases and civil penalties ; geographic diversity ; and other considerations . in order to better understand how dea is using its squads to respond to criminal diversion , we interviewed dea officials and officials from state and local agencies participating in the squads to obtain information on how criminal diversion investigations are carried out and how dea coordinates those investigations . to respond to the increasing rate of criminal diversion and a growing registrant population , dea has expanded its resources and targeted investigation strategies in ways to collaborate with state and local entities and enhance the effectiveness of its diversion control program . specifically , dea has expanded its use of tactical diversion squads , which work with dea's state , local , and other federal partners , to maximize resources and improve efforts to investigate , disrupt , and dismantle individuals or organizations involved in diversion schemes related to controlled substances and listed chemicals . dea has also renewed its focus on regulatory oversight of the more than 1.3 million dea registrants to ensure registrants comply with the csa and implementing regulations . dea accomplished this by increasing the frequency of scheduled investigations of dea registrants that are registered to handle controlled prescription drugs . furthermore , dea has conducted other targeted outreach efforts to specific registrant types to inform them of specific regulatory responsibilities or help them prepare for regulatory investigations: in 2005 dea established an initiative to better inform wholesale distributors of controlled substances of their responsibilities under the csa to report suspicious orders from pharmacies that are possibly filling invalid prescriptions . to ensure that diversion investigators and special agents have the necessary skills to carry out their responsibilities and that dea monitors the results of its employee guidance and training , dea has established internal control activities , which are consistent with standards for internal control in the federal government . the diversion investigator manual describes and explains the policies and procedures for diversion investigators in carrying out their regulatory and investigative responsibilities , the processes for conducting diversion investigations , and the procedures for developing investigative reports . the monitoring process includes direct supervisory review , self - inspection / peer review , and on - site internal inspection . the office of inspections also conducts on - site internal inspections of dea's 21 field divisions to ensure that employees are following required program policies and procedures — in accordance with the diversion investigator manual . we found that the inspections did not identify widespread findings or issues related to the timeliness and overall quality of the diversion investigations . given dea's increased focus on regulatory and criminal investigations in response to growing prescription drug diversion , it is critical for dea to determine and report on the extent to which these additional efforts are helping to reduce diversion . in addition , given that dea more than tripled the number of regulatory investigations conducted from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 including investigations of previously excluded registrant groups as well as increasing the frequency of investigations for a rapidly growing dwp registrant group — it will be important for dea to be able to assess and report on the potential results these additional investigations are having on regulatory compliance . in order for dea to better determine to what extent its efforts are decreasing diversions and to inform future program decisions , we recommend that the administrator of dea strengthen the agency's performance measurement for the diversion control program by reassessing its set of performance measures for the program to identify ways to enhance the measures and their link to the program outcome goal of reducing diversion . as performance measurement is a key part of an agency being results - oriented , that is , tracking and being held accountable for the results or outcomes an agency produces through its programs , our recommendation is intended to ensure that the program's performance measures meet the standards for performance measures established by doj and omb and are the best measures possible to demonstrate and report the program's results to program management , other external decision makers such as congress , as well as the public .
