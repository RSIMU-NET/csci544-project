recognizing the seriousness of this problem , in march 2004 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) launched the financial management line of business ( fmlob ) initiative , in part , to improve the outcome of governmentwide financial management system modernization efforts and provide timely and accurate data for decision making through the use of more cost - effective shared service solutions . specifically , we recommended that omb place a high priority on fully integrating into its approach four key concepts: ( 1 ) developing a concept of operations that articulates the interrelationships among financial management systems and how the shared service provider concept fits into the overall federal financial management framework , ( 2 ) defining standard business processes to promote consistency within and across agencies , ( 3 ) developing a strategy for ensuring that agencies' financial management systems are migrated to a limited number of service providers , and ( 4 ) defining and effectively implementing applicable disciplined processes necessary to properly manage financial management system implementation projects . as agreed to with your office , this report provides the results of the first phase of our work , including our efforts to determine ( 1 ) omb's progress toward addressing our prior recommendations related to the fmlob initiative and other challenges that impede its implementation and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of omb's monitoring of fmlob and financial management system modernization projects , including their costs . omb and fsio efforts to implement the fmlob initiative continue to show progress and have effectively addressed 5 of the 18 recommendations and made progress toward addressing the remaining 13 recommendations we made related to four areas considered key building blocks for governmentwide financial management systems â€” a concept of operations , standard business processes , migration strategy , and disciplined processes . further , the recommendations not yet completed , in particular , involve critical elements integral to success and will require much more extensive work before the promised benefits of the fmlob initiative can be fully realized . for example , according to fsio officials , it may take as many as 15 years or more before software that incorporates the standard business processes currently under development is in use governmentwide . in addition , development of a migration timeline reflecting agencies' commitment to migrating to shared service providers has not yet been completed . additional efforts are needed to fully address the remaining three recommendations in this area . omb has yet to take sufficient actions to fully address these recommendations , despite the critical role of omb oversight , established in various statutes , in helping to ensure the success of agency modernization efforts . achieving fmlob goals requires effective omb oversight of agency modernization projects . according to omb officials , a draft fmlob concept of operations ( conops ) has been developed ; however , it has not yet been finalized and officials would not provide an estimate for when it will be completed . in addition , omb circular no . until this tool is finaliz recommendation remains unclear . enhance existing oversight efforts to improve financial management syste implementations by developing a structured process to identify and evaluate specific and systemic implementation weaknesses and risks specifically related to financial management system modernizations , including those associated with projects on the management watch list and high risk list and others identified through reviews of agency provided information , as well as their costs , and discussions with agency officials ; implementing processes to ensure that agencies more effectively and consistently comply with guidance related to implementing financial management system modernization projects , including the use of disciplined processes to reduce the risk of implementation failures ; and clarifying guidance so that agencies consistently report planned and spending related to financial management system modernization projects including the financial portion of mixed systems . information technology: omb can make more effective use o investment reviews .
