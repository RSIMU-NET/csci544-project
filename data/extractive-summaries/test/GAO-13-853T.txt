beginning in 1996 , federal law has required the implementation of an entry and exit data system to track foreign nationals entering and leaving the united states . the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 required the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan to accelerate implementation of a biometric entry and exit data system that matches available information provided by foreign nationals upon their arrival in and departure from the united states . in 2003 , dhs initiated the u.s . visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program to develop a system to collect biographic data ( such as name and date of birth ) and biometric data ( such as fingerprints ) from foreign nationals at u.s. ports of entry . since 2004 , dhs has tracked foreign nationals' entries into the united states as part of an effort to comply with legislative requirements , and since december 2006 , a biometric entry capability has been fully operational at all air , sea , and land ports of entry . however , we have identified a range of management challenges that dhs has faced in its effort to fully deploy a corresponding biometric exit capability to track foreign nationals when they depart the country . for example , in november 2009 , we found that dhs had not adopted an integrated approach to scheduling , executing , and tracking the work that needed to be accomplished to deliver a biometric exit system . in these reports , we made recommendations intended to help ensure that a biometric exit capability was planned , designed , developed , and implemented in an effective and efficient manner . dhs generally agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to implement a number of them . most recently , in july 2013 , we reported on dhs's progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system , as well as dhs's efforts to identify and address potential overstays â€” individuals who were admitted into the country legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized period of admission . my statement today is based on our july 2013 report and , like that report , discusses the extent to which dhs has made progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system at air ports of entry , which is dhs's priority for a biometric exit capability . although dhs's may 2012 report stated that dhs would take steps to address the report's recommendations by may 2014 , dhs officials told us that the department's current goal is to develop information about options for biometric air exit and to report to congress in time for the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle regarding ( 1 ) the additional benefits that a biometric air exit system provides beyond an enhanced biographic exit system and ( 2 ) costs associated with biometric air exit . a senior official from dhs's office of policy told us that dhs has not kept the plan up to date because of the transition of responsibilities within dhs ; specifically , in march 2013 , pursuant to the explanatory statement for dhs's 2013 appropriation , dhs established an office within cbp that is responsible for coordinating dhs's entry and exit policies and operations.process as of june 2013 , and cbp told us that it planned to establish an integrated project team in july 2013 that will be responsible for more detailed planning for the department's biometric air exit efforts . furthermore , any delays in providing this information to congress could further affect possible implementation of a biometric exit system to address statutory requirements . therefore , we recommended that the secretary of homeland security establish time frames and milestones for developing and implementing an evaluation framework to be used in conducting the department's assessment of biometric exit options . dhs concurred with this recommendation and indicated that its component agencies plan to finalize the goals and objectives for biometric air exit by january 31 , 2014 , and that these goals and objectives will be used in the development of an evaluation framework that dhs expects to have completed by june 30 , 2014 .
