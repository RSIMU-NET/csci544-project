dist serves as the dod inventory of automated information systems and is intended to be used as a tool to help dod components in correcting year 2000 date problems . during our review , we focused on determining the status of the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence ( asd / c3i ) and disa's efforts to address data integrity and other problems associated with dist and whether these efforts will be completed in time to beneficially affect departmentwide and component year 2000 efforts . the inventory also plays a very critical role in the later stages of the year 2000 process , which include renovation , validation , and implementation . having an accurate and reliable enterprisewide systems inventory is also fundamental to having a good information technology investment process . as discussed in our year 2000 assessment guide , system inventories serve as a useful year 2000 decision - making tool , by offering added assurance that all systems are identified and linked to a specific business area or process , and that all enterprisewide cross boundary systems are considered . early in its year 2000 effort , dod recognized the value of having a reliable enterprisewide system inventory and the potential beneficial role its dist database could have in the initiative . for example , in november 1996 , the under secretary for defense ( comptroller ) and the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence issued a joint memorandum to senior defense managers stating that they considered dist to be “the backbone tool for managing the department's information technology investment strategies , identifying functional information systems interfaces and data exchange requirements , and managing the efforts to fix the year 2000 problem.” in its year 2000 management plan , defense reaffirmed that dist will be the official repository for the dod components and added that the reason components are required to report every quarter on their systems and are encouraged to report significant progress on their systems is “to give dod the visibility necessary to ensure a thorough and successful transition to year 2000 compliance for all dod systems.” it also stated that this reporting “will also keep other functional , that your systems interface with or exchange data with , informed as to the status of your year 2000 compliance progress.” finally , defense noted that the dist needed to be up - to - date so that it could keep the congress informed on the department's efforts to achieve year 2000 compliance . third , without an enterprisewide inventory , defense cannot adequately ensure that all interfaces are properly identified and corrected . finally , in not having a single , enterprisewide inventory , the department will not be able to readily identify areas that may need additional resources , such as testing facilities . however , in order to ensure complete validation of dist , we believe that the office of the asd / c3i and disa need to supplement these actions with efforts that involve fully comparing service inventories ( and command inventories in the case of the navy ) to dist and reconciling differences identified . additional copies are $2 each .
