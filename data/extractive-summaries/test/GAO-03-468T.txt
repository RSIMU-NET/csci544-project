specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) how the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks affected the financial markets and the actions market participants and infrastructure providers took to restore trading ; ( 2 ) the steps taken by 15 stock exchanges , electronic communication networks ( ecn ) , clearing organizations , and payment systems providers to address physical and electronic security and business continuity planning since the attacks ; and ( 3 ) the steps financial regulators have taken to ensure that the markets are better prepared for future disasters . the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks severely disrupted the u.s. financial markets because of the loss of life , damage to buildings , loss of telecommunications and power , and restrictions that were placed on access to the affected area . however , organizations still had limitations in one or more areas that increased the risk of disruptions to their operations if such disasters occurred in the future . although the financial regulators have begun efforts to improve the resiliency of clearance and settlement functions within the financial markets , they have not fully developed goals , strategies , or sound practices to similarly improve the resiliency of trading functions . in addition , the effectiveness of the securities and exchange commission's ( sec ) technology and operations risk oversight efforts — which clearly have increased in importance — have been limited by program , staff , and resource limitations . our report made recommendations designed to better prepare the markets to deal with future disasters and to enhance sec's technology and operations risk oversight capabilities . although financial market participants , regulators , and infrastructure providers made heroic efforts to restore the functioning of the markets as quickly as they did , the attacks and our review of 15 key financial market organizations — including 7 critical ones — revealed that financial market participants needed to improve their business continuity planning capabilities and take other actions to better prepare themselves for potential disasters .
