a key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be "actively engaged in farming" ( aef ) — that is , that a person contribute either labor or management time ( or both ) to the farm's operation . not all farm programs are subject to the same aef criteria , and the criteria often apply differently based on the type of legal entity owning the farm operation . the initial attempt to restrict payments to actual farmers was in 1987 , when congress enacted what is commonly known as the farm program payments integrity act ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 , p.l . 100-203 , §§1301-1307 ) . this law required that an individual or entity meet aef criteria to receive farm commodity payments . the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . in general , family farms receive special treatment in which every adult family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm's operating results is deemed to meet the aef requirements . as a result , the current set of laws and rules governing farm program eligibility — particularly for family members of a farm operation — remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups as well as certain members of congress . critics contend that current usda eligibility criteria — especially for providing active personal management — remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments , thus facilitating the creation of partnership members to increase the farm business's payment limit and expand its farm payment receipts . thus , a family farm potentially qualifies for an additional payment limit for each family member ( 18 years or older ) associated with the principal operator who participates in the farming operation . each member is treated separately and individually for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits . thus , a partnership's potential payment limit is equal to the number of qualifying members ( plus any special exemptions such as spouses ) times the individual payment limit . corporation . a legally defined association of joint owners or shareholders that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits . to be eligible to receive any farm program payment , every person or legal entity — including both u.s. and non - u.s. citizens — must provide a name and address , and have either a social security number ( ssn ) in the case of a person , or a taxpayer identification number ( tin ) or employee identification number ( ein ) in the case of a legal entity with multiple persons having ownership interests . finally , benefits under the trade adjustment assistance for farmers also require that participants meet aef requirements . the aef requirements apply equally to u.s. citizens , resident aliens , and foreign entities . the 2014 farm bill ( §1604 ) required usda to add more specificity to the role that a nonfamily producer who is a member of a legal entity — primarily a partnership or joint venture — must play to qualify for farm program benefits . however , long - standing concerns remain that some farm operations are organized to overcome program payment limits and maximize the amount of their farm program payments . in particular , some advocacy groups suggest that usda's new rule did not go far enough in tightening aef criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily farm operations . gao has cited three principal hindrances to usda oversight and enforcement of aef regulations for members — both family and nonfamily alike — of a farming operation that claim aef compliance by providing active personal management: ( 1 ) the definition of active personal management is broad and can be interpreted to include many potential activities , ( 2 ) requirements of what constitutes significant contributions of management are subjective , and ( 3 ) it is difficult to verify individuals' evidence of claimed contributions of active personal management and personal labor — often depending on interviews with individual payment recipients .
