this crs report analyzes the security implications of taiwan's presidential election of march 22 , 2008 , including the implications for u.s. assessments , security interests , and options for policymakers in congress and the bush administration . this analysis draws in part from direct information gained through a visit to taiwan to observe the election and to discuss views with a number of interlocutors , including those advising or aligned with president chen shui - bian and president - elect ma ying - jeou . this crs report will discuss the results of taiwan's presidential election and symbolic yet sensitive referendums on u.n. membership , outlook for taiwan's policies , implications for u.s. security interests in taiwan , and options for u.s. policymakers presented with a window of opportunity . there are a number of alternative futures for taiwan in the near and longer terms , including scenarios that are conducive to stability and policymaking , and scenarios that would challenge consensus - building and effective governance in taiwan , with implications for u.s. security interests in stability and deterrence . kmt stays unified ; dpp rebuilds ; and stable two - party democracy is sustained . the results of march 22 sapped the prc's alarmist warnings about the election and referendums , although it might still warn about instability until the inauguration on may 20 while chen shui - bian is still president . nevertheless , cross - strait tension is greatly reduced . chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition . as president , ma is expected to be less provocative towards beijing than chen . in one view , there is opportunity to turn u.s. attention from managing the cross - strait situation to urgent problems that require the prc's improved cooperation , such as dealing with nuclear proliferation in north korea and iran , the crisis in darfur in sudan , repression in burma , the crackdown in tibet , etc . ma ying - jeou's election presents a window of opportunity in the cross - strait and u.s. - taiwan relationships . however , careful consideration could include the question of whether such steps would seriously risk other u.s. priorities that require prc cooperation . accept taiwan's formal letter of request for u.s. consideration of whether to sell new f - 16c / d fighters . engage with the kmt to more quickly reduce uncertainties and anxieties in the military about changes to personnel , programs , and organization expected under ma . although taiwan is a full member of apec , its representation has been downgraded due to prc demands . the united states could also shape the cross - strait dialogue to focus on functional cooperation , rather than premature political integration , national unification , or concessions on taiwan's security . a fifth approach would be for congress to require a strategic review of policy .
