we have already published a number of reports on state trading issues , including ( 1 ) a july 1995 report that provides a brief summary of trade remedy laws available to investigate and respond to activities of entities trading with the united states , including stes ; ( 2 ) an august 1995 report on the general agreement on tariffs and trade / world trade organization ( wto ) practices that apply to stes and the effectiveness of those disciplines to date ; and ( 3 ) a june 1996 report that focuses on the activities of three stes , including the cwb , and their potential capabilities to distort trade in their respective commodity markets . in addition , the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) remains concerned that the cwb may be using its monopoly to undercut u.s. wheat prices and that u.s. farmers continue to be hurt by increased canadian wheat imports . we reviewed the following: ( 1 ) cwb operations , government assistance to the cwb and the canadian farmer , and ongoing changes to the environment in which the cwb operates ; ( 2 ) the availability of data to ascertain cwb pricing practices , and efforts to increase the amount of data available ; and ( 3 ) the nature of trade remedies available to address the operations of stes , and the frequency with which these remedies have been applied to stes . the agencies provided several reasons for this difficulty: ( 1 ) the voluminous amount of documentation on some types of cases coupled with an absence of electronic records to facilitate searches ; ( 2 ) the possibility that an ste's foreign name translation in a case file would differ from the translation on our ste list ; ( 3 ) the fact that under u.s. law , stes as institutions would not be the primary subject of a trade remedy action ; and ( 4 ) the fact that the trade remedy action may not be country or foreign exporter specific ; that is , it may involve imports of a particular product from all sources . representatives of wheat farmers in canada and the united states , as well as canadian government officials , also believe that grain exports to the united states would be greater if the cwb ceased to exist . the subsidy data provided by canada are , however , incomplete , as several government subsidies are not included . however , the cwb declines to reveal other important information , such as the actual contract prices for its sales to foreign grain buyers . a canadian grain company confirmed that sales to canadian consumers are based on the mge prices . therefore , the value information collected by customs on canadian wheat and barley shipments is used only for statistical purposes . stes have been involved in trade remedy actions under u.s. law .
