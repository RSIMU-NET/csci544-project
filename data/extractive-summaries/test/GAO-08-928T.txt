biennially , the judicial conference , the federal judiciary's principal policymaking body , assesses the judiciary's needs for additional judgeships . in the courts of appeals , all case filings are weighted equally at 1.0 , except for pro se case filings — those in which one or both parties are not represented by an attorney — which are discounted . the judicial conference relies on these quantitative workload measures to be reasonably accurate measures of judges' case - related workload . importantly , the weights were designed to be descriptive not prescriptive — that is , the weights were designed to develop a measure of the national average amount of time that judges actually spent on specific cases , not to develop a measure of how much time judges should spend on various types of cases . in our 2003 report , we found the district court case weights approved in 1993 to be a reasonably accurate measure of the average time demands a specific number and mix of cases filed in a district court could be expected to place on the district judges in that court . the methodology used to develop the weights used a valid sampling procedure , developed weights based on actual case - related time recorded by judges from case filings to disposition , and included a measure ( standard errors ) of the statistical confidence in the final weight for each weighted case type . the design for the new case weights relied on three sources of data for specific types of cases: ( 1 ) data from automated databases identifying the docketed events associated with the cases ; ( 2 ) data from automated sources on the time associated with courtroom events for cases , such as trials or hearings ; and ( 3 ) consensus of estimated time data from structured , guided discussion among experienced judges on the time associated with noncourtroom events for cases , such as reading briefs or writing opinions . first , the design assumed that judicial time spent on a given case could be accurately estimated by viewing the case as a set of individual tasks or events in the case . information about event frequencies and , where available , time spent on the events would be extracted from existing administrative data bases and report and used to develop estimates of the judge - time spent on different types of cases . for event data , the research design proposed using data from two data bases ( one of which was new and had not been implemented in all district courts ) that would have to be integrated to obtain and analyze the event data . the fjc proposed creating a technical advisory group to address this issue . second , the research design did not require judges to record time spent on individual cases . however , a majority of district judges' time is spent on case - related work outside the courtroom . thus , the planned methodology did not make it possible to objectively , statistically assess how accurate the new case weights are — weights whose accuracy the judicial conference relies upon in assessing judgeship needs . it is not based on empirical data regarding the judge time that different types of cases may require . in our 2003 report we recommended that the judicial conference of the united states update the district court case weights using a methodology that supports an objective , statistically reliable means of calculating the accuracy of the resulting weights ; and develop a methodology for measuring the case - related workload of courts of appeals judges that supports an objective , statistically reliable means of calculating the accuracy of the resulting workload measures and that addressed the special case characteristics of the court of appeals for the d.c . circuit .
