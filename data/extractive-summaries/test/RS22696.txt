credit suisse gave the court the opportunity — not exercised since 1981 — to reiterate and apply its previously stated standards for granting implied antitrust immunity . an antitrust suit ( originally a class action ) was filed by a group of ipo purchasers against the underwriters of those issues ( 10 major investment banks ) alleging conspiracy , price fixing - related , and tying violations of § 1 of the sherman act . the particular , allegedly harmful practices included ( 1 ) required investor promises to place bids in the aftermarket at prices above the initial public offering price , referred to as "laddering" ; ( 2 ) required investor commitments to purchase other , less attractive securities , a kind of tying arrangement ; and ( 3 ) investor payment of excessive commissions . the court , in an opinion authored by justice breyer , began its analysis of the availability of implied antitrust immunity in this instance by noting that all of the challenged activities meet the basic prerequisite for implied antitrust immunity in the regulated securities industry: they are "central to the proper functioning of well - regulated capital markets. . we believe it fair to conclude that , where conduct at the core or the marketing of new securities is at issue ; where securities regulators proceed with great care to distinguish the encouraged and permissible from the forbidden ; where the threat to antitrust lawsuits , through error and disincentive , could seriously alter underwriter conduct in undesirable ways , to allow an antitrust lawsuit would threaten serious harm to the efficient functioning of the securities markets . given ( 1 ) congress's expressed concern that securities markets become and remain stable , ( 2 ) the continued oversight and actions of a single expert regulatory agency versus the probability of diverse and possibly conflicting decisions by nonexpert judges in the event of securities / antitrust lawsuits , and ( 3 ) the likelihood of conflict between the mandates of antitrust law and allowable activities under the securities laws , the court found that "the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible' with the application of the antitrust laws. . justice thomas's dissent found fault with the court's assertion that the securities acts were silent on whether the antitrust laws should be applicable to entities in the securities industry .
