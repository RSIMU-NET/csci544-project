by law , married persons who file joint tax returns are each fully responsible for the accuracy of the tax return and for the full tax liability . this is true even though only one taxpayer may have earned the wages or income shown on the tax return . under the internal revenue service's ( irs ) innocent spouse program , irs can relieve taxpayers of tax debts on the basis of equity considerations , such as not knowing that their spouse failed to pay taxes due . since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act ( restructuring act ) of 1998 , irs has received thousands of requests from taxpayers for innocent spouse relief . irs's inability to provide timely responses to such requests has generated concerns among taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders . specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) irs's overall approach to ensure that innocent spouse cases were being processed in a timely , accurate , and consistent manner ; ( 2 ) the adequacy of irs's procedures to transfer tax liabilities between taxpayers when relief was granted to one of the taxpayers ; and ( 3 ) irs's efforts to evaluate the usefulness of its innocent spouse program web site to taxpayers . to some extent , irs also was able to reach decisions on more innocent spouse cases than it received in fiscal year 2001 because the portion of innocent spouse cases it receives that are not eligible for relief has been increasing . the guidance advises agencies to employ a combination of actions such as edit checks for controlling data entry and reconciliation of account totals . irs has established a web site for its innocent spouse program but has not evaluated the site . the innocent spouse program web site , which went on - line in december 1999 , was developed to help taxpayers determine their eligibility for innocent spouse relief .
