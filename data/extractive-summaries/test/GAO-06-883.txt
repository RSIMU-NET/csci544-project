gao has prepared this report under the comptroller general's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative as part of a continued effort to assist congress in overseeing dod's technology and acquisition investments . to successfully develop and transition technologies from their labs to their product lines , leading commercial companies depend on three key techniques: strategic planning at the corporate level ; a gated management review process that ensures a technology's relevancy , feasibility , and transition readiness ; and effective tools to solidify commitment , address transition issues , and gauge project progress and process effectiveness . for example , labs must demonstrate that the technology meets product line cost , schedule , and performance requirements . these metrics are not treated with the same rigor as metrics that are used after product development begins . this shortcoming is a major contributor to dod's poor cost and schedule outcomes . the strategy identifies five generic technology thrust areas — information assurance , battlespace awareness , force protection , reduced cost of ownership , and maintaining basic research — that have high priority in the department , and is supported by four other documents , including the basic research plan , which presents the dod objectives and investment strategy for dod - sponsored basic research performed by universities , industry , and service laboratories ; defense technology area plan , which presents the dod objectives and the strategies for applied research and advanced technology development investments ; joint warfighting science and technology plan , which takes a joint perspective across the applied research and advanced technology development plans to ensure that the science and technology program supports priority future joint warfighting capabilities ; and defense technology objectives , which identify specific technology advancements that will be developed or demonstrated , the anticipated date of availability , and specific expected benefits . however , they have experienced similar problems as the navy . with the exception of darpa , dod does not use relationship managers in the same manner as leading private companies . examples from past initiatives serve as reminders that just changing the mechanics of technology transition processes , without changing the environment that determines incentives , may not produce better outcomes . for commercial practices to work on a broad scale , the dod environment must be conducive for applying such practices . therefore , we recommend that the secretary of defense: expand the use of technology transition agreements to applied and advanced development projects ; include additional metrics in technology transition agreements to provide s&t and acquisition program managers demonstrated knowledge about the manufacturing readiness , producibility , other benefits , and risks of including the technology on a weapons program ; expand the use of relationship managers by designating people at various levels in both the s&t and acquisition communities to address systemic transition issues and those related to specific weapon system programs . in particular , we discussed their ( 1 ) strategic planning process for identifying and prioritizing customer needs , ( 2 ) technology development process used to fund and mature technologies required to meet customer needs , ( 3 ) tools used to facilitate communication between labs and product lines to transition technology , and ( 4 ) technology transition process , including when transition occurs , the organizations involved , and how technology is funded throughout the transition phase . gao - 06-391 .
