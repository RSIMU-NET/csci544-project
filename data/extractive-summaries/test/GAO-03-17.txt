the department of defense planned to spend about $7.9 billion on acquiring munitions in fiscal year 2002 . ongoing military operations associated with the global war on terrorism have heightened concerns about the unified combatant commands having sufficient quantities of munitions . since 1994 , the department of defense inspector general and gao have issued numerous reports identifying weaknesses and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the process used by the department to determine munitions requirements . our review of the requirements process and related documentation showed that the department of defense corrected the previously identified systemic problems in its process for determining munitions requirements , but the reliability of the process continues to be uncertain because of the department's failure to link the near - term munitions needs of the combatant commands and the purchases made by the military services based on computations derived from the department's munitions requirements determination process . as a result , the services are purchasing some critically needed munitions based on available funding and the contractors' production capacity . while this approach may be needed in the short term , it raises questions whether over the long term it would position the services to make the most efficient use of appropriated funds and whether the needs of combatant commands to carry out their missions will be met .
