the rail network is one of america's safest modes of transportation , although several recent rail accidents , including the metro - north commuter rail accident in bridgeport , connecticut , the collision of bnsf and up trains in chaffee , missouri , and the collision of a csx train and a truck in rosedale , maryland , have reinforced the need for constant effort from both the private and public sectors to ensure that rail transportation remains safe for passengers , the public , and railroad employees . my statement will discuss our ongoing reviews of fra's rail safety oversight and the implementation of positive train control , a communications - based system designed to prevent train accidents caused by human factors . in addition , we interviewed state rail safety officials and freight railroad officials from selected class i , ii , and iii railroads . the rail safety improvement act ( rsia ) of 2008 was the first authorization of fra's safety activities since 1994 and is due to be reauthorized in 2013 . rsia overhauled federal rail safety requirements by directing the fra to , among other things , promulgate additional new rail safety regulations and guidance in areas such as railroad risk reduction plans , track inspections standards , and highway - rail grade crossing safety . under rsia , fra is responsible for approving railroads' ptc implementation plans and certifying ptc systems prior to installation . our work to date indicates that fra primarily monitors railroads' compliance with federal safety regulations through routine inspections by individual inspectors at specific sites on railroads' systems . our preliminary work has found that thirty states also employ railroad safety inspectors , who participate in a partnership program with fra to conduct safety oversight activities , supplemental to fra's activities , based on fra rail safety regulations and to enforce state railroad safety laws . fra trains and certifies state inspectors and includes them in its inspection planning efforts . in 2006 , fra implemented a risk - based approach , using its national inspection plan ( nip ) , to allocate its limited inspection resources to ensure rail safety . the quantitative model uses data including: 1 ) the most recent 3 years of accident data from reports that railroads are required to file about accidents that occur on their tracks ; 2 ) data from fra's inspection activity ; and 3 ) information on railroad activities such as train miles and other data , to determine the scope of what fra's inspectors should inspect in a given year . fra officials also told us that while the sam model has been refined based on what they have learned from making improvements to the nip , the sam is not designed to take into account certain changes — such as increasing freight train volume or accidents in a particular region — as the sam uses past accident data to provide a baseline for the nationwide distribution of its inspectors . however , fra regional officials we talked to stated that the staffing decisions based on sam results do not necessarily align their inspectors with their perspective of the needs in their region nor does it take a region's geography into account . however , regional administrators expressed concern over the staffing pressures this can create . as we continue our on - going work on rail safety oversight , we will further assess how fra officials use these tools to accommodate changing rail safety risks and allocate inspectors across regions and inspection disciplines . based on our work to date , we have identified several potential challenges affecting fra's rail safety oversight , including lack of a final rule requiring the submission of risk reduction plans by specified railroads , lack of succession planning to ensure sufficient staff numbers and expertise , and other ongoing and emerging challenges . according to fra officials , in the next 5 years , 150 of fra's 470 inspectors ( about 32 percent ) will be eligible to retire . for example , because ptc systems are extremely complex command , control , and communications systems , the fra believes it will require a specialized inspector workforce — which fra currently does not have — to provide adequate safety oversight . developing ptc components and ptc installation: some ptc components are still in development — most notably the ptc back - office server . fra resources: although most railroads we spoke with said they have worked closely with fra throughout the ptc implementation process , some railroads cited concerns with fra's limited resources and the agency's ability to help facilitate railroads' ptc implementation . our work to date also indicates that by attempting to implement ptc by the 2015 deadline , railroads may be making choices that could introduce financial and operational risks to ptc implementation . representatives from freight railroads and fra told us railroads will not compromise the safety functions of the ptc system and will ensure that ptc is implemented meeting rsia requirements . these representatives noted that without adequate testing , ptc systems could potentially malfunction or fail more frequently , causing system disruptions .
