the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) has helped over 3.69 million afghan refugees return to afghanistan since march of 2002 , marking the largest assisted return operation in unhcr's history . in addition , more than a million refugees have returned to afghanistan without availing themselves of unhcr's assistance ( also known as "spontaneous returns" ) bringing the total number of returnees to 4.8 million or more . issues of particular concern to the 110 th congress are 1 ) continuing and sustaining refugee returns as part of afghanistan's overall reconstruction ; 2 ) developing funding strategies for the next phase of afghanistan's remaining refugees ; and 3 ) examining the refugee situation in light of border security issues , particularly with regard to pakistan's recently announced plan to lay land mines and build a fence along its border with afghanistan . the working assumption at the time was that there were approximately 2 million refugees in pakistan and 1.5 million in iran . almost everyone was caught off - guard , when subsequently 2.15 million afghans returned in 2002 , and yet most of the camps in pakistan ( and to some extent the cities in iran ) continued to house large numbers of afghan refugees . although the numbers of returns declined in subsequent years , it can be seen from table 1 that through 2005 the pace remained very strong . unhcr estimates that , as of december 2006 , perhaps 2.46 million registered and unregistered afghans are currently living in pakistan and more than 900,000 in iran . almost all assistance has been provided through the migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) account , and has been programmed by the department of state's bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) . this funding is used not only for the protection and care of refugees in countries of asylum , but also for the reintegration of afghan returnees in afghanistan . the united states thus faces the challenge of maintaining its crucial assistance in this area of the world despite competing priorities . a related issue may be whether pakistan and iran would be receptive to encouragement to grant citizenship to afghans who do not want to return to afghanistan . both the goi and the gop , indicate some possible flexibility on the future of afghan migration , but have nevertheless made clear that they believe the refugee crisis in afghanistan is over , and that there is no excuse for afghans to remain in their countries on humanitarian grounds . future study of the reasons for afghan population movements is required in order to determine their reasons for migration . it remains to be seen what effect the pakistani government's recently announced plans for controlling and securing the afghan border , through the construction of fences and planting of landmines , will have on refugee movements . new research indicates that afghan labor migration may prove beneficial to both afghanistan — in the form of remittances — and to countries of asylum — in the form of labor . ultimately , however , afghans will likely continue to live and work outside of afghanistan , regardless of the legality of doing so ; understanding and regulating as much of this migration as possible may be one way to ensure that it is done so in a secure , humane , and effective manner .
