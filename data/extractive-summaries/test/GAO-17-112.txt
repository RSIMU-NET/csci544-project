the capitol police board is charged with overseeing and supporting the capitol police . the board has several oversight responsibilities related to human capital . according to officials representing two of the four law enforcement expert groups with whom we spoke , such a wide ranging scope for an oversight body is atypical . the board's manual of procedures fully incorporated one of the six leading practices and partially incorporated the other five to facilitate accountability , transparency , and effective external communication . clearly understand decisions that require specific board approval . the manual has not incorporated this activity . evaluate board performance on a continuing basis . therefore , the board has not fully incorporated some leading practices into its manual because it believes that some of them address areas beyond what is required in statute . stakeholders also provided their perspectives of the board's role overall . the board could do this by soliciting stakeholder input as it considers the non - statutory changes that stakeholders suggested to address their concerns , such as developing strategies for obtaining stakeholder feedback when making security decisions . to ensure that the capitol police board's current and any new approaches help enhance accountability , transparency , and effective external communication with its stakeholders , we recommend that the board revise its manual of procedures to fully incorporate each of the leading practices for internal control and governance standards discussed in this report . further , the board noted that its manual is an internal reference tool to guide current and prospective board members and not a governance document . to examine the roles and responsibilities of the board and the chief of the capitol police as set out in statute and in the board's manual of procedures ( manual ) and to determine how the board's scope compares to other law enforcement oversight entities , we reviewed the relevant statutes that set out the board and the chief's roles and responsibilities . to examine the extent to which the board's manual incorporates leading practices from internal control and other standardized governance practices to facilitate accountability , transparency and effective external communication and describe the ways the board has implemented these practices , we first assessed the manual using internal control and corporate governance principles . to identify the congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree to which the board is accountable , transparent , and effective in its communication approaches and options that exist to enhance the board's approaches , we sought stakeholder views from the majority and minority staff of the committees who engage with the board – senate committee on rules and administration , committee on house administration , and the senate and house legislative branch appropriations subcommittees – as well as the majority and minority staff representing the leadership from the senate and the house , to provide insight into how the board's practices were meeting their needs for accountability , transparency , and effective communication when interacting with the board and to solicit feedback on the options to alternative board structures that we found in our prior work on the board , options proposed by the congressional research service in 2009 , and to identify any other options that may address any concerns they have in interacting with the board .
