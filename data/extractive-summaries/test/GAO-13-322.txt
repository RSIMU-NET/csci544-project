the department of defense ( dod ) operates a large and complex health care system that employs more than 150,000 military , civilian , and contract personnel working in military hospitals and clinics , commonly referred to as military treatment facilities ( mtf ) . this report ( 1 ) describes the contracting practices used by the military departments to provide health care professional services and what is known about the cost effectiveness of these practices , ( 2 ) assesses the extent to which the military departments have consolidated their health care staffing requirements , ( 3 ) identifies the percentage of contract health care professionals at on - base and off - base facilities and discusses the extent to which the costs associated with care provided by these professionals can be compared , ( 4 ) describes the training requirements and experience of medical services contracting personnel , and ( 5 ) identifies the extent to which the military departments have policies or procedures that address legislated quality standards for contract health care professionals and for the staffing companies that provide them . a variety of contracting arrangements are available to dod to contract for health care professionals . all three military departments used competition and fixed - price contracts for a majority of their medical services contract obligations in fiscal year 2011 . military department analyses indicate that multiple - award contracts may result in lower costs compared to some other contract arrangements . we found that the army , navy , air force , and jtf capmed together used multiple - award contracts for 64 percent of the $1.14 billion in obligations for contracts for health care professionals in fiscal year 2011 . over the last 9 years , various dod groups as well as gao have recommended that dod take steps toward such a strategy , but dod still does not have an agency - wide acquisition strategy to consolidate these requirements . in 2007 , dod drafted a charter for a defense medical strategic sourcing council . additionally , in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 , congress included a requirement for dod to provide an implementation plan for its governance reforms , including goals , timeframes , and estimated savings , among other things . for example , the departments have made efforts to use multiple - award contracts to consolidate intraservice staffing requirements , but we identified several instances where multiple task orders were placed for the same type of provider in the same area or facility . nearly all of the military departments' contract health care professionals — 96 percent — worked in facilities located on military installations in fiscal year 2011 . further , based on available data and interviews with dod officials , we determined that labor categories , labor costs , and full - time equivalent calculations all vary by military department , and in some cases by facility or contract . for example , reported workload data have been characterized as unreliable . dod medical services contracting personnel are subject to dod - wide training requirements , and health care experience varies for these personnel . the military departments provide cors , but usually not contracting officers , with specialized training in contracting for health care professionals in addition to dod's requirements . the air force relies on base contracting offices to support contracting for health care professionals at its 63 mtfs and , in contrast to both the army and navy , most air force contracting officers responsible for awarding and administering contracts for health care professionals are also responsible for the acquisition of non - medical products and services . according to dod officials , dod did not require consistent quality standards or take any additional actions in response to this legislation — such as by establishing a specific policy or guidance — because officials believed the military departments were already applying these standards as part of their contracting processes . 8 .
