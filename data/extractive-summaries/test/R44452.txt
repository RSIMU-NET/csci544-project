congress appropriates approximately $23 million annually to maintain the selective service agency . men who fail to register are subject to penalties in the form of lost benefits and criminal action . some have questioned the need to maintain this agency and the registration requirements . this report is intended to provide congress with information about how the military selective service act ( mssa ) , the selective service system ( sss ) , and associated requirements for registration have evolved over time . the first section of the report provides background and history on the military selective service act , the selective service system , and the implementation of the draft in the united states . the second section discusses statutory registration requirements , processes for registering , and penalties for failing to register . this report does not discuss the state of the all - volunteer force or whether it is adequate to meet our nation's current or future manpower needs . today , nearly all males residing in the united states — u.s . citizens and documented or undocumented immigrant men — are required to register with the selective service if they are at least 18 years old and are not yet 26 years old . men born from march 29 , 1957 , to december 31 , 1959 , were never required to register because the registration program was not in effect at the time they turned 18 . the agency is currently maintained as an active standby organization . the statutory missions of the sss are to maintain a complete registration and classification structure capable of immediate operation in the event of a national emergency ( including a structure for registration and classification of persons qualified for practice or employment in a health care occupation essential to the maintenance of the armed forces ) , and personnel adequate to reinstitute immediately the full operation of the system , including military reservists who are trained to operate such system and who can be ordered to active duty for such purpose in the event of a national emergency . if the sss were activated with the authority to induct individuals , the agency would be responsible for ( 1 ) holding a national draft lottery , ( 2 ) contacting registrants who are selected via the lottery , ( 3 ) arranging transportation for selectees to military entrance processing stations ( meps ) for testing and evaluation of fitness to serve , and ( 4 ) activating a classification structure that would include area offices , local offices , and appeal boards . others have suggested that the mssa is no longer necessary and should be repealed . still others have suggested amendments to the mssa to address issues of equity , efficiency , and cost .
