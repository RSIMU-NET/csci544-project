the vvsg are a set of technical standards for voting systems that use computers to assist in recording or counting votes . the vvsg replaced the federal voluntary vss originally developed under the auspices of the federal election commission ( fec ) . the practical effect of such state requirements is that voting system vendors can successfully market systems only if they are certified under the vss or vvsg . the act is largely silent on the relationship between the vvsg and those requirements , which stipulate that voting systems must provide for auditability , accessibility , and ballot verification and error correction by voters , that states must set standards for what constitutes a vote on a given system , and that machine error rates of voting systems must conform to the standards set in the guidelines . several issues have been raised about the vvsg that may require congressional attention . the 2005 version did not address the second criticism , but the 2007 draft would require more realistic testing . certification process . the 2005 version of the guidelines partially revised the vss , and some observers believe that the revisions should have been more comprehensive to address perceived shortcomings of the vss . until the vvsg went into effect in late 2007 , federal certification of voting systems continued to be based on the 2002 vss , and the next version of the vvsg will also likely go into effect about two years after they are adopted probably some time in 2009 . that may be especially important for those jurisdictions that require a voter - verifiable paper audit trail for use with dres . some observers have expressed concerns that if states do not follow the vvsg in meeting the requirements , they could be judged not to be in compliance with hava , despite the voluntary nature of the guidelines and the stipulation in hava that the methods of implementation are left to states .
