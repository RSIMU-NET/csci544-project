on october 5 , 2004 , the manufacturer announced that because of potential contamination , it would be unable to release any vaccine for the u.s. market . before the october 5 announcement , hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and its advisory committee on immunization practices ( acip ) had recommended that those at high risk of severe complications from influenza and those in other priority groups — such as health care workers and those aged 50 – 64 years — receive an influenza vaccination . media reports of long lines of seniors waiting hours for a chance at a vaccination , of others at high risk who could not find a vaccination , and of individuals turned away who never returned when supplies became available fueled worries that the nation was not adequately prepared to respond to the significant vaccine shortage or to an influenza pandemic ( a widespread or worldwide influenza epidemic ) . what actions were taken at federal , state , and local levels to ensure that high - risk individuals had access to influenza vaccine during the 2004 – 05 shortage ? . other organizations within hhs that are involved with immunization activities include the national vaccine program office , which is responsible for coordinating and ensuring collaboration among the many federal agencies involved in vaccine and immunization activities , and the food and drug administration ( fda ) , which in approving and regulating the use of vaccines and drugs , including antiviral medications , is responsible for ensuring that they are safe and effective . after the october 5 , 2004 , announcement of the sharp reduction in expected influenza vaccine supply , federal , state , and local health officials took steps to help ensure that those at high risk of severe complications from infection had access to influenza vaccine . state and local health officials we met with reported having quickly adopted cdc's revised recommendations . to help support providers in vaccinating only those individuals in cdc's priority groups , a number of states , such as california and florida , issued emergency public health directives requiring health care providers to limit influenza vaccination to people in priority groups and to refrain from vaccinating individuals not in cdc's priority groups . although the actions taken to address the influenza vaccine shortage helped achieve vaccination rates approaching past levels for certain priority groups ( see fig . despite these efforts , however , problems occurred . certain officials we spoke with , however , reported that although plans and directives helped , improvements were still needed . for example , minnesota tried to sell its available vaccine to other states seeking additional vaccine for their high - risk populations . while part of the lesson learned about communication was positive , some aspects of this lesson pointed to need for improvement . despite these positives , when examining the 2004 – 05 influenza season , state and local officials identified areas of communication to improve for future seasons . drawing from experiences during the 2004 – 05 shortage , cdc has taken a number of steps , including issuing interim guidelines in august 2005 , to assist in responding to possible future shortages . it is too early , however , to assess the effectiveness of these efforts in coordinating actions of federal , state , and local health agencies and others who play a part in the annual influenza vaccination process . flu vaccine: supply problems heighten need to ensure access for high - risk people .
