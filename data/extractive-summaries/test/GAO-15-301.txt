in 2010 , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) authorized the establishment of the patient - centered outcomes research institute ( pcori ) as a federally funded , nonprofit corporation to improve the quality and relevance of comparative clinical effectiveness research ( cer ) . pcori , which began operation in 2010 , is required to identify research priorities , establish a research project agenda , fund research consistent with its research agenda , and disseminate research results , among other things . pcori seeks to make its research patient centered by incorporating patients and other stakeholders in the research process , and pcori refers to the type of cer it conducts as patient - centered to fund pcori , ppaca established the outcomes research ( pcor ) .patient - centered outcomes research trust fund ( pcortf ) , through which the institute is expected to receive an estimated $3.5 billion from fiscal years 2010 through 2019 . ppaca mandated that gao review pcori's activities in 2015. report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which pcori established priorities and processes for funding and disseminating comparative clinical effectiveness research consistent with its legislative requirements ; ( 2 ) the status of pcori's efforts to fund comparative clinical effectiveness research ; and ( 3 ) pcori's plans , if any , to evaluate the effectiveness of its work . priorities , what plans pcori has for updating these priorities , what procedures pcori employs for reviewing and selecting applications to fund , how pcori monitors its contractors , and how pcori plans to disseminate research results . we compared information gathered from documentation and interviews to pcori's legislative requirements . in 2012 , pcori established five broad research priorities: ( 1 ) assessment of prevention , diagnosis , and treatment options ; ( 2 ) improving health care systems ; ( 3 ) communication and dissemination research ; ( 4 ) addressing disparities ; and ( 5 ) accelerating patient - centered outcomes research and methodological research . pcori officials stated that they are currently developing a peer review assessment process , as required by law , to review final reports submitted by contractors at the conclusion of a project . specifically , pcori has entered into a contract for the development of a dissemination and implementation plan . as of october 2014 , pcori has awarded 360 contracts to fund research projects across 12 funding areas . pcori made a total of $670.8 million in commitments to fund these contracts . according to pcori officials , approximately $106 million in commitments to date are for the pcornet data research network , the aim of which is to improve the capacity for and speed of conducting cer . pcornet is still undergoing development and testing . officials stated that limited amounts of data will be available through pcornet for queries by researchers after september 2015 , with the amount of available data increasing over time . pcori's evaluation group — a body composed of members from its board of governors , methodology committee , advisory panel on patient engagement , external experts , and pcori staff — has developed initial plans for evaluating pcori's efforts against its three strategic goals , which are to increase information , speed implementation , and influence research . to do so , pcori identified primary outcome measures for each of its strategic goals . in its strategic plan , pcori notes that these are meant to be long - term measures because research typically requires several years to complete and additional years for the results to be disseminated and implemented . therefore , since 2013 , pcori has been using early and intermediate process and output measures as a way to monitor its progress toward its strategic goals . pcori anticipates having some early results related to its primary outcome measures starting in 2017 after the first cer studies are completed and their findings released , although full evaluation of the results of these outcome measures will not be possible until around 2020 , after a large number of cer studies have been completed and a few years have elapsed , allowing time for study results to be taken up . pcori provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
