in summary , over the past 3 fiscal years , the district government has proposed hundreds of management reform initiatives that were estimated to save millions of dollars as well as improve government services . however , as of june 1 , 2000 , the district had only reported savings of about $1.5 million related to these initiatives and had not consistently tracked the status of these projects . neither the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance authority ( the authority ) nor the district could provide adequate details on the goals achieved for all of the projects that had been reported as completed or in various stages of completion . the district does not currently have a systematic process to monitor these management reform projects and determine where savings or customer service improvements have been realized . consequently , the district cannot say for certain how funds designated for management reform have been spent or whether the key goals of these initiatives have been realized .
