while the risks of loss and the regulation may be local , the business of insurance , as with many financial services , has an increasingly substantial international component as companies look to grow and diversify . the postcrisis 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank ) altered the u.s. insurance regulatory system , particularly as it relates to international issues . the fio is not a federal insurance regulator , but is tasked with representing the united states in international fora and , along with the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , can negotiate international covered agreements relating to insurance prudential measures . the new federal involvement in insurance issues , both domestic and international , has created frictions both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities , and has been a subject of both congressional hearings and proposed legislation . in 2017 , total u.s. services accounted for $798 billion of u.s. exports and $542 billion of u.s. imports , creating a surplus of $255 billion .  — nothing in this section shall — ( 1 ) preempt — ( a ) any state insurance measure that governs any insurer's rates , premiums , underwriting , or sales practices ; ( b ) any state coverage requirements for insurance ; ( c ) the application of the antitrust laws of any state to the business of insurance ; or ( d ) any state insurance measure governing the capital or solvency of an insurer , except to the extent that such state insurance measure results in less favorable treatment of a non - united state insurer than a united states insurer ; further strictures are placed on the determination , including notice to the states involved and to congressional committees ; public notice and comment in the federal register ; and the specific application of the administrative procedure act , including de novo determination by courts in a judicial review . although the fio and the ustr must consult with congress on covered agreement negotiations , the statute does not require specific authorization or approval from congress for a covered agreement . outside of international trade negotiations and agreements , two separate but interrelated entities have the most significant impact on international insurance issues in the united states: the financial stability board and the international association of insurance supervisors . as part of its monitoring of global financial stability , the fsb has designated a number of financial institutions as globally systemically important . 115-174 on may 24 , 2018 . the federal reserve and the department of the treasury are to complete an annual report and to provide testimony on the ongoing discussions at the iais through 2022 , and the federal reserve and fio are to complete a study and report , along with the opportunity for public comment and review by the government accountability office ( gao ) , on the impact of international capital standards or other proposals prior to agreeing to such standards . h.r . similar language to s. 1360 was added to p.l .
