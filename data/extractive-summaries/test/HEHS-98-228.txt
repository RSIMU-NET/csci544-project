recently , in the course of the debate regarding how to restore long - term solvency for the social security program , legislation has been proposed that would require ssa to place on the pebes an individualized estimate of the rates of return workers receive on their contributions to the social security program . proponents of adding rates of return to the pebes believe these rates would provide individuals with information on the current program and enable them to compare their rate of return for social security with rates for other investments . furthermore , using rates of return for social security presents a number of difficulties . for example , the social security program is designed to help ensure that low - wage earners have adequate income in their retirement . to be clearly understood , rate of return estimates for social security need an explanation of how they are calculated and how uncertain the estimates are . many factors that would be included in rate of return estimates for social security are subject to considerable uncertainty , and these uncertainties mean that the actual rates of return that individuals receive could vary substantially from their estimates . because rate of return estimates for social security rely on projected earnings , they are inherently uncertain . however , ssa's records do not include information on whether a worker has a spouse or children unless and until such dependents apply for benefits based on the worker's record . as a result of this benefit option , a dually entitled couple's rate of return on their contributions is generally different than their individual rates . explanations would be needed to understand a number of important factors , including whether the rates of return incorporated the transaction and administrative costs for investments or annuities , the differences in risk associated with social security and private investments , and the questions of how to treat the costs of the benefits promised under the current system when switching to any other retirement system . given the disagreement over whether it is appropriate to apply the rate of return concept to the social security program and the number of assumptions that must be factored into such an estimate , it would be especially important to fully explain how the rate was calculated and how uncertain the estimate could be . in addition , ssa pointed out that it is working hard to make the information currently provided in the pebes easy for readers to understand and use and agreed that adding rate of return information would increase the complexity of the statement .
