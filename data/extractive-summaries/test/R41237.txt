since at least the 1980s , the border has played a central role in the debate over how to provide domestic security in the united states . the broad framework currently in place generally consists of a qhsr underpinning supported by a collection of agency or function specific strategic elements that show some commonalities . the five strategic commonalities to achieve these goals consist of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) leadership , deployment of layered security , maximizing domain awareness , promotion of a shared agency culture , and expansion of the border through international and domestic partnerships . for congressional policymakers , the current state of border protection presents at least three questions: ( 1 ) what does the current border protection framework consist of ? .  ( 2 ) is it working ? . and ( 3 ) are there more effective alternatives to achieve border protection ? . moreover , such questions provide an opportunity for legislators to re - evaluate the policies that have been pursued in providing border protection , especially as these policies might impact other elements of the u.s. border , such as markets and communities . this report provides an overview of the current border protection framework and its operationally oriented strategic elements and measures their effectiveness . for critics and advocates of u.s. border protection policy , there are a host of competing policy alternatives for how to effectively protect the border . while some individuals want more enforcement and stricter admission criteria , others want to lessen these restrictions on cross - border activity . ultimately , while neither camp is seeking to make the u.s. population less secure , the policy choices for building border protection are rooted in competing visions of what u.s. border policy should look like . these visions can be grouped into at least two camps: ( 1 ) a unilateral security model , based on a metaphorical "fortress," and ( 2 ) an interdependence ( or cooperation - based ) model , based on a metaphorical "complex organism. . as previously stated , what has emerged from these efforts has been a generally agreed upon framework of mission and goals , but some might question whether a comprehensive strategy has yet been sufficiently mapped out . the border protection framework goals of obtaining operational control of the borders , safeguarding lawful trade and travel , and identifying and disrupting transnational criminal organizations are necessarily vague , as the breadth of the threats and activities at the border are wide . but these goals are rooted in the notion that a strategy based on enforcement can ultimately prevent or deter most actions that are undesirable . this assumption has been the source of much debate and continues to be the source of skepticism in certain circles . as the empirical analysis above suggested , few conclusive claims about the effectiveness of the current border protection framework can be made . yet , even if enforcement - only measures do provide some level of deterrence and prevention against border violations , these efforts are both costly and do not necessarily address the underlying causes of such activities .
