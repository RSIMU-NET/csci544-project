the 2009 presidential transition will be a unique and critical period for the united states . our nation faces a wartime presidential transition for the first time in 40 years . in addition , this will be the first post - 9 / 11 transition , with a relatively new department of homeland security ( dhs ) grappling with the threats we face here at home while experiencing its first change in administration . while as a legislative branch agency gao has extensive experience helping each new congress , the presidential transition act points to gao as a resource for incoming administrations as well . the act specifically identifies gao as a source of briefings and other materials to help inform presidential appointees of the major management issues , risks , and challenges they will face . the act's 2000 amendments to clearly bring gao into the transition picture are consistent with the role we traditionally have played as an important resource for congress and new administrations during transitions . objectives for gao's transition efforts provide insight into pressing national issues . we believe this reassessment is needed to ensure that these types of serious disruptions can be minimized in the future . while facing pressing issues , the next congress and new administration also inherit the federal government's serious long - term fiscal challenge â€” driven on the spending side by rising health care costs and changing demographics . as a result of this framework and the efforts of congress and the bush and clinton administrations , there has been substantial progress in establishing the basic infrastructure needed to create high - performing organizations across the federal government . sustained efforts in these areas by the next congress and administration will help improve service to the american public , strengthen public confidence in the government's performance and accountability , potentially save billions of dollars , and ensure the ability of government to deliver on its promises . gao high - risk list as of september 2008 addressing challenges in broad - based transformations strategic human capital management managing federal real property protecting the federal government's information systems and the nation's critical infrastructures implementing and transforming the department of homeland security establishing appropriate and effective information - sharing mechanisms to improve homeland security dod approach to business transformation dod business systems modernization dod personnel security clearance program dod support infrastructure management dod supply chain management dod weapon systems acquisition faa air traffic control modernization financing the nation's transportation system effective protection of technologies critical to u.s. national security transforming federal oversight of food safety the 2010 census ( new ) . in summary , our goal will continue to be to provide congressional and executive branch policy makers with a comprehensive snapshot of how things are working across government and to emphasize the need to update some federal activities to better align them with 21st century realities and bring about government transformation . in keeping with our role , we will be providing congress and the executive branch with clear facts and constructive options and suggestions that our elected officials can use to make policy choices in this pivotal transition year . the nation's new and returning leaders will be able to use such information to help address both the nation's urgent issues and long - term challenges so that our nation stays strong and secure now and for the next generation .
