this report analyzes the threat to u.s. security posed by the al qaeda organization . by this time , al qaeda had become a coalition of factions of radical islamic groups operating throughout the muslim world , mostly groups opposing their governments . cells and associates have been located in over 70 countries , according to u.s. officials . although u.s. officials say that the post - september 11 struggle against al qaeda uses all aspects of u.s. national power ( legal , economic , diplomatic , as well as military ) , a cornerstone of the post - september 11 u.s. effort has been the military effort in afghanistan . if true , this would suggest that the three are in contact with al qaeda operatives outside iran . reflecting this view , the state department report on terrorism for 2004 ( p. 7 ) says , as do many experts , that: ... the core of al - qa'ida has suffered damage to its leadership , organization , and capabilities...at the same time , al - qa'ida has spread its anti - u.s. , anti - western ideology to other groups and geographical areas . younger al qaeda figures , some of whom fled the afghanistan battlefield , are said to be emerging as major planners , and these activists apparently see al qaeda as inspiration rather than as a structured organization . according to this view , bin laden and zawahiri are far less operationally relevant than they were at the time of september 11 and u.s. and allied counter - terrorist efforts might be better spent on countering the ideology that is promoted by al qaeda . those who believe that al qaeda as an organization is marginal to the overall global islamist threat might focus on such policy objectives as addressing regional conflicts , promoting democracy in the arab world , cooperating with regional governments to prevent terrorism financing and terrorist infiltration , and improving public diplomacy to better explain u.s. policies in the middle east . on the other hand , some who believe that al qaeda remains central to the islamist terrorism threat might tend to recommend policies that focus on finding , combating , and arresting al qaeda leaders and operatives that are still at large . many believe that , no matter the structure and capabilities of al qaeda , stabilizing iraq will likely be crucial to reducing the recruitment of militants willing to conduct acts of terrorism against the united states and its allies . others believe that the al qaeda and global islamic terrorist threat is difficult to assess , no matter how much intelligence is shared and gathered , and that combating al qaeda and its affiliates abroad could have only partial success .
