proposed legislation in previous sessions of congress demonstrates legislative interest in the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies . some observers believe that such patents negatively impact social welfare . according to some experts , tax strategy patents may limit the ability of taxpayers to utilize provisions of the tax code , interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations . others assert that tax strategy patents potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and taxpayers alike . still others believe that the patent system should not provide incentives for individuals to develop new ways to reduce their tax liability . other commentators explain that patents on "business methods" have been obtained and enforced for many years . legislation enacted in 1999 that accounted expressly for patents claiming "a method of doing or conducting business" arguably approved of such patents . in addition , some commentators believe that tax strategy patents present a positive development , potentially improving the public disclosure of tax shelters for the attention of congress and federal tax authorities . some of these applications have been approved as issued patents . further , several of them have been the subject of infringement litigation in the federal judicial system . although business method patents have been held to be patentable at least since the issuance of the state street bank opinion in 1998 , the more recent phenomenon of tax strategy patents has resulted in a spirited discussion . on the other hand , other observers , including many patent professionals , believe both that concerns over tax patents are overstated , and that the patenting of tax strategies may lead to numerous positive consequences . in the 111 th congress , three bills were introduced that would limit the enforcement of tax strategy patents . h.r . 1265 and s. 506 defined the excluded category of "tax planning invention[s]" to mean "a plan , strategy , technique , scheme , process , or system that is designed to reduce , minimize , determine , avoid , or defer , or has , when implemented , the effect of reducing , minimizing , determining , avoiding , or deferring , a taxpayer's tax liability or is designed to facilitate compliance with tax laws , but does not include tax preparation software and other tools or systems used solely to prepare tax or information returns.... " h.r . 2584 would have prevented any patent claiming a "tax planning method," which is defined similarly . other legislative responses are also possible . congress could also encourage continued cooperation between the uspto and the irs with respect to tax strategy patents . the voluntary contributions of knowledgeable specialists , through these and other mechanisms , may help promote a high level of quality of issued tax strategy patents . some observers believe that patents on these and other innovations have been allowed for many years , without any evidence of harm to the u.s. innovation environment . although proposed legislative responses to the phenomenon of tax strategy patents have thus far been limited to those instruments , this episode might also promote broader congressional thinking of the sorts of inventions that may be appropriately patented .
