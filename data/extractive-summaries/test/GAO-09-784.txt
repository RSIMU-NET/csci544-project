to address these objectives , we reviewed safetea - lu and other new starts statutory requirements , fta guidance and regulations governing the new starts program and other fta documents , including the annual new starts report , and interviewed transportation experts , transit consultants , transit industry associations , and department of transportation ( dot ) officials about the time it takes for a new starts project to move through the new starts process , as well as the options that exist to expedite the process . for example , given past concerns that the evaluation process did not ac for a project's impact on economic development and fta's lack of communication to sponsors about upcoming changes , the statute added economic development to the list of project justification criteria that ft must use to evaluate and rate new starts projects , and requires fta to issue notice and guidance each time significant changes are made to th process and criteria . nevertheless , 9 of the 40 projects that have received a ffga since 1997 , and with complete data available , had milestone dates that ranged from about 4.5 to 14 years to complete the project development phases . however , the data from these 9 projects are not generalizeable to the 40 new starts projects . fta has not historically retained all milestone data for the 40 projects , such as the dates project sponsors apply to enter a project development phase , in a consistent manner . in addition , we found that project sponsors do not systematically retain milestone data for projects that have completed the new starts process . congress and fta have taken action to expedite projects through the new starts process through penta - p and training workshops for project sponsors . although not required , fta has also retained milestone data from some , but not all , projects longer than 2 years . we were unable to obtain complete and reliable project milestone data from fta . fta officials acknowledged that while not historically perfect ; the agency has retained sufficient milestone data to help manage the new starts program . nevertheless , recognizing the importance of having complete milestone data to better understand and improve the project development process , fta has taken several steps in recent years to more consistently collect and retain such data . safetea - lu also established the public - private partnership pilot program ( penta - p ) to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of public - private partnerships for certain new fixed guideway capital projects funded by fta . to reduce the “start / stop” phenomena project sponsors described , a legislative change would be necessary to eliminate the requirement that fta approve advancement of a project into final design , which would effectively combine the preliminary engineering and final design phases into one “project development” phase , as was done in safetea - lu when creating a more streamlined version of the process under the small starts program . as such , it is possible that , with more frequent use of letters of intent , fta's commitment authority could be depleted earlier than expected , which could affect the anticipated funding stream for future projects . however , this policy change does not apply to projects approved for entry into preliminary engineering , which is the new starts project development phase that has the most requirements for project sponsors and the phase where project sponsors told us that frequent changes result in additional costs and delays . however , fta must also strike the appropriate balance between expediting project development and maintaining the rigor and accountability of the new starts program . as fta works to develop its proposal for the new starts program for the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization , considering the advantages and disadvantages of these options , including any potential trade - offs , could help fta select any options that expedite the process while maintaining the rigorous oversight of the process . to evaluate the time it has generally taken for projects to move through the new starts process we collected and attempted to verify fta data on new starts projects that have advanced through the new starts process and received ffgas after june 1997 to determine the length of time each project spent in each stage of the process . however , of the 30 projects , we received complete sets of milestone data for 9 projects .
