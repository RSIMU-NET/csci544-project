between 2002 and 2012 an estimated 850,000 jobs will open in the construction industry , but experts predict that there will not be enough skilled workers to fill them . labor , through oatels , directly registers and oversees programs in 23 states . while labor and apprenticeship councils provide oversight , recent studies have shown that a significant number of construction apprentices are not completing their programs and that construction programs sponsored by employers without union participation have lower completion rates and wages for apprentices . specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of labor monitors the operations and outcomes of registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , ( 2 ) its oversight activities for council - monitored states , and ( 3 ) the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by employers alone . federal apprenticeship directors in these states reported they conducted 379 quality reviews in 2004 , covering only about 4 percent of the programs under their watch . although labor collects information to compute completion rates and track participants who do not complete programs in the time expected , it does not use these data to focus its oversight efforts on programs with poor performance . labor has infrequently reviewed states to which it has delegated oversight responsibility . while incompatible data systems may suggest that it would be difficult or costly to obtain more than aggregate counts , in collecting data for this report , we found many of the council - monitored states — including 10 with large numbers of apprentices — were both willing and capable of providing us data on apprentices by industry and by occupation as well as information on completion rates , completion times , and some wage data for occupations that we had specified . it is difficult to know what factors underlie this trend because , as noted earlier , labor does not systematically record information about why apprentices leave programs . we recommend that the secretary of labor take steps to ( 1 ) better utilize information in labor's database , such as indicators of program performance , for management oversight , particularly for apprenticeship programs in occupations with expected future labor shortages ; ( 2 ) develop a cost - effective strategy for collecting data from council - monitored states ; ( 3 ) conduct labor's reviews of apprenticeship activities in states that regulate their own programs on a regular basis to ensure that state activities are in accord with labor's requirements for recognition of apprenticeship programs ; and ( 4 ) offer substantive feedback to states from its reviews . our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of labor monitors the operations and outcomes of registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , ( 2 ) its oversight activities for council - monitored states , and ( 3 ) outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by employers alone . 27 q6 .
