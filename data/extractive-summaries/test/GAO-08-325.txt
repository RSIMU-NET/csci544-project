specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) whether dod has clearly defined and instilled a common understanding and approach to its global strike concept throughout the department , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has assessed and developed capabilities needed for global strike , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dod has identified the funding requirements and developed an investment strategy for acquiring new global strike capabilities . dod has taken a number of steps to implement its global strike concept and has generally assigned responsibilities for the planning , execution , and support of global strike operations . without a complete and clearly articulated concept that is well communicated and practiced with key stakeholders , dod could encounter difficulties in fully implementing its concept and building the necessary relationships for carrying out global strike operations . while key stakeholders have been involved in various global strike development efforts , global strike is interpreted differently among combatant command and service officials , who have significant roles and responsibilities in planning , coordinating , and executing global strike operations . for the long term , dod has four key studies underway or completed that are examining potential offensive strike systems to provide global strike capabilities beginning sometime after 2018 . since dod has not fully assessed the required enabling capabilities or coordinated various department efforts to improve enabling capabilities , such as intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance and command and control , for future strike systems , dod might not make the best decisions regarding which enabling capabilities to pursue . while dod plans investments in a range of global - strike - related capabilities , it has not yet begun to develop a prioritized investment strategy that considers the breadth of current efforts and future plans to develop capabilities for global strike , integrates these efforts to assess global strike options , and makes choices among alternatives in light of the department's long - term fiscal challenges . our prior work has shown that a long - term and comprehensive investment approach is an important tool in an organization's decision - making process to define direction , establish priorities , assist with current and future budgets , and plan the actions needed to achieve goals . specifically , dod concurred with our recommendations to ( 1 ) conduct a comprehensive assessment of enabling capabilities ( intelligence collection and dissemination , surveillance and reconnaissance , command and control , communications , and battlefield damage assessment ) ; ( 2 ) provide guidance on how the results of its studies to identify potential strike systems for global strike would be integrated into a comprehensive prioritized investment strategy for global strike ; ( 3 ) perform a comprehensive review of all capabilities being developed within dod's fydp to determine the extent to which these capabilities contribute or can be leveraged for global strike ; and ( 4 ) determine the appropriateness of using a portfolio management approach for global strike . to identify whether the department of defense ( dod ) has clearly defined and instilled a common understanding and approach to its global strike mission , we reviewed relevant global strike concept documents , studies , reports , briefings , and other pertinent documents to determine the scope , capabilities , range of operations , types of targets , doctrine , and other factors that make up the global strike concept and identify the definitions that are used throughout dod to define the term “global strike.” for example , we reviewed the april 2006 global strike joint capabilities document , a key document that identifies the set of capabilities required across all functional areas to accomplish the global strike mission , to obtain information on current global strike capabilities and shortfalls . to assess the extent to which dod has assessed and developed capabilities needed for global strike , we reviewed the study plans , supporting and relevant documentation , and final reports , if available , for dod's four principal global strike assessments — next generation long - range strike analysis of alternatives ; nuclear and conventional global strike missile study ; prompt global strike analysis of alternatives ; and global strike raid evaluation of alternatives — to identify potential conventional offensive strike weapons systems it may need in the near , mid , and long term .
