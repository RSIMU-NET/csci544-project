the federal home loan bank system's ( fhlbank system ) traditional cooperative approach to providing housing and community finance through 12 regionally based federal home loan banks ( fhlbank ) faces continual challenges due to consolidation in the financial services industry and the emergence of mortgage lenders with nationwide operations . recently , these concerns have been heightened as the federal housing finance board ( fhfb ) , the fhlbank system's financial regulator , has analyzed the benefits and costs associated with potential changes to the system's membership requirements that would allow financial organizations to join more than one fhlbank district ( these potential changes to the system's membership rules are commonly referred to as multidistrict membership ) . our review of key advance pricing terms — advance interest rates , collateral requirements , advance borrowing capacity , and capital stock purchase requirements — identified several significant differences among the 12 fhlbanks . the fhlbanks may charge different interest rates on advances with comparable maturities , some may establish interest rates on the basis of advance size while others do not , and the fhlbanks apply differing haircuts to the same type of collateral , establish different borrowing limits , and require members to purchase fhlbank stock in differing amounts depending upon their levels of advances outstanding . for example , officials at one fhlbank said that its representatives had the authority to negotiate the stated advance interest rates . fhfb requests data on , among other things , the total value of collateral securing advances , collateralization by member type ( such as commercial bank and thrifts ) , collateralization by member size ( such as members with $10 billion or more in assets ) , and the use of eligible collateral by member institutions ( such as the use of single - family mortgages and small business and agricultural cfi collateral ) . although fhfb has identified such data as useful for assessing the fhlbank system's safety and soundness , we found that fhlbanks do not have clear information on how fhfb wants the data to be reported . fhfb also stated that it planned to work with the fhlbanks to assess the value of additional data collection and reporting to monitor the competitive and safety and soundness influences of holding company subsidiaries that operate in multiple fhlbank districts . as discussed with your staff , our report objectives are to ( 1 ) describe the laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that fhlbanks can offer on advances ; ( 2 ) provide information on whether key differences exist in current advance pricing and other terms across the fhlbanks ; ( 3 ) determine whether holding companies face any legal or regulatory barriers in transferring assets among subsidiaries who are members of different fhlbank districts ; and ( 4 ) describe fhfb's safety and soundness oversight of the fhlbanks' advance pricing practices and review selected data that fhfb collects to monitor the safety and soundness of the fhlbank system .
