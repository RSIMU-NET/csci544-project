for those legal noncitizens who obtained their status through the financial sponsorship of a family member , there is an additional restriction .  ( 2 ) to what extent are agencies implementing sponsor deeming , and what factors may hinder them ? . 1 ) . the number of sponsored noncitizens potentially affected by sponsor deeming is unknown ; however , factors such as the restrictions on their eligibility for tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , as well as the deeming process itself , likely limit the number affected . the total number of sponsored noncitizens that apply for these benefits is also unknown , in part because most federal benefit agencies do not collect this data . staff reported the following examples of situations: some applicants withdraw their applications because they do not wish to bother their sponsor with a request for income documentation ; some withdraw because they are concerned about how their pursuit of benefits will impact their sponsors' ability to remain in the united states or naturalize , if their sponsors are legal noncitizens themselves ; some withdraw after being told their sponsor may be asked to repay the benefits in the future , as specified by federal law ; some applicants' sponsors cannot be located , resulting in denial of the application due to lack of sponsor income information ; and , some applicants' sponsors refuse to provide income information , also resulting in denial of the application . for instance , less than 0.4 percent of ssi recipients were sponsored noncitizens during the years 2004 through 2007 , according to ssa . although most administering agencies have established sponsor deeming policies , agency officials reported that additional guidance in certain areas would be helpful . specifically , between 60 and 70 percent of state administering agencies with sponsor deeming policies for tanf , medicaid , or snap expressed some desire for more guidance on various aspects of deeming ( see fig . specifically , over two - thirds of the tanf , medicaid , and snap state agency officials responding to our survey reported that clarification on whether it is mandatory or optional for agencies to administratively pursue sponsor repayment would be moderately , very , or extremely useful . ssi benefits , which applies nationwide . in new york , a state official reported that sponsor repayment is to be pursued when noncitizens receive tanf or snap benefits after qualifying for the indigence exception to deeming . some state and local tanf , medicaid , and snap officials told us that the staff who pursue sponsor repayment sometimes have competing priorities that also discourage the pursuit of sponsors for repayment . the prwora and iirira changes to sponsor deeming and repayment in tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , coupled with simultaneous changes to noncitizen eligibility for these benefits , were intended in part to “assure that aliens be self - reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.” while the laws' restrictions on noncitizen benefit eligibility directly work toward this goal , sponsor deeming and repayment efforts have not been as effective , in part because benefit administering agencies do not have the information and guidance they need to implement these provisions as intended . to obtain information on agency implementation of sponsor deeming and repayment , as well as the population affected , we reviewed available federal data on noncitizens , as well as available federal and state data on benefit applicants and recipients , to develop estimates of the sponsored noncitizen population and noncitizen applicants and recipients ; conducted a nationwide survey of states regarding temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , medicaid , and the supplemental nutritional assistance program ( snap ) ; visited five states and selected localities within each state and interviewed officials administering tanf , medicaid , and snap ; interviewed officials from all 10 regional offices of the social security administration ( ssa ) regarding relevant supplemental security income ( ssi ) policies , implementation processes and challenges , and the frequency that officials had encountered related cases ; interviewed officials from relevant federal agencies and reviewed pertinent federal laws , regulations , and agency guidance ; and interviewed researchers knowledgeable in immigrant and public benefit issues .
