since 2015 , dhs has issued eight such directives to address vulnerabilities impacting federal civilian agencies . the specific objectives of our review were to evaluate ( 1 ) dhs's process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of the binding operational directives , including agencies' implementation of the directive requirements . dhs plays a key role in the cybersecurity posture of the federal government and in the cybersecurity of systems that support the nation's critical infrastructures . federal civilian enterprise essential . these directives instruct agencies to , among other things: mitigate critical vulnerabilities discovered by dhs's nccic through its scanning of agencies' internet - accessible systems ; better secure their hvas by participating in risk and vulnerability assessments ( rva ) and security architecture reviews ( sar ) conducted on their assets ; and address several urgent vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices identified in a nccic analysis report . fisma requires that dhs develop and oversee the implementation of binding operational directives to safeguard federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat , vulnerability , or risk and to implement the policies , principles , standards , and guidelines developed by the director of omb , such as omb memoranda m - 19-03 and m - 19-02 . consistent with this requirement , dhs's draft process calls for cisa to coordinate with stakeholders , such as nist and gsa , early in the directive identification process to incorporate their input as a necessary part of executing the directive process . according to nist officials in the information technology laboratory / computer security division , which is responsible for working on directive issues , cisa coordinates with them to ensure that a new directive does not conflict with nist guidance , but does not do so early in the process . cisa officials acknowledged that , in the past , the agency mainly relied on an ad hoc approach to coordination and did not always coordinate early in the planning process with stakeholders , including nist and gsa , even though early coordination is called for in the current dhs process . nist officials also noted that dhs and nist have started regular coordination meetings to discuss directive - related issues earlier in the process . nevertheless , cisa has yet to determine when in the directives' development — for example , during early development and at directive approval — coordination with specific entities should occur . cisa has not validated agencies' actions on all five selected directives . the officials added that it is the agency's responsibility to manage its own plan of actions and milestones , including verifications , and that they are not able to independently validate all of the actions because of a lack of an automated mechanism to detect findings inside agency networks and the lack of resources to do manual assessments . however , cisa did not take a risk - based approach , and it also did not have a strategy in place to check selected agency - reported actions to validate their completion . for example , according to dhs and agency data , in response to the directive on critical vulnerability mitigation ( bod 15-01 ) , agencies were able to mitigate about 2,500 out of about 3,600 critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of detection . the five directives are discussed below and in more detail in appendix iv . while all covered agencies did not always meet the 30-day requirement , their mitigations were validated by dhs and reached 87 percent compliance by 2017 . officials attributed the recent decline in percentage mitigated to a 35-day partial government shutdown . while cisa did not independently validate agencies' actions in addressing the vulnerabilities as the devices were internal to the network , cisa reported that agencies secured over 11,000 network infrastructure devices across the federal civilian government ( see figure 2 ) . see figure 4 for details . however , dhs completed only about half of the required annual assessments this year ( with 73 assessments completed in fiscal year 2019 ) . specifically , while the directive states that agencies should address weaknesses within 30 days , the directive also states that if the senior accountable officer for risk management at the agency determines that a risk cannot be adequately addressed within 30 days , the agency must develop and submit a remediation plan to dhs for its review . to address the first and second challenges ( outdated systems and specialized expertise ) , in its march 2019 report to omb , dhs provided the following considerations for omb: ( 1 ) examine agency budgets to ensure agencies are deploying all available resources and capabilities against threats to government networks and data ; ( 2 ) provide supplemental funds to agencies to support implementation of current and future binding operational directives ; and ( 3 ) examine agency budgets to ensure agencies are deploying all available resources to obtain specialized training for staff or to hire specialized skill sets . however , it does not have a schedule or plan for completing this reassessment , or to address outstanding issues on completing required assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance to agencies and third parties . federal civilian agencies have made many significant improvements in cybersecurity by implementing the directives' requirements . further , dhs has only completed about half of the required assessments for fiscal year 2019 . given these shortcomings , dhs has been reassessing key aspects of the hva program .  ( recommendation 3 ) the secretary of homeland security should develop a schedule and plan for completing the high value asset program reassessment and addressing the outstanding issues on completing the required high value asset assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance for tier 2 and 3 hva systems .  ( recommendation 4 ) . we also reviewed dhs written requirements and process for overseeing how agencies are implementing the directives . bod 16-02 , threat to network infrastructure devices ( designated as closed by dhs , march 2019 ) , issued september 27 , 2016 bod 17-01 , removal of kaspersky - branded products , issued bod 18-01 , enhance email and web security , issued october 16 , bod 18-02 , securing high value assets , issued may 7 , 2018 we then randomly selected a sample of 12 agencies from the civilian executive branch agencies , to which dhs directives apply , to determine the extent to which these agencies have taken steps to address the directives' requirements . in addition , we reviewed the directives and other relevant requirements as well as dhs's process for evaluating agency actions to address the requirements and to develop binding operational directive - related performance metrics . we also reviewed dhs performance reports regarding the extent to which dhs's government - wide performance metrics for mitigation of vulnerabilities on internet - facing systems and for closure of certain vulnerabilities on high value assets align with agencies' existing requirements from omb and dhs , such as closure timelines of selected types of vulnerabilities and weaknesses . participating in a security architecture assessment for select high value assets , if requested to do so by dhs . at 90 calendar days after issuance of this directive , and unless directed otherwise by dhs based on new information , departments or agencies will begin to implement the agency plan of action and provide a status report to dhs on the progress of that implementation every 30 calendar days thereafter until full removal and discontinuance of use is achieved . sslv2 was released in 1995 . in 2014 , nist marked rc4 as “not approved” for use in federal information systems .
