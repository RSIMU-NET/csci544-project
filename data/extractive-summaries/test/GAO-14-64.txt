in accordance with its responsibilities set forth in law , the office of management and budget ( omb ) launched the federal information technology ( it ) dashboard in june 2009 as a public web site that reports performance and supporting data for major it investments — on which the federal government plans to invest over $38 billion in fiscal year 2014 . we analyzed both the processes used to address these investments and the results of performance reviews . it disagreed with our recommendation to improve how it reflects current performance in cost and schedule ratings , but more recently made changes to dashboard calculations to address this while also noting challenges in comprehensively evaluating cost and schedule data for these investments . we recommended that omb analyze agencies' investment risk over time as reflected in the dashboard's cio ratings and present its analysis with the president's annual budget submission , and that the department of defense ensure that its cio ratings reflect available investment performance assessments and its risk management guidance . as of august 2013 , cios at the eight selected agencies rated 198 of their 244 major investments listed on the dashboard as low risk or moderately low risk . historically , over the life of the dashboard from june 2009 to august 2013 , low or moderately low risk investments accounted for an average of 72 percent of all ratings at the eight agencies , medium risk ratings an average of 22 percent , and high risk or moderately high risk ratings an average of 6 percent . 5 ) . by gathering incomplete information on it investments , omb increases the risk of not fulfilling its oversight responsibilities , of agencies making inefficient and ineffective investment decisions , and of congress and the public being misinformed as to the performance of federal it investments . however , the investment remained rated on the dashboard as moderately low risk until november 2012 , when it was updated to medium risk . while agencies experienced several issues with reporting the risk of their investments , such as technical problems and delayed updates to the dashboard , the cio ratings were mostly or completely consistent with investment risk at seven of the eight selected agencies . of the eight investments receiving a red rating in 2012 , the agencies reviewed seven using tools such as techstat sessions,investment review boards , and other high - level reviews . each of these resulted in action items intended to improve performance . while we acknowledge that omb and federal agencies continue to have access to the dashboard during the budget process , the public display of these data is intended to allow other oversight bodies , including congress and the general public , to hold government agencies accountable for progress and results . specifically , commerce stated that although it is no longer reporting publicly on its satellite ground system investments through the dashboard , neither the department cio nor omb has relinquished its oversight role . our objectives for this engagement were to ( 1 ) characterize the chief information officer ( cio ) ratings for selected federal agencies' information technology ( it ) investments as reported on the dashboard over time , ( 2 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies' cio ratings are consistent with reported investment risk , and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies are addressing at - risk investments . to accomplish the second objective , we selected the top 10 major investments at each of the eight selected agencies ( for a total of 80 investments ) , with the highest reported it spending in fiscal year 2012 . investments which were consistent with underlying documentation for every month in 2012 were categorized as “consistent,” those which were inconsistent for 1 or more months were categorized as “partially inconsistent,” and those with inconsistencies in each month were “inconsistent.” because we were only evaluating the consistency of dashboard ratings with reported risk , we did not evaluate the accuracy of the investment documentation . we reviewed the processes used to address these investments and interviewed relevant officials .
