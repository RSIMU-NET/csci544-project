we also interviewed officials from the seven selected mtw agencies about their monitoring of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies' effects on tenants . for example , mtw agencies must include certain elements in their annual plans for each activity they propose to adopt , such as ( 1 ) a description of the activity and its anticipated effect in relation to the statutory objective under which the activity is proposed ; ( 2 ) the hud metrics that will be used to quantify the changes the agency anticipates as a result of the activity , including baseline performance level and yearly benchmarks ; and ( 3 ) the mtw authorizations that give the agency the flexibility to conduct the activity . the comment period closed on june 5 , 2017 . however , we found that hud's oversight — review of annual reports and compliance assessments — has not been timely and hud has not fully documented its process for assessing compliance , due to limited staffing and competing priorities . while the mtw office added staff to assist with the oversight of the current 39 mtw agencies , hud has not conducted workforce planning to address the resources needed for overseeing the 100 agencies to be added through the mtw demonstration expansion . hud has taken steps to improve mtw agencies' annual reporting . hud plans to continue to follow this oversight structure for the existing 39 agencies , but have field office staff assume more responsibilities for agencies that will join the mtw demonstration as a result of the expansion . mtw funding flexibilities may partly explain the differences , but limitations in hud data ( such as the inability to determine which funding source was used to fund which activity ) make it difficult to more fully understand the differences . mtw agencies accumulated relatively large reserves of voucher funding , but hud has performed limited oversight of reserves for these agencies . mtw agencies had higher median administrative , subsidy , and tenant services expenses than comparable non - mtw agencies . the observed differences in public housing occupancy and voucher unit utilization rates and program expenses between mtw and non - mtw agencies , which could affect the number of tenants served , may be a result of mtw agencies' ability to ( 1 ) combine their public housing and voucher funds and use them interchangeably and ( 2 ) use funds to implement policies that go beyond traditional forms of housing assistance . nontraditional activities . other factors related to expenses . hud officials said hud did not have the information technology resources needed to make this change in pic . however , hud has not developed and implemented a process to monitor mtw reserves . as a result , without a comprehensive framework — standard definitions , clear guidance on reporting requirements , and analysis plans — hud cannot provide assurance that it is adequately monitoring how mtw activities affect tenants . workforce planning . data collection . hud has performed limited oversight of mtw voucher reserves and its data and financial reporting systems are not structured to effectively track public housing reserves . improving oversight of the demonstration would help hud assess what mtw agencies have done , including their use of funding .  ( recommendation 8 ) the assistant secretary for pih should develop written guidance for existing mtw agencies that requires a hardship policy for public housing time limits and encourages an impact analysis , annual reevaluation , and hardship policy for work - requirement and time - limit policies for public housing and voucher programs as part of a framework for monitoring the effect of these policies on tenants .  ( recommendation 11 ) . in order to provide reasonable assurance that mtw agencies have sound plans for expanding their reserves , hud still would have to develop a process to monitor mtw agencies' reserves . hud generally agreed with our remaining eight recommendations . in addition , in commenting on the fourth recommendation , hud described plans to update its data system to capture information on households served through local , nontraditional mtw activities . our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) oversight of agencies participating in the moving to work ( mtw ) demonstration , including agency reporting and compliance with demonstration requirements ; ( 2 ) any association between mtw flexibilities and program outcomes , including public housing occupancy rates and voucher unit utilization rates ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which hud monitored effects of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies on tenants . finally , we interviewed representatives from tenant advocacy organizations . voucher tenant services expenses per household . the models had the form: i = 1 , … , n indexes agencies j = 2009 , … , 2015 indexes years mtwij indicates whether agency i participated in the mtw demonstration µij is the mean outcome , conditional on the covariates g is the gaussian link function year is a vector of indicators for each year from 2010 through 2015 ( excluding 2009 ) , which accounts for common period effects across agencies , γ xij is a vector of linear continuous ( e.g. , number of households ) and categorical ( e.g. , hud region ) control variables that may confound the association between agency type and the outcome of interest ( discussed above for the matched sample ) β is the parameter of interest , estimating the association between mtw repeated observations from 2009 through 2015 for mtw agencies and their corresponding matched non - mtw agencies can introduce autocorrelation within these clusters of observations , and the differences across matched clusters can introduce heteroscedasticity ( that is , the variance in one cluster of agencies may be not be consistent with the variance in another cluster ) .
