our objectives for this review were to: ( 1 ) describe what actions cms has taken , if any , to assist states that have chosen to transition to a marketplace it platform different from the one they originally used and identify the costs and challenges for states in making this transition ; ( 2 ) assess what actions cms has taken to assist selected states' plans to ensure that the development and operations of marketplace it systems can be financially self - sustained ; and ( 3 ) assess the steps that cms has taken to monitor the performance of the states' marketplace it systems . the selection resulted in two states using state - based marketplaces ( minnesota and new york ) and two states that had transitioned from state - based marketplaces to using the federal platform ( hawaii and oregon ) . federally facilitated marketplaces . implementation . cms relies on these offices to , among other things , perform the following reviews: establishment reviews . cms is to conduct establishment reviews of states that receive federal marketplace grant and medicaid funds , following the enterprise life cycle framework . as of march 2016 , minnesota had enrolled approximately 84,000 individuals in qualified health plans . further , we noted that cms had not provided adequate oversight of the healthcare.gov initiative through its office of the chief information officer . cms also issued a regulation to all states that included requirements regarding states' transition plans and their coordination with cms and hhs ; however , this regulation was not finalized until after hawaii and oregon had initiated their transition efforts . further , the two states encountered challenges during their transitions . these challenges were related to accelerated transition time frames , difficulties reassigning functional marketplace responsibilities , delays in receiving approvals and decisions needed from cms , and trouble accessing historical consumer data in previous marketplace it systems developed by vendors . delays in communications with cms . the cms officials also stated that they had continued to refine their operational processes and policy associated with transitioning to the federal platform , as well as provide guidance and regulatory requirements for states that transitioned their marketplaces to other models , with particular focus on those that transitioned to the federal platform . while cms took steps to collect and review marketplace financial audit reports , it did not ensure that the four selected states always provided audit reports or that the reports were complete . cms assisted selected states with their effort to financially sustain the development and operations of their marketplaces ( including supporting it systems ) by reviewing sustainability plans ; reviewing annual independent financial audit reports ; and conducting sustainability risk assessments . however , cms did not provide consistent oversight of the four selected states' programs because the agency did not take steps to collect complete sustainability plans or financial audit reports from all of these selected states . as a result , cms has been limited in its ability to determine whether state marketplace it systems are performing efficiently and effectively and to provide early warning of potential problems for the overall state marketplace it systems' service delivery to consumers .  ( recommendation 6 ) . hhs did not specifically identify which aspects of our recommendation it concurred with and did not concur with ; however , the department stated that , while it requests performance measures from the state marketplaces , once the marketplaces are operational , states are responsible for monitoring their own performance measures . until new york's marketplace has documented these goals in a performance measurement plan with clear ties to its metrics , cms may not have visibility into new york's marketplace performance metrics which state officials said guide their decision making and operations , or be able to ascertain that the state continuously assessed and adjusted performance metrics and targets as appropriate . our objectives were to: ( 1 ) describe what actions the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) has taken , if any , to assist states that have chosen to transition to a marketplace it platform different from the one they originally used and identify the costs and challenges for states in making this transition ; ( 2 ) assess what actions cms has taken to assist selected states' plans to ensure that the development and operations of marketplace it systems can be financially self - sustained ; and ( 3 ) assess the steps that cms has taken to monitor the performance of the states' marketplace it systems .
