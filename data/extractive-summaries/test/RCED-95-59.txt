it focuses on the quality of small businesses' research proposals for technological innovation , the implementation of a provision for technical assistance by agencies participating in the program , and duplicate funding of similar research by more than one agency . although it is too early to make a conclusive judgment about the effect of funding increases on the quality of sbir research proposals that received awards , the high level of competition and the large numbers of worthy but unfunded projects suggest that quality research proposals kept pace with the program's initial expansion . although it is somewhat early to draw conclusions because the major funding increases will not occur until fiscal years 1995 and 1997 , several factors suggest that quality research proposals have kept pace with the sbir program's initial expansion . none of the five major agencies have implemented the 1992 discretionary technical assistance provision , and future implementation remains uncertain . however , some sbir officials have taken steps , independent of the provision , to provide assistance with commercialization of research conducted by sbir companies . duplicate funding of similar proposals submitted to more than one agency has become a problem . several factors have contributed to this concern: ( 1 ) the fraudulent evasion of the proposal certification procedure , whereby companies fail to identify identical proposals to other agencies ; ( 2 ) the vagueness of key terms such as “similar research” and the difficulty of defining them more effectively , the result of which is that there can be disagreement about what constitutes duplicate research ; and ( 3 ) the lack of interagency access to and exchange of current information about recent awards .
