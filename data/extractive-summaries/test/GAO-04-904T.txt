our report addressed the following questions: what federal funds have been allocated to local jurisdictions in ncr for emergency preparedness , for what specific purposes , and from what sources ? . what challenges exist within ncr to organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs ? . specifically , oncrc was mandated to coordinate the activities of dhs relating to ncr , including cooperating with the dhs' office for state and local government coordination ; coordinate with federal agencies in the ncr on terrorism preparedness to ensure adequate planning , information sharing , training , and execution of the federal role in domestic preparedness activities ; coordinate with federal , state , and regional agencies and the private sector in ncr on terrorism preparedness to ensure adequate planning , information sharing , training , and execution of domestic preparedness activities among these agencies and entities ; serve as a liaison between the federal government and state , local , and regional authorities , and private sector entities in ncr to facilitate access to federal grants and other programs . the urban area security initiative funds were designated for regional use , and a plan has been developed for using the funds to benefit the region as a whole . without national standards , guidance on likely threats and scenerios for which to be prepared , coordinated plans , and reliable data , it is difficult for us or oncrc to determine what gaps , if any , remain in the emergency response capacities and preparedness within ncr . however , as already noted , it is not clear how the urban area security initiative spending plan links to the actual and planned uses for the other funding sources that comprised about $279.5 million of the $340 million in federal homeland security grants to the ncr during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 . however , there is no consistent method for identifying these gaps among jurisdictions within ncr . we recognize that ncr is a complex multijurisdictional area comprising the district of columbia and surrounding county and city jurisdictions in maryland and virginia . our report contains several recommendations . to help ensure that emergency preparedness grants and associated funds are managed in a way that maximizes their effectiveness , we recommend that the secretary of the department of homeland security take the following three actions to fulfill dhs's statutory responsibilities in ncr: work with ncr jurisdictions to develop a coordinated strategic plan to establish goals and priorities for enhancing first responder capacities that can be used to guide the use of federal emergency preparedness funds .
