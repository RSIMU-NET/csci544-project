under the b61 lep , nnsa and the air force — the armed service responsible for air - delivered weapons such as the b61 — plan to consolidate four of the five versions of the b61 bomb ( b61 legacy bombs ) , each of which was designed to fulfill specific military requirements , into a single weapon known as the b61-12 , which will be equipped with a new tail kit guidance assembly that will enable it to meet all military requirements . nnsa agreed with our recommendation and has taken steps toward improvement in this area , which we continue to monitor . these documents included project plans , schedules , management plans , and selected acquisition reports . in addition , we visited nnsa's sandia national laboratories and los alamos national laboratory , the two laboratories that serve as design agencies for the lep , to view systems that track project activities , cost and schedule information , and the execution of risk management steps , as well as to meet program officials responsible for the design and production of the b61-12 and see some of the components under development . earned value management is a project management tool developed by dod in the 1960s to help managers monitor project risks . earned value management's intended purpose is to integrate a project's cost , schedule , and technical efforts for management and provide reliable data to decision makers . several officials from both nnsa and dod characterized the b61-12 lep's overall program management approach as improved over the approaches used in previous leps . an earned value management system . according to nnsa and dod officials we interviewed , the b61-12 lep is the first lep to use earned value management , a tool that may help nnsa ensure that its work progresses on budget and on schedule . integrated cost estimates . specifically , in august 2014 , nnsa issued its defense programs program execution guide ( program execution guide ) regarding program management practices in nnsa defense programs , including leps . the new management approach that the b61-12 lep's program managers have implemented , along with the new program execution guide , may help nnsa address the potential management challenges that nnsa officials and others have identified with previous leps , but it is too soon to determine whether this will be the case . nnsa estimates that avoiding this risk prevented a program delay that could have lasted for more than a year and increased program costs by more than $2 million . joint risks in the “red” category ( i.e. , high risk ) include risks related to the compatibility of the b61-12 with the still - developing f - 35 aircraft , the risk of temperature - related component failures in certain flight environments , and schedule risks related to the hydrodynamic testing of certain changed nonnuclear components . nnsa and dod officials acknowledged the schedule's constraints , which they say are driven by factors including delays in starting the b61-12 lep because of a lengthy design study , the effects of sequestration , and the need to complete work on the b61-12 lep to enable nnsa to start work on planned future leps . in testimony given to the strategic forces subcommittee of the senate committee on armed services in march 2015 , the nuclear weapons council characterized the b61-12 lep's schedule as having “little , if any , margin left.” dod officials have testified before congress that the b61-12 lep must be completed on the current schedule to ensure that the aging of b61 legacy bombs does not affect the united states' ability to maintain its commitments to nato , and doe officials have testified that the lep must be completed to ensure that doe can effectively manage other ongoing and planned leps and stockpile stewardship activities . given nnsa's past problems in executing leps , and a schedule with little room for delays , nnsa and air force may face challenges in the future in ensuring that risks are not realized and do not affect the program's schedule , its cost , or the performance of the b61-12 . we are not making new recommendations in this report . we provided a draft of this report to doe and dod for review and comment . both agencies provided technical comments that we incorporated , as appropriate . this report assesses ( 1 ) the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration's ( nnsa ) management approach for the b61-12 life extension program ( lep ) and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep .
