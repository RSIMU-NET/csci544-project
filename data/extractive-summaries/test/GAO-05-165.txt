as requested , this report discusses the views of nationally recognized experts on key issues concerning wastewater security , including the potential vulnerabilities of wastewater systems ; activities that most warrant federal support to mitigate the risk of terrorism ; and the criteria that the experts believe should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated among recipients to improve their security and the methods the experts suggest should be used to distribute these funds . wastewater systems in the united states provide essential services to residential , commercial , and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters . a terrorist could seek to impair a wastewater system's treatment process , to use a wastewater system to carry out an attack elsewhere , or some combination of both . these vulnerabilities include ( 1 ) a general lack of security awareness within the wastewater sector ; ( 2 ) interdependencies among components of the wastewater system , opening the possibility that a failure of any individual component could bring down the entire system ; and ( 3 ) interdependencies between the wastewater system and other critical infrastructure that could fail , such as electric power supplies . these explosions may also damage natural gas or electric lines often co - located with sewers . third , experts identified interdependencies between wastewater systems and other critical infrastructures . experts most frequently identified 11 specific activities to improve wastewater security as deserving high priority for federal support ( see fig . improving local , state , and regional collaboration efforts . the remaining eight activities experts frequently rated as warranting high or highest priority for federal funding include ( 1 ) providing training to utility employees related to conducting vulnerability assessments and improving the security culture among employees ; ( 2 ) improving national communication efforts between utilities and key entities responsible for homeland security ; ( 3 ) installing early warning systems in collection systems to monitor for or detect sabotage ; ( 4 ) hardening physical assets of treatment plants and collection systems ; ( 5 ) strengthening operations and personnel procedures ; ( 6 ) increasing research and development efforts toward improving threat detection , assessment , and response capabilities ; ( 7 ) developing voluntary wastewater security standards and guidance documents ; and ( 8 ) strengthening cyber security and supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems . over half of the experts surveyed ( 29 of 50 ) rated the replacement of gaseous chemicals at wastewater treatment facilities with less hazardous alternatives as warranting highest priority for federal funding . the most frequently identified were utilities: ( 1 ) serving critical infrastructure including government , commercial , industrial , and public health centers ; ( 2 ) using large quantities of gaseous chemicals ; ( 3 ) serving areas with large populations ; ( 4 ) where a security breach would adversely impact environmental resources ( e.g. , receiving waters ) ; ( 5 ) having completed vulnerability assessments ; ( 6 ) serving areas with medium or small populations ; and ( 7 ) serving buildings , monuments , parks , tourist attractions or other entities that have symbolic value ( see fig . more than three quarters of the experts ( 39 of 50 ) gave utilities serving critical infrastructure a highest priority rating . other mechanisms that were rated as less effective included loans , or loan guarantees , and tax incentives for private utilities . many , for example , favored direct grants with no match for activities that benefit multiple utilities , or which should be addressed in the near term . thirty of the 50 experts indicated that grants with a matching requirement ( cost - shared grants ) would be very effective as a mechanism for providing funds to wastewater utilities . a number of experts , however , expressed reservations .
