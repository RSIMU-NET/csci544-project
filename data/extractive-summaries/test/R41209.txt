on march 31 , 2010 , the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) in the office of management and budget ( omb ) issued a proposed policy letter on inherently governmental functions and other "work reserved for performance by federal government employees. . while not final , the policy letter represents the obama administration's proposed guidance for agencies determining ( 1 ) whether particular functions are inherently governmental and ( 2 ) when functions closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions and critical functions should be performed by government personnel . the proposed policy letter was , in part , issued under the authority of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fy2009 ( ndaa'09 ) and president obama's memorandum of march 4 , 2009 , on government contracting . section 321 of ndaa'09 tasked omb with ( 1 ) reviewing existing definitions of "inherently governmental function" to determine whether such definitions are "sufficiently focused" to ensure that only government personnel perform inherently governmental functions or "other critical functions necessary for the mission of a federal department or agency ; " ( 2 ) developing a "single consistent definition" of "inherently governmental function" that would address any deficiencies in the existing definitions , reasonably apply to all agencies , and ensure that agency personnel can identify positions that perform inherently governmental functions ; ( 3 ) developing criteria for identifying "critical functions" that should be performed by government personnel ; and ( 4 ) developing criteria for identifying positions that government personnel should perform in order to ensure that agencies develop and maintain "sufficient organic expertise and technical capacity" to perform their missions and oversee contractors' work . president obama's march 4 , 2009 , memorandum similarly charged omb with clarifying when outsourcing is "appropriate. . the office of federal procurement policy has reportedly indicated that a final policy letter will be released "in early 2011. . 111-8 , p.l . 111-84 , p.l . 111-117 ) . agencies are also required by law to give "special consideration" to using federal employees to perform functions closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions . however , they are not prohibited from contracting out such functions . although it is not final , the policy letter raises several legal and policy issues of potential interest to congress , given recently enacted and proposed legislation regarding inherently governmental functions and other limitations upon contracting out ( e.g. , p.l . key among these issues are ( 1 ) the relationship between the proposed policy letter and other executive branch authorities on inherently governmental and related functions ; ( 2 ) whether the proposed policy letter would necessarily result in changes in agencies' use of contractors to perform certain functions that some members of congress and commentators claim are inherently governmental ( e.g. , security services during contingency operations ) ; and ( 3 ) the potential demands of any new requirements upon the acquisition workforce . similarly , while the proposed policy letter adopts the definition of "inherently governmental function" used in the fair act , neither it nor the notice accompanying it addresses whether or how the obama administration would change the definitions in the far , omb circular a - 76 , and other executive branch regulations and policy documents to ensure that there is a "single consistent definition" of inherently governmental functions . while the concept of sovereignty is arguably implicit in the fair act's listing of the types of functions included within the definition of "inherently governmental function" and in the case law regarding inherently governmental functions , the fair act's discussion of inherently governmental functions arguably focuses more upon the exercise of discretion , which is the focus of the second of the proposed policy letter's tests for identifying inherently governmental functions .
