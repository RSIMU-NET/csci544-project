climate change is viewed as a global issue , but proposed responses generally require action at the national level . in 1992 , the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases . over the past 16 years , a variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states , including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions , improved appliance efficiency , and incentives for developing renewable energy sources . this focus was particularly evident in the administration's 2006 climate action report ( car ) submitted under the provisions of the unfccc . of the roughly 50 programs summarized in the 2006 car , only seven were described as "regulatory. . in its 2007 decision in massachusetts v. epa , the supreme court found that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the clean air act . further , in june 2008 , the senate considered legislation ( s. 3036 ) to enact an economy - wide cap - and - trade system to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions . however , a cloture motion on this bill failed , and the bill was ultimately tabled . this report provides background on the evolution of u.s. climate change policy from ratification of the unfccc to the george w. bush administration's rejection of the kyoto protocol programs , to the present . current major regulatory programs that monitor or reduce greenhouse gas emissions are identified , along with their estimated effect on greenhouse gas emissions . regulatory measures that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions are a small subset of the total u.s. effort numerically , but are responsible for a proportionally larger share of greenhouse gas emission reductions . in general , these regulatory programs were established and implemented primarily for reasons other than climate change concerns . 109-58 ) , with provisions directly and indirectly related to greenhouse gas emissions . also not included in p.l . 110-140 ) . in addition to the above programs , eisa also requires the establishment of an office of climate change and environment in the department of transportation . this office will plan , coordinate , and implement research at dot on reducing transportation - related energy use , mitigating the causes of climate change , and addressing the impacts of climate change on transportation . as indicated below ( table 2 ) , energy - related activities are responsible for about 86% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions , and 98% of its carbon dioxide emissions . climate change — as a specific issue needing a regulatory response — was debated during deliberations on the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ) and recognized in passage of senate amendment 866 expressing the sense of the senate that congress should enact a comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory , market - based limits and incentives on greenhouse gases that slow , stop , and reverse the growth of such emissions . the energy independence and security act ( eisa ) of 2007 directly addresses some climate change issues , but still generally focuses on energy supply and consumption . while some provisions in energy laws enacted over the past 16 years have led to lower greenhouse gas emissions or addressed climate change directly , other provisions in those same laws have almost certainly resulted in higher emissions . to date , no energy law has had reducing greenhouse gas emissions as the main organizing principle . comprehensive climate change policy directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions should address energy supply and consumption and , thus , be integrated with energy policy . this will be a pivotal challenge to the 111 th congress's and the incoming administration's anticipated efforts to enact legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
