to support its demanding financial and mission - related responsibilities , the commission relies extensively on computerized systems . it also provides the necessary security services to support these applications . sec has corrected or mitigated 18 of the 34 security control weaknesses that we had reported as unresolved at the time of our prior audit report in 2008 . for example , it has adequately validated electronic certificates from connections to its physically secured the perimeter of the operations center , monitored unusual and suspicious activities at its operations center , and removed network system accounts and data center access rights from separating employees . while sec has made important progress in strengthening its information security controls , it has not completed actions to correct or mitigate 16 of the previously reported weaknesses . in addition to the 16 previously reported weakness that remain uncorrected , we identified 23 new weaknesses in controls intended to restrict access to data and systems , as well as weaknesses in other information security controls , that continue to jeopardize the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of sec's financial and sensitive information and information systems . for example , sec did not always remove excessive user privileges on its financial systems , properly document or maintain approval of user access privileges to the restrict unnecessary remote access to database servers , and limit users' privileges so that users do not monopolize database system resources during critical times of the day . a basic element of cryptography is encryption . sec did not adequately configure several database systems to enable auditing and monitoring of security - relevant events . although sec has strengthened its physical security controls , certain weaknesses reduced its effectiveness in protecting and controlling physical access to sensitive work areas . sec did not adequately segregate incompatible computer - related duties and functions . for example , sec has provided individuals with training for incident handling and developed , documented , and implemented a policy on remedial action plans to ensure that deficiencies are mitigated in an effective and timely manner . however , a key reason for the information security weaknesses is that it has not effectively or fully implemented key program activities . until all key elements of its information security program are fully and consistently implemented , sec will not have sufficient assurance that new weaknesses will not emerge and that financial information and financial assets are adequately safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , fraudulent use , improper disclosure , or destruction . according to an sec official , a vacancy announcement has not yet been posted for this position . sec has made progress in correcting or mitigating previously reported weaknesses . to assist the commission in improving the implementation of its agencywide information security program , we recommend that the sec chairman direct the cio to take the following four actions: designate a senior agency information security officer who will be responsible for managing sec's information security program , provide full information for management oversight of information security conduct comprehensive periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of security controls for the general support system and key financial applications , and certify and accredit subsystems that support the production of sec's financial statements . using the requirements identified by the federal information security management act ( fisma ) , the office of management and budget ( omb ) , and nist , we evaluated sec's implementation of its security program by reviewing sec's risk assessment process and risk assessments for three key systems that support the preparation of financial statements to determine whether risks and threats were documented consistent with federal guidance ; analyzing sec's policies , procedures , practices , and standards to determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel responsible for securing information and information systems ; analyzing security plans to determine if management , operational , and technical controls were in place or planned and that security plans were updated ; examining training records for personnel with significant security responsibilities to determine if they received training commensurate with those responsibilities ; analyzing security testing and evaluation results for three key systems to determine whether management , operational , and technical controls were tested at least annually and based on risk ; examining remedial action plans to determine whether they addressed vulnerabilities identified in security testing and evaluations ; and examining contingency plans for three key systems to determine whether those plans had been tested or updated .
