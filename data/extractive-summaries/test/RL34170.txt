the republic of yemen remains a country of concern to u.s. policy makers . yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , an affiliate of al qaeda ( aq ) . issues such as terrorism and yemen's political stability are tied to broader questions regarding the country's long - term economic and environmental viability . hopes for progress and stability arising from yemen's 2011-2012 political transition have been eroding throughout 2014 and early 2015 . before that , the obama administration and other observers considered yemen to be one of the few relative arab spring "success stories" ; the government had new leadership ( president hadi ) and had managed to bring all the nation's political factions together under the rubric of the national dialogue conference ( ndc ) in an attempt to reach consensus on governance . their campaign has continued , culminating in the summer 2014 takeover of the capital sana'a and other parts of yemen . according to u.s. officials , aqap , a u.s. - designated foreign terrorist organization ( designated in 2010 ) operating in yemen , remains the al qaeda affiliate "most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the united states. . to date , there is public information on three aqap attempted attacks or disrupted plots against the united states homeland , including: a failed bomb attack against northwest airlines flight 253 on christmas day 2009 ; a failed attempt ( disrupted by saudi intelligence ) to ship explosive parcel packages to jewish sites in chicago in october 2010 ; and a disrupted bomb plot ( disclosed in may 2012 ) , in which aqap provided a concealed explosive device to a saudi double agent who subsequently turned the device over to authorities . internal turmoil diverts yemeni government attention and resources , thereby reducing both its will and capacity to counter transnational terrorism . in general , it is uncertain what kind of impact u.s. sanctions will have in deterring individuals from disrupting yemen's transition . the state department reports that the united states committed more than $142 million in assistance to yemen in fy2014 , in addition to $256 million in fy2013 and more than $356 million in fy2012 . the defense department's 1206 "train and equip" fund has become the major source of overt u.s. military aid to yemen . 113-76 , the fy2014 omnibus appropriations act , states that "none of the funds appropriated by this act for assistance for yemen may be made available for the armed forces of yemen if such forces are controlled by a foreign terrorist organization , as designated pursuant to section 219 of the immigration and nationality act. . the president may waive this restriction and has done so in the case of yemen , most recently for fy2015 . the obama administration has waived these restrictions , stating that continued assistance is in the u.s. national interest . during saleh's presidency , u.s. - yemeni relations were constantly strained by a lack of strong military - to - military ties and commercial relations , general yemeni disapproval of u.s. policy in the middle east , and u.s. distrust of yemen's commitment to fighting terrorism . during the early years of the george w. bush administration , bilateral relations improved under the rubric of the war against al qaeda , although yemen's lax policy toward suspected terrorists and u.s. concerns about corruption and governance led to limits on u.s. support . yemen's tenuous transition on november 23 , 2011 , after 11 months of protests and violence that claimed over 2,000 lives , saleh signed on to a u.s. - backed , gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) - brokered transition plan . after a 90-day transition period , yemen held a presidential "election" in february 2012 with one consensus candidate on the ballot â€” former vice president abed rabbo mansour al hadi .
