from 1987 through 2003 , the united states provided more than $2 billion in economic assistance to the federated states of micronesia ( fsm ) and the rmi under a compact of free association ; approximately $579 million of this economic assistance went to the rmi . in 2003 , the u.s. government approved an amended compact with the rmi that provides an additional 20 years of assistance , totaling about $1.5 billion from 2004 through 2023 . the amended compact with the rmi identifies the additional 20 years of grant assistance as intended to assist the rmi government in its efforts to promote the economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance of its people . the amended compact also contains several new funding and accountability provisions that strengthen reporting and bilateral interaction . these provisions include requiring the establishment of a joint economic management committee and a trust fund committee to , respectively , among other things , review the rmi's progress toward compact objectives and to assess the trust fund's effectiveness in contributing to the country's long - term economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance . in 2003 , we testified that these provisions could improve accountability over assistance but that successful implementation will require appropriate resources and sustained commitment from both the united states and the rmi . today , drawing on several reports that we have published since 2005 , i will discuss the rmi's economic prospects , implementation of its amended compact to meet long - term goals , and potential trust fund earnings . the amended compacts and their subsidiary agreements , along with the countries' development plans , target the grant assistance to six sectors — education , health , public infrastructure , the environment , public sector capacity building , and private sector development — prioritizing two sectors , education and health . in addition , the rmi has not enacted economic policy reforms needed to improve its growth prospects . the rmi's government budget is characterized by limited tax revenue paired with growing government payrolls . the rmi development plan identifies fishing and tourism as key potential private sector growth industries . the rmi has allocated funds to priority sectors , although several factors have hindered its use of the funds to meet long - term development needs . further , despite actions taken to effectively implement compact grants , administrative challenges have limited its ability to ensure use of the grants for its long - term goals . in addition , although oia has monitored early compact activities , it has also faced capacity constraints . data deficiencies . staff and skill limitations have constrained the rmi's ability to provide day - to - day monitoring of sector grant operations . although the rmi has supplemented its trust fund balance with additional contributions , other sources of income are uncertain or entail risks . as of june 2007 , the rmi trust fund committee had not appointed an independent auditor or a money manager to invest the fund according to the proposed investment strategy . largely dependent on government spending of foreign aid , the rmi has limited potential for private sector growth , and its government has made little progress in implementing reforms needed to increase investment opportunities and tax income . our prior reports on the amended compacts include recommendations that the secretary of the interior direct the deputy assistant secretary for insular affairs , as chair of the rmi management and trust fund committees , to , among other things , ensure that jemfac address the lack of rmi progress in implementing reforms to increase investment and tax income ; coordinate with other u.s. agencies on jemfac to work with the the rmi to establish plans to minimize the impact of declining assistance ; coordinate with other u.s. agencies on jemfac to work with the rmi to fully develop a reliable mechanism for measuring progress toward compact goals ; and ensure the rmi trust fund committee's assessment and timely reporting of the fund's likely status as a source of revenue after 2023 . the grant amounts do not include the annual audit grant , capped at $500,000 , that will be provided to both countries . market volatility and choice of investment strategy could result in the rmi trust fund's inability to disburse the maximum level of income allowed in the trust fund agreement , or any income , in some years .
