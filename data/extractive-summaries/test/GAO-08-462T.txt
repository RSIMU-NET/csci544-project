with about $546 billion in discretionary budget authority provided thus far in fiscal year 2008 , along with total reported obligations of about $492 billion to support ongoing operations and activities related to the global war on terrorism since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks through september 2007 , the department has been given stewardship of unprecedented amounts of taxpayer money . my testimony today will provide perspectives on the progress dod has made and the challenges it faces in its approaches to overall business transformation , business systems modernization , and financial management capabilities improvements . of the 15 high - risk areas , the 8 dod - specific high - risk areas cut across all of dod's major business areas . dod's pervasive business systems and related financial management deficiencies adversely affect its ability to assess resource requirements ; control costs ; ensure basic accountability ; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget ; measure performance ; maintain funds control ; prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse ; and address pressing management issues . dod's senior leadership has shown commitment to transforming the department's business operations , and dod has taken a number of positive steps to begin this effort . as we have testified and reported for years , a successful , integrated , departmentwide approach to addressing dod's overall business transformation requires two critical elements: a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide plan and an individual capable of providing full - time focus and sustained leadership both within and across administrations , dedicated solely to the integration and execution of the overall business transformation effort . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 requires the secretary of defense , acting through the cmo , to develop a strategic management plan to include detailed descriptions of such things as performance goals and measures for improving and evaluating the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the business operations of the department , key initiatives to achieve these performance goals , procedures to monitor progress , procedures to review and approve plans and budgets for changes in business operations , and procedures to oversee the development , review , and approval of all budget requests for defense business systems . now that this legislation has been enacted , it will be important for dod to define the specific roles and responsibilities for the cmo , deputy cmo , and the service cmos ; ensure clearly delineated reporting relationships among them and other department and service officials ; foster good executive - level working relationships for maximum effectiveness ; establish appropriate integration and transformation structures and processes ; promote individual accountability and performance ; and provide for continuity . as such , we believe the cmo position should be codified as a separate position from the deputy secretary of defense in order to provide full - time attention to business transformation and subject to an extended term appointment . we designated dod's business systems modernization program as high risk in 1995 . the department has established and has begun to implement legislatively directed corporate investment review structures and processes needed to effectively manage its business system investments , but it has yet to do so in a manner that is fully consistent with relevant guidance , both at a corporate and component level . accordingly , we made recommendations aimed at improving the department's ability to better manage the billions of dollars it invests annually in its business systems and dod largely agreed with these recommendations but added that while it intends to improve departmental policies and procedures for business system investments , each component is responsible for developing and executing investment management policies and procedures needed to manage the business systems under its tier of responsibility . given the department's dependency on the efforts of its components to address dod's financial management weaknesses , it is imperative that dod ensure the sufficiency and reliability of ( 1 ) corrective actions taken by dod components to support management attestations as to the reliability of reported financial information ; ( 2 ) activities taken by dod components and other initiatives to ensure that corrective actions are directed at supporting improved financial visibility capabilities , beyond providing information primarily for financial statement reporting , and are sustained until a financial statement audit can be performed ; and ( 3 ) accomplishments and progress reported by dod components and initiatives . in fiscal year 2007 , dod introduced key refinements to its strategy for achieving financial statement auditability . the purpose of these planned assessments is to identify auditability risks that , if not mitigated during the development of the system , may impede the component's ability to achieve clean audit opinions on its financial statements . defense business transformation: a full - time chief management officer with a term appointment is needed at dod to maintain continuity of effort and achieve sustainable success . enterprise architecture: leadership remains key to establishing and leveraging architectures for organizational transformation . information technology investment management: a framework for assessing and improving process maturity .
