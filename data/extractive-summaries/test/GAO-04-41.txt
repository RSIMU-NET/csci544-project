in its most recent estimates of selected health consequences of cigarette smoking , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that , on average , over 440,000 deaths and $76 billion in medical expenditures were attributable to cigarette smoking each year from 1995 through 1999 . reducing the number of tobacco - related deaths , along with the associated costs , represents a significant public health challenge for the federal government . the first surgeon general's report to the congress that specifically focused on tobacco use among youth concluded that preventing youth from starting to use tobacco is key to reducing the deaths and incidence of disease attributable to tobacco use . most adults who use tobacco started using it between the ages of 10 and 18 . according to the report , if children and adolescents can be encouraged to abstain from using tobacco before they become adults , they are less likely to use tobacco for the rest of their lives . we focused our review on describing ( 1 ) programs , research , and activities that aim to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth , ( 2 ) the efforts of federal departments and agencies to monitor their programs , and ( 3 ) the coordination among federal departments and agencies in their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth . other programs and activities administered by hhs , dod , doj , education , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) address tobacco use as part of a broader focus on unhealthy behaviors , such as substance abuse and violence . the first , cdc's ntcp , focuses on preventing and reducing tobacco use among the general population , but it also explicitly targets tobacco use among youth . for instance , cdc recommends that states establish comprehensive tobacco control programs that include certain components , such as community - based programs to reduce tobacco use that include a wide range of prevention activities , such as engaging youth in developing and implementing tobacco control interventions , conducting educational programs for young people , parents , school personnel , and others , and restricting access to tobacco products ; school programs to implement school health policies that consist of tobacco - free policies , evidence - based curricula , teacher training , parental involvement , cessation services , and links between school and other community efforts and state media and educational campaigns ; marketing campaigns to counter protobacco influences and increase prohealth messages and influences , including paid television , radio , billboard , and print media campaigns ; cessation services to help people quit smoking ; enforcement of tobacco control policies by restricting minors' access to tobacco and restricting smoking in public places ; and statewide efforts to provide localities with technical assistance on how to evaluate tobacco programs , promote media advocacy , implement smoke - free policies , and reduce minors' access to tobacco . the second federal program that focuses only on tobacco and aims to prevent tobacco use among youth is samhsa's program to oversee state implementation of legislation commonly referred to as the synar amendment . to monitor federal programs that aim to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth , federal departments and agencies collect information on how their programs are being implemented by grantees and the effectiveness of grantees' efforts in meeting national program goals . cdc obtains this information through various sources , such as states' applications for ntcp funding , state progress reports , periodic site visits , surveys , and program evaluations conducted by various states . they obtain this information by various means , such as periodic reports and visits to grantee sites . hhs agencies also coordinate on efforts to jointly support research on tobacco use prevention and cessation . hhs and education provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate . in written comments , hhs stated that the report was very informative and provided a thorough overview of nicotine and tobacco activities related to youth , but did not include programs within cms that are a substantial element of hhs tobacco prevention . hhs also noted that the report did not include information about the challenges other federal agencies experienced in coordinating tobacco - related issues . however , these officials did not cite any challenges they had experienced with coordinating their tobacco - related efforts . to do our work , we obtained and reviewed program documents , strategic and performance plans , pertinent program reports and special studies , surveillance and other data , and federal web sites from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) including the office of the secretary , the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation , office of public health and science , agency for healthcare research and quality , centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , centers for medicare & medicaid services , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , indian health service , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) ; the departments of defense ( dod ) , justice ( doj ) , and education ; the environmental protection agency ; the federal trade commission ; and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) .
