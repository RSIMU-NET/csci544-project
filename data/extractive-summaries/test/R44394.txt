there are several ways to measure traffic safety: the number of highway fatalities ; the number of serious injuries from crashes ; the economic loss to people involved in crashes ; and the social cost of emergency response and accident - induced traffic delays . similar measures can reveal trends for narrower categories such as vehicle occupants and bicyclists . the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled ( vmt ) is the most commonly cited measure of traffic safety , due in part to the seriousness of that outcome and in part to the fact that fatalities are closely tracked and unambiguous . in contrast , crashes involving injuries or property damage may be reported inconsistently by local public safety agencies or may not come to the attention of authorities ; reported data on the numbers of serious crashes and of crashes involving injuries are estimated based on sampling . as figure 1 indicates , the fatality rate has improved significantly since the passage of the first federal highway safety legislation in 1966 . although the fatality rate from motor vehicle crashes has fallen to a record low , other measures indicate that improvement in traffic safety has stalled . the rate of crashes resulting in serious injuries was significantly higher in 2013 than in 2008 , and the overall crash rate has been rising ( figure 2 ) . however , some of the change in accident and fatality rates over the past several decades is attributable to factors beyond the scope of federal highway safety policies . although u.s. highway safety statistics have steadily improved , there is room for further improvement . since 2010 the reductions in u.s. fatality and injury rates have stalled , and preliminary estimates indicate that traffic deaths increased by 9% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 , while vmt increased by less than 3% . there are several policy actions congress could consider that are recommended by safety advocates as being relatively low - cost but effective interventions . as noted above , the incentive grant program congress created in 2005 to encourage states to adopt mandatory belt use laws with primary enforcement was judged to have reached its ceiling by 2012 , with 34 states and the district of columbia having adopted such laws for front - seat passengers , and 17 states and the district of columbia having adopted such laws for all vehicle occupants ( front and rear seats ) . in a further disincentive to the use of automated enforcement , congress required states in which automated enforcement systems are in operation to use some of their federal safety funding to conduct a biennial survey of those systems . since driver error plays a major role in traffic crashes , the prospect of reducing the role of the human driver in driving decisions is considered to have great potential to reduce crashes and the resulting deaths and injuries . it is estimated that it takes around 17 years for the u.s. automobile fleet to turn over , and this time period has been lengthening due to the increasing reliability of cars and decline in crashes , so the impact of new vehicle technologies is likely to take some time to appear . dot has announced that it would work with industry , states , and other stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of autonomous vehicles , and has proposed a 10-year , $4 billion program to test connected vehicles . given the potential safety impact of the new collision - avoidance technologies and the lag in the spread of such technologies , an analysis of the costs and benefits of a program to encourage drivers to replace older cars with new cars equipped with these technologies may be worthwhile .
