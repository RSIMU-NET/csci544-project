for certain individuals , such as those who live in remote areas or cannot easily travel long distances , access to health care services can be challenging . although the literature is mixed on the effectiveness of telehealth and remote patient monitoring , a 2016 review of studies by the agency for healthcare research and quality — an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — found that the most consistent benefit of telehealth and remote patient monitoring occurs when the technology is used for communication and counseling or to remotely monitor chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease , with improvements in outcomes such as mortality , quality of life , and reductions in hospital admissions . the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 included a provision that we study telehealth and remote patient monitoring . in this report we 1. describe the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are used by medicare and other federal programs to provide health care services ; 2. assess the extent to which cms oversees telehealth payments in medicare ; 3. describe the factors associations representing providers and patients rated — and payers cited — as affecting the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare ; and 4. describe how emerging payment and delivery models could affect the potential use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare . in addition to having the provider and patient associations rate the factors and having the payer association identify them , we also reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from each provider , patient , and payer association using a structured question set to obtain examples , from their perspective , of how these factors can encourage the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare or create barriers to their use . officials from a provider association told us that telehealth can improve patient outcomes by facilitating follow - up to care . for example , officials from one provider association noted that provider and regional medical specialty shortages can be addressed through telehealth , potentially increasing productivity and ensuring on - time scheduling of appointments . officials often linked their comments on payment with those regarding coverage restrictions . additionally , there are some instances when clinicians can use remote patient monitoring to meet merit - based incentive payment system goals — for example , using home monitoring to remotely gather information to determine a patient's proper dose of blood thinning medication . according to cms officials , clinicians using telehealth and remote patient monitoring for these purposes do not have to bill medicare for the service in order to receive credit for it under the merit - based incentive payment system , and these services can count for credit under the improvement activities performance category regardless of whether they meet the statutory telehealth requirements . we provided a draft of this report to hhs , dod , and va for review and comment . these departments provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . for example , illinois requires a medical professional be present with the patient receiving care at the originating site , while oregon does not require anyone to be with the patient who is receiving care , at what is known as the originating site . through an administered data collection instrument , officials from six associations representing providers and two associations representing patients identified , and rated the significance of , factors that encourage — and barriers that limit — the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare . cms response to cited concerns .
