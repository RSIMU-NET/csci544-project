the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) was established in 1920 and covers only employees hired before 1984 . participants in the csrs do not pay social security payroll taxes and they do not earn social security benefits . for a worker retiring after 30 years of federal service , a csrs annuity will be equal to 56.25% of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of basic pay . because the social security trust funds needed additional cash contributions to remain solvent , the social security amendments of 1983 ( p.l . to coordinate federal pension benefits with social security , congress directed the development of a new retirement system for federal employees hired after 1983 . the result was the federal employees' retirement system ( fers ) act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-335 ) . the fers consists of three elements: social security , the fers basic retirement annuity and the fers supplement , and the thrift savings plan ( tsp ) . the thrift savings plan is a defined contribution ( dc ) retirement plan similar to the 401 ( k ) plans provided by many employers in the private sector . final salaries and retirement income replacement rates are shown for each of four illustrative pay grades . the replacement rate is shown for employees who make no contribution to the tsp , and thus receive only the agency automatic 1% contribution ; for workers who contribute 5% of pay , and therefore receive a 5% contribution from their employing agencies ; and for workers who contribute 10% of pay , which results in the same 5% agency contribution as would a 5% employee contribution . across the four tables , two factors are varied: the assumed rate of return on contributions to the tsp and the employees' number of years of service at retirement . in table 6 and table 7 , the replacement rates have been estimated for an employee who retires on december 31 , 2034 , at the age of 62 after 20 years of service under fers . 111-31 : provides for newly hired federal employees to be enrolled automatically in the thrift savings plan ( tsp ) at a default contribution rate of 3% of pay ; requires the federal retirement thrift investment board to establish within the tsp a qualified roth contribution program that provides for after - tax contributions and tax - free distributions ; gives the federal retirement thrift investment board authority to allow tsp participants to invest in mutual funds in addition to the five investment funds now included in the tsp ; requires the thrift board to submit to congress an annual report that includes demographic information about tsp participants and fund managers ; requires participants to sign an acknowledgement of risk if they invest contributions in any investment option other than government securities ; grants the executive director of the tsp authority to issue subpoenas under certain circumstances ; allows funds held in an individual's tsp account to be subject to court orders with respect to payment of restitution to victims of certain crimes ; requires the secretary of defense to report to congress the estimated cost of an agency match on contributions to the tsp by members of the uniformed services ; and allows the surviving spouse of a deceased tsp participant to maintain the decedent's account with the tsp .
