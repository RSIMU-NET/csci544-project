gsa provided the results of its study to the house and senate committees on appropriations in november 2010 and also reported on its efforts to implement the federal strategic sourcing initiative — office supplies ii ( os ii ) , an initiative focused on leveraging the government's buying power to realize savings . the conferees also directed gao to assess the gsa study , with particular attention to the potential for savings . gsa estimated that federal agencies spent about $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2009 purchasing office supplies from more than 239,000 vendors . alternatively , agencies can use the federal supply schedule program ( schedules program ) , a simplified process for procuring office supplies where gsa awards contracts to multiple vendors for a wide range of commercially available goods and services to take advantage of price discounts equal to those that vendors offer their “most favored customers.” the schedules program can leverage the government's significant aggregate buying power . the gsa report estimated that during fiscal year 2009 , the 10 agencies the highest spending on office supplies accounted for about $1.3 billion , or about 81 percent , of the total $1.6 billion spent governmentwide in the 14 categories of office supplies . further , it stated that about 58 percent of office supply purchases were made outside of the gsa schedules program , mostly at retail stores . additionally , gsa reported that agencies paid an average of 75 percent more ( a price premium ) than schedule prices and 86 percent more than os ii prices , for their retail purchases . while the gsa report acknowledged some limitations with the data , we identified additional data and other limitations that lead us to question the magnitude of some of gsa's reported price premiums . we were not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations . additionally , other agencies questioned the study's specific findings related to price premiums , but their own studies of price premiums support gsa's conclusion that better prices can be obtained through consolidated , leveraged purchasing . we also identified additional data and other limitations in gsa's study , including: gsa may not have been able to properly control for purchases of different quantities of the same item . two different formulas were used for calculating price premium estimates . gsa concluded that purchase cardholders compared costs at some level prior to making a purchase based on its interviews with senior - level acquisition officials . however , these agencies agreed with gsa's overall conclusion that better prices can be obtained through leveraged buys and that prices available through the new os ii blanket purchase agreements were better than the prices available from their existing agency blanket purchase agreements . the os ii initiative , more so than past efforts , is demonstrating that leveraged buying can produce greater savings and has provided improvements for managing ongoing and future strategic sourcing initiatives . in addition to the savings from the blanket purchase agreements , gsa representatives told us that they are also seeing prices decrease on schedules program contracts as vendors that were not selected for the os ii program react to the additional price competition created by the os ii initiative . gsa is capturing lessons learned from os ii and is attempting to incorporate these lessons into other strategic sourcing initiatives . for example , gsa has issued letters of concern to four vendors and has issued one cure notice to a vendor . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states .
