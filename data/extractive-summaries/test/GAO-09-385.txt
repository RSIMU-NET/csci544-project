for those nuclear weapons that are refurbished , this office oversees the activities of the design are refurbished , this office oversees the activities of the design laboratories and production facilities that ( 1 ) determine which laboratories and production facilities that ( 1 ) determine which components , such as the nuclear explosives package , will need components , such as the nuclear explosives package , will need refurbishment to extend each weapon's life ; ( 2 ) design and produce the refurbishment to extend each weapon's life ; ( 2 ) design and produce the necessary components ; ( 3 ) install the components in the weapons ; and necessary components ; ( 3 ) install the components in the weapons ; and ( 4 ) certify that the changes do not adversely affect the yield , safety , and ( 4 ) certify that the changes do not adversely affect the yield , safety , and reliability of the weapons . in 2005 , nnsa completed the refurbishment of the w87 . nnsa has continued to face management challenges during the refurbishment of the b61 bomb and w76 warhead . while nnsa has faced numerous technical challenges in refurbishing the b61 bomb and w76 warhead , this report focuses on two of the most significant technical challenges that have had an impact on cost , schedule , and meeting refurbishment objectives — the decision to reuse or manufacture a new material for a critical component in the b61 bomb and the manufacture of fogbank for the w76 . to assess the extent to which nnsa and dod have effectively managed the b61 and w76 life extension programs , we first analyzed nnsa's congressional budget requests , project plans , and acquisition reports to determine whether the life extension activities for the b61 bomb and w76 warhead were within budget or facing cost overruns . nnsa completed the refurbishment of the b61 bomb on schedule in november 2008 . however , according to nnsa and dod officials , nnsa was not able to meet all the refurbishment objectives because it established an unrealistic schedule and failed to fully implement its phase 6.x process . nnsa was able to meet its refurbishment schedule and avoid significant cost overruns for the b61 only because ( 1 ) dod changed some of the refurbishment objectives , ( 2 ) nnsa was able to reuse , rather than manufacture , a critical component for the b61 , and ( 3 ) the nuclear weapons council significantly reduced the number of b61 bombs in the stockpile . some of the b61 refurbishment problems could have been avoided if dod had fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in overseeing nnsa's life extension program activities . to address dod concerns , in december 2007 , nnsa agreed to conduct additional tests . second , the air force did not adequately review nnsa's design , engineering , and testing activities — a review that would have alerted it to the fact that nnsa was unable to meet all refurbishment objectives . nnsa developed a risk mitigation strategy to avoid potential cost overruns and schedule delays related to the manufacture of fogbank but failed to effectively implement it . as a result , nnsa's original plans to produce the first refurbished w76 weapon in september 2007 slipped to september 2008 . nnsa does not have a consistent approach for developing a cost baseline for the w76 program . refurbishing the nuclear weapons stockpile is a difficult task . ensure that the program managers responsible for overseeing the construction of new facilities directly related to future life extension programs coordinate with the program managers of such future programs to avoid the types of delays and problems faced with the construction and operation of the fogbank manufacturing facility for the w76 program .
