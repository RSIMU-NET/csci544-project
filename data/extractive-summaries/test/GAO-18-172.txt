the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems while facilitating the movement of passengers and commerce using security - related technologies . to fulfill this mission , tsa must ensure that all airline passengers and their carry - on and checked baggage are screened to deter , detect , and prevent the carriage of prohibited and other dangerous items , such as explosives , on board commercial aircraft . to address the extent to which tsa uses otas , we analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) on obligations through contracts and otas from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 . as a result of this step , we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to report on tsa's minimum use of otas ; however , we were not able to independently verify tsa's total ota obligations during this timeframe . to address the purposes of tsa's use of otas and how tsa prices and oversees them , we reviewed relevant tsa policy and guidance and selected a nongeneralizable sample of 29 otas from the eight tsa programs that awarded them from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 . as we reported in 2016 , congress has granted other transaction authority to 11 federal agencies . the following examples illustrate some of the ways tsa has used otas to reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated with tsa security programs . tsa uses otas to reimburse airports for the allowable design and construction costs associated with facility modifications needed for installing , updating , or replacing in - line checked baggage screening systems . our review of 29 otas awarded by 8 tsa programs from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and monitor these otas varied based on the complexity of the requirement . nonetheless , tsa's own 2015 internal compliance review found significant gaps in ota documentation and reporting . for otas awarded by the electronic baggage screening program where the requirements for infrastructure design and construction can be complex , the program produces an independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications from the airports which are required to follow tsa's detailed guidance . certain proposed costs in the contractor's bid were higher than tsa's independent government cost estimate . the airport authority provided documentation verifying electrical rates set by the local power authority that tsa's contracting officer used to determine fair and reasonable pricing . in addition to the steps tsa has taken to improve ota oversight , such as revising its ota policy and increasing training requirements , tsa officials told us that they will continue to conduct quarterly compliance reviews and monthly data verification in accordance with their policy . the report is also available at no charge on the gao website at http: / / www.gao.gov . in other types of projects , tsa provides 100 percent reimbursement â€” for example , for existing systems requiring the correction of security or safety deficiencies . aircraft operators are responsible for reimbursing tsa for the cost of the security screening . certify invoices to the contracting officer for payment .
