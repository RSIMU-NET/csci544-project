we appreciate the opportunity to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on us - visit ( the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ) , a multibillion - dollar program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that is intended to achieve a daunting set of goals: to enhance the security of our citizens and visitors and ensure the integrity of the u.s. immigration system , and at the same time to facilitate legitimate trade and travel and protect privacy . our reviews have produced four reports that , among other things , described dhs progress against legislatively mandated milestones and identified fundamental challenges that the department faced in delivering promised program capabilities and benefits on time and within cost . to be sure that a program is doing the right thing , it needs to be justified by sufficient fact - based and verifiable analysis to show that the program as defined will properly fit within the larger homeland security operational and technological environments and that it will produce mission value commensurate with expected costs and risks . these recommendations have been aimed at helping the department to ensure that this program fulfills expectations: in other words , that the program is doing the right thing in the right way , and that it is holding itself accountable for doing so . all work on which this testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . to achieve its goals , us - visit uses biometric information ( digital fingerscans and photographs ) to verify identity and screen persons against watch lists . when a visitor arrives at a port of entry , the biometric information is used to verify that the visitor is the person who was issued the visa or other travel documents . ultimately , visitors are to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning . increment 1 concentrates on establishing capabilities at air and sea ports of entry . these alternatives are as follows . one of dhs's goals in using this technology is to improve the ability to collect entry and exit information . we have made recommendations to dhs aimed at ensuring that this is in fact the case for us - visit , and the department has taken steps intended to address our recommendations . without a clear operational context for us - visit , the risk is increased that the program will not interoperate with related programs and thus not cost - effectively meet mission needs . according to the us - visit chief strategist , an immigration and border management strategic plan was drafted in march 2005 that shows how us - visit is aligned with dhs's organizational mission and that defines an overall vision for immigration and border management . the department has begun to develop such analyses , but some of these , such as its analyses of the operational impact of increment 2b and of the options for its exit capability , do not yet provide an adequate basis for investment and deployment decisions . one area in which dhs has made good progress is in implementing our recommendations to establish the human capital capabilities necessary to manage us - visit . since then , the program office has finalized the human capital plan , completed more activities , and formulated plans to complete others ( for example , according to the program office , it has completed an analysis of its workforce to determine diversity trends , retirement and attrition rates , and mission - critical and leadership competency gaps , and it has plans to complete an analysis of workforce data to maintain strategic focus on preserving the skills , knowledge , and leadership abilities required for the us - visit program's success ) . having such staff has been and will be particularly important in light of the program's more limited progress to date in establishing program management process capabilities . until these controls are effectively implemented , us - visit will be at risk of not delivering promised capabilities on time and within budget . because dhs test plans were not sufficiently well - defined to be effective , we recommended that before testing begins , dhs develop and approve test plans that meet the criteria that relevant systems development guidance prescribes for effective test plans: namely , that they ( 1 ) specify the test environment ; ( 2 ) describe each test to be performed , including test controls , inputs , and expected outputs ; ( 3 ) define the test procedures to be followed in conducting the tests ; and ( 4 ) provide traceability between the test cases and the requirements to be verified by the testing . to better ensure that us - visit and dhs meet expectations , we made recommendations related to measuring and disclosing progress against program commitments .
