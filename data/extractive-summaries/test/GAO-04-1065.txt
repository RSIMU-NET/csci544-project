food aid shipments must generally be transported on u.s. - flag ships under the requirements set by the cargo preference program . two broad groups of u.s. - flag carriers compete for these food aid shipments: 1. those that participate in the maritime security fleet ( msf ) ( generally liners that carry containers on scheduled routes ) and receive a $2.1 million annual subsidy from the federal government and 2. those that do not ( generally carriers of bulk and bagged cargo that operate on a charter basis ) . the cargo preference and maritime security programs both provide incentives to retain privately owned u.s. - flag ships and their u.s. - citizen mariners for commercial and national defense purposes . non - msf carriers transported about 55 percent and msf carriers 45 percent of bagged food aid shipments from fiscal years 1999 to 2003 . although on average approximately 67 percent of food aid was shipped as bulk cargo and 33 percent as bagged cargo from fiscal years 1999 to 2003 , the share of food aid shipped as bagged cargo generally increased during these years . changes in food aid spending from fiscal years 1999 to 2003 have contributed to this shift from bulk to bagged cargo . however , another 16 percent of msf food aid voyages carried food aid tonnage between 2,500 and 7,500 tons . the actual food aid tonnage and net revenue impact for msf vessels under a tonnage limitation will depend on options available to the carriers and how they respond to them . increased shipping costs: usda , usaid , and marad noted concern over the possibility of increased freight rates if ( 1 ) non - msf carriers raised prices in response to decreased competition , ( 2 ) freight rates bid by non - msf vessels for contracts that would have otherwise been carried by msf vessels are higher because of charter service rather than liner service or because the non - msf carrier may not regularly sail to that location , ( 3 ) msf carriers raised prices in response to losses associated with carrying less food aid , receiving fewer subsidy payments , or incurring costs for delayed delivery charges , and / or ( 4 ) freight rates bid by msf carriers for food aid shipments below a tonnage limitation are higher than their bid otherwise would have been for a larger shipment due to the loss of economies of scale . as discussed with committee representatives , we have focused on answering the following questions: ( 1 ) how the cargo preference and maritime security programs are designed to meet their objectives and who participates in them ; ( 2 ) what the nature and extent are of msf and non - msf carrier participation in the food aid program ; ( 3 ) how establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation on msf vessels would be expected to affect the msf , other u.s. - flag ships , the cargo preference food aid program , and the ports servicing these ships . for affected voyages , an msf carrier may be able to ( 1 ) continue carrying some food aid up to the limit , ( 2 ) replace some food aid above a limit with other cargo , and ( 3 ) continue carrying food aid above a limit if it were more profitable than the subsidy payment for that voyage plus any net revenue from replacing the food aid with other cargo .
