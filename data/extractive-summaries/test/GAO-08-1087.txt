as of april 2008 , dod estimated that it had more than 164,000 contractors in iraq , costing billions of dollars each year . our reporting objectives are to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which costs for selected contracts supporting contingency operations increased and the factors causing the increases , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod provided oversight for selected contracts that support contingency operations , and ( 3 ) the reasons for the department's use of contractors to support contingency operations for the contracts we reviewed , as well as other contracts . the total actual cost for the first year of services for this contract was about $409.6 million . this increase included growth in the quantity of equipment repaired and the number of customers served , new requirements for resetting and issuing army prepositioned stock and operating tire assembly and repair and hmmwv refurbishment programs . for example , in option years one and two , funding for the reset of equipment totaled approximately $54.2 million and $50.1 million , respectively . to meet the increased demands , additional contractor personnel were needed . for example , in september 2004 a new requirement for an installation fire department was added . other factors that contributed to individual contract cost growth among the contracts we reviewed included ( 1 ) short - term contract extensions , ( 2 ) the government's inability to provide promised equipment , ( 3 ) changes in host country labor laws , and ( 4 ) having to pay for work to be performed multiple times because it did not meet required standards . the contractors felt it was too risky to obtain long - term leases for such things as vehicles and housing because there was no guarantee that the contract would be extended again . dod's oversight of some of the contracts we reviewed has been inadequate because of a shortage of qualified oversight and contract administration personnel and because it did not maintain some contract files in accordance with applicable policy and guidance . this position requires a certified quality assurance professional . due to the vacant property administrator position , some proper accounting of government - owned equipment was not performed . however , according to oversight officials , assigned contract oversight personnel for the linguist contract were unable to judge the performance of the contractor employees because they were generally unable to speak the languages of the contractor employees they were responsible for overseeing . however , given that we identified inadequate oversight and administration staff levels for five of the seven contracts , and in four of the contracts we identified a failure to follow guidance for contract file maintenance or quality assurance principles , we believe the potential for these weaknesses exists in other dod contracts . for five of the seven contracts , dod lacked sufficient personnel to meet increased requirements for services to support operations in iraq and afghanistan . according to army officials , years ago the military did not anticipate such a large requirement for arabic speakers . in may 2007 we reported that dod and service officials attributed the increased use of contractors for support services to several factors , including ( 1 ) increased operations and maintenance requirements from the global war on terror and other contingencies , which dod has met without an increase in active duty and civilian personnel ; ( 2 ) federal government policy , which is to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services that are not inherently governmental in nature ; and ( 3 ) dod initiatives , such as its competitive sourcing and utility privatization programs . to ensure that dod is able to exercise effective oversight over the contracts we reviewed , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to take the following three actions: develop a plan to adequately staff oversight positions with qualified personnel , take steps to determine why guidance for maintaining contract files is not consistently being followed and implement a corrective action plan , and ensure that quality assurance principles are consistently implemented . first , we developed criteria for such a list of contracts ( including task orders ) awarded by dod and its components that included the following: the contract supports deployed forces ; operations and maintenance ( o&m ) funds are used to pay for the contract services ; the principal place of performance is within the united states central command's area of operation ( i.e. , 50 percent or greater ) ; the contract is to maintain a weapons system ( s ) and / or provide support , including base support , but not for reconstruction and commodities ; the award date of the contract is after october 2002 ; the contract was still in effect as of december 12 , 2006 ; and the contractor is u.s. based . if there was a difference between annual contract costs and the initially estimated contract costs , we reviewed contract modification documents , contractor proposals , and other contract documents , and spoke with contracting office and contractor representatives to determine what led to the change in cost .
