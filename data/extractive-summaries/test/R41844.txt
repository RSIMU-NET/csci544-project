the reclamation fund was established in 1902 as a special fund within the united states treasury to aid the development of irrigation on the arid lands of western states . it originated as a revolving fund supported by the proceeds of the sale of land and water in the western united states . over time it , has been amended to receive proceeds from a number of disparate sources , including power generation and mineral leasing . since the mid - 1990s , balances in the reclamation fund have increased significantly as appropriations made from the fund have not kept pace with receipts coming in to the fund . barring major changes by congress in the form of increased appropriations from the fund or a redirection of its receipts , the fund's balance is expected to continue to increase . for instance , congress could increase appropriations from the reclamation fund in annual discretionary appropriations , but such an increase would have to compete with other appropriations ( including general fund appropriations ) subject to congressional 302 ( b ) allocations . some , including water users and others benefitting from reclamation projects , note that the reclamation fund was intended to benefit water resource projects in western states , and spending its balance on the fund's intended purposes is a logical use of the fund . the bill established a separate fund ( known as the reclamation water settlements fund ) in the treasury and directed the secretary of the treasury to transfer into the new fund up to $120 million annually between fy2020 and fy2034 that would otherwise go to the reclamation fund . more recently , a bill in the senate in the 113 th congress , the authorized rural water projects completion act ( s. 715 ) , proposes to establish a new fund for rural water projects ( similar to the water settlements fund referenced above ) that would receive , without further appropriation , approximately $80 million per year in funding that would otherwise revert to the reclamation fund .
