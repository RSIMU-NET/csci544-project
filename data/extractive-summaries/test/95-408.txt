the focus of the latest national debate over high levels of immigration is largely on its economic effects , that is , whether immigration provides net economic benefits to society . immigrants also affect the private economy in their capacity as workers: if the admission of foreign - born workers lowers wages , which , in turn , results in more goods being produced at lower prices , then u.s. consumers would benefit ; however , if immigration results in lower wages , u.s. workers would be harmed . the report concludes with a discussion of policy implications . before the entrance of foreign - born workers to the u.s. labor market , the amount of labor that workers are willing to supply to employers is represented by the curve labeled s 1 in figure 1 . at any given wage rate , more workers now are willing to offer their services to employers . the model suggests that some native - born workers may be made worse off through lower wages or diminished job prospects because immigration increases the supply of labor available to the nation's employers . it also has been suggested that congress address the distributional issue some empirical studies have raised by changing the composition of legal immigration . if , for example , individuals permanently admitted to the united states under the employment - based category are largely high - skilled , while those admitted under one or more of the other categories ( i.e. , family preference , immediate relatives , diversity , or refugees and asylees ) are largely low - skilled , then the current numerical limits on the latter might be lowered to mitigate immigration's presumed adverse consequences for less - skilled natives . indeed , if the skill levels of immigrants do differ by admission category , then an across - the - board cutback in the number of foreign - born persons allowed into the united states would not be an effective remedy for the poor labor market performance of low - skilled natives in recent decades . yet , changing the composition of immigration may not be the most effective way to improve the plight of low - skilled native - born workers . perhaps not surprisingly , in light of the conflicting results of the previously discussed literature , there is no consensus among the few studies that have looked specifically at the impact on high - skilled native - born workers of an increase in the supply of comparable foreign - born workers . another analysis similarly estimated that an increase in temporary and permanent immigrants does not negatively affect the wages of u.s. workers in professional occupations . the economist attributed "roughly half of the adverse wage impact of immigration on high - skill labor markets ... to the increased use of low - pay postdoctoral appointments [in science and engineering] as a way of adjusting to the increase in [labor] supply. . if the composition of foreign - born workers were shifted toward the high - skilled , it could make it more difficult to utilize one means commonly suggested to mitigate any adverse distributional effects of immigration . students and low - skilled native - born workers often have been encouraged to become complements of rather than substitutes for foreign - born workers .
