the unliquidated funds from completed grants and contracts represent millions of dollars that potentially could be recovered , deobligated , and used to provide epa with additional resources needed to fund other environmental programs . this report responds to your request that we ( 1 ) identify epa's efforts to close out inactive grants and contracts ; ( 2 ) identify the progress that epa has made in reducing the number of inactive grants and contracts , identify the number of remaining inactive grants and contracts , and identify the dates by which they are expected to be closed out ; and ( 3 ) determine the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts . construction grants are used for designing and constructing wastewater treatment facilities to improve water quality in specific geographical areas . the agency has developed a strategy for eliminating the backlog of nonconstruction grants and preventing a future backlog . to avert a future grant backlog , the agency developed a strategy that includes identifying the required closeout documents for individual grants before the grants are awarded , requiring each grants management office to develop a closeout strategy , and streamlining closeout procedures to improve the effectiveness of the closeout process . epa did not always follow its procedures when closing out nonconstruction grants . the objectives of the first strategy , developed in 1990 , were not attained , and actions called for in the second strategy , developed in 1997 , were not fully implemented . this closeout strategy also called for several initiatives , including reviewing the workload for grants in each region and identifying impediments to closing grants . for nonconstruction grants , the backlog was reduced from approximately 18,000 in 1996 to approximately 4,100 as of june 30 , 1998 , and the number of inactive construction grants was about 500 as of march 1998 â€” reduced from about 5,900 at the end of fiscal year 1990 . the backlog of inactive nonconstruction grants will likely be eliminated by 2000 , but it is uncertain when the backlogs of construction grants and contracts will be eliminated . in july 1996 , epa proposed 2000 as the date for eliminating the backlog of nearly 18,000 nonconstruction grants . if the agency maintains its current progress and closure rate , the goal may be achieved earlier . of these 598 grants , 476 were for completed wastewater treatment projects that had begun operations ; therefore , epa could begin the closeout process . it is unlikely , however , that this goal will be met either . by august 1998 , epa had reduced that number to 1,028 .
