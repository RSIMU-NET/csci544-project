as part of a comprehensive review of student treatment at the department of defense ( dod ) service academies originally requested by senator nunn and senator glenn , we collected information on the honor and conduct adjudicatory systems at the military academy , the naval academy , and the air force academy . the conduct system at each academy establishes rules and regulations and provides an administrative process for dealing with those accused of violating them . due process protections are greater in criminal proceedings than in non - criminal proceedings ( such as administrative hearings ) . these 12 categories of due process rights include several rights derived from criminal hearings . the objectives of this report are to ( 1 ) compare the characteristics of the honor and conduct systems at each academy and describe how the various systems provide common due process protections from the perspective of key participants in the process and ( 2 ) describe the attitudes and perceptions of the students toward the honor and conduct systems . while the honor systems at each academy share many similarities , there are also some key differences . did not want a system that would codify right and wrong , or a system that over the years would become so involved with loopholes and elastic clauses that soon its very principles would degenerate into a set of rights and wrongs that would enable and tempt midshipmen to do wrong yet still be within the codified system's bounds of right.” “the honor concept is not a code of specific requirements or prohibitions , but is violated by the commission or omission of any act contrary to those principles , provided the commission or omission was done with the intent to breach the fundamental concept.” the 1994 naval academy honor concept states , “midshipmen are persons of integrity: they stand for that which is right. . in general , the academies are fairly similar with regard to the due process protections their honor systems provide students . also , there is some confusion regarding whether some acts are honor violations or conduct violations . many academy students ( from 23 percent at the naval academy to over 40 percent at the other two academies ) saw toleration of an honor offense as much less serious than other offenses ( see fig . toleration was more likely to be seen as a less serious offense at the two academies with a non - toleration clause than it was at the naval academy where toleration is a conduct offense , not an honor offense . we asked students several questions aimed at assessing their willingness to report honor violations . however , the systems and processes vary considerably across the three academies . a company board is not considered to be a major disciplinary proceeding . the inconsistencies , with academy students having less protection , involve the right to be represented by counsel ; the right to remain silent ; the right to an independent appeal ; the maximum length of the punishment of “restriction ; ” and , in the case of the military and air force academies , the standard of proof used to determine guilt . a second difference concerns the right to remain silent . for naval academy midshipmen , the standard of proof for administrative conduct hearings is the same at the academy as it is for nonjudicial punishment in the fleet , “preponderance of the evidence.” however , the standard of proof used in military and air force academy administrative conduct hearings ( preponderance of the evidence ) is lower than that used for nonjudicial punishment in the active army and air force . a majority of students at the academies perceived that the handling of conduct offenses , the application of rules and regulations , and the disciplinary actions imposed were not consistent . give cadets more responsibility and authority .
