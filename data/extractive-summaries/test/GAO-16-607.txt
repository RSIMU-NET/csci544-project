according to interior officials , blm has been updating its regulations on natural gas emissions for a number of years , but it can take years to propose and finalize such regulations . in addition , we analyzed a simple random sample of 100 of the 1,281 fiscal year 2014 venting or flaring requests to assess the extent to which field office supervisors approved these and followed blm's guidance for doing so . thus , the guidance interior has provided to operators on how to report natural gas emissions has not ensured that these data are consistent and complete . third , interior's guidance does not specify which activities are to be reported under ogor categories for natural gas emissions . furthermore , the guidance allows for use of any estimation method that is approved by a blm supervisor . without specific instructions from blm on how to develop estimates of natural gas emissions , it may also be difficult for blm's production accountability staff to determine which method operators are using to estimate natural gas emissions and to verify their accuracy during periodic records reviews . although some blm field office officials we spoke with told us they felt that the ogor volume estimates were fairly reliable , without consistent accounting , interior does not have the information it needs to have reasonable assurance that it is minimizing waste on federal oil and gas leases . blm has approved operators' requests to vent or flare gas royalty - free without having the documentation its guidance requires . field offices have also applied blm's guidance differently , which has resulted in some field offices requiring royalty payments on flared gas while other field offices do not . generally , venting or flaring on a short - term basis in temporary or emergency circumstances is described in ntl - 4a as “authorized venting or flaring of gas.” alternatively , venting or flaring requests that are more long term in nature — described in ntl - 4a as “other venting or flaring” of gas — may be approved if operators submit documentation that consists of ( 1 ) an evaluation report providing an economic and a geologic justification to flare or ( 2 ) an action plan that will eliminate venting or flaring of the gas within 1 year from the date of application . as discussed above , interior officials we spoke with told us that blm plans to finalize the proposed regulations by the end of calendar year 2016 , and they told us that finalizing the proposed regulations is an administration priority . to fulfill its responsibility to ensure that operators use all reasonable precautions to prevent waste of oil or gas on federal leases , interior must be able to account for oil and gas produced from these leases , including how it is sold , lost , or used . onrr should provide additional guidance on how to report royalty - free and royalty - bearing flaring and consider creating a separate category for royalty - bearing flaring ; how to report certain unreported or underreported emissions , such as emissions from storage tanks and gas vented during well completions ; and how to differentiate between combusted and noncombusted lease use volumes reported on the ogor , which could assist interior in measuring its progress toward greenhouse gas reduction goals . these regulations include a requirement that operators collect or flare 95 percent of gas associated with new wells . this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which the department of the interior ( interior ) can account for natural gas emissions from onshore federal leases and ( 2 ) how selected bureau of land management ( blm ) field offices have managed requests to vent or flare natural gas emissions on onshore leases . specifically , we interviewed blm officials in blm headquarters ; blm's national operations center in lakewood , colorado ; and six blm field offices we selected primarily based on ( 1 ) the volume of flared gas emitted in that region , ( 2 ) the amount of lease use gas consumed in that region , and ( 3 ) the volume of vented gas in that region in fiscal year 2014 , the most recent year for which complete data were available . to examine the guidance blm provides to operators regarding reporting flared volumes on the ogor , we reviewed blm's existing guidance on venting and flaring — notice to lessees and operators of onshore federal and indian oil and gas leases ( ntl - 4a ) — and interviewed officials from our selected field offices on how such volumes are to be reported on the ogor .
