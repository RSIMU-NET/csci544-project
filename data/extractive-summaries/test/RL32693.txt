distributional effects are often central policy issues in debates over tax legislation . although economic analysis can be used to estimate the distribution of the tax system , or a tax change ( a positive or descriptive analysis ) , it cannot be used to provide a normative or prescriptive analysis . most normative analysis in economics is focused on efficiency . even in the case of distribution issues , however , economic analysis can be used to facilitate the understanding of desirable distributions , measure them correctly , and determine the implications of different assumptions about social welfare for the optimal distribution of the tax burden . this section is presented for the interested reader , but is not a necessary preliminary to examining the analysis in the second section , which presents estimates of the distribution of the federal and total u.s. tax burden . there are two separate , albeit related , questions about tax burden distribution . when effective tax rates rise with income a tax system is progressive , it is proportional when effective tax rates are relatively constant , or regressive , if effective tax rates fall as income increases . although it is straightforward to describe what makes a tax system regressive , proportional , or progressive , it is more difficult to characterize changes to an existing tax system . this report will instead examine the measures that are often used to characterize tax changes . some of the measures that have been presented include ( 1 ) the share of taxpayers benefitted that fall below an income level ; ( 2 ) the percentage reduction in taxes paid ; ( 3 ) the tax cut as a percentage of income ( both pre - tax and disposable ) ; ( 4 ) the distribution of the tax cut by income class ; and ( 5 ) the average tax cut . but that measure does not reveal very much about distribution , because people in the lower - income categories may have extremely small tax liabilities and a tiny change in tax could result in a very big percentage change . thus , there is a tendency for absolute measures to show most across - the - board tax cuts as favoring higher - income individuals — because these individuals have a larger proportion of the income and pay an even larger fraction of the income tax . a different type of measure is a relative one that tries to examine how the tax benefit is changing the overall relative distribution of income in the country — that is , is it making income shares more equal or less equal ? . both patterns show that benefits fell , and then rose at very high - income levels , but the percentage change in tax liability suggests the biggest benefits for the lower - income class , while the percentage change in after - tax income measure shows the biggest benefits for the top measure . the ctj measures are a percentage of pre - tax income rather than disposable income , which tends to make all percentages slightly smaller .
