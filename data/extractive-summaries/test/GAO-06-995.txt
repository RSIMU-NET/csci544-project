for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been urged by commissions , panels , and legislation to make increased use of commercial acquisitions to take advantage of the efficiencies of the commercial marketplace . to help ensure the increased use of commercial acquisition , the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) established and the air force implemented two commercial acquisition goals to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2005 . these were to double the dollar value of commercial acquisition contract actions awarded in 1999 ( for the air force this meant going from about $3 billion to about $6 billion ) and strive to increase the number of commercial contract actions awarded to 50 percent of all air force contract actions . in setting these goals , osd expected that the increased use of commercial acquisition would provide dod with greater access to commercial markets ( products and service types ) with increased competition , better prices , and new market entrants and / or technologies . specifically , we determined ( 1 ) the extent to which the air force has increased its use of commercial acquisition to obtain expected benefits and ( 2 ) the risks associated with air force use of commercial acquisition . as its overall spending has increased , the air force has increased spending using commercial acquisition , from $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2001 to over $8 billion in fiscal year 2005 ( see fig . for example , improperly classifying an acquisition as a commercial acquisition leaves the air force vulnerable to accepting prices that may not be the best value for the department because under commercial acquisition regulations , the government is precluded from requesting cost or pricing information . the air force use of commercial acquisition has been accompanied by an increased amount of dollars being awarded sole - source . the definition found in federal regulation states in part: “commercial item means any item , other than real property , that is of a type customarily used by the general public.” in an attachment to the 2001 memo instituting the commercial acquisition goals , osd cautioned that the phrase “of a type” is not intended to allow the use of commercial acquisition to acquire sole - source , military - unique items that are not closely related to items already in the marketplace . there are circumstances when an acquisition , including one for commercial items , can be awarded without competition . furthermore , at least one of the expected benefits of commercial acquisition — attracting new market entrants — has not materialized through the air force's use of sole - source commercial acquisitions for products in fiscal year 2004 . we considered them traditional contractors .
