we reviewed securities and exchange commission ( sec ) filings and pbgc documents disclosing missed contributions and plan underfunding at the time of termination . further , pbgc agreed that it has limited power over executive compensation during bankruptcy , as such payments are under the purview of the bankruptcy court . for 2009 , this limit is $54,000 . executives at 10 companies received approximately $350 million in pay and other benefits in the years leading up to the termination of their companies' underfunded pension plans . we identified the salaries , bonuses , and benefits provided to small groups of high - ranking executives at these companies . we also found that some executives at these companies received millions of dollars combined in other financial benefits such as income tax reimbursements , retention bonuses , severance packages , split - dollar life insurance , and supplemental retirement plans . we did not find any illegal activity related to executive compensation on the part of either the 10 companies or the 40 executives under review . we spoke to several retirees , including one pilot who lost two - thirds of his monthly pension payments when his pension plan was turned over to pbgc . the plan covering the company's pilots was terminated during the first bankruptcy . according to the companies' compensation committees , executive compensation is meant to “establish a relationship between compensation and the attainment of corporate objectives.” however , in 1 year , an executive failed to meet his target objectives , yet received a $1.5 million bonus “given continued confidence that he will achieve superior results in the future.” in addition to salaries and bonuses , the executives also received over $10 million in other benefits . any executive compensation paid during the course of a bankruptcy must be approved by the court , and once approved , cannot be recovered . to determine pay and other compensation received by executives in the years preceding their company's termination of an underfunded defined benefit pension plan , we first obtained a database from the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) identifying companies that had terminated underfunded pension plans from 1999 to 2008 . we requested and reviewed documents provided by selected companies related to the compensation of their executives . because some companies and executives did not provide information , declined to be interviewed , and / or did not consent to granting gao access to copies of their tax returns from the internal revenue service , we were not able to document all details concerning pay and benefits received beyond the details available in public documents or otherwise voluntarily provided . to assess the reliability of pbgc data related to the termination of defined benefit pension plans from 1999 through 2008 , we ( 1 ) interviewed pbgc officials familiar with the data related to terminated pension plans and ( 2 ) matched the data provided by pbgc for the pension plans in each case study against records available on the agency's web site to verify that the data we were provided were exported correctly .
