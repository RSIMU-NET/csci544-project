recognizing that existing depot facilities may not be ideally configured to efficiently and effectively support the services' readiness needs , senate report 115-262 , accompanying a proposed bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , included a provision directing the secretaries of the army , navy and air force to submit an engineering master plan for optimal placement and consolidation of facilities and major equipment , as well as an investment strategy addressing the facilities , major equipment and infrastructure requirements of depots under the jurisdiction of each service . the objectives of this report are to evaluate: 1 ) the condition of depot facilities and equipment , their relationship to depot performance , and the services' tracking of the relationship to depot performance ; and 2 ) the extent to which dod and the services have developed an approach for guiding depot investments to address key challenges . delays in depot maintenance can directly affect the services' readiness by hindering their ability to conduct training and operations using these weapon systems . our previous work has identified multiple factors that can affect depot performance , including the size and skill of the depot workforce , the condition of weapon systems upon arrival at the depot , the availability of spare parts , and the condition of the depot's facilities and equipment , among others ( see fig . specifically , 12 of the 21 depots – more than half – have average condition ratings that are below 80 , indicating that they are in “poor” condition ( see fig . equipment is generally past its expected useful life at most military depots . for example , the plan estimates that optimized facilities and equipment will save the shipyards over 325,000 labor days per year . including these elements could enhance the effectiveness of service depot investments . officials estimate that the effort will cost $21 billion over 20 years , and will allow for increased repair capacity . we have a separate review examining the navy's effort to optimize its shipyards , which examines its use of results - oriented elements . however , these one - time reports will not provide congress and decision makers with information after their initial release . dod does report some depot information to congress ; however , the information reported is limited in nature and does not address key issues concerning depot facilities and equipment . improving readiness is one of dod's top priorities . without providing oversight of and reporting on service depot investments , dod risks continued deterioration of the depots' facilities and equipment , suboptimal investments , and reduced military readiness as the services experience costly maintenance delays . dod's 21 depots are critical for repairing and maintaining its complex array of weapon systems . however , with the exception of the plan designed to address the navy shipyards , the services' plans are still in the initial stages , and each one is expected to lack key elements of a results - oriented management approach — including analytically based goals , results - oriented metrics , full identification of required resources and risks , and regular reporting on progress — that would help guide investment . in addition , implementing a regular monitoring and reporting process to provide oversight and accountability over depot investments would further enhance dod's ability to attain improvements at the depots significant enough to reverse years of decline and reach the challenging goals set by the secretary of defense for improving mission capability rates and reducing operating and support costs .
