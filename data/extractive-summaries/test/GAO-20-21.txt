its expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue and the trust fund has essentially borrowed with interest from the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) general fund almost every year since 1979 , which was its first complete fiscal year . in june 2019 , we reported preliminary observations that coal operator bankruptcies were further straining trust fund finances because , in some cases , responsibility for benefit payments was transferred from the bankrupt operator to the trust fund . this may occur , for instance , when the amount of collateral dol requires from a self - insured coal operator does not fully cover the operator's benefit responsibility should the operator become insolvent . we also interviewed dol officials , coal mine operators , and insurance company representatives . to assess how coal mine operator bankruptcies affected the trust fund , we analyzed bloomberg terminal ( bloomberg ) data and consulted dol to identify coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016 , and whose cases had progressed far enough such that the outcome ( or likely outcome ) was known . thus , we were unable to assess the effect on the trust fund of dol not monitoring coal operator compliance with commercial insurance requirements . in june 2019 , we reported that dol estimated that between $313 million to $325 million in benefit liabilities would transfer to the trust fund as a result of these bankruptcies . in january 2020 , however , dol provided updated estimates stating that $865 million in benefit liabilities would transfer to the trust fund as a result of these bankruptcies . as previously discussed , state insurance regulation , insurer underwriting and risk management practices , and state guaranty funds also help to protect the trust fund from having to assume responsibility for paying black lung benefits on behalf of bankrupt coal operators . in overseeing coal mine operator self - insurance in the past , dol did not estimate future benefit liability when setting collateral ; regularly review operators to monitor their changing financial conditions ; or always use enforcement tools available to protect the financial interests of the trust fund , such as by revoking an operator's ability to self - insure , if warranted . however , the new process still lacks procedures for self - insurance renewals and coal operator appeals , which could hinder dol from taking enforcement actions to protect the trust fund as needed . in july 2019 , dol began implementing a new process for coal mine operator self - insurance that should help to address some past deficiencies if implemented effectively . dol's new self - insurance process will include estimates of future benefit liability coal mine operators applying to dol to self - insure will be required to submit: a completed application ; a certified consolidated financial statement for each of the 3 years prior to its application ; recent black lung claims information ; and a certified actuarial report on the operator's existing and future black lung benefit liabilities . this could result in the trust fund having to assume responsibility for paying benefits that would otherwise have been paid by an insurer . the black lung disability trust fund faces financial challenges , and dol's limited oversight of coal mine operator insurance has further strained trust fund finances by allowing operator liabilities to transfer to the federal government . we are making the following three recommendations to the department of labor: the director of the office of workers' compensation programs should develop and implement procedures for coal mine operator self - insurance renewal that clarifies how long an operator is authorized to self - insure ; when an operator must submit its renewal application and supporting documentation ; and the conditions under which an operator's self - insurance authority would not be renewed .  ( recommendation 3 ) . specifically , dol reported that it will ( 1 ) ensure letters granting or renewing self - insurance authority will inform operators that their authorization expires in one year and that they must submit renewal information three months in advance of the expiration date , ( 2 ) ensure letters denying self - insurance will inform operators that they have a 30- day appeal period ( limited to one extension ) and that dol has set a goal of resolving all appeals within 90 days of the denial letter , and ( 3 ) modify existing computer systems to identify lapses or cancellations of commercial insurance coverage , and require operators identified as having lapsed or cancelled coverage to obtain or provide proof of coverage within 30 days .
