dod has faced long - term challenges in managing its portfolio of facilities , halting degradation of facilities , and reducing unneeded infrastructure to free up funds to better maintain the facilities it still uses and to meet other needs . costs to build and maintain the defense infrastructure represent a significant financial commitment . dod's management of its support infrastructure is on our high - risk list , in part due to the challenges dod faces in eliminating unneeded infrastructure . the secretary acknowledged that the brac process is controversial but stated that it is the only effective way to achieve needed infrastructure savings , and that the upcoming request comes as a result of dod plans to reduce its force structure . to identify some of the key factors and challenges that contributed to brac 2005 implementation and results , we reviewed our previous work and key documents related to brac 2005 , such as brac business plans that laid out the actions and timing of those actions to implement the recommendations , briefings prepared by the military services on the implementation status of the recommendations , and other key documents . congress required the secretary of defense to develop and submit to congress a force structure plan laying out the numbers , size , and composition of the units that constitute u.s. defense forces — for example , divisions , ships , and air wings — based on the secretary's assessment of the probable national security threats over the ensuing 20 year period , and an inventory of global military installations . dod began to develop options for closure or realignment recommendations . after dod selected its base closure and realignment recommendations , it submitted them to the brac commission , which performed an independent review and analysis of dod's recommendations . in contrast to other brac rounds that were primarily focused on achieving savings by reducing excess infrastructure , the secretary of defense identified three goals for brac 2005 . these goals and the primary selection criteria's focus on enhancing military value led dod to identify numerous recommendations that were designed to be transformational and enhance jointness , thereby adding to the complexity the commission and dod faced in finalizing and implementing the brac recommendations . dod expects this brac recommendation to produce significant savings ; however , as we reported , this brac recommendation required sustained senior leadership attention to ensure effective completion . specifically , dod had to synchronize the relocations of over 123,000 people with about $24.7 billion in new construction or renovation . moreover , many of the proposed brac recommendations that dod presented to the commission for review were made up of multiple individual actions , unlike prior rounds in which each base was handled by a single integrated recommendation , according to the brac commission . the effect on communities from installation growth has led to challenges for the communities to ensure the provision of adequate services to the installation . as we have previously reported , communities experiencing growth were hindered in their ability to effectively plan for off - base support such as adequate roads and schools due to inconsistent information from dod around the 2007 time frame . our analysis of dod's fiscal year 2011 brac 2005 budget submission to congress and each annual submission throughout the brac 2005 implementation period shows that one - time implementation costs grew from $21 billion originally estimated by the brac commission in 2005 to in about $35.1 billion , an increase of about $14.1 billion , or 67 percent.constant 2005 dollars , costs increased to about $32.2 billion , an increase of 53 percent . 9.5 percent decrease from the commission's estimate . the 20-year net present value savings estimated by the commission in 2005 for this brac round have decreased by 73 percent to about $9.9 billion . defense infrastructure: changes in funding priorities and management processes needed to improve condition and reduce costs of guard and reserve facilities . gao / nsiad - 99-36 .
