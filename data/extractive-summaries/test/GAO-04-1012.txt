among the changes , the act shortened from 60 days to 40 days the time labor is given to process petitions filed on behalf of groups of workers to determine their potential eligibility for services ; established a deadline for workers to enroll in training , after they have been laid off or their petition has been approved , in order to maintain eligibility for extended income support payments ; created a health coverage tax credit ( hctc ) to help trade - affected workers who are enrolled in or have completed training , or have a waiver from this requirement , pay for health insurance ; created a wage insurance benefit for workers age 50 and older , subsidizing the difference between the prior and new wages of some trade - affected workers who find reemployment quickly ; and expanded the eligibility criteria for secondary workers — defined as those who are indirectly affected by international trade , because they supply component parts to or perform finishing work for directly affected firms . most workers are enrolling in taa services sooner than in prior years because of two key provisions of the taa reform act , the new petition - processing time limit and the new training enrollment deadline . labor's national data indicate that overall states issued over 40 percent more training waivers in fiscal year 2003 than in 2002 ( see fig . 5 ) . 8 ) . while demand for taa services increased substantially during fiscal year 2002 , most provisions of the taa reform act of 2002 did not take effect until early in fiscal year 2003 . most states anticipate that in fiscal year 2004 they will have difficulties meeting the demand for taa training with taa training funds alone — even though the amount of funds available nationally for taa training was doubled from $110 million to $220 million between fiscal years 2002 and 2003 . however , in an earlier study we found that information captured by this reporting system was often incomplete and many states did not validate information reported to labor . since june 2002 , states could use wris for reporting taa outcomes , but it is unknown how many states are using or plan to use this system . some individuals may not be captured by wage record data . meanwhile , states report that certain provisions of the reform act have presented implementation challenges . in particular , labor should track over time the following: the ability of workers to meet the new training enrollment deadline and of states and local areas to provide appropriate assessments to all trade - affected workers within the deadline , especially when responding to very large layoffs , and whether the eligibility criteria for the new wage insurance program are resulting in the denial of services to some older workers who could benefit from the program . copies will also be made available to others upon request . we were asked to provide information on ( 1 ) how key provisions of the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act have affected program services , ( 2 ) what have been the challenges in implementing the taa reform act's new provisions , ( 3 ) whether demand for taa training has changed , and how states are meeting this demand , and ( 4 ) what is known about what the taa program is achieving .
