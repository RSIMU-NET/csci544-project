as a result of these challenges , we added several va programs to our high - risk list . this list focuses attention on government operations that are most vulnerable to fraud , waste , abuse , or mismanagement , or in need of transformation . we , along with va's inspector general and other entities , continue to identify significant deficiencies in va's governance structures and operations — all of which can affect the care provided to our nation's veterans . my statement today focuses on the status of va's efforts to address its high - risk designations and open gao recommendations in the following areas: ( 1 ) managing risks and improving va health care ; ( 2 ) va acquisition management ; ( 3 ) improving and modernizing federal disability programs ; and ( 4 ) other government - wide high - risk areas that have direct implications for va and its operations . this statement is based on our 2019 high - risk update and our body of work that spans more than a decade . va is responsible for providing benefits to veterans , including health care , disability compensation , and various types of financial assistance . in fiscal year 2019 , va received a total budget of $201.1 billion , and the largest discretionary budget in its history — $86.6 billion , about $20 billion higher than in 2015 . since we designated va health care as a high - risk area in 2015 , va has begun to address each of the identified five areas of concern related to managing risks and improving va health care: ( 1 ) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes ; ( 2 ) inadequate oversight and accountability ; ( 3 ) it challenges ; ( 4 ) inadequate training for va staff ; and ( 5 ) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . specifically , the leadership commitment and action plan criteria remain partially met . the secretary's actions , to date , have allowed the department to maintain its leadership commitment rating as of march 2019 . in order to address the monitoring and demonstrated progress criteria , va's ongoing revisions to its action plan need to include the addition of certain essential components , including metrics , milestones , and mechanisms for monitoring and demonstrating progress in addressing the high - risk areas of concern . for example , in november 2017 , we reported that , due in part to misinterpretation or lack of awareness of vha policy , va medical center officials did not always conduct or document timely required reviews of providers when allegations were made against them . in a series of reports from 2012 through 2018 , gao found va's wait time data unreliable for primary and specialty care , as well as for care in the community . gao also found that va did not measure the full wait times that veterans experience in obtaining care across these settings . in april 2019 , we reported that vha's appraisal process for assessing medical center director performance relies heavily on medical center performance information . information technology challenges . the new system is intended to be the authoritative source of clinical data to support improved health , patient safety , and quality of care provided by va. va has not fully implemented our priority recommendation calling for the department to define the role of the interagency program office in the governance plans for acquisition of the department's new electronic health record system . in light of numerous contracting challenges that we have identified , and given the significant investment in resources to fulfill its critical mission of serving veterans , we added va acquisition management as a new high - risk area in 2019 . we have identified challenges in the following areas of concern related to va's acquisition management: ( 1 ) outdated acquisition regulations and policies ; ( 2 ) lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy ; ( 3 ) inadequate acquisition training ; ( 4 ) contracting officer workload challenges ; ( 5 ) lack of reliable data systems ; ( 6 ) limited contract oversight and incomplete contract file documentation ; and ( 7 ) leadership instability . leadership instability . managing disability claims workloads . however , as we reported in march 2018 , va's appeals plan does not provide reasonable assurance that it will have the capacity to implement the new process and manage risks . however , as of april 2019 va has not fully addressed this recommendation . we made two recommendations to improve va's disability benefit appeals process , including that va ( 1 ) clearly articulate in its appeals plan how it will monitor and assess the new appeals process compared to the legacy process , and ( 2 ) ensure that its appeals plan more fully addresses related risks , given the uncertainties associated with implementing a new process . updating disability benefit eligibility criteria . however , we lowered va's prior rating for this criterion from met to partially met because va's plans have changed since our last update , and although it is conducting a study to update earnings loss information for some diagnostic codes and body systems , its plan does not include timetables for monitoring these or future updates to earnings loss information . since his confirmation in july 2018 , secretary wilkie has demonstrated his commitment to addressing the department's high - risk designations by , among other things , creating an office to direct an integrated approach for high - risk concerns and communicating to va leaders the importance of addressing our recommendations . fully addressing these issues will require sustained leadership attention on these issues as well as leadership stability — something that va has not had in recent years . the plan , which identifies high - level implementation targets through 2020 , provides a framework to address the secretary's four priorities: ( 1 ) improving training and customer service ; ( 2 ) implementing the va mission act and improving veterans' access to care ; ( 3 ) connecting the va's electronic health records system to the dod's to ensure a continuum of care for transitioning service members ; and ( 4 ) transforming va's business systems . if successful , these efforts could be transformative for va . sustained congressional oversight of va's efforts will also be needed .
