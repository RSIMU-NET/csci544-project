as requested , this report builds upon that statement to ( 1 ) summarize our observations on agencies' september plans and ( 2 ) provide additional information on how the next phase of the results act's implementation — performance planning and measurement — can be used to address the critical planning issues we observed in reviewing the september strategic plans . among the remaining critical challenges are ( 1 ) clearly establishing a strategic direction for agencies by improving goal - setting and measurement ; ( 2 ) improving the management of crosscutting program efforts by ensuring that those programs are appropriately coordinated to avoid duplication , fragmentation , and overlap ; and ( 3 ) ensuring that agencies have the data systems and analytic capacity in place to better assess program performance and costs , improve management and performance , and establish accountability . by improving on their draft strategic plans , agencies' september plans undertook the first steps toward setting a strategic direction for their programs and activities . in our reviews of agencies' september plans , we found that some agencies have begun to address the challenge of setting a strategic direction . although improvements were not isolated to these agencies , we also found that agencies need to further clarify their strategic directions if the results act is to be effective in guiding the agencies and informing congressional and other decisionmakers . consequently , agencies can continue to address the critical planning challenges associated with setting a strategic direction as they develop their first annual performance plans . our work also indicates that if agencies and omb use the annual planning process to highlight crosscutting program efforts and provide evidence of joint planning and coordination of those efforts , the individual agency performance plans and the governmentwide performance plan should help provide congress with the information needed to identify agencies and programs addressing similar missions . verified and validated performance information , in conjunction with augmented program evaluation efforts , will help ensure that agencies are able to report progress in meeting goals and identify specific strategies to improve performance . the absence of both sound program performance and cost data and the capacity to use those data to improve performance is a critical challenge that agencies must confront if they are to effectively implement the results act . over the longer term , the program performance information that agencies are to generate under the results act should be a valuable new resource for congress to use in its program authorization , oversight , budget , and appropriation responsibilities . agencies , on the whole , made significant progress in improving their plans during august and september 1997 . this need still exists in the september plan . recognizing that the linkage between the strategic plan and the annual performance plan is a critical element of the act , justice said that it has revised its internal processes to ensure that the strategic plan serves as the foundation for the development of annual budgets and performance plans . specifically , the mission statement was too broad , lacking explicit reference to certain key responsibilities ; the goals and objectives suggested some results to be achieved but provided little basis for judging how opm would know whether those goals were being achieved or what opm's contribution toward achieving those results might be ; some external factors were identified , but others were not included in the plan , which also did not meet the act's requirement to link each factor to a particular goal or to identify how it might affect opm's success in meeting its goals ; and , finally , the program evaluation component discussed customer satisfaction with opm services but did not indicate how evaluations were used in developing strategic goals or provide a schedule for future evaluations as the act requires and omb guidance reiterated .
