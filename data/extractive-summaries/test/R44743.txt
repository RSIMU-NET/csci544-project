t he immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides that individual aliens outside the united states are "inadmissible" — or generally barred from admission to the country — on health , criminal , security , and other grounds set forth in the ina . however , the ina also grants the executive several broad authorities that could be used to exclude certain individual aliens or classes of aliens for reasons that are not specifically set forth in the ina . section 212 ( f ) of the ina is arguably the broadest and best known of these provisions , but sections 214 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) can also be seen to authorize the executive to restrict aliens' entry or admission to the united states . the provisions currently in section 212 ( f ) — which have been part of the ina since its enactment in 1952 — state , in relevant part , that whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states , he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate . legislative history materials from the time of the ina's enactment suggest that these provisions were seen to grant the president broad authority to bar or impose conditions upon the entry of aliens , and presidents over the years have relied upon section 212 ( f ) to suspend or restrict the entry of various groups of aliens , often ( although not always ) in conjunction with the imposition of financial sanctions upon them . neither the text of section 212 ( f ) nor the case law to date suggests any firm legal constraints upon the president's exercise of his authority under section 212 ( f ) , as is explained below . however , future executive actions under ina § 212 ( f ) could potentially be seen to raise legal issues that have not been prompted by the executive's prior exercise of this authority . section 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) similarly provides that "it shall be unlawful for any alien" to enter or depart the united states "except under such reasonable rules , regulations , and orders , and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the president may prescribe. . for example , president carter cited to section 215 ( a ) when authorizing the revocation of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas issued to iranians during the iran hostage crisis .
