in response to this concern , you asked us to answer the following questions: what changes have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing ? . what changes have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who work and the number of hours they work ? . our review was based in large part on our analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study ( npsas ) . in part , this interest in postsecondary education likely reflects students' recognition that such education is associated with higher incomes later in life . to provide a more complete picture , our report focuses on those students who borrow and those who work , showing the annual and cumulative amounts of their borrowing and the number of hours worked per week while they were enrolled . among bachelor's degree recipients , the portion of students who had borrowed $20,000 or more for the 1992-93 through 1995-96 time period rose from about 9 percent to about 19 percent of graduating seniors who had borrowed ; see table 2 . this increase eliminated the earlier difference between public and private 4-year schools in the percentage of students borrowing in 1 or more years — public school students “caught up” to private school students in terms of the percentage of the group that borrowed . overall , during 1995-96 more than two - thirds of full - time undergraduates worked while enrolled . average hours worked per week did not change significantly . about 80 percent of full - time doctoral students who worked while enrolled said they held positions directly related to their studies , compared with about 63 percent of students in master's programs and about two - thirds of students in professional programs . to gain a better understanding of student work and borrowing patterns during school year 1995-96 , we analyzed amounts borrowed and hours worked by several factors , including type of school , cost of attendance , year in school , dependency status , gender , family income , race / ethnicity , cost of attendance , and expected family contribution . in contrast with the substantial amount of information about students' own borrowing experiences , little information is available about the amounts that parents borrow to pay for their children's postsecondary education . of these , the department of education's work contained the most useful information . according to the department , the average amount of these loans increased by about 55 percent ( from $3,588 to $5,556 in constant 1995-96 dollars ) over the 1992-93 to 1995-96 period . because we were unable to identify students who were in the last year of their graduate or professional degree program in school year 1989-90 or who completed their degree during that year , we limited our analysis of graduate and professional degree students' cumulative debt to 1992-93 and 1995-96 . the estimated averages shown are based on analysis of the results from a sample of students . degree or other credential received 1995-96 dollars ) $5,171 $4,758 - $5,584 percentage of graduates borrowing in 1 or more years a total of $20,000 or more 15.7 - 22.2 dollars ) table ii.5: students in graduate and professional programs who borrowed , amount borrowed , and percentage with $50,000 or more debt , school years 1992-93 and 1995-96 undergraduate , graduate , or recipients who borrowed in 1 or a total of $50,000 or more for 1995-96 dollars ) . however , the portion of dependent students who borrowed increased at all family income levels , and at the highest level ( $100,000 and above ) , it nearly doubled from 16.3 percent to 32.6 percent .
