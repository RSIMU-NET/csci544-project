in my remarks today , i will describe to what extent medical information used for research depends on personally identifiable information , research that is and is not subject to current federal oversight requirements , and how irbs ensure the confidentiality of health information used in research . i will also discuss the safeguards health care organizations have in place to protect the confidentiality of health information used in research . in summary , our survey revealed that a considerable amount of health research relies on personally identifiable information . while some of this research is subject to irb review — either because it is federally supported or regulated research or because the organization voluntarily applies federal rules to all of its research — some of the organizations conduct records - based research that is not reviewed by an irb . in any case , the process of irb review does not ensure the confidentiality of medical information used in research — primarily because the provisions of the common rule related to confidentiality are limited . moreover , according to recent studies , the irb system on the whole is strained . nevertheless , although external review of their research is limited , most of the organizations in our study told us that they have various security safeguards in place to limit internal and external access to paper and electronic databases , and many say they have taken measures to ensure the anonymity of research and survey subjects .
