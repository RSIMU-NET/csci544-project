our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) epa's planned state emissions reporting requirements exceed the agency's program needs and ( 2 ) states use epa's aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) to monitor emissions data . to determine whether epa's planned state emissions reporting requirements exceeded the agency's actual program needs , we reviewed the clean air act , and we analyzed various information reporting requirements of the 1990 amendments and epa documents interpreting requirements of the amendments . further , we evaluated state and state air pollution association comments on the draft regulation . epa has suspended its promulgation of the regulation and has recently begun studying alternative reporting options . when airs was originally designed , states were expected to be one of its primary users ; however , most heavy emission states now use their own systems because these systems are more efficient and easier to use than airs . this is incorrect .
