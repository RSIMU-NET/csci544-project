the term "patentable subject matter" refers to the requirement of section 101 of the patent act of 1952 that an invention must consist of a "process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter" in order to be patented . the aia also limited the availability of patents claiming tax avoidance strategies . however , the courts have long held that several implicit exceptions exist to the four categories of patentable subject matter set out in section 101 . for many years , section 101 was arguably a coarse filter that was rarely used to invalidate an issued patent or reject an application pending at the uspto . this situation changed over the past decade due to a series of decisions issued by the supreme court of the united states . four supreme court opinions have issued since 2010 addressing patentable subject matter . in each instance the court concluded that the invention before it was unpatentable under section 101 . since the supreme court issued its decisions , section 101 has been more frequently invoked to invalidate issued patents and reject pending patent applications at the uspto . further , numerous patents granted by the uspto under earlier standards would likely be held invalid if they were subject to scrutiny by the agency or the courts . even if these requirements of novelty , nonobviousness , and utility are met , an invention is not patentable unless it falls within at least one category of patentable subject matter . the supreme court decisions in bilski , mayo v. prometheus , myriad , and alice present the current law of the land with respect to whether a particular invention is eligible for patenting . several key themes may be gleaned from these four opinions . that test asks ( 1 ) whether the claim recites a law of nature , natural phenomenon , or abstract idea ; and ( 2 ) if so , whether the claim includes additional , inventive elements that indicate the claim applies one of the three excluded subject matters , rather than being a fundamental concept per se . with regard to this second step , the court will analyze a patent claim to determine if it preempts a field of activity . if a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept , then it cannot be patented under section 101 . in addition , the court does not consider a claim's recitation of routine , nominal hardware — such as a general - purpose computer — to ameliorate concerns over section 101 eligibility . if the current situation is deemed acceptable , then no action need be taken . as of the date this report was published , no bill has been introduced before congress addressing the law of patentable subject since the enactment of the leahy - smith america invents act in 2011 .  ( b ) sole exceptions to subject matter eligibility . — a claimed invention is ineligible under subsection ( a ) only if the claimed invention as a whole exists in nature independent of and prior to any human activity , or can be performed solely in the human mind .  - a claim for a useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any useful improvement thereof , may be denied eligibility under this section 101 on the ground that the scope of the exclusive rights under such a claim would preempt the use by others of all practical applications of a law of nature , natural phenomenon , or abstract idea . similarly , the aba section on intellectual property asserts that recent supreme court decisions "have injected ambiguity into the eligibility determination by requiring courts and the [uspto] to apply criteria such as 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' factors that were previously relevant only to novelty and obviousness , in order to ignore limitations and render a claim patent ineligible and in effect have turned the gateway function of patent eligibility into a patentability test better left to the other statutory provisions.... " for its part , the ipo explains that the supreme court's analysis "is contrary to [c]ongressional intent , too restrictive , technologically incorrect , unsound from a policy standpoint , and bad law. .
