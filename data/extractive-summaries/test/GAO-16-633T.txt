following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the coast guard was charged with expanded security - related mission responsibilities . the impact of balancing a broad array of coast guard missions , in conjunction with constrained budgets in recent years , have underscored the need for the coast guard to ensure it has the proper mix of assets and can effectively allocate them to achieve its mission responsibilities . in recent years , the coast guard has begun to deploy new assets , such as national security cutters and fast response cutters , and has taken actions to assess what assets it needs to carry out its missions and how to best allocate its current assets . for example , in 2008 , it developed an annual planning process to allocate asset resource hours across its missions and units . it is primarily based on our may 2016 report on the coast guard's allocation of assets ; as well as prior reports on the coast guard's acquisition of assets , in addition , my statement includes selected updates from may 2016 on the coast guard's efforts to reassess and update its mission needs , and fiscal year 2015 asset resource hour data . we also analyzed data on the coast guard's asset resource hours used in fiscal year 2015 and found the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this testimony . since the 2016 revision does not identify specific assets or resource hours necessary to meet the coast guard's mission requirements , the 2005 mission needs statement remains the baseline document outlining the coast guard's mission needs and the resource hours per asset necessary to achieve them . the expected operational capacities planned for assets in the 2005 mission needs statement baseline have , in several cases , been subsequently revised downward to reflect more realistic and achievable operational targets . for the past 6 years , we have consistently found that there is a significant difference between the funding the coast guard estimates it needs to carry out its program of record for its major acquisitions and what it has traditionally requested and received through annual appropriations . to date , the coast guard's attempts to address this difference by establishing its future fleet's mission needs within reasonable budget constraints have been unsuccessful . long - term acquisition plan: this plan is to be a 20-year capital investment plan that describes for the upcoming fiscal year and for each of the 20 fiscal years thereafter , such information as the numbers and types of legacy aircraft and vessels to be decommissioned ; the numbers and types of aircraft and vessels to be acquired ; and the estimated level of funding in each fiscal year required to acquire the cutters and aircraft , as well as related command , control , communications , computer , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance systems and any changes to shoreside infrastructure . coast guard field unit officials we spoke with , and coast guard planning documents we reviewed for our may 2016 report , indicated that the coast guard is not able to achieve the resource hour allocation capacities set by the headquarters' strategic planning directions for several reasons , including the declining condition of legacy assets and unscheduled maintenance . in response to our findings , we recommended that the coast guard more systematically incorporate field unit input to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions — in addition to asset maximum capacities currently used — in the annual strategic planning directions to more effectively communicate strategic intent to field units . the coast guard concurred with our recommendation and stated that it was taking actions to better incorporate field unit input for fiscal year 2017 . for example , coast guard officials told us that the coast guard conducts a national maritime security risk assessment every 2 years to inform its asset allocations ; however , the coast guard does not document how these risk assessments have affected asset allocation decisions across its missions . in conclusion , given that many of the assumptions underlying the coast guard's acquisition plans have changed since 2005 and are no longer accurate , and the importance of ensuring that limited acquisition resources are invested as efficiently and effectively as possible , the coast guard should continue to follow through with our recommendations to identify the cost , capability , and quantity of its fleet mix , as well as the trade - offs that would need to be made given fiscal constraints .
