this report discusses various issues concerning the role of certain power marketing administrations ( pma ) and other federal agencies in restructuring electricity markets . in return , these utilities built generating and other facilities to provide all of the electricity needed by all current and future customers in their service areas . in response , the chairmen of the house committee on resources and the subcommittee on water and power asked gao to focus on these three pmas and to ( 1 ) examine whether the government operates them and the related electric power assets in a businesslike manner that recovers the federal government's capital investment in those assets and the costs of operating and maintaining them and ( 2 ) identify options that the congress and other policymakers can pursue to address concerns about the role of these three pmas in restructuring markets or to manage them in a more businesslike fashion . the pmas generally follow these laws and regulations ; however , in some cases federal statutes and doe's rules also prohibit or are ambiguous about the recovery of certain costs . as we reported in september 1997 , for fiscal years 1992 through 1996 , as a result of its involvment in the electricity - related activities of southeastern , southwestern , and western ( the three pmas ) , the federal government incurred “net costs” of $1.5 billion — the amount by which the full costs of providing electric power exceeded the revenues from the sale of power . in addition , the availability of many federal power plants to generate electricity is below that of nonfederal plants because , among other factors , the federal plants are aging and because the federal planning and budgeting practices , including those used by the bureau and the corps , do not always ensure that funds are available so that repairs can be made when they are needed . the net cost to the treasury and the performance problems of the federal power plants — when combined with competitive pressures on electricity suppliers to decrease their rates at a time when some federal hydropower project's environmental costs need to be recouped by the pmas — create varying degrees of risk that some of the federal investment at certain federal generation and transmission projects and rate - setting systems will not be repaid . for example , although the recovery of most of the federal investment in the three pmas' hydropower - related facilities is relatively secure , up to $1.4 billion of the federal investment for projects or rate - setting systems pertaining to these pmas , out of a total federal investment of about $7.2 billion , is at some risk of nonrecovery . many options exist for improving the operations of the hydropower program while continuing federal ownership . as stated in our march 1997 report , the three general ways the government could divest itself of its hydropower assets are divesting ( 1 ) only the pmas ( including the right to market power and any associated federally owned transmission assets ) ; ( 2 ) the pmas and the generating assets of the bureau or the corps or both ; and ( 3 ) the pmas , the generating assets , and the balance of the projects ( for example , the dams and the reservoirs ) .divesting combinations of these assets is also possible .
