the federal reserve ( fed ) is mandated to keep inflation low and stable , and alters interest rates in order to do so . in recent years , the fed has focused attention on the core rate of inflation , a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices , in explanations of its policy decisions . when core inflation approached 3% in 2006 , chairman bernanke said that it had "reached a level that , if sustained , would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists , including myself , would consider consistent with price stability...." this report defines core inflation , reviews recent trends , and analyzes the advantages and drawbacks of using core inflation . no official measure of "inflation" exists . when food and energy prices are omitted from the cpi , the remaining basket is commonly referred to as the core cpi . the overall measure of cpi , which includes food and energy , is often referred to as the headline cpi . headline inflation often does not have good predictive power over short - time periods because food and energy prices are so volatile . relying on core inflation for policymaking has its drawbacks , however . technically , if a rise in one price leads to a rise in overall inflation , it must be because of some accommodation on the fed's part ( because it did not raise interest rates enough to induce other prices to fall ) . in scenarios like this one , a focus on core inflation could forestall a needed policy change until it is too late .
