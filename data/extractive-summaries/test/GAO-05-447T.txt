we are grateful to the congress for providing us with the support and resources that have helped us in our quest to be a world - class professional services organization . i am proud of the work we accomplish as we continue to provide our congressional clients with professional , objective , fact - based , non - partisan , non - ideological , fair , balanced , and reliable information in a timely manner regarding how well government programs and policies are working and , when needed , recommendations to make government work better . in the years ahead , our support to the congress will likely prove even more critical because of the pressures created by our nation's current and projected budget deficit and long - term fiscal imbalance . these fiscal pressures will require the congress to make tough choices regarding what the government should do , how it will do its work , who will help carry out its work in the future , and how government will be financed in the future . we summarized the larger challenges facing the federal government in our recently issued 21st century challenges report . in this report , we emphasize the critical need to bring the federal government's programs and policies into line with 21st century realities . continuing on our current unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security . we , therefore , must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that our programs and priorities respond to emerging security , social , economic , and environmental changes and challenges in the years ahead . my testimony today will focus on our ( 1 ) performance and results with the funding you provided us in fiscal year 2004 , ( 2 ) streamlining and management improvement efforts under way , and ( 3 ) budget request for fiscal year 2006 to support the congress and serve the american people . we also informed policymakers about long - term challenges facing the nation , such as the federal government's financial condition and fiscal outlook , new security threats in the post - cold war world , the aging of america and its impact on our health care and retirement systems , changing economic conditions , and the increasing demands on our infrastructure — from highways to water systems . financial benefits could also result from increases in federal revenues — due to changes in laws , user fees , or sales — that our work helped to produce . many of the benefits that result from our work cannot be measured in dollar terms . during fiscal year 2004 , we recorded a total of 1,197 other benefits ( see fig . 4 ) . 7 ) , primarily by executive branch agencies . during fiscal year 2004 , experts from our staff testified at 217 congressional hearings ( see fig . 9 ) covering a wide range of complex issues . shortly after i was appointed in november 1998 , i determined that gao should undertake a major transformation effort to better enable it to “lead by example” and better support the congress in the 21st century . currently , as shown in figure 12 , over 50 percent of our staff resources in the support area are contractors , allowing us to devote more of our staff resources to our mission work . we recently surveyed managers of agency mission support operations and identified additional activities that potentially could be filled through alternative sourcing strategies . in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , we will assess the feasibility of alternative sourcing for these activities using an acquisition sourcing maturity model and cost - benefit analyses . in fiscal year 2002 , an independent study of gao's it processes and related costs revealed that , “gao is delivering superb it application support and development services to the business units at 29 percent less than the cost it would take the government peer group to deliver.” in confirmation of these findings , in fiscal year 2003 , gao was one of only three federal agencies to receive the cio magazine 100 award for excellence in effectively managing it resources to obtain the most value for every it dollar . we are requesting budget authority of $493.5 million for fiscal year 2006 . this budget request will allow us to continue to maximize productivity , operate more effectively and efficiently , and maintain the progress we have made in technology and other areas . however , it does not allow us sufficient funding to support a staffing level of 3,269 — the staffing level that we requested in previous years . while we have reduced our planned staffing level for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , we believe that the staffing level we requested in previous years is a more optimal staffing level for gao and would allow us to successfully meet the future needs of the congress and provide the return on investment that the congress and the american people expect . table 2 summarizes the changes we are requesting in our fiscal year 2006 budget . we promote a workforce that continually improves its skills and knowledge . due to recent budget constraints , we have curtailed some efforts related to archiving paper records .
