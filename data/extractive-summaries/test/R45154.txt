a "lame duck" session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held but before the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term . a lame duck session may occur under the following circumstances: ( 1 ) by a previously enacted law prescribing an additional session of congress ; ( 2 ) following a recess within a session but spanning the election ; ( 3 ) under authority granted to the leadership at the time of a contingent adjournment or recess of the session ; ( 4 ) by continuing to meet , perhaps in pro forma sessions , throughout the period spanning the election ; and ( 5 ) in response to a presidential proclamation calling an extraordinary session . while these consistent lame duck sessions have occurred under varied circumstances , they have generally focused on spending provisions . in both chambers , however , lame duck sessions have adjourned later since the 2008 session . in the four of past five election years , the house or senate adjourned in january . during this entire period , the two chambers have held longer lame duck sessions and more days in daily sessions . when lame duck sessions occurred sporadically ( 1935-1998 ) , congress most often used the post - election meetings to address specific , urgent concerns ( table 7 ) . after the first session of the 76 th congress adjourned in august 1939 , president franklin d. roosevelt called congress into extraordinary session in september to address the threat of war in europe , and this session lasted into november . since the reconvening occurred before the election , it did not produce a lame duck session . seven regular appropriations bills also remained to be enacted . in 1994 , congress recessed on october 8 and then reconvened on november 29 for the sole purpose of passing a bill implementing a new general agreement on tariffs and trade . both chambers then adjourned sine die . in 2004 , congress convened a lame duck session to consider appropriation bills and the debt limit . 7321 , which provided $14 billion in loans to automakers by using funds from an existing program .
