the cost of the premiums paid for dba coverage , if allowable under the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , is generally reimbursable under government contracts . this report assesses ( 1 ) how state managed the transition from a single insurer program to an open market system , ( 2 ) the extent to which this change affected dba premium rates paid by state's contractors , and ( 3 ) the extent to which this change affected small businesses . leading acquisition practices emphasize the importance of allowing enough time to complete a solicitation , adequately documenting market research , and collecting and analyzing data , among other things . we found that state did not follow these leading practices . state had little time to complete its 2012 single insurer solicitation , and when it received no offers , state had to withdraw its solicitation only 3 days before its existing dba contract was due to expire . in 2007 , state did not complete the solicitation process in time to obtain a dba single insurer ; however , in that instance , state was able to reach an agreement with its single insurer to extend the contract for 6 months — an option that it did not have in this instance since it had already agreed with its single insurer that the existing contract would expire on july 21 , 2012 . our analysis of a sample of state contractors' dba rates during the transition from a single insurer program to an open market system showed that the rates increased as state moved to the open market system , but the increases fell in a similar range of those that were likely to have occurred if state had continued its single insurer program . our analysis also showed that the increase in effective dba premium rates after the transition was comparable to the increase in effective dba premium rates requested by state's single dba insurer , which said it had lost money under the prior contract . our analysis of existing federal procurement data did not show a clear effect on contractors that are small businesses resulting from state's transition to an open market system , but insurers and contractors have expressed concern that the change has had or could have an adverse effect . without conducting an assessment , state cannot be assured that it is meeting its policy goal of maximizing opportunities for small businesses . while we cannot determine what effect state's transition had on small businesses based on our analysis of federal procurement data , our discussions with insurance industry officials showed that there is a potential for adverse effects . state's transition from a single insurer program to an open market system was not the result of a policy decision based on an analysis of costs and benefits of both approaches but was required because its 2012 solicitation to select a single insurer failed to yield any bids . evaluate whether a single insurer program or an open market system best serves its needs . incorporate leading practices into any future single insurer solicitations by determining whether existing guidance could be used , or by developing guidance based on leading practices in federal and state department acquisition regulations and state internal control standards . we reviewed state's 2008 dba single insurer contract and its 2012 solicitation . we limited our sample to contractors that: were required to obtain dba coverage for work performed overseas ; signed contracts with state both before and after state's transition to an open market system ; performed work for state overseas in countries affected by the transition to an open market system ; represented a range of contract dollar values and type of work performed ( i.e. , construction , security , or services ) ; and were certified as small businesses by the small business administration . since dba premium rates varied in state's single insurer program according to one of four rate categories , we selected contractors in different rate categories to approximate the representation of service types and contract sizes among all state contractors.we intended to use these interviews to better understand the complexity because and details of how small businesses experienced the transition and to uncover any details potentially not revealed in our analysis of federal procurement data — not to draw generalizable conclusions about all of the small businesses that contracted with state — we determined that eight interviews would be sufficient . to examine our second objective , the impact of the department of state's ( state ) transition to the open market system on premiums paid by state's contractors , we collected data on contractors' defense base act ( dba ) insurance premiums , rates , and payroll during state's single insurer program and in the open market . market research: better documentation needed to inform future procurements at selected agencies .
