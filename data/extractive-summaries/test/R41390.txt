implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) is having a substantial impact on federal mandatory spending . in addition , the aca authorized new medicare spending and appropriated billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support numerous other activities and programs . furthermore , the aca established four special funds — and appropriated amounts to each one — to support primary care , public health , and comparative effectiveness research , and help pay for the administrative costs of the law's implementation . first , there are the amounts provided in appropriations acts for specific grant and other programs pursuant to explicit authorizations of appropriations in the aca . the two agencies primarily responsible for the aca's implementation are the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the internal revenue service ( irs ) , within the department of the treasury . this report is periodically revised and updated to reflect important legislative and administrative developments . the aca authorized numerous new discretionary grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations , typically through fy2014 or fy2015 . many of these provisions authorize annual appropriations of specified amounts for one or more fiscal years to carry out the program . the aca also was a convenient legislative vehicle to reauthorize funding — in most instances through fy2014 or fy2015 — for many existing discretionary grant programs , primarily ones authorized under the public health service act ( phsa ) . the authorizations of appropriations for many of these established programs had expired prior to the aca , though most of them were continuing to receive annual funding . importantly , the aca permanently reauthorized appropriations for the federal health centers program , the national health service corp ( nhsc ) , and many programs and services provided by the indian health service ( ihs ) . all the aca's discretionary spending provisions that include authorizations of appropriations are summarized in a series of tables below . the provisions are organized by general topic under the following headings: health centers and clinics ( table 2 ) ; health care workforce ( table 3 ) ; prevention and wellness ( table 4 ) ; maternal and child health ( table 5 ) ; health care quality ( table 6 ) ; nursing homes ( table 7 ) ; health disparities data collection ( table 8 ) ; emergency care ( table 9 ) ; elder justice ( table 10 ) ; biomedical research ( table 11 ) ; biologics ( table 12 ) ; 340b drug pricing ( table 13 ) ; medical malpractice ( table 14 ) ; pain care management ( table 15 ) ; medicaid ( table 16 ) ; medicare ( table 17 ) ; and private health insurance ( table 18 ) . the third column provides a brief description of the program , including the types of entities and / or individuals eligible for funding , and gives details of the authorization of appropriations . both agencies have requested an increase in their annual appropriations in each of the past five years ( i.e. , fy2013-fy2017 ) to help cover those costs . cms has instead relied on funding from a variety of sources to support the development and operation of the federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) . however , the agency has not provided — or been instructed by congress to provide — a breakdown of its spending on aca implementation . but , as with cms , congress has not given the irs any additional funding . in april 2011 , lawmakers agreed to cuts in discretionary spending for a broad range of agencies and programs as part of negotiations to complete the fy2011 appropriations process and avert a government shutdown . the office of management and budget ( omb ) is responsible for calculating the percentages and amounts by which mandatory and discretionary spending are required to be reduced each year , and for applying the relevant exemptions and special rules .
