nevertheless , because there are more vehicles on the road , because they are being driven more miles , and because the average useful life of a car exceeds the statutorily defined "useful life" over which emission standards must be met , emissions from motor vehicles continue to be a major component of the nation's air pollution problems . the agency reports that in 2013 on - road vehicles accounted for about 34% of carbon monoxide emissions in the united states , 38% of nitrogen oxides , 12% of volatile organic compounds , and 3% of particulate matter . the memorandum directed epa to "review for adequacy the current non - greenhouse gas emissions regulations for new motor vehicles , new motor vehicle engines , and motor vehicle fuels , including tailpipe emissions standards for nitrogen oxides and air toxics , and sulfur standards for gasoline," and to promulgate regulations as required . the final rule is effective on june 27 , 2014 . the tier 3 standards have been controversial since at least a year prior to their proposal , with dueling studies from auto manufacturers , epa , and the petroleum refining industry having been prepared in advance of their release . epa is also extending the regulatory useful life period during which the standards apply from 120,000 miles to 150,000 miles . the evaporative emissions program represents about a 50% reduction from current standards and applies to all light - duty and on - road gasoline - powered heavy - duty vehicles . under the tier 3 fuel program , gasoline is required to contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm ) sulfur on an annual average basis beginning january 1 , 2017 , down from 30 ppm under the tier 2 program ( similar reductions have already been phased in for highway diesel fuels beginning in 2006 ) . epa expects the final tier 3 standards to reduce these adverse impacts and yield significant benefits , including the annual prevention of between 660 and 1,500 pm - related premature deaths , between 110 and 500 ozone - related premature deaths , about 2,200 asthma - related hospital admissions , 81,000 work days lost , 210,000 school absence days , and approximately 1.1 million minor restricted - activity days . auto manufacturers have been generally supportive of the standards , which they view as allowing the adoption of new technology necessary to meet the separate ghg standards already promulgated , and which would harmonize the u.s. fuel requirements with those of foreign fuels . the tier 3 gasoline sulfur standards are similar to levels already achieved in europe , japan , and south korea , as well as those proposed in china and some other countries . in the u.s. context , auto manufacturers already face more stringent requirements for both tailpipe emissions and fuel requirements in california and the section 177 states , and many individual vehicle manufacturers and their trade organizations have emphasized the importance of a nationwide program to enable streamlined production and decreased compliance costs . as a result , api has argued that the tier 3 proposal ignores the results of earlier sulfur standards that had led to "significant reduction in ambient ozone levels and will lead to further ozone reductions for the next decade," adding that tier 3 rules would add no substantial benefit while imposing "significant costs on making gasoline. . in letters to the president before the standards' proposal , several senators of both parties asked that the administration delay the epa rulemaking over concerns that the new fuel standards would raise the price of gasoline ; similar concerns have been expressed in the wake of the final rule . the american petroleum institute contends that the tighter sulfur controls would impose almost $10 billion in refinery capital expenditures , create an annual compliance cost of $2.4 billion , increase gasoline manufacturing costs from 6 to 9 cents per gallon , and increase refinery ghg emissions by 1% . epa has asserted that the rule as proposed would add less than a penny to the price of a gallon of gasoline ( 0.65 cents according to the final rule's regulatory impact analysis ) . in sum , epa estimates the annual compliance cost of the overall program in 2030 would be approximately $1.5 billion ( $760 million for the vehicle program and $700 million for the fuel program ) , and the 2030 benefits would be between $6.7 billion and $19 billion , or 4.5 to 13 times greater than the costs of the program . to address industry concerns , the final rule would allow a three - year delay in compliance for small refiners . it also includes averaging , banking , and trading programs that would give the refining industry flexibility in meeting the standards .
