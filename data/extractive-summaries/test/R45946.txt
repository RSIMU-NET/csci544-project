the movement of employees between the private sector and government is often referred to as the revolving door . individuals may move because they possess policy and procedural knowledge and have relationships with former colleagues that are useful to prospective employers , either in government or in the private sector . some observers see the revolving door as potentially valuable to both private - sector firms and the government ; other observers believe that employees leaving government to join the industries they were regulating , or leaving the private sector to join a relevant government agency , could provide an unfair representational advantage and create the potential for conflicts of interest . using a dataset of executive branch cabinet department officials compiled by graduate students at the bush school of government and public service at texas a&m university in partnership with crs , this report provides empirical data about the use of the revolving door by a subset of federal officials , with a particular focus on those who were registered lobbyists either before or after their government service . this analysis is followed by a discussion of select issues for potential congressional consideration . while most historic revolving door provisions generally addressed individuals exiting government for work in the private sector , some have also addressed individuals entering government . in 1919 , the first restrictions were placed on individuals who had specifically served as procurement officials from leaving government service "to solicit employment in the presentation or to aid or assist for compensation in the prosecution of claims against the united states arising out of any contracts or agreements for the procurement of supplies â¦ which were pending or entered into while the said officer or employee was associated therewith. . in 1962 , portions of the current statutory provision at 18 u.s.c . since the 1960s , postemployment restriction laws have been amended several times , including by the ethics in government act of 1978 to add certain one - year "cooling off" periods for high - level executive branch personnel and limit executive branch official postemployment advocacy ( i.e. , lobbying ) activities ; by the ethics reform act of 1989 ; and by the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 , which extended the "cooling off" period to two years for "very senior" executive branch officials . for example , in 1977 , the senate committee on governmental affairs reported a bill that would have amended the existing revolving door provisions . additional criticism of the revolving door focuses on the worth of a former government employee over time . in every administration , executive branch officials arrive from , and depart to , the private sector . data covers positions such as agency heads and their immediate subordinates , policy executives and advisors , and aides who report to these officials. . four plum books were used to build a dataset of political appointees who served in president george w. bush's and president barack obama's administrations . table 2 lists the cabinet departments included in this study and the number of employees from that cabinet department included in the dataset . in recent years , there has been greater focus on potential additional restrictions that might be placed on individuals entering and exiting government through the introduction of legislation to amend current revolving door restrictions and the issuance of executive orders to temporarily increase the "cooling off" period for executive branch appointees .
