at the same time , the 1980 act anticipated that some shippers might not have competitive alternatives — commonly referred to as “captive shippers” — and gave the interstate commerce commission ( icc ) , and later the surface transportation board ( stb ) , the authority to establish a process so that shippers could obtain relief from unreasonably high rates . my comments today are based on our most recent reports issued in august 2007 and october 2006 , and cover ( 1 ) the changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the enactment of the staggers rail act , including changes in rail rates since 1985 , ( 2 ) the extent of captivity in the industry and stb's efforts to protect captive shippers , and ( 3 ) stb's actions to address our recent recommendations . taken together , these acts anchor the federal government's role in the freight rail industry by establishing numerous goals for regulating the industry , including to allow , to the maximum extent possible , competition and demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail ; minimize the need for federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system and require fair and expeditious regulatory decisions when regulation is required ; promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues , as determined by stb ; ensure the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation system with effective competition among rail carriers and with other modes to meet the needs of the public and the national defense ; foster sound economic conditions in transportation and ensure effective competition and coordination between rail carriers and other modes ; maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues that exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and attract capital ; prohibit predatory pricing and practices to avoid undue concentrations of market power ; and provide for the expeditious handling and resolution of all proceedings . in addition , rail rates have generally declined since 1985 , even though rates began to increase in 2001 and experienced a 9 percent annual increase between 2004 and 2005 — the largest annual increase in 20 years . in 2005 , rates increased for all 13 commodities that we reviewed . in 2005 the amount of industry revenue reported as miscellaneous increased ten - fold over 2000 levels , rising from about $141 million to over $1.7 billion ( see fig . in october 2006 , we reported that captive shippers are difficult to identify and stb's efforts to protect captive shippers have resulted in little effective relief for those shippers . we also reported that economists and shipper groups have proposed a number of alternatives to address remaining concerns about competition – however , each of these alternative approaches have costs and benefits and should be carefully considered to ensure the approach will achieve the important balance set out in the staggers act . it remains difficult to determine precisely how many shippers are “captive” to one railroad because the proxy measures that provide the best indication can overstate or understate captivity . some areas with access to one class i railroad also have more than half of their traffic traveling at rates that exceed the statutory threshold for rate relief . stb has taken some actions to address our past recommendations , but it is too soon to determine the effect of these actions . it will be important that these analysts have the ability that stb has through its statutory authority to inquire into railroad practices as well as sufficient access to information to determine whether rail rates in selected markets reflect justified and reasonable pricing practices , or an abuse of market power by the railroads . we also recommended that stb review its method of data collection to ensure that all freight railroads are consistently and accurately reporting all revenues collected from shippers , including fuel surcharges and other costs not explicitly captured in all railroad rate structures . in august 2007 , stb finalized rules that require railroads to report their fuel costs and revenue from fuel surcharges . while these are positive steps , these rules did not address how surcharges are reported in the carload waybill sample . as stated earlier , stb has also taken steps to refine the rate relief process since our 2006 report . while these appear to be positive steps that could address longstanding concerns with the rate relief process , it is too soon to determine the effect of these changes to the process , and we have not evaluated the effect of these changes . freight railroads: updated information on rates and other industry trends .
