the u.s. congress continues to be concerned about the the u.s. congress continues to be concerned about the underrepresentation of american professionals employed by some united underrepresentation of american professionals employed by some united nations ( un ) organizations and that insufficient progress has been made nations ( un ) organizations and that insufficient progress has been made to improve u.s. representation . these five agencies together comprise approximately 50 percent of total un organizations' professional staff . given projected staff levels , retirements , and separations for 2006-2010 , these agencies need to hire more americans than they have in recent years to meet their minimum targets for equitable u.s. representation in 2010 . u.s. citizens are equitably represented at the un secretariat , though at the lower end of its target range , while the fifth agency — undp — has not established a target for u.s. representation . u.s. citizens fill about 11 percent of undp's professional positions . barriers common to most un agencies we reviewed include nontransparent human resource practices , a limited number of positions open to external candidates , lengthy hiring processes , comparatively low or unclear compensation , required mobility and rotation , and limited u.s. government support . for example , candidates serving in professional un positions funded by their member governments are more likely to be hired by the secretariat than those who take the secretariat's entry - level exam ; however , the united states has not funded such positions at the secretariat . iaea has difficulty attracting u.s. employees because the pool of american nuclear specialists is decreasing . state targets its recruitment efforts for senior and policy - making un positions , and , although it is difficult to directly link state's efforts to un hiring decisions , u.s. representation in these positions has either improved or displayed no trend in the five un agencies we reviewed . state also has increased its efforts to improve overall u.s. representation , including adding staff to its un employment office and increasing coordination with other u.s. agencies ; however , despite these efforts , u.s. representation in entry - level positions has declined or did not reflect a trend in four of the five un agencies we reviewed . additionally , state has increased coordination with other u.s. agencies . state's un vacancy list and its un employment web site also have limitations . as the lead department in charge of u.s. government efforts to promote equitable american representation at the un , the department of state will continue to face a number of barriers to increasing the employment of americans at these organizations , most of which are outside the u.s. government's control . this could include identifying options for developing a benefits calculator that would enable applicants to better estimate their potential total compensation based on their individual circumstances ; expand targeted recruiting and outreach to more strategically reach populations of americans that may be qualified for and interested in entry - and mid - level un positions ; and conduct an evaluation of the costs , benefits , and trade - offs of: maintaining a roster of qualified candidates for professional and senior positions determined to be a high priority for u.s. interests ; funding junior professional officers , or other gratis personnel , where americans are underrepresented or in danger of becoming underrepresented . in this report we reviewed ( 1 ) u.s. representation status and employment trends at five united nations ( un ) organizations , ( 2 ) factors affecting these organizations' ability to meet u.s. representation targets , and ( 3 ) the u.s. department of state's current efforts to improve u.s. representation and additional steps that could be taken . we reviewed five un organizations: the un secretariat ; international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) ; un educational , scientific , and cultural organization ( unesco ) ; office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) ; and un development program ( undp ) .
