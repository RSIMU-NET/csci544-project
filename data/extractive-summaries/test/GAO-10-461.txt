lmp was originally scheduled to be completed by 2005 , but the army delayed fielding lmp because of the significant problems faced by the first deployment sites — the communications - electronics command and tobyhanna army depot — in july 2003 , which we detailed in several reports . however , the effectiveness of the army's management processes could not be evaluated until the second deployment had occurred on may 14 , 2009 . lastly , we met with lmp program management officials to discuss plans for the third deployment of lmp scheduled to occur in october 2010 . the army's management processes that were established prior to the second deployment of lmp were not effective in enabling the second deployment sites to realize the full benefits of lmp . the depots experienced data quality issues , despite improvements the army made to address data quality issues experienced during the first deployment of lmp at tobyhanna army depot , because the army's testing strategy did not provide reasonable assurance that the data being used by lmp were accurate and reliable . additionally , the army's training strategy did not effectively provide users the skills necessary to perform all of their tasks in lmp . users at the depots stated that the training they received before lmp became operational was not conducted in a realistic environment that showed them how to perform their expected duties . the army was unable to realize the full benefits of lmp at the second deployment sites because of data quality issues . although the army's processes addressed some of the data issues from the first deployment of lmp , according to lmp program management office officials , these processes did not assess whether the overall quality of the data that the system would use was sufficient to support the lmp processes . although the army's training strategy was designed to provide lmp users the skills and knowledge to successfully perform their new roles , lmp users we interviewed at corpus christi and letterkenny army depots stated that the training they received prior to lmp becoming operational did not fully meet their needs . the army was unable to determine whether the second deployment sites had achieved the envisioned functionality of lmp because the army lacked a comprehensive set of metrics to measure the success of lmp implementation . our previous work has shown that successful performance measures should be aligned throughout the organization and cover the activities that an entity is expected to perform to support the intent of the program . however , despite the presence of these items , the lmp program management office's scorecard reflected the status of lmp implementation as “green.” for example , a may 28 , 2009 , briefing that was provided to senior army management contained 17 “what's important now” items that identified problems related to missing data , the ability of the depots to fill customer requisitions , the ability to correct data in lmp , and challenges related to issuing materials to the shop floor to support repairs . the army has also achieved benefits through the common picture provided by lmp . the item manager stated that the delays occurred because the item manager's system showed that an item was located at a depot , but the depot's system did not show the item as received , so personnel at the depot had to locate the item before it could be inducted for repair . additionally , lmp program management officials stated that they had developed changes to their testing strategy and that tests are scheduled to begin in may 2010 . unless the army addresses these challenges , the third deployment locations are likely to face the same , or even greater , problems , since the third deployment of lmp will occur at more locations and affect more users than the previous deployments . in written comments on a draft of this report , dod stated that the army concurred with our recommendations and highlighted the corrective actions it is taking to ( 1 ) improve testing activities to obtain reasonable assurance that the data used by lmp can support the lmp processes , ( 2 ) improve training for lmp users , and ( 3 ) establish performance metrics that will enable the army to assess whether the deployment sites are able to use lmp as intended .
