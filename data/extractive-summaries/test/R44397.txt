t he national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) was created in 1958 by the national aeronautics and space act ( p.l . 85-568 ) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities . it has four mission directorates . the science mission directorate manages robotic science missions , such as the hubble space telescope , the mars rover curiosity , and satellites for earth science research . the space technology mission directorate develops new technologies for use in future space missions , such as advanced propulsion and laser communications . the human exploration and operations mission directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities , including the international space station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft . in addition , nasa's office of education manages formal and informal education programs for school children , college and university students , and the general public . while congress is generally supportive of most nasa programs , government - wide fiscal constraints make funding decisions challenging . 5393 , h.rept . the administration has requested $19.025 billion for nasa in fy2017 . the house bill would provide $19.508 billion . the senate bill would provide $19.306 billion . unusually , the fy2017 request includes $763 million in mandatory funds . in the fy 2017 budget , the president proposes fully - paid - for one - year mandatory funding to accelerate progress in science , aeronautics , space technology , and exploration , as well as additional multi - year mandatory funding for aeronautics to support research and development for low carbon emission aircraft , including associated transportation systems , as part of a multi - agency effort to enable a 21 st century clean transportation system . the house and senate bills include no mandatory funding . the fy2017 request for the science mission directorate is $5.601 billion , an increase of 0.2% from fy2016 . within this total , funding for earth science , astrophysics , and heliophysics would increase , while funding for planetary science and the james webb space telescope would decrease . the fy2017 request for the aeronautics research mission directorate is $790 million , an increase of 23.5% from fy2016 . the request includes new aviation horizons ( nah ) , a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations . the fy2017 request for the space technology mission directorate is $827 million , an increase of 20.4% from fy2016 . as shown in table 1 , the house bill would provide $88 million less than the request for space technology , but more than the fy2016 appropriation , while the senate bill would provide the fy2016 amount . the fy2017 request for exploration is $3.337 billion , a decrease of 17.2% from fy2016 . the request for space operations is $5.076 billion , an increase of 0.9% . as shown in table 1 , the house and senate bills would both provide significantly more than the request for exploration and somewhat less than the request for space operations . the fy2017 request for the office of education is $100 million , a decrease of 13.0% from fy2016 . programs of particular congressional interest include the national space grant college and fellowship program ( $24 million ) , the experimental program to stimulate competitive research ( epscor , $9 million ) , and the minority university research education program ( murep , $30 million ) . as shown in table 1 , the house and senate bills would both provide more than the request for the office of education: $115 million and $108 million , respectively . the fy2017 request for safety , security , and mission services , which funds management and operations at the nasa centers and nasa headquarters , is $2.837 billion , an increase of 2.5% from fy2016 .
