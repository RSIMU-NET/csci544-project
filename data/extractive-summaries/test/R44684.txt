the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in congress , or job tenure , is a source of recurring interest among members of congress , congressional staff , those who study staffing in the house and senate , and the public . there may be interest in congressional tenure information from multiple perspectives , including assessment of how a congressional office might oversee human resources issues , how staff might approach a congressional career , and guidance for how frequently staffing changes may occur in various positions . this report provides tenure data for 18 staff position titles that are typically used in senators' offices , and information for using those data for different purposes . the positions include the following: administrative director casework supervisor caseworker chief counsel chief of staff communications director counsel executive assistant field representative legislative assistant legislative correspondent legislative director office manager press secretary regional representative scheduler staff assistant state directo . senators' staff tenure data were calculated for each year between 2006 and 2016 . other data concerns arise from the variation across offices , lack of other demographic information about staff , and lack of information about where congressional staff work . tables in this section provide tenure data for selected positions in senators' personal offices and detailed data and visualizations for each position . the "trend" column provides information on whether the time staff stayed in a position increased , was unchanged , or decreased between 2006 and 2016 . a number of staff who stay in a position for only a brief period may depress the average length of tenure . finally , since each senator's office serves as its own hiring authority , variations from office to office , which for each position may include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which aggregated data provided here might match tenure in a particular office . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position , appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in 10 position titles in senate offices . the median tenure was unchanged for eight positions . this may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . although pay is not the only factor that might affect an individual's decision to remain in or leave a particular job , staff in positions that generally pay less typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in higher - paying positions . some of these lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level positions in some senators' offices ; if so , senate office employees in those roles appear to follow national trends for others in entry - level types of jobs , remaining in the role for a relatively short period of time . similarly , those in more senior positions , which often require a particular level of congressional or other professional experience , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . table a - 1 provides the number of related titles included for each position used in this report or related crs reports on staff tenure .
