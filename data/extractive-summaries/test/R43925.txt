in 2012 , mastercard and visa — also called "payment brands" — set october 1 , 2015 , as the date by which u.s. card issuers — banks and credit unions — would need to have replaced existing credit and debit magnetic stripe cards with chip cards , and for merchants to begin accepting them . chip cards are formally known as "emv" cards , named for the coalition of three companies , europay , mastercard , and visa , that developed the specifications for the standard . chip cards make data stolen in a breach much more difficult to use: counterfeiting is significantly more difficult than with stripe cards . the cost of a complete transition in the united states is expected to be at least $6 billion , but the costs for issuers and merchants that do not meet the adoption deadline could be even greater: now that the deadline has passed , the liability for fraudulent transactions will shift to the party that has not switched to chip cards . additionally , new deadlines are coming in 2016 and 2017 for card - branded atm cards . these breaches are called "pos intrusions. . pos intrusions and the ensuing card fraud are facilitated by what many consider to be the weak link in the u.s. card payment process: the continued use of magnetic stripe cards that carry unencrypted data . the upcoming liability shifts for branded atm cards and the ongoing debate over signature versus pin are two areas of continued work toward a complete shift to chip cards . these bills would have , for example — increased protection for consumers whose card data had been compromised ( e.g. , free credit monitoring for a year ) ; increased penalties for those convicted of identity theft and certain other violations of data privacy and security ; provided for criminal penalties against entities that fail to provide required notice of a breach of personally identifiable information ; defined thresholds for when public notification would be required after a breach ; and / or defined thresholds for when notification of law enforcement or other government entities ( e.g. , secret service , federal bureau of investigation , congressional judiciary committees , federal trade commission ) would be required . given the broad interest in reducing data breaches and fraud , and the october 1 , 2015 , transition deadline , the 114 th congress might examine the effectiveness of the transition to determine whether legislative action may be needed , especially if major breaches continue to occur .
