to assess the extent to which the navy provides complete , quality ships to the fleet , free of government and contractor deficiencies , we reviewed key metrics on ship quality and completeness identified by shipbuilding program offices by analyzing data in: the form dd - 250 material inspection and receiving report , navy board of inspection and survey ( insurv ) reports , and a document called the transfer book — which catalogues deficiencies and the material condition of a ship when it is provided to the fleet at owld — among other documents , for each ship in our review . in addition to these milestones and events that occur on all new navy ships , department of defense ( dod ) acquisition policy also calls for events that usually occur during the post - delivery period on one ship per class , typically the first ( or lead ) ship: initial operational capability ( ioc ) : a key milestone in weapon system acquisitions that typically refers to the point in time when the warfighter ( in the navy's case , the operational fleet ) has the ability to employ and maintain a new system . the navy completes a range of work during the post - delivery period that varies from ship to ship , but generally falls into three categories: incomplete work is all work that was planned to be completed during construction , but was not accomplished . all six ships we reviewed that had completed the post - delivery period — lpd 25 , lha 6 , ddg 112 , lcs 3 , lcs 4 , and ssn 782 — were provided to the fleet with varying degrees of incomplete work and quality problems . it had also corrected nearly all of its minor deficiencies . table 6 provides examples of the quality issues identified by fleet officials on these ships . as such , cvn 78 and ddg 1000 are at greater risk of being provided to the fleet at the end of their post - delivery periods with incomplete construction work and unknown quality . the navy's ship delivery policy and officials with the office of the cno , who are responsible for the policy , identify two different time frames regarding when ships should be complete , defect - free , and mission capable: 1. at delivery , when the navy accepts custody of the ships , and 2. at owld , when the navy provides the ship to the fleet . without clarifying when ships should achieve a certain level of completeness and quality , the navy does not have a clear standard or objective against which it can measure the condition of its ships and ensure quality . while insurv makes a recommendation for ship delivery , officials stated that they do not make a recommendation for provision to the fleet because ship trials are not well - timed to independently verify the completeness and quality of ships at the point when they are provided to the fleet . the correction of these starred deficiencies was therefore not inspected by insurv . congress included a provision in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 that may address this lack of clarity and consistency in reported delivery dates by establishing criteria that must be met in order for a ship to be deemed delivered . dod acquisition guidance and gao best practices state that testing provides critical information to make informed production and other acquisition decisions . further , insurv's only post - delivery trial is not well - timed to independently verify the completeness and quality of ships before they are provided to the fleet . similarly , ioc is reported but does not signify that ships have successfully demonstrated capability . in its written comments , which are reprinted in appendix iii of this report , dod did not concur with two recommendations , partially concurred with a third recommendation , and fully concurred with a fourth recommendation . the response , however , did not indicate that dod will ensure that the criteria used to declare ioc aligns with dod guidance . this report assesses: ( 1 ) the extent to which the navy provides complete , quality ships to the fleet that are free of government and contractor deficiencies ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the navy's policy governing ship delivery facilitates efforts to deliver complete and quality ships ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which navy reports to congress on the progress of shipbuilding programs consistently define key milestones such as ship delivery and initial operational capability . littoral combat ship and frigate: congress faced with critical acquisition decisions .
