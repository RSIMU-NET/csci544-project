the united republic of tanzania is an east african country of nearly 54 million people that is about twice as large as california . president john magufuli was elected in 2015 and is serving his first five - year term in office . since the 2015 elections , however , u.s. concerns about tanzania's governance have raised some tensions . such concerns have centered on the nullification of the 2015 election results ( and the subsequent rerun in 2016 ) in the semiautonomous coastal region of zanzibar , restrictions on civil liberties , and similar issues . citing such concerns , in march 2016 , the u.s. millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) board announced it would suspend its partnership with tanzania , deferring a vote on the country's continued eligibility for a potential second large development compact ; this effectively ended , for the time being , the development of a second mcc compact with tanzania , following its completion of an initial compact between 2008 and 2013 . how bilateral ties may proceed under the trump administration and during the 115 th congress has yet to be determined , but they appear likely to remain on a positive track . an april 26 , 2017 , press release issued under the name of secretary of state rex tillerson characterized the u.s. - tanzanian relationship as "strong," and "marked by a collaborative effort toward shared goals and close cooperation on a variety of programs and initiatives , from health and education , promoting economic growth and democratic governance , and advancing regional security," and projected similar trends in the future . in 2014 tanzania was selected as one of six initial partner countries under the obama administration's african peacekeeping rapid response partnership ( aprrp ) . while most u.s. aid has focused on health and economic growth , bilateral security cooperation has also increased . tanzania is a top african contributor of personnel to international peacekeeping operations . while there is generally little tanzania - focused congressional activity or legislation , some members of congress occasionally travel to the country and periodically host visits from tanzanian leaders , such as that of former president jakaya kikwete during the august 2014 u.s. - africa leaders summit . tanzania , formed in 1964 , is a union of tanganyika , the mainland territory , which gained independence from britain in 1961 , and the zanzibar archipelago . despite a stated commitment to reform , corruption and poor service delivery have hampered tanzania's efforts to curb widespread poverty and reduce reliance on subsistence agriculture . nevertheless , the obama administration viewed the tanzanian government as committed to development and governance reform , and provided substantial aid to spur progress in these areas , and to invest in infrastructure . tanzania's ruling party , chama cha mapinduzi ( ccm , swahili for party of the revolution ) , was created by nyerere in 1977 through the merger of the ruling parties of the mainland and zanzibar . still , opposition parties reportedly face periodic harassment and de facto restrictions on their activities . lissu , who is also the president of the tanganyika law society , is a fierce critic of president magufuli and his government , but also a long - standing critic of corruption who may face hostility from many quarters . other opposition parliamentarians also face frequent duress from police . this growth has been based largely on earnings from agricultural exports , such as coffee , tea , and cotton ; tourism , which has steadily increased and is a key source of hard currency ; and exports of gold , the price of which rose over the past decade and spiked in 2011 , but has since declined . former president kikwete was the first african head of state to meet with former president obama after obama took office in 2009 . the united states , while expressing periodic concern over issues such as corruption , appears likely — as suggested by bilateral relations trends and aid levels in recent years — to continue to support the strengthening of tanzania's democratic system and the socioeconomic development of its people , and to look to tanzania as a key development partner in east and southern africa .
