over the past 15 years , various reform efforts have attempted to shift the focus of federal government management from a preoccupation with activities to the results or outcomes of those activities . prior to these efforts , our work on performance measurement in the federal government showed that federal agencies generally lacked the infrastructure needed to manage and report on the results of federal programs in a way that was transparent to congress and the american people . this capacity includes an infrastructure of outcome - oriented strategic plans , performance measures , and accountability reporting that has significantly increased over time and provides a solid foundation for improving the performance of federal programs . you asked us to discuss: ( 1 ) the trends in federal managers' reported use of performance information governmentwide and at the agency level as identified through four surveys we conducted over the past 10 years ; ( 2 ) how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve federal program management ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned to be considered by the next congress and administration for future performance improvement initiatives . in summary , our surveys show that , while significantly more federal managers' have performance measures for their programs and some agencies have shown greater use of information , overall the use of performance information in management decision making has not changed over the last 10 years . first , the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last decade to ensure that the performance information gathered is used in making management decisions: ( 1 ) demonstrating leadership commitment to results - oriented management ; ( 2 ) developing a clear “line of sight” linking individual performance with organizational results ; and ( 3 ) building agency capacity to collect and use performance information . in addition , the next administration should focus its attention on: ( 1 ) adopting a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance ; ( 2 ) improving the relevance of performance information to congress ; and ( 3 ) building agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making . we will be issuing a report at a later date that addresses both these questions , including an analysis of practices at selected agencies . in addition to the survey results , we also drew from our extensive prior work on gpra , part , transformational change , and performance management . similarly , managers who believed their immediate supervisor paid attention to the use of performance information in decision making also perceived that managers at their level made greater use of performance information . at the same time , an increasing portion of senior executives report they are being held more accountable for results .
