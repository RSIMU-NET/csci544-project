for the past 11 years , certain material weaknesses in financial reporting and other limitations on the scope of our work have resulted in conditions that prevented us from expressing an opinion on the federal government's accrual basis consolidated financial statements . we have reported that the federal government did not have adequate systems , controls , and procedures for preparing the cfs . the purpose of this report is to ( 1 ) discuss the details of the material weaknesses we identified during our audit of the fiscal year 2007 cfs relating to internal control over the processes used to prepare the cfs , ( 2 ) recommend improvements to address these weaknesses , and ( 3 ) provide the status of corrective actions taken by treasury and omb to address the 81 recommendations detailed in our previous reports ( see app . as part of our audit of the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 cfs , we evaluated the federal government's financial reporting procedures and related internal control , and we followed up on the status of corrective actions taken by treasury and omb to address open recommendations relating to the processes used to prepare the cfs that were in our previous reports . over the past several years , treasury has developed and documented numerous standard operating procedures ( sop ) for preparing the cfs , which have substantially addressed gao's recommendation for treasury to develop and document policies and procedures for preparing the cfs . the federal government reports a unified budget deficit ( budget deficit ) in the reconciliation of net operating cost and the unified budget deficit and in the statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities . omb and treasury have continued to work with federal agencies to reduce these material unreconciled differences . we recommend that the director of omb direct the controller of omb's office of federal financial management , in coordination with treasury's fiscal assistant secretary , to develop formal processes and procedures for identifying and resolving any material differences in distributed offsetting receipt amounts included in the net outlay calculation of federal agencies' sbrs and the amounts included in the computation of the budget deficit in the cfs . this appendix includes recommendations that were open at the beginning of our fiscal year 2007 audit from five of our previous reports: financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government needs improvement , gao - 04-45 ( washington , d.c.: oct. 30 , 2003 ) ; financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government needs further improvement , gao - 04- 866 ( washington , d.c.: sept. 10 , 2004 ) ; financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government continues to need improvement , gao - 05-407 ( washington , d.c.: may 4 , 2005 ) ; financial audit: significant internal control weaknesses remain in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government , gao - 06-415 ( washington , d.c.: apr . of the 81 recommendations relating to the processes used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) that are listed in this appendix , 35 were closed and 46 remained open as of december 10 , 2007 , the date of our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2007 cfs .
