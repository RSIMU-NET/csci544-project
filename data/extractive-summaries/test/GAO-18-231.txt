we were asked to review dod's performance outcomes from brac 2005 . air force officials stated that they did not measure the achievement of goals but that it would have been helpful to have metrics to measure success , especially as dod had requested from congress another brac round . given that dod did not concur with our 2013 recommendation and does not plan to act upon it , dod is not currently required to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and track achievement of its brac goals in future rounds . specifically , some military organizations we met with stated that they could not communicate to brac decision makers information outside of the data - collection process , which ultimately hindered analysis . for example: officials from the army human resources command in fort knox , kentucky , said that facilities data submitted during the data - collection process did not convey a complete picture of excess capacity at the installation , and officials at fort knox were unable to share the appropriate context or details because nondisclosure agreements prevented communication . as a result , the army ultimately constructed a new headquarters building for the human resources command at fort knox and dod spent approximately $55 million more than estimated to complete this action . using fiscal year 2010 military construction funding , dod spent approximately $27.7 million to create a landing field for use by the new marine corps f - 35 training squadron mission at eglin air force base . this lack of specific guidance to monitor and report mission - related changes that arose during brac 2005 implementation ultimately resulted in inefficient use of space and extra costs for dod . without providing specific guidance to monitor and report mission - related changes that require significant changes to the recommendation business plans , dod will not be able to effectively monitor the efficient use of space and the costs associated with implementing any future brac recommendations . of the 14 recommendations we made from 2007 to 2017 to help dod address challenges affecting brac's disposal phase , dod generally agreed with 12 of them . dod concurred and actions are pending . we had previously recommended that dod and the department of housing and urban development — which , with dod , develops the implementing regulations for the brac homeless - assistance process — include information on legal alternatives to providing on - base property to expedite the redevelopment process , but dod did not concur and stated no action is expected . by instituting improvements to the analysis , implementation , and disposal phases in any future brac round , dod could better inform decision making , better ensure that its infrastructure meets the needs of its force structure , and better position itself to gain congressional approval for additional rounds of brac in the future . congress enacting a requirement for dod to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and to track the achievement of its goals , alongside the requirement to prioritize military value , would address dod's concern about subverting a statutory requirement related to military value . the objectives of our review were to assess the extent that the department of defense ( dod ) ( 1 ) measured the achievement of goals for reducing excess infrastructure , transforming the military , and promoting jointness for the 2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) round and ( 2 ) implemented prior gao recommendations and addressed any additional challenges faced in brac 2005 to improve performance for any future brac round .
