our testimony today lays out our preliminary observations on these issues and highlights areas of further examination . lead in drinking water is regulated under the act's 1991 lead and copper rule . in addition , drinking water systems may consult with state health agencies when communicating with their customers about health risks from drinking water . you asked that we ( 1 ) examine the current structure and level of coordination among key government entities that implement the safe drinking water act's regulations for lead in the district of columbia , and identify any improvements to increase efficiency and accountability , ( 2 ) determine how other drinking water systems that exceeded the epa action level for lead have conducted public notification and outreach , ( 3 ) assess the availability of data necessary to determine which adult and child populations are at greatest risk of exposure to elevated lead levels , and what information wasa is gathering to help track their health , ( 4 ) evaluate the state of research on lead exposure , and how this information could help inform other drinking water utilities of potential problems in their systems . we will also examine interrelationships among other key agencies ( such as the aqueduct and the d.c. department of health ) ; how other water systems in similar situations interacted with federal , state , and local agencies ; and what the experiences of these other jurisdictions may suggest concerning how improved coordination can better protect drinking water in the district of columbia . for example , some of the practices of the two systems we have begun to examine — the massachusetts water resources authority and the portland water bureau — include tailoring their communications to varied audiences in their service areas , testing the effectiveness of their communication materials , and linking demographic and infrastructure data to identify populations at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . wasa faces challenges in collecting the information needed to identify district citizens at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . in our future work , we will examine the efforts of other water systems to go one step further by linking data on at - risk populations ( such as pregnant mothers , infants , and small children ) with data on homes suspected of being served by lead service pipes and other plumbing fixtures that may leach lead into drinking water . much is known about the hazards of lead in the human body and about how lead from paint , soil , and dust enter the body . however , little research has been done to determine actual lead exposure from drinking water , and the information that does exist is dated . drinking water is provided to district of columbia residents under a unique organizational structure: the u.s. army corps of engineers' washington aqueduct draws water from the potomac river and filters and chemically treats it to meet epa specifications . in the case of drinking water in the district of columbia , one of the key relationships is the one between wasa , the deliverer of water to district customers , and epa's philadelphia office , the regulator charged with overseeing wasa's compliance with drinking water regulations . aside from the tap water monitoring issue , epa's philadelphia office acknowledges that its oversight of wasa public notification and education efforts could have been better , noting that “in hindsight , epa should have asked more questions about the extent , coverage and impact of dc wasa's public education program , and reacted to fill the public education gaps where they were evident.” to address the problem , the philadelphia office reported on its website that it will have to make some improvements in the way it exercises its own oversight responsibilities . mr. chairman , this completes my prepared statement .
