the incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in u.s. waters , eclipsing the magnitude of the 1989 exxon valdez spill after four to five days . based on the most recent estimate from the federal government's flow rate technical group , the deepwater well ultimately released more than 200 million gallons ( or 4.9 million barrels ) of crude oil ( see "well flow rate estimates" below ) . although decreasing amounts of oil were observed on the ocean surface following the well containment , oil spill response officials and researchers have found oil in other places . a pressing question raised by many stakeholders is where did the oil go ? . because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders . these perceptions may be influenced by multiple factors , including oil spill assessments and their methods , the group that prepared the assessment ( and perceived biases of the group ) , and the manner in which the assessment is presented . if policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment , attention to oil spill's consequences and associated impacts may wane . on the other hand , a perception that a substantial volume of oil remains and poses a threat to the environment could result in continuing pressure on gulf industries and livelihoods . the fate of the oil may be of interest to policymakers for other reasons , including oversight of oil spill response performance and assessment of the government's capability to monitor oil spills in the environment . these include the chemical composition of the oil , a complex collection of natural processes and pathways , the location of the spill or discharge , and human intervention . on november 23 , 2010 , the federal government released a peer - reviewed "technical document" that further explained how the estimates were derived ; in some cases , the november document modified the august estimates . even assuming that approximately half of the oil has been removed from the gulf marine environment through direct recovery , burning , skimming , or evaporation , a substantial portion of oil — over 100 million gallons — remained in the gulf as of the oil budget estimate . the most recent authoritative assessment — the november oil budget document — contained estimates based on calculations made in july 2010 . months later , it is unknown what happened to the oil that remained . it is debatable whether the fate of the remaining oil will ever be established conclusively . multiple challenges hinder this objective: the complexity of the gulf system ; resources required to collect data ; and varied interpretations over the results and observations . moreover , as time progresses , determining the fate of the oil will likely become more difficult . regardless , the question of oil fate will likely be addressed through an incremental process . researchers are continuing to study various components of the gulf , specifically damages to natural resources . some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil's fate .
