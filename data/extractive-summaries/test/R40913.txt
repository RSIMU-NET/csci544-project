a major result has been the establishment of a number of programs focused on energy efficiency and conservation of domestic resources and on research programs that target the development of renewable sources of energy . many of the current programs have been reauthorized and redesigned periodically to meet changing economic conditions and national interests . the programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia , and from state and local governments to rural communities . since 2005 , congress has enacted several major energy laws: the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ; p.l . 109-58 ) ; the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ; p.l . 110-140 ) ; the energy improvement and extension act ( eiea ) , enacted as division b of the emergency economic stabilization act ( eesa ; p.l . 110-343 ) ; and the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) . each of those laws established , expanded , or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment ( rdd&d ) programs . the department of energy ( doe ) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs . the department of the treasury and the department of agriculture ( usda ) operate several programs . a few programs can also be found among the departments of the interior ( doi ) , labor ( dol ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) . this report outlines current federal programs and provisions providing grants , loans , loan guarantees , and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency , energy conservation , and renewable energy rdd&d . incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes . appendix a . energy efficiency and renewable energy technology deployment , demonstration , and commercialization grant program 5 . renewable energy grants ( 1603 program ) appendix d. appendix d. summary of expired federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives / index of program .
