between february 2015 and november 2016 more than 85 united states marshals service ( usms ) employees made allegations that usms officials engaged in improper promotion practices — such as routinely pre - selecting favored candidates and offering detail assignments to certain individuals based on non - merit factors — among others . in recent years , several internal and external investigations have substantiated several allegations . in light of ongoing congressional questions , you asked us to assess the extent to which usms's promotion processes and policies ensure the selection of candidates based on merit as well as any effects that usms promotion practices may have on employee morale . to what extent are the usms's merit promotion policies aligned with federal guidelines ? . what steps , if any , has the usms taken to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion policies and processes ? . to address these objectives , we analyzed relevant usms documentation and data . in determining whether the usms merit promotion policies are aligned with federal guidelines , we reviewed relevant provisions in title 5 of the united states code and the code of federal regulations and compared these with certain provisions in the usms merit promotion plan . specifically , we examined the extent to which the usms merit promotion plan conformed to the five general requirements outlined in title 5 of the code of federal regulations that agencies must incorporate in merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection . at each location , we interviewed the u.s . usms mission areas include fugitive apprehension , witness protection , and federal prisoner transportation , among others . u.s . usms's office of professional responsibility ( opr ) oversees the internal compliance review of usms staff , division , and district offices , which assess compliance with doj and usms policies and procedures , and ensures the integrity of the agency's internal controls . we found that raters may directly compete with candidates whose merit promotion packages they score . usms also does not monitor the implementation of the rating component of its process to ensure that raters complied with a key merit promotion process requirement . specifically , usms guidance states that raters are expected to decline to score a candidate's application if there is a conflict of interest with the candidate , for example , a former employee or supervisor relationship or a close personal relationship . although usms does not monitor the implementation of key aspects of its rating process to mitigate potential rater conflicts of interest or bias , usms has begun to implement changes that could address these deficiencies . although usms is implementing a new competency assessment process for gs - 13 merit promotions , it is not clear at this time whether the new process will address concerns about inconsistent rater scoring because the agency plans to use new benchmarks that were developed by a third - party contractor in collaboration with usms subject matter experts to determine candidate scores . while usms provides raters with benchmarks and verbal guidance on how to apply the benchmarks when scoring applications , usms has not documented guidance for raters . by developing clear and specific documented guidance on how raters should interpret and apply the benchmark guidelines , usms could minimize rater subjectivity and scoring inconsistency for both the current rating process and the forthcoming competency - based assessment . specifically , in response to the survey statement , promotions in my work unit are based on merit , an estimated 41 percent of usms respondents strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement , while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed , and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed . for example , among the 85 employees in our discussion groups: sixty - three employees expressed the view that the merit promotion process lacks transparency because hrd does not effectively communicate with employees about procedural steps or process changes , contributing to a lack of understanding about the process . providing specific and consistent information to employees about key steps in the merit promotion process and internal management decisions , and constructive feedback to employees on the results of the promotion process , including employee readiness for promotion , would improve transparency and help mitigate employee perceptions of favoritism that have negatively impacted employee morale . in light of the significant distrust in the merit promotion practices we heard from employees , usms management can also take further action to better understand and appropriately address employee concerns , such as providing employees specific feedback on the results of the promotion process , including their readiness for promotion and developing an agency - wide action plan to more fully understand and address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the merit promotion process .
