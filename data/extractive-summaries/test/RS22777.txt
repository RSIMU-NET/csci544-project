china has been a strong proponent of an arms control regime in space and has argued for the peaceful use of outer space in the united nations' conference on disarmament and at the prevention of an arms race in outer space dialogue . mistrust of chinese space intentions grew in the mid - 1990s when u.s. companies were accused of transferring potentially sensitive military information to china . the international community condemned the test as an irresponsible act because it polluted that orbital slot with thousands of pieces of debris that will threaten the space assets of more than two dozen countries , including china's , for years . given china's apparent commitment to space , the growing u.s. dependence on space for security and military use , and chinese concerns over taiwan , the asat test may have been a demonstration of strategic chinese deterrence . others saw a more nefarious display of china's space capabilities , and a sign that china has more ambitious objectives in space . the potential benefits of expanded cooperation and dialogue with china include: improved transparency . space policy dialogue . joint activities .
