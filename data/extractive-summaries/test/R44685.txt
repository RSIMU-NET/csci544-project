the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in congress , or job tenure , is a source of recurring interest among members of congress , congressional staff , those who study staffing in the house and senate , and the public . there may be interest in congressional tenure information from multiple perspectives , including assessment of how a congressional office might oversee human resources issues , how staff might approach a congressional career , and guidance for how frequently staffing changes may occur in various positions . this report provides tenure data for 15 staff position titles that are typically used in senate committees , and information for using those data for different purposes . the positions include the following: chief clerk chief counsel communications director counsel deputy staff director legislative assistant minority staff director press secretary professional staff member senior counsel senior professional staff member staff assistant staff director subcommittee staff director systems administrato . senate committee staff tenure data were calculated for each year between 2006 and 2016 . no aggregate measure of individual congressional career length is provided in this report . tables in this section provide tenure data for selected positions in senate committees and detailed data and visualizations for each position . table 1 provides a summary of staff tenure for selected positions since 2006 . the "trend" column provides information on whether the time staff stayed in a position increased , was unchanged , or decreased between 2006 and 2016 . a number of staff who stay in a position for only a brief period may depress the average length of tenure . finally , since each senate committee serves as its own hiring authority , variations from committee to committee , which for each position may include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which data provided here might match tenure in a particular office . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position , appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in four position titles in senate committees . the median tenure was unchanged for seven positions , and decreased for four positions . this may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . although pay is not the only factor that might affect an individual's decision to remain in or leave a particular job , staff in positions that generally pay less typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in higher - paying positions . some of these lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level positions in some senate committees ; if so , senate committee employees in those roles appear to follow national trends for others in entry - level types of jobs , remaining in the role for a relatively short period of time . similarly , those in more senior positions , which often require a particular level of congressional or other professional experience , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . other job title variations reflect factors specific to particular offices , since each office functions as its own hiring authority . table a - 1 provides the number of related titles included for each position used in this report or related crs reports on staff tenure .
