we also subsequently produced reports that have discussed the interagency program office in relation to va's efforts to develop a lifetime electronic health record capability for servicemembers and veterans , develop a joint electronic record capability with dod , and promote increased electronic health record system interoperability . similarly , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 defines interoperability , per its use in the provision governing va's and dod's electronic health records , as “the ability of different electronic health records systems or software to meaningfully exchange information in real time and provide useful results to one or more systems.” thus , in these contexts , interoperability allows patients' electronic health information to be available from provider to provider , regardless of where the information originated . the act also called for the departments to set up the interagency program office to be a single point of accountability for their efforts to implement these systems or capabilities by the september 30 , 2009 , deadline . further , while the office had begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter , it was not yet fulfilling key it management responsibilities in the areas of performance measurement ( as we previously recommended ) , project planning , and scheduling , which were essential to establishing the office as a single point of accountability for the departments' interoperability efforts . va and dod stated that they agreed with this recommendation . nevertheless , the office's efforts in these areas did not fully satisfy the recommendations and were incomplete . in our february 2011 report on the departments' efforts to address their common health it needs , we noted that , among other things , the interagency program office had not developed an approved integrated master schedule , master program plan , or performance metrics for the vler initiative , as outlined in the office's charter . to oversee this new effort , in october 2011 , va and dod re - chartered the interagency program office to give it increased authority , expanded responsibilities , and increased staffing levels for leading the integrated system effort . however , in february 2013 , the secretaries of va and dod announced that they would not continue with their joint development of a single electronic health record system . further , we recommended that va and dod better position the office to function as the single point of accountability for achieving interoperability between the departments' electronic health record systems by ensuring that the office has authority ( 1 ) over dedicated resources ( e.g. , budget and staff ) , ( 2 ) to develop interagency processes , and ( 3 ) to make decisions over the departments' interoperability efforts . as a result , we recommended that va and dod , working with the interagency program office , take actions to establish a time frame for identifying outcome - oriented metrics , define goals to provide a basis for assessing and reporting on the status of interoperability - related activities and the extent to which interoperability is being achieved by the departments' modernized electronic health record systems , and update interagency program office guidance to reflect the metrics and goals identified . further , in following up on implementation of the recommendations in our august 2015 report , we found that va , dod , and the interagency program office had addressed the recommendations in full by updating guidance to include goals and objectives and an approach to developing metrics that would improve the departments' ability to report on the status of interoperability activities . as we testified in june 2018 , va has taken steps to establish a program management office and has drafted a structure for technology , functional , and joint governance of the electronic health record implementation . accordingly , the officials have not yet indicated what role , if any , the interagency program office is to have in the governance process . we are making the following recommendation to va: the secretary of veterans affairs should ensure that the role and responsibilities of the interagency program office are clearly defined within the governance plans for acquisition of the department's new electronic health record system .
