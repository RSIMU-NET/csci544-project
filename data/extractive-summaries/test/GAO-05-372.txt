postal service's ( usps ) international mail facilities or private carriers ; the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) food and drug administration ( fda ) , which is responsible for ensuring the safety , effectiveness , and quality of domestic and imported drugs ; the department of justice's drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , which regulates controlled substances ; and the department of homeland security's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , which has law enforcement responsibilities that include investigations of prescription drugs coming into the united states through the mail and express carriers . however , these estimates also have limitations , being partially based on extrapolations from limited fda observations at international mail branch facilities . at the time , fda officials said that because they were unable to process the volume of targeted packages , they released tens of thousands of packages containing drug products that may violate current prohibitions and could have posed a health risk to consumers . while the new procedures may encourage uniform practices at the mail facilities , packages that contain potentially prohibited prescription drugs continue to be released to the addressee . according to fda , the purpose of the new procedures was to “provide a standard operating environment for the prioritized selection , examination and admissibility determination of fda - regulated pharmaceuticals imported into the united states via international mail.” under the procedures , cbp personnel are to forward to fda personnel any mail items , from fda's national list of targeted countries and based on local criteria , that appear to contain prescription drugs . we identified three factors beyond inspection and interdiction that have complicated federal efforts to enforce the prohibitions on prescription drugs imported for personal use: ( 1 ) the volume of importation has strained limited federal resources ; ( 2 ) internet pharmacies , particularly foreign - based sites , can operate outside of the u.s. regulatory system for noncontrolled and controlled prescription drugs and can evade federal law enforcement actions ; and ( 3 ) current law requires that fda notify addressees that their packages have been detained because they appear unapproved for import and give them the opportunity to provide admissibility evidence regarding their imported items . fda and dea officials said that the companies have been willing to work with government agencies to stop transactions involving prescription drugs prohibited from import , and some have alerted federal officials when suspicious activity is detected . this task force appears to be a step in the right direction . however , its efforts could be further enhanced if the task force established a strategic framework to promote accountability and guide resource and policy decisions . since 1999 , federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies have organized various task forces and working groups to address issues associated with purchasing prescription drugs over the internet ; however , recent efforts have begun to focus particular attention on imported prescription drugs . he said that the plans developed by fda in 1999 are still viable as far as domestic sales are concerned , but they have not been refocused to reflect concerns about imported prescriptions and did not position federal law enforcement agencies to anticipate the increased volume of drugs that are imported by individuals . cbp and other agencies have taken a step in the right direction by establishing a task force designed to address many of the challenges discussed in this report . fda has suggested that the hhs secretary consider proposing changes to this requirement , but the hhs secretary has not yet responded with a legislative proposal . at a minimum , this strategic framework should include establishment of an approach for estimating the scope of the problem , such as the volume of drugs entering the country through mail and carrier facilities ; establishment of objectives , milestones , and performance measures and a methodology to gauge results ; determination of the resources and investments needed to address the flow of prescription drugs illegally imported for personal use and where resources and investments should be targeted ; and an evaluation component to assess progress , identify barriers to achieving goals , and suggest modifications .
