prototyping — the development and testing of a model or system design that uses available or emerging technologies — can be employed in weapon system acquisition programs to reduce risk by maturing technologies and to improve understanding of a potential system's likely design , feasibility , cost , and schedule before making major funding commitments . house report 114-102 accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2016 included a provision that we review how dod's research and development funds are used and whether this approach effectively supports activities such as prototyping . this report assesses ( 1 ) how dod has used prototyping prior to system development on major defense acquisition programs , and ( 2 ) what steps dod has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities conducted outside of major defense acquisition programs . to determine how dod has used prototyping in mdaps , we examined 22 mdaps that entered system development between december 2009 — which is when dod implemented new prototyping requirements enacted by congress in the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( wsara ) — and february 2016 . one of the purposes of this type of prototyping can be to further disruptive innovation . the programs we reviewed used prototyping primarily to reduce technical risks , investigate integration challenges , validate designs , and mature technologies . prototyping provided programs with information on technology maturity , the feasibility of the design concepts , potential costs , and the achievability of planned performance requirements , which helped inject realism into their business cases . however , these initiatives face barriers , such as limited funding and competing priorities . literature on private sector innovation , including the use of prototyping , identifies key enablers for these types of efforts , such as developing a strategy for innovation , identifying relative levels of investments that align with innovation goals , and protecting funding for technology investments that have higher risk , but perhaps more reward across the enterprise . dod has taken steps that are consistent with a few of these enablers , but lacks others , such as an innovation strategy that could also address the role of prototyping . if a prototyping effort is completed after an acquisition program has begun , the program may not be willing to adopt it . the ndaa for fiscal year 2017 included a provision that could provide more information about funding for select prototyping initiatives outside of acquisition programs . to help ensure dod takes a strategic approach for its prototyping and innovation initiatives and overcomes funding and cultural barriers , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for research and engineering to take the following four actions: develop a high - level dod - wide strategy , in collaboration with the military services and other appropriate dod components , to communicate strategic goals and priorities and delineate roles and responsibilities among dod's prototyping and innovation initiatives . this increase is driven by new projects as well as testing and development efforts on existing projects .
