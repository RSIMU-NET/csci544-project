over the past 50 years , the court has drawn a line between speech that advocates violence in the abstract and speech that facilitates it in a specific way , with the former receiving more robust constitutional protections . in more recent years , some have begun to question whether and how the court's decisions in this area should apply to speech online . a number of legal scholars have explored these issues , and some have proposed recommendations to congress about how best to address these concerns in accordance with the first amendment . although governmental efforts to combat online content promoting terrorism or violence could take a number of forms , this report focuses on the first amendment implications of imposing civil or criminal liability on individual internet users ( i.e. , the originators of the content ) rather than the social media companies or internet service providers themselves . the report then discusses the overarching first amendment principles that bear on what the government may regulate under the first amendment , including ( 1 )  the distinction between regulating conduct and speech ; ( 2 )  the presumed invalidity of content - based laws ; and ( 3 )  relevant "unprotected" categories of speech that generally can be restricted because of their content . at the same time , some commentators have questioned the purported link between what some refer to as "hate speech" and bias - motivated crimes or have expressed concern that focusing on the ideological motivations of speakers has led to calls to criminalize protected speech divorced from any criminal intent or action . while the first amendment may extend to u.s. citizens speaking abroad or foreign nationals speaking within the united states under some circumstances , the supreme court has not directly opined on whether the first amendment applies to online content that a foreign national posts while located outside of the united states . nevertheless , the court's decisions involving the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections , as well as lower court decisions involving the first amendment rights of foreign nationals , suggest that foreign nationals may face barriers in claiming first amendment protections for such speech . 2010 ) ( same ) . while finding it unnecessary to decide in that case "whether the [f]irst [a]mendment limits the actions of u.s. officials in their dealings with foreign parties," judge ginsburg noted the following principle from the restatement ( third ) of foreign relations : the provisions of the united states constitution safeguarding individual rights generally control the united states government in the conduct of its foreign relations as well as in domestic matters , and generally limit governmental authority whether it is exercised in the united states or abroad , and whether such authority is exercised unilaterally or by international agreement . to determine whether a law targets expression and depending on the facts of the case , a court might consider ( 1 )  the express terms ( i.e. , "the face" ) of the law , ( 2 )  the purpose of the law , or ( 3 )  its practical application to see whether the law is directed at certain content or speakers or applies to the challenger's activities solely as a result of what that party seeks to communicate . it reasoned that the law itself "regulates speech on the basis of its content" because whether plaintiffs are subject to prosecution "depends on what they say. . unlike a law involving "material support," which , in the court's view , "most often" takes the form of conduct rather than speech , a law that expressly prohibits or restricts , for example , social media posts promoting terrorism or violence would more clearly involve speech because of its central focus on communications . although the supreme court has not had many occasions to consider laws that expressly restrict online content , in a first amendment challenge to a federal law that restricted the online transmission of certain "indecent" and "patently offensive" content , both the parties and the court evaluated the law as regulating speech , not conduct . accordingly , a law that restricts speech concerning "politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion" generally receives strict scrutiny . when a law regulates protected speech , courts generally apply strict scrutiny and require the government to show that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest . in contrast , laws that primarily regulate nonexpressive conduct or unprotected speech normally are not subjected to strict scrutiny . this section examines the strict scrutiny test and the overbreadth doctrine , as well as applications of those doctrines in the context of terrorism - related offenses and criminal prosecutions involving online speech , as those standards and precedents are likely to affect how the government may regulate online speech promoting terrorism or violence . in this regard , speech on the internet advocating violence as an abstract proposition would likely be considered protected , while speech that incites imminent violence , constitutes a true threat , or is integral to criminal conduct may be deemed unprotected . finally , the government may have more leeway to regulate online content when asserting its interests in national security and foreign affairs ; however , such laws , to the extent they restrict or burden protected speech , would likely have to withstand heightened ( if not strict ) first amendment scrutiny .
