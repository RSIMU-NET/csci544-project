in the past , there have been allegations of recruiter misconduct with applicants resulting in negative perceptions about military service . additionally , in june 2014 , the arng strength maintenance division began a pilot effort through its recruiting standards branch to conduct inspections to help provide oversight of state - level recruiting activities , but the branch has not been permanently established to ensure ongoing monitoring . specifically , in january 2010 , we found that the arng's data on recruiter irregularities — or , wrongdoings on the part of recruiters — were incomplete and recommended that dod take actions to increase visibility and track recruiter - irregularities . dod concurred with our recommendations and took steps to clarify , share , and track recruiter irregularity data . as of july 16 , 2015 this office had completed inspections in 16 states . the approval for permanent staff may not take place until early 2017 . arng strength maintenance division officials stated that they believe that continued oversight of state recruiting activities is important and that currently they are using positions for the arng recruiting standards branch that are intended for use in other areas . without permanently establishing an entity , such as the arng recruiting standards branch or other entity , to conduct inspections of state - level recruiting activities , the director , arng may be limited in its ability to ensure that arng policies and procedures are being properly implemented by the states . the arng had mixed results in meeting its overall recruiting goals and nearly met its goals for initial military training ; however , the arng does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service or military obligation . having this information could be particularly important in light of our analysis above showing that about 40 percent of soldiers who joined from fiscal years 2001 through 2007 did not complete their initial term of service . financial incentives are a tool available to recruiters , and arng incentives policy states that the incentives assist leadership in meeting and sustaining arng readiness requirements and provides incentives to assist in filling critical shortages . without providing recruiters with training on how to utilize available tools , such as use of financial incentives to fill positions , recruiters may not have an understanding of which military positions are considered critical and are not best positioned to utilize available financial incentives to fill these positions . osd has not monitored the amounts of incentives obligated through the arng incentives programs . as previously noted , the arng strength maintenance division and arng - hrm have not ensured that recruiting officials receive training and understand available financial incentives to fill critical military positions , and arng - hrm officials stated that they are aware that there is some confusion at the state level over which positions are considered critical . without the department of the army and arng - hrm evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of arng incentives programs in meeting its goals and documenting the results , they may not know whether incentives are being used effectively to meet and sustain program goals and whether incentives are being awarded to fill critical occupational specialties . to help determine whether arng officials are effectively using financial incentives , in conjunction with the director , arng , exercise their oversight responsibilities by evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of arng's incentives program in meeting its goals . we disagree with that assertion . the objectives of our review were to evaluate the extent to which ( 1 ) the army national guard ( arng ) has provided oversight of its recruiting process ; ( 2 ) the arng met its goals for recruiting , completion of initial military training , and completion of initial term of service in recent years ; and ( 3 ) the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , department of the army , and arng have conducted their oversight responsibilities of the arng's financial incentives programs . also , house report 113-446 accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included two additional provisions: 1 ) a provision for us to assess the extent to which contracting vehicles used to support arng recruiting were in compliance with department of defense ( dod ) and department of the army policies and regulations , and 2 ) a provision for us to assess the numbers of individuals who complete basic and advanced individual training and the average length of time between when a person enlists in the arng and when the person completes initial military training . except in the case of reasons why soldiers left the arng before completing their military training and data on when soldiers separated during the training process , we found that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining ( 1 ) the extent to which enlisted soldiers completed their initial military training ; ( 2 ) the length of time it took these soldiers to complete their initial military training and become qualified for their military occupational specialty ; ( 3 ) the extent to which enlisted soldiers completed their initial term of service ; ( 4 ) the length of time enlisted soldiers who did not complete their initial term of service served in the arng ; and ( 5 ) the reasons why enlisted soldiers who graduated from their training but did not complete their initial term of service left the arng .
