the u.s. airspace system is one of the safest in the world , but incidents and near misses at and around u.s. airport runways and taxiways still occur . you asked us to review faa's safety oversight of airport terminal areas — runways , taxiways , and ramp areas ( the area from the gate to the taxiway or runway , where aircraft are prepared for departure and arrival ) — and update our prior work , including our 2011 report on terminal area safety . to what extent does faa use data to analyze terminal area incidents ? . to assess the extent to which faa uses data to analyze terminal area - incidents , we reviewed faa data from fiscal years 2011 through 2018 on reported runway and taxiway incidents and calculated trends in incident types , severity , and aircraft involved . to assess the reliability of these data , we reviewed faa documentation , interviewed faa officials , and reviewed incident data for errors such as duplicates or incomplete records . to identify faa's and other stakeholders' efforts , including technologies , to improve terminal area safety and determine how faa assesses their effectiveness , we reviewed documentation of faa , airports' and airlines' current or planned terminal area initiatives . 3 ) . for example , a team of representatives from the air traffic organization , the office of airports , and the office of flight standards , uses information on each incursion to classify its severity into one of four categories — a through d. an example of a category a incursion occurred in june 2018 in springfield , missouri , when an aircraft with 53 people on board accelerated for takeoff before noticing an airport operations vehicle crossing the runway . faa also uses data to analyze runway incursions over time . according to faa officials , the increase in less severe incursions may be due to increased reporting of these incidents , which we also noted in our 2011 report on terminal area safety . additionally , several joint industry efforts and special task teams have recently analyzed excursions . in 2011 , we found that faa was not formally tracking runway excursions and recommended that faa develop a plan to track and assess them , which faa began doing in 2013 . however , without a process to identify duplicates , faa is not able to verify that this statement is true , and therefore cannot accurately assess and mitigate the risk excursions pose to terminal area safety . beginning to analyze ramp area incidents , for example in its new metric , would provide faa with information necessary to mitigate ramp area incidents and ensure that it is directing its efforts to the riskiest parts of the terminal area . faa's primary runway and taxiway safety effort is the runway safety program , whereby staff develop national and regional runway safety plans , analyze data on runway and taxiway incidents , and help local air traffic control managers organize annual runway safety action team ( rsat ) meetings at which faa , airport operator , and other stakeholders at each airport discuss recent runway and taxiway incidents . faa has taken steps to improve terminal area safety , but has not assessed the effectiveness of many of its runway and taxiway safety efforts . for example , faa has not evaluated how its primary efforts such as asde - x , assc , or the runway safety program contribute to runway and taxiway safety , despite having implemented these efforts years ago . without assessing the effectiveness of its range of efforts , faa cannot determine the extent to which each of its efforts contribute to its goal of improving runway and taxiway safety , or whether other actions are needed . however , without leveraging data to analyze all terminal - area incidents , faa may be missing opportunities to better target the agency's resources , and ultimately to further improve safety . we are making the following five recommendations to faa: 1 . the runway safety manager should establish a plan to assess the effectiveness of all of faa's terminal area - safety efforts , including airport surface detection equipment , model x ( asde - x ) and the runway safety program .
