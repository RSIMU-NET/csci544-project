more than 5.5 billion pounds of explosives are used each year in the united states . magazine inventory . for example , during a recent 3-year period ( january 2002 — february 2005 ) , 9 thefts involving state and local government storage facilities were reported . by comparison , during this same period , atf received reports of 205 explosives thefts nationwide from all sources . the amounts of explosives reported stolen or missing from state and local government facilities in each reported incident of theft are also relatively small when compared with the total amounts of stolen and missing explosives nationwide . since january 2002 , atf has conducted 77 voluntary inspections at state and local storage facilities — 34 inspections at facilities that atf shares with state and local agencies and 43 inspections at other state and local facilities . according to atf officials , no significant or systemic safety or security problems have been found during inspections of state and local storage magazines . as a result , no systematic information about these facilities is collected . by comparison , atf collects a variety of information about private sector explosives storage facilities , primarily under its authority to issue explosives licenses . atf also collects information about private sector storage facilities during mandatory licensee inspections . because state and local government storage facilities are exempt from the licensing process described above , they are not required to submit licensing - related information about their storage facility to atf and they are not subject to licensing - related mandatory atf inspections . we found that security oversight measures varied at the 14 selected state and local government entities we visited . further , because atf does not oversee state and local government storage facilities as part of the federal licensing process and atf does not have any other statutory authority to conduct regulatory inspections of these facilities , atf's ability to monitor the potential vulnerability of these facilities to theft or assess the extent to which these facilities are in compliance with federal explosives storage regulations is limited . in reviewing the security of state and local government explosives storage facilities , we focused on the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives' ( atf ) role in overseeing and regulating these facilities , including the extent to which atf's licensing operations address state and local government facilities and what authority atf has to enforce federal explosives law and regulations at state and local government facilities . we chose law enforcement bomb squads as the primary focus of our site visits because ( 1 ) we concluded that state and local bomb squads would be the most likely state and local government agencies to have a need for explosives storage facilities and ( 2 ) there was no other source of nationwide information on the number and location of state and local government explosives storage facilities .
