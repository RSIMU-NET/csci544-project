this report presents the status of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) plans for conducting the taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 . tcmp results play an important role in tax policy and administration decisions . congress and federal and state agencies use tcmp data for policy analysis , revenue estimating , and research . to identify the possible effects of the plan on measuring taxpayer compliance , we talked to irs officials responsible for planning the survey and reviewed documents describing the scope of the 1994 tcmp . current plans indicate the 1994 tcmp will differ significantly from previous tcmp surveys , ranging from the sample design to the audit methods . for the 1994 tcmp sample , irs plans to audit over 150,000 tax returns filed by individuals , small corporations , s corporations , and partnerships â€” about 40,000 more returns than the aggregate for these entity types in prior surveys . irs plans to provide more information to its auditors on each sample case in this tcmp . unlike prior surveys , irs plans to require auditors to identify the cause for most instances of noncompliance found on the return and determine the associated tax issue . this would have left out certain types of income such as rental income and portfolio income ( e.g. , interest , dividends , and royalties ) that are generally reported only on schedule k. for tax year 1992 , statistics of income data indicate that about one - half of partnership net income appeared only on the schedule k. collecting schedule k data would allow irs to get a more complete picture of tax compliance by partnerships and s corporations , which represent about 21 percent of the tcmp sample population for business taxpayers . as a result , irs will not be able to accurately track the tax consequences of adjustments to partnership and s corporation returns to the individual taxpayers . irs is concurrently developing two data collection mechanisms for tcmp . these problems limit the usefulness of the workpapers . we believe that obtaining audit adjustment data on all partnerships and s corporations income and deductions would enhance irs' compliance planning and research . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists .
