long - standing u.s. policy has treated the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency . when the united states is involved in an extended military conflict overseas , 90% or more of military cargoes are typically carried by ship . congress also has determined that for economic security reasons , the united states should have a commercial fleet active in international commerce . to support the u.s. - flag international fleet , congress has required that "government - impelled" cargo sent overseas be carried on u.s. - flag ships . government - impelled cargo is government - owned cargo such as military supplies , foreign aid such as food , and any privately owned cargo financed by the federal government , such as goods purchased with an export - import bank loan . cargo preference requirements are highly controversial , particularly among shippers of civilian aid cargoes , because they significantly increase shipping costs and may delay shipments . however , preference cargo is critical to some u.s. - flag ship lines , as u.s. - flag ships are not price - competitive with foreign - flag ships in carrying the overwhelming bulk of exports and imports transacted in the private sector . the military sealift command ( msc ) in the department of defense ( dod ) operates a fleet of about 120 ships . the existence of both a privately owned deep - sea u.s. - flag fleet and a government - owned fleet capable of carrying similar types of military cargo overseas is a key motivation behind cargo preference laws . the msts found that it could transport passengers and cargo in government - owned vessels for 80% or less of the cost of using private u.s. - flag shipping space . due to opposition from the eisenhower administration , which favored repealing cargo preference requirements in favor of direct subsidies to u.s. - flag operators , the 100% requirement was reduced to 50% , the commerce department was relieved of direct responsibility for administering the law , and a provision was added requiring that u.s. - flag commercial vessels charge the government "fair and reasonable rates. . in the merchant marine act of 1970 ( p.l . competition between the msc and the commercial fleet for carriage of military - related cargo has continued . at a recent hearing , a representative of the u.s. - flag shipping industry stated the following: dod must continue to abide by its long - standing "commercial first" policy to provide military cargo to privately owned united states flag vessels when available in lieu of government - owned or controlled vessels . since the mid - 1990s , the msc fleet has stabilized at around 120 ships , and the focus of u.s. - flag carriers has shifted from containing the size of the msc fleet to fully funding the msp program in annual appropriations and to more vigorous enforcement of civilian cargo preferences . u.s. - flag operators have also been wary of msc attempts to allow foreign - flag carriers to bid on msc contracts in an effort to increase competition and obtain lower rates , even though the foreign carriers would have used u.s. - owned ships and u.s. crews . according to the latest available data compiled by marad , in fy2011 military cargo accounted for about 86% of cargo preference tonnage , while food aid accounted for 11% and civilian agency cargoes accounted for 3% . several recent developments suggest that the volume of preference cargo may change in the coming years . congress is also reauthorizing the export - import bank , almost all of whose financed cargoes are carried on u.s. - flag ships .
