103-322 ) . the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 was passed during a period when federal and state policymakers were adopting increasingly punitive measures―such as establishing new crimes , increasing penalties for certain offenses , requiring convicted offenders to serve a greater proportion of their sentences before being eligible for release , and making convicted offenders ineligible for certain government assistance programs―as a means to combat violent crime . however , concerns about the financial and social costs of an increasing prison population and what prisons are doing to rehabilitate prisoners and prevent recidivism have led some policymakers to consider whether some of the "tough on crime" policies of the 1980s and 1990s need to be changed . of note , under current pell grant program rules , expanding pell grant eligibility to prisoners would not affect the eligibility of non - prisoners or award levels of non - prisoners . employment and educational attainment have also been linked . the nces study did not ask prisoners whether the cost of postsecondary education prevented them from participating , but the institute for higher education policy notes that self - financing can be a barrier for prisoners who want to participate in postsecondary education while they are incarcerated . pell grants are need - based aid that is intended to be the foundation for all federal need - based student aid awarded to undergraduates . the report provided data on the number of inmates receiving pell grants , described the effect of allowing incarcerated individuals to receive pell grants on grants for other needy students , and reviewed the research at that time on the effect of correctional education on recidivism rates . with respect to the hea , the vcclea eliminated the supplement not supplant provision relating to pell grant funds made available to incarcerated individuals and the prohibition on pell grant receipt by individuals sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty . in 2008 , congress passed and president george w. bush signed into law the higher education opportunity act ( p.l . under department of education ( ed ) regulations for hea title iv , an incarcerated student is defined as any "student who is serving a criminal sentence in a federal , state , or local penitentiary , prison , jail , reformatory , work farm , or other similar correctional institution. . among the requirements generally applicable to the hea title iv student aid programs for ay2018-2019 are the following: students must have a high school diploma or a general educational development ( ged ) certificate ; must have completed an eligible homeschool program ; or must have shown an "ability to benefit" from postsecondary education and either be enrolled in an eligible career pathway program or have been initially enrolled in an eligible postsecondary program prior to july 1 , 2012 . males who are subject to registration with the selective service system ( sss ) must be registered with the selective service . in 2015 , ed initiated the second chance pell experiment to determine if access to pell grants would increase the enrollment of incarcerated individuals in high - quality postsecondary education programs . under the second chance pell experiment , participating ihes , in partnership with federal and / or state prisons , award pell grants to individuals who are otherwise pell - eligible except that they are incarcerated in a federal or state prison . however , there are several issues policymakers might consider before expanding access to pell grants , including overall program costs , whether the federal government should support more research on the effects of postsecondary education in correctional institutions , obstacles to providing access to postsecondary education in a correctional environment , and barriers returning prisoners might face when trying to find post - release employment related to their education . unlike most prison sentences , there is no set period of time for when someone who is civilly committed will be released . most men aged 18 – 25 are required to register with the sss . for incarcerated or previously incarcerated men 26 and older who failed to register , proving pell grant eligibility may be cumbersome . these programs include the adult and juvenile state and local offender demonstration program , which may support adult education and training , among several allowable uses . should congress want to take additional steps to promote postsecondary educational pursuits of incarcerated individuals , it might consider encouraging the development of career pathway programs in correctional environments such that prisoners who have not completed high school may pursue postsecondary education with the aid of a pell grant . there is a dearth of methodologically rigorous research on the best way to deliver postsecondary education in prison . a criminal history can be a barrier to securing employment in a variety of fields , either because formerly incarcerated individuals are prohibited from working in the field due to a provision in law or regulation , or because employers are wary of hiring someone with a criminal history . policymakers might consider whether there is a need to undertake efforts to reduce the collateral consequences of a criminal history on post - release employment .
