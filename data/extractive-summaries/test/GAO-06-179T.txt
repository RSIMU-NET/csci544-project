the united states , along with its coalition partners and various international organizations , has undertaken a challenging and costly effort to stabilize and rebuild iraq following multiple wars and decades of neglect by the former regime . this enormous effort is taking place in an unstable security environment , concurrent with iraqi efforts to complete a constitutional framework for establishing a permanent government . the united states reconstruction assistance goal is to help the iraqi government develop a democratic , stable , and prosperous country , at peace with itself and its neighbors , a partner in the war against terrorism , enjoying the benefits of a free society and a market economy . in july 2005 , we issued two reports on ( 1 ) the status of funding and reconstruction efforts in iraq , focusing on the progress we have achieved and the challenges we face in rebuilding iraq's infrastructure and ( 2 ) the use of private security providers in iraq . we issued two additional reports in september on ( 1 ) u.s. reconstruction efforts in the water and sanitation sector and ( 2 ) u.s. assistance for the january 2005 iraqi elections . finally , we expect to issue a report shortly on u.s. efforts to stabilize the security situation in iraq ( a classified report ) . this statement includes unclassified information only and is based on recent gao reports . the united states is the primary contributor to rebuilding and stabilization efforts in iraq . international donors have provided about $2.7 billion in multilateral and bilateral grants , of the pledged $13.6 billion , for reconstruction activities ; however , most of the pledged amount is in the form of loans that largely have not been accessed by the iraqis . in addition to subsidy expenditures , iraq has planned for capital investment levels of 21 percent from 2005 to 2007 . however , iraq may need more funding than currently available to meet the needs and demands of the country . first , the unstable security environment and the continuing strength of the insurgency have made it difficult for the united states to transfer security responsibilities to iraqi forces and engage in rebuilding efforts . second , inadequate performance data and measures make it difficult to determine the overall progress and impact of u.s. reconstruction efforts . third , the u.s. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with iraq's inability to sustain new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects and to address maintenance needs in the water , sanitation , and electricity sectors . over the past 2 years , significant increases in attacks against the coalition and coalition partners have made it difficult to transfer security responsibilities to iraqi forces and engage in rebuilding efforts in iraq . state has set broad goals for providing essential services , and the u.s. program has undertaken many rebuilding activities in iraq . as of june 2005 , approximately $52 million of the $200 million in completed large - scale water and sanitation projects either were not operating or were operating at lower capacity due to looting of key equipment and shortages of reliable power , trained iraqi staff , and required chemicals and supplies . specifically , we will examine the efforts to stabilize iraq and develop its security forces , including the challenge of ensuring that iraq can independently fund , sustain , and support its new security forces ; examine the management of the u.s. rebuilding effort , including program execution ; and assess the progress made in developing iraq's energy sectors , including the sectors' needs , existing resources and contributions , achievements , and future challenges .
