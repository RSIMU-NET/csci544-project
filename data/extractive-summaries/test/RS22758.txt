a similar report was issued in 2001 . although iran continues to declare it has no plans to develop an icbm program , there appears to be considerable public uncertainty and debate as to whether the shahab - 6 is an actual design study concept , or an active or abandoned iranian icbm or even space - launch program . in february 2008 , iran reportedly launched a low - orbit research rocket in preparation for a later satellite launch . other observers have alleged russian assistance in iranian development of this missile . some have reported that perhaps several dozen or more of these missile types may be deployed and operational . in mid - july 2008 , iran launched a number of ballistic missiles and rockets of varying ranges during military exercises . bush administration officials said iran did not test new technologies or capabilities , but said the missile launches were evidence of the need for its proposed missile defense system in europe . at the time , a pentagon spokesman said he could not confirm the launch occurred , but that this was consistent with the fact that iran continues to develop a ballistic missile program that poses a threat to iran's neighbors in the region and beyond .
