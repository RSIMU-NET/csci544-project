initially , as domestic pork sales fell in response to the spread of the h1n1 flu , futures prices for corn , soybeans , and wheat declined sharply . this was a result of concerns that lower pork demand and production could reduce demand for other commodities , including u.s. feed grains and protein meals ( like soybeans ) , as well as other farm inputs . there were also fears that reduced demand for pork would have adverse ripple effects throughout the hog sector , resulting in production changes as producers respond to lower prices . in other livestock markets , wholesale beef and cattle futures prices were initially higher following reports of the outbreak . the u.s. produce sector also expressed concerns about possible restrictions on fresh produce trade with mexico and the processing of agricultural guest labor workers from mexico because of the 2009 h1n1 outbreak , but these fears so far have not materialized . in june 2009 , ustr reported updated estimates by the university of missouri , indicating that the u.s. pork industry could face losses of about $270 million in income in the second quarter of 2009 alone , based on market conditions in the first few days since the virus was identified . pork producers in the united states began to see a downturn in u.s. pork markets in late 2007 . the h1n1 outbreak compounded this already worsening situation , and newly imposed trade restrictions in u.s. export markets , particularly in russia and china , only further strained demand for u.s. pork products . in part because of the surplus situation , in may 2008 and march 2009 , usda announced that it would purchase $50 million and $25 million , respectively , in pork products for federal food and nutrition assistance programs . subsequent usda pork product purchases followed later in 2009 . in mid - june , smithfield foods company reported that , although it remained concerned about restrictions on international markets , the company believed that h1n1 had had "only a short - term effect on u.s. fresh pork demand," with "no significant effect on the quarter" based on the company's consolidated income statement . usmef reported that , overall , "april pork exports were not down as much as had been predicted," particularly given the continued economic downturn . nevertheless , at an october 2009 house agriculture subcommittee hearing on the economic conditions facing the u.s. pork industry , both administration and industry officials acknowledged the economic effects on the sector from reduced exports and trade restrictions because of concerns about the h1n1 flu virus . specifically , nppc asked usda to implement a purchase program for $50 million of pork products to help boost cash hog prices ; to work with u.s. trading partners to remove all restrictions on exports of u.s. pork and pork products ; to develop a comprehensive surveillance program for early detection of swine diseases ; and to work to keep open the border between the united states and canada to allow for movement of hogs . these actions are largely intended to "help stabilize prices and markets , stimulate the economy , and provide high quality food to americans in need of usda's nutrition assistance programs. .
