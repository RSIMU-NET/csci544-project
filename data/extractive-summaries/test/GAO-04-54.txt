interest in cabin air quality heightened in 2003 , with reports that a small number of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) infections may have occurred on board aircraft serving areas with sars outbreaks .  ( 3 ) what technologies are available today to improve the air quality in commercial airliner cabins , and which , if any , should be required ? . finally , we contacted the 14 largest u.s. airlines that use airbus , boeing , or mcdonnell douglas aircraft to determine the extent to which their aircraft fleets use high - efficiency particulate air ( hepa ) filters on recirculated cabin air . as air travel has become more accessible , the flying public mirrors the general population more closely than in years past . both reports recommended actions for improving what is known about cabin air quality , including the need to collect better data on the potential effect of cabin air quality on passenger and cabin crew health . for example , according to the council , infectious agents , such as viruses and bacteria , were likely present on aircraft , and high occupant densities could increase the risk of transmittal . nine of these recommendations were directed to faa , and it has implemented them to varying degrees . we reviewed faa's approach for addressing the recommendations and found that the agency has made progress on implementing some of them , including those relating to making information available on potential health issues related to cabin air quality and the risks posed to sensitive people by allergens from small animals transported in aircraft cabins ; however action on others is pending . according to faa , the surveillance and research program is to be carried out in two parts ; the first started in december 2003 and the second will start in december 2004 and end in late 2006 or early 2007 . although 5 of 8 commenting committee members said that the initiative should shed some light on cabin air quality's effects on health , all said that it was much more limited than the committee had envisioned . several technologies exist today that could improve cabin air quality , but opinions vary on whether requiring the use of improved technologies in commercial airliner cabins is warranted . however , some regional jets , which have fewer than 100 seats , are not equipped with filters , and some older large aircraft still use less efficient filters . faa does not require the filtration of recirculated air , but health experts and members of the committee that produced the 2001 report on cabin air quality believe that given their proven effectiveness , hepa filters should be required for all aircraft that recirculate cabin air . however , this would be done at the expense of higher fuel consumption , increased engine emissions , and lower cabin humidity . however , hepa filters will not filter gaseous contaminants . to help ensure that faa's research and surveillance efforts on airliner cabin air quality answer critical outstanding questions about the nature and extent of potential health effects of cabin air quality on passengers and flight attendants , gao recommends that the secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to develop a detailed plan for the research and surveillance efforts , including key milestones and funding estimates , in accordance with generally accepted practices for oversight and independence ; appoint a committee of acknowledged experts in the fields of aircraft ventilation and public health , including representatives of epa and niosh , to assist in planning and overseeing the research and surveillance efforts recommended by the national research council in 2001 ; leverage the findings of international research on airliner cabin air quality to inform faa's surveillance and research efforts ; and report to congress annually on the progress and findings of the research and surveillance efforts and funding needs . we also interviewed officials representing the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , the world health organization ( who ) , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the aerospace medical association ( asma ) , the air transport association ( ata ) , the association of flight attendants ( afa ) , the international airline passengers association ( iapa ) , aircraft and air filter manufacturers , as well as experts on cabin air quality issues , including members of the committee that produced the 2001 council report on cabin air quality . gao posts this list , known as “today's reports,” on its web site daily .
