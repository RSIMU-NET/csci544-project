in 2011 , representatives of various federal agencies , labor unions , and management organizations were brought together by the national council on federal labor - management relations ( lmr council ) , in conjunction with the chief human capital officers council ( chco council ) , to identify ways to reform and improve employee performance management in the federal government . you asked us to evaluate the gear framework . a long - standing challenge for federal agencies has been developing credible and effective performance management systems that can serve as a strategic tool to drive internal change and achieve results . of these , three agencies – doe , hud , and opm – implemented gear agency - wide with few exceptions . however , beyond its completion in september 2013 , the chco council has no stated plans to update the toolkit , such as collecting lessons learned on an ongoing basis from the pilot agencies , or including additional promising practices as needed . while the toolkit shows promise for refining the future implementation of gear , its utility in this regard could be limited because neither the chco council nor opm have stated plans to broadly disseminate it . the five pilot agencies adopted various approaches to implementing all five of the gear recommendations based on their needs and available resources . thus , three of the five agencies – doe , hud , and opm – implemented gear agency - wide , while two agencies – coast guard and nca – established pilots in single units . early stakeholder involvement with employees , management , executive team and unions resulted in greater transparency and fewer obstacles during implementation . administer employee surveys prior to implementation to identify the greatest needs and to establish a baseline to better track results . the other four agency plans did not include all project planning best practices . they state that planning may be done in stages throughout the project as stakeholders learn more details . recognizing that moving toward a more performance - oriented culture within federal agencies is likely to be a continuous effort and to ensure that the opportunity gear recommendations offer to improve performance management is not lost , we recommend the acting director of opm , in collaboration with the chief human capital officers council , define roles and responsibilities of opm , the chco council , and participating federal agencies going forward as the gear framework is implemented government - wide . in addition , to improve agencies' gear implementation plans , we recommend that: the secretary of homeland security direct the commandant of the coast guard take the following two actions to update the agency's gear implementation plan to include: ( 1 ) performance measures that permit comparison between desired outcomes and actual results and ( 2 ) additional information on schedules that are linked to specific actions ; the secretary of housing and urban development take the following two actions to update the agency's gear implementation plan to: ( 1 ) include objectives describing the goals the agency plans to achieve and ( 2 ) identify roles and responsibilities for specific actions and stakeholders ; the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for memorial affairs take the following three actions to update the national cemetery administration's gear implementation plan to include: ( 1 ) performance measures that permit comparison between desired outcomes and actual results , ( 2 ) additional information on roles and responsibilities for specific actions and stakeholders , and ( 3 ) additional information on schedules that are linked to specific actions ; and the acting director of opm to take the following two actions to update the agency's gear implementation plan to: ( 1 ) include objectives describing the goals the agency plans to achieve and ( 2 ) identify roles and responsibilities for specific actions and stakeholders . in their written responses , opm , dhs , and va officials agreed with our recommendations . this report ( 1 ) analyzes how the goals - engagement - accountability - results ( gear ) framework addresses key practices for effective performance management and identifies opportunities , if any , to improve gear implementation government - wide ; ( 2 ) describes the status of each pilot agency's gear implementation and any lessons learned to date ; and ( 3 ) assesses the extent to which each agency's gear implementation plan includes selected best practices for project planning . the gear framework is currently being piloted in five departments and agencies – the departments of energy ( doe ) , homeland security / united states coast guard ( dhs / coast guard ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , veterans affairs / national cemetery administration ( va / nca ) , and the office of personnel management ( opm ) . also interviewed labor union representatives about any problems or concerns with implementing the gear framework . while hud was already pursuing several objectives that it now views as part of gear , gear provided a framework of guiding principles that helped hud officials organize their efforts .
