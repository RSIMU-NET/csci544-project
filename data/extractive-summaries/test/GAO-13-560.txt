the internet offers consumers a convenient method for purchasing prescription drugs that is sometimes cheaper than traditional brick - and - mortar retail pharmacies . according to a recent survey conducted by the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services , nearly one in four adult u.s. internet consumers surveyed reported purchasing prescription drugs online . the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting the illegal importation of goods into the united states , including prescription drugs that have not been approved for marketing in the united states by fda , and its u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) conducts investigations related to violations of these laws , including illegally importing prescription drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods . this report identifies ( 1 ) how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal or state law or established industry standards , ( 2 ) challenges associated with federal investigations and prosecutions of rogue internet pharmacies , ( 3 ) efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and ( 4 ) efforts to educate consumers about the risks of rogue internet pharmacies and how to recognize legitimate online pharmacies . to identify how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal or state laws or established industry standards , we interviewed officials from federal agencies such as fda , cbp , ice , uspis , and doj , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency documents , including those that presented information about federal indictments and prosecutions related to internet pharmacy crimes . consumers who have taken prescription drugs purchased from rogue internet pharmacies have experienced health problems , required emergency treatments , and have died.pharmacies sell prescription drugs without legitimate medical oversight , consumers may be harmed by ingesting drugs that are contraindicated for them , or have interactions with other medications that they are taking . in addition , some rogue internet pharmacies operating from abroad have recruited doctors and pharmacies based and licensed in the united states to fulfill online prescription drug orders in exchange for payment , according to officials from federal agencies and stakeholders . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and as a result , federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting their operators . officials from federal agencies and stakeholders we interviewed told us that piecing together these operations can be difficult because rogue internet pharmacies can be composed of thousands of related websites . agency investigations have resulted in the conviction of operators , fines , and asset seizures . federal agencies have also taken steps to shut down rogue internet pharmacy websites . given that most rogue internet pharmacies operate from abroad , stakeholders including nabp , national alliance for model state drug laws , and national association of attorneys general , as well as officials from several state attorneys general offices told us that states do not have the authority , ability , or resources to investigate and prosecute them . csip has helped member companies that provide services to internet businesses — such as internet registrars , search engines , and payment processors — share information about rogue internet pharmacies , and encourages its members to block services to them.csip contracts with a third - party company that proactively searches the internet to identify rogue internet pharmacies and disseminates this information to its members . despite fda warnings to consumers that the agency could not ensure the safety of drugs not approved for sale in the united states that are purchased from other countries , the prevalence of such programs may have contributed to a perception among u.s. consumers that they can readily save money and obtain safe prescription drugs by purchasing them from canada . we provided a draft of this report for comment to hhs , doj , and dhs , and we provided excerpts of this report for comment to uspis and nsf . we received technical comments from hhs , doj , and dhs , which we incorporated as appropriate . establishing a safe harbor for companies that provide services to internet - based businesses .
