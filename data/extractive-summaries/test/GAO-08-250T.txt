the smithsonian's annual operating and capital program revenues come from its own private trust fund assets and federal appropriations ; however , the majority of funds for facilities come from the smithsonian's federal appropriations . in april 2005 , we reported that the smithsonian's current funding would not be sufficient to cover its estimated $2.3 billion in facilities projects through 2013 and recommended that the smithsonian board of regents develop and implement a funding plan to address the smithsonian's facilities projects . my statement focuses on three topics: ( 1 ) the smithsonian's real property management efforts , including the condition of the smithsonian's facilities , costs of facilities' projects , and efforts to improve real property security and portfolio management ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the smithsonian has developed and implemented strategies to fund its revitalization , construction , and maintenance projects as we recommended in 2005 ; and ( 3 ) some preliminary results of our ongoing work on governance changes being made by the smithsonian's board of regents to address recent governance problems . restricted funds have been provided for some facilities' construction projects and enhancements related to revitalization projects . the smithsonian follows many key security practices to protect its assets but faces communication and funding challenges . in our september 2007 report , we recommended that the smithsonian increase awareness of security issues . the smithsonian has omitted privately funded projects from its capital plan and its estimate of $2.5 billion for facilities projects through 2013 , making it challenging for the smithsonian and other stakeholders to comprehensively assess the funding and scope of facilities projects . as a result , our september 2007 report recommends that the smithsonian include privately funded projects in its capital plan . our analysis of the smithsonian's evaluations of the eight other funding options , including the potential benefits and drawbacks of each , showed that the evaluations were limited in that they did not always include a complete analysis , fully explain specific assumptions , or benchmark with other organizations â€” items crucial to determining each option's potential viability . however , according to the literature we reviewed and governance experts we interviewed , success will depend in part on how regents embrace their new responsibilities and on their level of engagement , as good governance results from a board that consists of active and deeply engaged members . the board has taken a number of steps to address these issues , including 1 ) amending its bylaws to require the attendance of the general counsel and chief financial officer , or their designees , at all meetings of the board and relevant board committees , 2 ) strengthening the relationship between the inspector general's office and the board , and 3 ) establishing an independent office of the regents that is responsible for , among other things , setting the agenda for the board in concert with the secretary and through consultation with smithsonian museum directors and others . management policies have been strengthened .
