first , an examination of the civil service reform act and thewhistleblower protection act will explain why national security whistleblowers were excluded fromthe protections provided in those statutes . presidents may decide to centralize control of agency information by requiring the agencyhead to approve the release of any information . employees were ordered to communicate onlythrough the head of their agency .  ( 112 ) in the whistleblower protection act ( wpa ) of 1989 , congress found that federal employeeswho make protected disclosures "serve the public interest by assisting in the elimination of fraud,waste , abuse , and unnecessary government expenditures. .  ( 114 ) the wpa incorporates the exemptions for national securityinformation included in the 1978 statute . on november 26 , 1996 , the office of legal counsel ( olc ) in the justice department issuedan eight - page opinion on " ( 1 ) the application of executive branch rules and practices on disclosureof classified information to members of congress , in light of relevant congressional enactments ; ( 2 ) the applicability of the whistleblower protection act ; and ( 3 ) the applicability of executive order12674. . during house debate on the bill reported from conference committee , several membersreferred to it as an "official secrets" law .  ( 231 ) the bill is designed to clarify that disclosures of classifiedinformation to appropriate committees of congress are protected , to codify the "anti - gag" provisionthat congress has placed in annual appropriations bills to protect agency employees who comeforward with disclosures of illegality , to authorize the osc to file amicus briefs in whistleblowercases , and to allow whistleblower cases to be heard by all federal appellate courts for a period of fiveyears .  ( 234 ) the justice department regards this provision as an intrusion into the president's prerogativeto control national security information and those who have access to it . to perform its legislative and constitutional functions , congress depends on information ( domestic and national security ) available from the executive branch . agency heads provide congress with information,but some members of congress have also expressed a need to receive information directly fromrank - and - file employees within an agency . the interest of congress in maintaining an openchannel with agency employees is demonstrated through such statutes as lloyd - lafollette , theappropriations riders on the nondisclosure policy , the military whistleblower protection act , andthe intelligence community whistleblower act . this awareness is reflected in legislation thatallows and encourages intelligence community employees to report issues of waste , fraud , ormismanagement to the intelligence committees of congress . initially it was known as the project on military procurement .
