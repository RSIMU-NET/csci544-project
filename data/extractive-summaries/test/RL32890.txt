persons suspected of terrorist or criminal activity may be transferred from one state ( i.e. , country ) to another to answer charges against them . a distinct form of rendition is extradition , by which one state surrenders a person within its territorial jurisdiction to a requesting state via a formal legal process , typically established by treaty between the countries . the terms "irregular rendition" and "extraordinary rendition" have been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another , generally for the purpose of arrest , detention , and / or interrogation by the receiving state ( for purposes of this report , the term "rendition" will be used to describe irregular renditions , and not extraditions , unless otherwise specified ) . the obama administration has continued this practice . this country does not believe in torture. . in august , the task force issued recommendations to ensure that u.s. transfer practices comply with applicable standards and do not result in the transfer of persons to face torture . these recommendations include strengthening procedures used to obtain assurances from a country that a person will not face torture if transferred there , including through the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the treatment of transferred persons . this report describes the most relevant legal guidelines limiting the transfer of persons to foreign states where they may face torture , as well as recent legislation seeking to limit the rendition of persons to countries believed to practice torture . the u.n. convention against torture and other cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment ( cat ) and u.s. domestic implementing legislation impose the primary legal restrictions on the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture . however , it is not altogether clear that cat prohibits the rendering of persons seized outside the united states , or whether criminal sanctions would apply to a u.s. official who authorized a rendition without intending to facilitate the torture of the rendered person ( as opposed to , for instance , the harsh mistreatment of the rendered person to a degree not rising to the level of torture ) . although cat and its implementing legislation provide the primary legal constraints upon the rendition of persons to countries believed to engage in torture , other treaties and statutes are also potentially relevant . the executive order entitled "ensuring lawful interrogations" establishes a special interagency task force on interrogation and transfer policies , which is charged with reviewing the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws , international obligations , and policies of the united states and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose , or with the effect , of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the united states to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control . these include involving the state department in evaluating assurances in all cases . for an order to be issued by the foreign intelligence surveillance court authorizing a rendition , the requesting u.s. official would have needed to provide evidence that the rendered person was ( 1 ) an international terrorist ; and ( 2 ) would not be subjected to torture or lesser forms of cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment â€” a more stringent limitation on the transfer of persons than that expressly imposed by cat article 3 , which only bars the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture . generally , persons could not be transferred to such countries , whether through rendition or some other process .
