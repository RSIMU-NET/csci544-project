hlgoa also increased civil penalties and added criminal penalties for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements . this is our ninth report under this mandate . to determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance , we examined a stratified random sample of 80 quarterly lobbying disclosure ( ld - 2 ) reports with income and expenses of $5,000 or more filed during the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2014 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2015 . this methodology allows us to generalize some elements to the population of ld - 2 reports . to determine whether lobbyists reported their federal political contributions as required by the lda , we analyzed stratified random samples of year - end 2014 and midyear 2015 semiannual political contributions ( ld - 203 ) reports . to determine whether lobbyists were meeting the requirement to file an ld - 2 report for the quarter in which they registered , we compared new registrations ( ld - 1 ) filed in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 , and the first and second quarters of 2015 to the corresponding ld - 2 reports on file with the clerk of the house . the ld - 2s contain information that includes: a list of individuals who acted as lobbyists on behalf of the client the name of the lobbyist reporting on quarterly lobbying activities ; the name of the client for whom the lobbyist lobbied ; during the reporting period ; whether any lobbyists served in covered positions in the executive or legislative branch such as high ranking agency officials or congressional staff positions , in the previous 20 years ; codes describing general issue areas , such as agriculture and education ; a description of the specific lobbying issues ; houses of congress and federal agencies lobbied during the reporting period ; and reported income ( or expenses for organizations with in - house lobbyists ) related to lobbying activities during the quarter ( rounded to the nearest $10,000 ) . these results are consistent with the findings we have reported in prior reviews . figure 3 shows that for most ld - 2 reports , lobbyists provided documentation for income and expenses for sampled reports from 2010 through 2015 . lobbyists for an estimated 85 percent of ld - 2 reports in our 2015 sample filed year - end 2014 ld - 203 reports for all lobbyists listed on the report as required . this year , we estimate that 21 percent of all ld - 2 reports may not have properly disclosed one or more previously held covered positions as required . as in our other reports , some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions , such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions . consistent with prior reviews , most lobbying firms reported that they found it “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to comply with reporting requirements . this is consistent with prior reviews . u.s. attorney's office ( usao ) officials stated that they continue to have sufficient personnel resources and authority under the lda to enforce reporting requirements . in august 2015 , usao finalized a settlement in the amount of $125,000 for the carmen group to address failure to file for several years . the department of justice provided updated data which we incorporated into the report . our objectives were to determine the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) by providing documentation to support information contained on registrations and reports filed under the lda ; to identify challenges and potential improvements to compliance , if any ; and to describe the resources and authorities available to the u.s. attorney's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) , its role in enforcing lda compliance , and the efforts it has made to improve lda enforcement . however , we did consult with officials from each office .
