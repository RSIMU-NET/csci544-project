during the final year of the clinton administration , proposals by the national park service to enforce long - standing policies that regulated the use of snowmobiles in national parks raised a number of questions regarding the potential regulation of such vehicles . these questions continue to be debated , as the national park service ( nps ) explores optional winter use plans for yellowstone and other units of the national park system , and as various parties challenge the actions of the nps in court . of these , 348 ( 89% ) have not been open to snowmobiles . yellowstone accounted for about 40% of the snowmobile visitors at these five parks , with a total of 76,571 in the 1999-2000 winter season . snowmobile visits to yellowstone increased during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 winter seasons , peaking at 87,206 in the latter winter . although recreational access by snowmobiles has been permitted in units of the national park system , the park service , in the late 1990s , concluded that such use has generally been in violation of executive orders 11644 and 11989 , issued by presidents nixon and carter respectively . it specified that off - road vehicle "areas and trails shall be located in areas of the national park system ... only if the respective agency head determines that off - road vehicle use in such locations will not adversely affect their natural , aesthetic , or scenic values," and it directed the park service to "monitor the effects of the use of off - road vehicles" and to rescind or limit this use "as necessary to further the policy of this order. . by july 2000 , the department had backed away from its strict enforcement stance with a clarification: there would be no snowmobile ban in park units pending a formal rulemaking and public comment period , and snowmobile practices prior to the april 2000 announcement ( i.e. , access to more than 40 parks ) would continue through the 2000-2001 winter season . in reversing the clinton administration rules on yellowstone access , the national park service set limits on emissions and noise from the snowmobiles that would be allowed in the three yellowstone area park units . simultaneously , the environmental protection agency developed emission limits applicable to new snowmobiles offered for sale anywhere in the united states beginning in 2006 and 2007 . at least five hearings have been held on these issues since the 106 th congress , and congress has on three occasions approved language in appropriations bills to require that nps temporary winter use rules permitting snowmobiles in yellowstone and grand teton national parks and on the rockefeller memorial parkway remain in effect for the year covered by the appropriations bill . congress and the nps have provided a temporary resolution of the yellowstone access issue since 2004 , but the issue is now returning to the limelight , as a federal district court has vacated final regulations for yellowstone access for a third time . among those opposed , environmental groups and individuals that want snowmobiles banned from the park form a solid majority .
