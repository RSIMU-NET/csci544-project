it also provides the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi benefit levels and eligibility in 2042 , and the interaction between the two programs . if one of the objectives of reforming social security were to mitigate the effect of possible benefit reductions on the elderly poor , targeting spending would become an important consideration . the income measure shows the projected net change in income under each option , including both social security and ssi benefits , so these projections reflect the interaction between the two programs . under option #1 , which would create a new minimum social security benefit at the poverty line , about two - thirds of the poor elderly ( 68% ) are projected to be unaffected . under option #2 , which would create a sliding - scale minimum benefit based on years of work , about nine out of ten of the poor elderly ( 89% ) are projected to be unaffected , for the same reasons mentioned in the previous option . under option #4 , which would raise ssi federal benefit rates to the poverty line and also liberalize eligibility , about 59% of the poor elderly are projected to be unaffected , as shown in figure 7 . each additional dollar of social security benefits could reduce ssi recipients' benefits by one dollar ( or more , after factoring in state supplements ) , and could disqualify some recipients for ssi altogether . in addition to considering benefit levels , poverty rates , and targeting , as examined above , policymakers examining the potential effects of social security reform on the elderly poor would likely consider other criteria when discussing policy changes to either social security or ssi . changing the social security benefit formula to mitigate the effects of changes on the elderly poor arguably would not target additional dollars as efficiently . social security participation among the elderly is nearly universal . as a result , changes to ssi would likely affect fewer of the elderly poor than would changes to social security . in recent years , major changes to social security and ssi have been rare . in addition , social security faces long - term solvency problems . ultimately , future elderly poverty rates depend largely on how policymakers choose to address social security's looming solvency problems . this paper examines four possible policy options to reduce elderly poverty . baseline all of the options in this paper are compared to a current law payable baseline , which assumes that current law benefits are cut across the board to balance social security's annual income and spending at the point of insolvency , currently projected to occur in 2041 . as a result , the interactions between social security and ssi benefits can be seen . for policies with liberalized eligibility criteria ( such as the ssi options analyzed in this report ) , the same proportion of qualifying individuals is assumed to take up benefits .
