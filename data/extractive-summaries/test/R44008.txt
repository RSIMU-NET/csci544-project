the importance of early learning for children's healthy development and positive outcomes in school and the workforce has become a subject of increasing interest to the public , members of congress , and the adm inistration . during recent congresses many bills have been introduced that would provide funding to states aiming to facilitate improvements in the quality of , and access to , early childhood education ( ece ) programs . the program is intended to support state and local efforts to build , develop and expand high quality preschool programs . in its fy2016 budget request , the administration states that the pdg program will lay the groundwork to help ensure that states are ready to participate in the administration's proposed preschool for all program â€” which would make high - quality preschool programs available for all four - year - olds from low - and moderate - income families . the pdg program is subdivided into two grant programs: pdg - expansion grants and pdg - development grants . states that have more robust state funded preschool programs or have received a rtt - elc grant are eligible to apply for expansion grants . in the fy2014 president's budget , the obama administration requested $750 million in discretionary funding for the new pdg program , as well as $75 billion ( over 10 years ) in mandatory funding for a preschool for all program that would provide high - quality public preschool to all low - and moderate - income three - and four - year - olds . fy2015 and fy2016 funding allowed existing grantees to receive a continuation award but was not sufficient to fund new grantees . states are required to indicate in their application how they will ( 1 ) begin serving eligible children within the first two years after receiving a grant , ( 2 ) subgrant 65% of the funding to subgrantees for the implementation of high - quality preschool in one or more high - need areas in the state , and ( 3 ) use no more than 35% of funding for improving state preschool infrastructure and capacity to provide high - quality preschool at the state level . fy2015 and fy2016 funding allowed existing grantees to receive continuation awards . appropriations were not sufficient to fund new grantees . of the $250 million in fy2014 funding for pdg , $80 million was reserved for pdg - development grants and $170 million was reserved for pdg - expansion grants . as has been noted , pdg - development grants are designed for states with fewer than 10% of their four - year - olds in state - funded preschool that have not received a rtt - elc grant . as table 6 shows , in 2014 , five states were awarded these grants . the workforce knowledge and competency framework , "at a minimum , ( a ) is evidence - based ; ( b ) incorporates knowledge and application of the state's early learning and development standards , the comprehensive assessment systems , child development , health , and culturally and linguistically appropriate strategies for working with families ; ( c ) includes knowledge of early mathematics and literacy development and effective instructional practices to support mathematics and literacy development in young children ; ( d ) incorporates effective use of data to guide instruction and program improvement ; ( e ) includes effective behavior management strategies that promote positive social emotional development and reduce challenging behaviors ; and ( f ) incorporates feedback from experts at the state's postsecondary institutions and other early learning and development experts and early childhood educators. . acronyms used in this report appendix c. differences between pdg programs on december 10 , 2015 , the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) was comprehensively reauthorized by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l . 114-95 ) .
