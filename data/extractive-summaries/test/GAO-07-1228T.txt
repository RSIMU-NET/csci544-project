six years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected . following the wtc attack , federal funding was provided to government agencies and private organizations to establish programs for screening , monitoring , or treating responders for illnesses and conditions related to the wtc disaster ; these programs are referred to in this testimony as the wtc health programs . we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who resided outside the new york city ( nyc ) metropolitan area . my testimony today is primarily based on our report issued in july 2007 . as you requested , i will discuss the status of ( 1 ) services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , ( 2 ) niosh's efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , and ( 3 ) niosh's awards to grantees for treatment services . in brief , we reported in july 2007 that hhs's wtc federal responder screening program had had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of screening services for federal responders and that niosh , the administrator of the program , was considering expanding the program to include monitoring but had not done so . as of early september 2007 the department has not responded to this recommendation . this interruption in service occurred because there was a change in the administration of the wtc federal responder screening program , and certain interagency agreements were not established in time to keep the program fully operational . however , the program stopped scheduling and paying for these specialty diagnostic services in april 2006 because the program's contract with a new provider network did not cover these services . if federal responders do not receive this type of monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in june 2007 , niosh awarded $800,600 to dcc for coordinating the provision of screening and monitoring examinations , and qtc will receive a portion of this award from dcc to provide about 1,000 screening and monitoring examinations through may 2008 . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded and set aside funds totaling $51 million from its $75 million appropriation for four wtc health programs in the nyc metropolitan area to provide treatment services to responders enrolled in these programs . therefore we recommended in july 2007 that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the attack on the wtc , regardless of who their employer was or where they reside . september 11: hhs needs to ensure the availability of health screening and monitoring for all responders . gao - 07-892 . washington , d.c.: july 23 , 2007 .
