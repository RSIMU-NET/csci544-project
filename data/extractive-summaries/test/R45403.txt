today , many analysts believe that u.s. technological overmatch — and , by extension , national security — is at risk due to a number of factors , including a rapidly evolving global landscape for innovation ; changes in the composition of r&d funding ; and the increasing technological prowess of potential adversaries . congress plays a central role in how the department of defense ( dod ) creates and acquires leading - edge technologies , including establishing and refining the organizational structure of dod research and development activities , providing policy direction , and appropriating funds for r&d and innovation - related activities . the report provided specific recommendations for federal government action . federal r&d funding as a share of total u.s. r&d grew from 53.9% in 1953 to 65% by 1960 , peaking at 67% in 1964 .  ( see appendix for more detailed information on these acts. ) . in 1986 , japan surpassed the united states in commercial semiconductor chip production ; the u.s. share of the world market for merchant producers fell from 100% in 1975 to less than 5% ; and by 1986 , japanese firms accounted for 65% of the dram ( dynamic random - access memory ) chips sold in the united states , and more than 80% of the global market . these funds were matched by the industry partners . china's share of global r&d rose from 4.9% in 2000 to 25.1% in 2016 . moreover , while the united states remained the world's single largest funder of r&d in 2016 , spending 13% more than china ( see table 1 ) , china's r&d funding has been growing at a much more rapid pace . the national security strategy of the united states ( nss ) , released by president donald trump in december 2017 , and the national defense strategy of the united states of america: sharpening the american military's competitive edge ( nds ) , released by defense secretary jim mattis in january 2018 , offer insights into the administration's perspectives on the changing global r&d landscape and provide a strategic framework for its policies and approaches to ensuring u.s. technological dominance on the battlefield . research and development is now a global enterprise , with the private sector driving technology development . how does it ensure dod maintains an adequate technical workforce ? . has dod increased its tolerance for failure ? . is the usd ( r&e ) effectively leveraging and coordinating rdt&e activities and investments across dod and with other federal agencies ? . has dod increased collaboration and partnership with leading - edge technology companies that have not historically been a part of dod's innovation ecosystem ? . is dod effectively using other transaction authority to increase its innovative capacity and access technologies outside of the agency's traditional contractor base ? . 100-418 ) , among other things: sought to facilitate more open , equitable , and reciprocal market access ; reduce or eliminate barriers and other trade - distorting policies and practices ; enable a more effective system of international trading disciplines and procedures ; increase intellectual property protections ; and improve enforcement of u.s. antidumping and countervailing duties ; authorized trade adjustment assistance to firms and workers ; extended federal patent royalty payments to nongovernment employees ; declared as u.s. policy that federally supported international science and technology agreements should be negotiated to ensure that intellectual property rights are properly protected and that access to r&d opportunities and facilities , and the flow of scientific and technological information , are , to the maximum extent practicable , equitable and reciprocal ; changed the name of the national bureau of standards to the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , expanded its technology transfer role , and mandated an annual report on emerging technologies ; established the nist advanced technology program ( atp ) to assist u.s. businesses in creating and applying generic technology and research results needed to commercialize significant new scientific discoveries and technologies rapidly and to refine manufacturing technologies ; established the nist manufacturing extension partnership ( mep ) program to assist in the establishment of regional centers to enhance productivity and technological performance of u.s. small and medium - size manufacturers .
