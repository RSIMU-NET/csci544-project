two federal agencies — the federal protective service ( fps ) , an agency within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and gsa — are critical to ensuring security . we designated federal real property management as a high - risk area in part because of physical security challenges at federal facilities . fps is primarily responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in federal facilities held or leased by gsa . gsa also has primary responsibility for providing facilities maintenance , space for communications equipment , and building plans , among other services . for example , fps was a component of gsa until 2003 , when it transferred to dhs . therefore , this recommendation remains open . while fps and gsa officials have drafted a joint strategy , the agencies have not defined and articulated a common outcome or fully established mutually reinforcing or joint strategies because they have not agreed on how they will work together to achieve their respective missions . in our prior work , we have reported on delays in updating the moa , and in 2012 , we recommended that the administrator of gsa ensure that the agency identifies the jurisdictions of all gsa buildings and that these data are provided to fps officials to better equip them to manage roles and responsibilities at gsa buildings , and an updated moa would help gsa implement the needed changes to address this issue . as a result , the regions rely on informal communication between the agencies for day - to - day operations . for example , gsa officials at one region told us that their role , as compared with fps's role , in the protection of federal facilities is not clearly defined and said that they were unaware of formal security standards , policies , and procedures for gsa . our prior work has found that when agencies monitor , evaluate , and report on the results of collaboration , they can better identify areas for improvement . fps's and gsa's incomplete collaboration , particularly with regard to three key collaboration practices — the lack of agreement on roles and responsibilities , communicating compatible policies and procedures , and mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results — essential elements to organizing joint efforts and facilitating decision making across agency boundaries — makes day - to - day operations more challenging and creates inefficiencies and security risks at the regional level , as discussed below . fps officials in another region told us that they hold quarterly meetings with gsa regional officials to discuss security issues , including upcoming events , such as protests , that could affect facility security , as well as how and when to inform tenant agencies about actions they need to take , such as expanded telework , during the events . during our tours of these four facilities , we observed how fps and gsa collaborate at the facility level to provide security , and interviewed fps security officers and gsa facility managers about their collaborative efforts to provide facility security and about how the status of fps and gsa collaboration and implementation of our six selected collaboration practices affect their operations .
