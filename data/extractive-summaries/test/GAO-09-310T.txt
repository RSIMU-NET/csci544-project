we prepared this work under the authority of the comptroller general to help policymakers weigh various regulatory reform proposals and consider ways in which the current regulatory system could be made more effective and efficient . my statement today is based on our report , which ( 1 ) describes how regulation has evolved in banking , securities , thrifts , credit unions , futures , insurance , secondary mortgage markets and other important areas ; ( 2 ) describes several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades that have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system ; and ( 3 ) presents an evaluation framework that can be used by congress and others to shape potential regulatory reform efforts . as a result of 150 years of changes in financial regulation in the united states , the regulatory system has become complex and fragmented . today , responsibilities for overseeing the financial services industry are shared among almost a dozen federal banking , securities , futures , and other regulatory agencies , numerous self - regulatory organizations , and hundreds of state financial regulatory agencies . regulators have struggled , and often failed , to mitigate the systemic risks posed by these conglomerates , and to ensure they adequately manage their risks . a second dramatic development in u.s. financial markets in recent decades has been the increasingly critical roles played by less - regulated entities . in particular , the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors , and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products . fourth , standard setters for accounting and financial regulators have faced growing challenges in ensuring that accounting and audit standards appropriately respond to financial market developments , and in addressing challenges arising from the global convergence of accounting and auditing standards . finally , with the increasingly global aspects of financial markets , the current fragmented u.s. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators . as a result of significant market developments in recent decades that have outpaced a fragmented and outdated regulatory structure , significant reforms to the u.s. regulatory system are critically and urgently needed . the current system has important weaknesses that , if not addressed , will continue to expose the nation's financial system to serious risks . our report offers a framework for crafting and evaluating regulatory reform proposals ; it consists of the following nine characteristics that should be reflected in any new regulatory system . by applying the elements of this framework , the relative strengths and weaknesses of any reform proposal should be better revealed , and policymakers should be able to focus on identifying trade - offs and balancing competing goals . similarly , the framework could be used to craft proposals , or to identify aspects to be added to existing proposals to make them more effective and appropriate for addressing the limitations of the current system . 8 . finally , although significant changes may be required to modernize the u.s. financial regulatory system , policymakers should consider carefully how best to implement the changes in such a way that the transition to a new structure does not hamper the functioning of the financial markets , individual financial institutions' ability to conduct their activities , and consumers' ability to access needed services . financial regulation: a framework for crafting and assessing proposals to modernize the outdated u.s. financial regulatory system .
