federal recognition of indian tribes confers specific legal status on these tribes and imposes certain responsibilities on the federal government , such as an obligation to provide the tribes and their members with certain benefits . during our review , as we were comparing programs' eligibility requirements with the characteristics of the non - federally recognized tribes that received federal funding , we identified some instances where federal agencies had made grants to likely ineligible non - federally recognized tribes and where an agency had initiated actions to enforce federal financial reporting requirements . most of the 26 non - federally recognized tribes were eligible for these funds because of their status as a nonprofit or state - recognized tribe ( 24 out of 26 ) . examples of the 24 federal programs that awarded funding to non - federally recognized tribes in the 4-year period and that are authorized to fund nonprofit organizations that meet all applicable eligibility requirements include the following: the rural business enterprise grants program , administered by the department of agriculture , which has statutory authority to fund public bodies , including indian tribes on state reservations , and private nonprofit corporations for measures designed to finance and facilitate development of small and emerging private business enterprises , among other measures ; the job opportunities for low - income individuals program , administered by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , which has statutory authority to enter into agreements with nonprofits for the purpose of conducting projects that provide technical and financial assistance to private employers that assist them in creating jobs for low - income individuals ; and the retired and senior volunteer program , administered by the corporation for national and community service , which has statutory authority to make grants to or contract with nonprofits to support programs for certain volunteer service projects for senior citizens . most of the funding ( 75 percent ) awarded to the lumbee tribe of north carolina was awarded by hud's indian housing block grants program . specifically , 95 percent of the funding was awarded by seven federal programs in four agencies . each of these programs awarded a total of more than $1.5 million to non - federally recognized tribes during the period . specifically , when we compared the eligibility requirements for each federal program that provided funding to non - federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 with the characteristics of each entity , we found that education funded some non - federally recognized tribes under the american indian vocational rehabilitation services program that appear to be ineligible and that hhs funded two non - federally recognized tribes in new jersey that the state does not consider to be state recognized . nevertheless , education provided funds under the american indian vocational rehabilitation services program to state - recognized tribes that were not located on state reservations but rather had self - defined tribal service areas , raising substantial questions about the tribes' eligibility for the funding , and hhs provided funds to two non - federally recognized tribes in new jersey as state - recognized tribes that are not officially recognized by the state . education's commitment to review its practices and take appropriate action is consistent with our revised recommendation . this review's objectives were to address ( 1 ) the key means by which non - federally recognized tribes have been eligible for federal funding and ( 2 ) the amount of federal funding awarded to non - federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , by agency and program . to compile this list we relied on information from ( 1 ) the department of the interior , and obtained a list of all those entities that have submitted a letter of intent to petition for federal recognition through the department's administrative acknowledgment process or have submitted a complete petition but had not received federal recognition as of april 29 , 2011 ; ( 2 ) selected states about state - recognized tribes ; and ( 3 ) other documents and sources that identified other self - identified tribes that are not federally recognized . as part of our contact with these 15 states , in addition to inquiring about any state - recognized tribes , we also asked about whether they were aware of any other non - federally recognized tribes within their borders . we selected north carolina because it had the highest concentration of non - federally recognized tribes that we identified as having received funding during the 4-year period ( 7 out of 26 ) , including three of the top four recipients of federal funds during the period .
