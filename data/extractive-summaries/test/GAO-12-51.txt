the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency that administers medicare , pays ma plans a monthly amount to provide health care services for each beneficiary enrolled in these plans . such growth . this report ( 1 ) determines the extent to which differences , if any , in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs affected risk scores and payments to ma plans in 2010 ; and ( 2 ) evaluates cms's methodology for estimating the percentage of ma beneficiary risk scores in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 that was attributable to differences in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs . to quantify the impact of both our and cms's estimates of coding differences on payments to ma plans , we estimated the risk score growth attributable to coding differences , as described above , and using data ma plans submitted to cms that were used to determine payments to ma plans , calculated total risk - adjusted payments for each ma plan before and after applying a coding adjustment . then , cms calculated the average of the three estimates.estimate to 2010 ma beneficiaries , cms multiplied the average annual difference in risk score growth by its estimate of the average length of time that 2010 ma beneficiaries had been continuously enrolled in ma plans over the previous 3 years , and cms multiplied this result by 81.8 percent , its estimate of the percentage of 2010 ma beneficiaries who were enrolled in an ma plan in 2009 and therefore were exposed to ma coding practices . cms implemented this same adjustment of 3.41 percent in 2011 and has announced it will implement this same adjustment in 2012 . before cms reduced 2010 ma beneficiary risk scores , we found that these scores were at least 4.8 percent , and perhaps as much as 7.1 percent , higher than the risk scores likely would have been as a result of diagnostic coding differences , that is , if the same beneficiaries had been continuously enrolled in ffs ( see fig . furthermore , cms also found that the impact of coding differences while we did not have more recent data , increased from 2004 to 2008. the trend of coding differences through 2008 suggests that the impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 could be larger than in 2010 . incorporating 2008 data would have increased the size of cms's final adjustment . second , cms did not take into account the increasing impact of coding differences over time . by not updating its estimate with more current data , cms also did not account for the additional years of cumulative coding differences in its estimate: 4 years for 2011 ( 2007 to 2011 ) and 5 years for 2012 ( 2007 to 2012 ) . based on the trend of increasing impact of coding differences through 2008 , shown in both cms's and our analysis , we believe that the impact of coding differences on 2011 and 2012 ma risk scores is likely to be larger than it was on 2010 ma risk scores . this finding underscores the importance of continuing to adjust ma risk scores to account for coding differences and ensuring that these adjustments are as accurate as possible . such steps could include , for example , accounting for additional beneficiary characteristics , including the most current data available , identifying and accounting for all years of coding differences that could affect the payment year for which an adjustment is made , and incorporating the trend of the impact of coding differences on risk scores . cms did not comment on our recommendation for executive action . in addition , for beneficiaries who were enrolled in medicare ffs and switched to ma in 2005 , 2006 , or 2007 , we included data for 1 year of medicare ffs enrollment immediately preceding their ma enrollment.our ma study population included three types of beneficiaries , each of which we analyzed separately for each period: ma joiners — beneficiaries enrolled in medicare ffs for the entire first year of each period and then enrolled in ma for all of the following year , ma plan stayers — beneficiaries enrolled in the same ma plan for the first and second year of the period , and ma plan switchers — beneficiaries enrolled in one ma plan for the first year of the period and a second ma plan in the following year .
