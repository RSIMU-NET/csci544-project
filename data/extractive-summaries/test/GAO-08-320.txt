to better understand how other countries deal with similar challenges , you asked us to identify other countries' approaches for addressing the issues that exon - florio is intended to address . in addition , in 1996 we issued a report that describes how four major investors in the united states - - - france , germany , japan , and the united kingdom - - - - monitored foreign investment in their own countries to protect national security - related interests . this report updates the 1996 report and also expands it by describing foreign direct investment policies and processes in six additional countries: canada , china , india , the netherlands , russia , and the united arab emirates ( uae ) . we obtained and reviewed copies of relevant laws and regulations and interviewed foreign government officials concerning their implementation and any planned changes to their foreign investment laws , regulations , and policies . the president can , based on the advice of the committee , exercise his authority under the exon - florio provision to suspend or prohibit a foreign acquisition of a u.s. company only if he finds that there is credible evidence that the foreign entity exercising control might take action that threatens national security , and that laws , other than exon - florio and the international emergency economic powers act , do not provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect national security . history and each country's experience with foreign investment have influenced its concept of national security , which in turn influences restrictions placed on investments . restrictions range from requiring approval of investments in a narrowly defined defense sector to broad restrictions on the basis of economic security and cultural policy . recent and proposed changes in the countries' laws and policies have more explicitly identified national security as an area of concern , in some cases as the result of controversial investments . the two countries without a review process , the netherlands and the uae , restrict entry into certain sectors or restrict the extent of ownership allowed in a sector . however , their investment policies are significantly different . while there are many unique characteristics to the systems employed by the 10 countries to regulate foreign investment , in many ways the systems are similar to each other , and in several ways similar to the cfius process in the united states . generally , this review is conducted by a government economic body with input from government security bodies , and national security is a primary factor or one of several factors considered in evaluating transactions . although the concepts of national security vary from country to country , all countries share similar concerns about national security - related issues . these concerns include , for example , their defense industrial base , and more recently , investments in energy sectors and investments of state - owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds ; the latter because of concerns that political rather than economic motivation may be behind the investment . for example , a country may place national citizenship requirements on company board members . unlike the u.s. system , most countries' reviews are mandatory if the investment reaches certain dollar thresholds or if the buyer will obtain a controlling or blocking share in the acquired company . finally , unlike in the u.s. process , five countries allow review process decisions to be challenged in court or through administrative means . in its letter , treasury reemphasized the commitment of the united states to an open investment policy and stated that countries' general investment policies and the relationship of foreign investment reviews to those policies are important in understanding investment review regimes . under finsa , cfius and the president must consider , as appropriate , the following additional factors:the potential national security - related effects on u. s. critical infrastructure , including major energy assets ; the potential national security - related effects on u.s. critical technologies ; whether the transaction is a foreign government - controlled transaction ; as appropriate , and particularly with respect to transactions requiring an investigation , a review of the current assessment of the acquiring country's adherence to nonproliferation regimes ; the relationship of the acquiring country with the united states , specifically on its record on cooperating in counterterrorism efforts ; and the potential for transshipment or diversion of technologies with military applications , including an analysis of national export control laws and regulations ; the long - term projection of u.s. requirements for sources of energy and other critical resources and material ; and the potential effects of the transaction on sales of military goods , equipment , or technology to any country identified by the secretary of defense as posing a potential regional military threat to the interests of the united states . the press notes also establish the percentage of a company that can be owned by a foreign investor in each sector . some sectors have additional restrictions and approvals . however , the british government has never used the authority provided under this act .
