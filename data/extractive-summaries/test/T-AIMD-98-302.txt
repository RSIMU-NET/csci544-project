my statement today will describe the risks to the department of education , with a focus on student financial aid systems , actions the department has taken in recent months to address these risks , and key issues the department must deal with if its systems are to be ready for the century change: testing of systems , exchanging data with internal and external partners , and developing business continuity and contingency plans . in brief , education faces major risks that year 2000 failures could severely disrupt the student financial aid delivery process , including delaying disbursements and application processing . further , because of systems interdependencies , repercussions from year 2000-related problems could be felt throughout the student financial aid community — a network including students , institutions of higher education , financial organizations , and other government agencies . the department was very slow in implementing a comprehensive year 2000 program to address these risks — basic awareness and assessment tasks were not completed until recently . education is now accelerating its program , but with the slow start , it remains in a position of playing catch up . accordingly , the department has major challenges ahead but limited time remaining to adequately deal with them . therefore , it must also focus on developing appropriate contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of key systems failures .
