currently there is no large - scale commercial production in the united states , and the u.s. market depends on imports . congress made significant changes to federal policies regarding hemp in the 2014 farm bill ( agricultural act of 2014 , p.l . 113-79 ) . the 2014 farm bill provided that certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture may grow hemp under an agricultural pilot program . appropriators have also blocked the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) from prohibiting the transportation , processing , sale , or use of industrial hemp that is grown or cultivated in accordance with the 2014 farm bill provision . despite these efforts , industrial hemp continues to be subject to u.s. drug laws , and growing industrial hemp is restricted . under current u.s. drug policy , all cannabis varieties — including industrial hemp — are considered schedule i controlled substances under the controlled substances act ( csa ) , and dea continues to control and regulate cannabis production . although hemp production is now allowed in accordance with the requirements under the 2014 farm bill provision , other aspects of hemp production are still subject to dea oversight , including the importation of viable seeds . among the bills addressing industrial hemp , the industrial hemp farming act would amend the csa to specify that the term marijuana does not include industrial hemp , thus excluding hemp from the csa as a controlled substance subject to dea regulation . an expanded version of this bill was introduced in the 115 th congress in both the house and senate ( h.r . 5485 ; s. 2667 ) . many of the provisions in these bills are included in the senate version of the 2018 farm bill legislation ( h.r . similar provisions are not part of the house - passed 2018 farm bill ( h.r . 2 ) . myriad other bills introduced in both the house and the senate would further amend the csa and other federal laws to address industrial hemp . while marijuana generally refers to the psychotropic drug ( whether used for medicinal or recreational purposes ) , industrial hemp is cultivated for use in the production of a wide range of products , including foods and beverages , personal care products , nutritional supplements , fabrics and textiles , paper , construction materials , and other manufactured goods . while marijuana is defined in u.s. drug laws , congress established a statutory definition for industrial hemp as "the plant cannabis sativa l. and any part of such plant , whether growing or not , with a delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis" as part of the 2014 farm bill . hemp is generally characterized by plants that are low in delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol ( delta - 9 thc ) , the dominant psychotrophic ingredient in cannabis sativa . some common provisions across these state laws include defining industrial hemp ( based on the percentage of thc it contains ) and excluding hemp from the definition of "controlled substances" under state law ; authorizing the growing and possessing of industrial hemp by creating an advisory board or commission ; establishing or authorizing a state licensing or registration program for growers and / or seed breeders ; requiring recordkeeping ; requiring waivers or changes to federal law ; establishing or authorizing fee structures ; establishing inspection procedures ; allowing state departments to collect funds for research programs ; promoting research and development of markets for industrial hemp ; establishing certified seed requirements or , in some states , "heritage hemp seeds" ( e.g. , in colorado and kentucky ) ; and establishing penalties . also , they "support the decoupling of industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana" under the csa and "demand the president and the attorney general direct the u.s. drug enforcement agency ( dea ) to differentiate between industrial hemp and marijuana and adopt a policy to allow american farmers to grow industrial hemp under state law without requiring dea licenses" to "legalize the production of industrial hemp as an alternative crop for agricultural producers. . joint dea / usda / fda "statement of principles on industrial hemp" as noted in the joint dea / usda / fda "statement of principles on industrial hemp," published august 12 , 2016 , which is excerpted below: usda , having consulted with and received concurrence from the u.s. drug enforcement administration ( dea ) and the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) , therefore , is issuing this statement of principles to inform the public regarding how federal law applies to activities involving industrial hemp so that individuals , institutions , and states that wish to participate in industrial hemp agricultural pilot programs can do so in accordance with federal law .
