the four major federal land management agencies — the u.s. department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service , and national park service , and the u.s. department of agriculture's forest service — administer approximately 628 million acres , or about 28 percent of the land area in the united states . revenue generated by the sale or exchange of public lands under fltfa has created another funding source available to the four agencies to acquire land when appropriations for acquisitions have been declining . second , the secretaries can directly use a portion of fltfa revenue to acquire specific parcels of land at their own discretion . among other things , fltfa requires that ( 1 ) no more than 20 percent can be used for blm's administrative and other activities necessary to carry out the land disposal program ; ( 2 ) of the amount not spent on administrative expenses , at least 80 percent of the revenue must be expended in the state in which the funds were generated ; and ( 3 ) at least 80 percent of fltfa revenue required to be spent on land acquisitions within a state must be used to acquire inholdings ( as opposed to adjacent land ) within that state . in addition , the national mou sets the allocation of funds from the fltfa account for each agency — 60 percent for blm , 20 percent for the forest service , and 10 percent each for the fish and wildlife service and the park service , but the secretaries may vary from these allocations by mutual agreement . we conducted semistructured interviews and collected data from ( 1 ) the 10 blm state officials responsible for the fltfa program in their office on the program's status , completed and planned fltfa land sales and acquisitions , and the challenges faced in conducting sales and acquiring land ; ( 2 ) officials at the 7 blm field offices that have raised 97 percent of the fltfa revenue ; and ( 3 ) a nongeneralizable sample of 11 of the 137 remaining blm district and field offices that had not conducted a competitive sale under fltfa as of may 31 , 2007 to determine why such sales have generally not occurred and challenges faced to conducting future sales . the most notable of these is the southern nevada public land management act of 1998 ( snplma ) . since fltfa was enacted in 2000 , blm has raised $95.7 million in revenue , mostly by selling 16,659 acres . as of may 2007 , about 92 percent of the revenue raised , or $88 million , has come from land sales in nevada — 1 of the 11 western states under fltfa . blm state and field office officials most frequently cited the availability of knowledgeable realty staff to conduct the sales as a challenge to raising revenue from fltfa sales . these staff may not be available because they are working on activities that blm has identified as a higher priority , such as reviewing and approving energy rights - of - way . we identified two additional issues hampering land sales activity under fltfa . first , while blm has identified land for sale in its land use plans , it has not made the sale of this land a priority during the first 7 years of the program . blm has established annual goals for the disposal of land through sales or other means . since the enactment of fltfa 7 years ago , blm reports that the four land management agencies have spent $13.3 million of the $95.7 million in fltfa revenue — $10.1 million to acquire nine parcels of land and $3.2 million in administrative expenses for conducting fltfa sales . to fund the acquisitions in the secretarial initiative of $18 million , the blm fltfa program lead told us that the secretaries approved the use of $14.5 million of the funds from the 20 percent of revenue available for acquisitions outside the state in which they were raised , and $3.5 million of the revenue not used for administrative activities supporting the land sales program . outside of nevada , agencies have had little money to acquire land . furthermore , progress in acquiring priority land has been hampered by the agencies' weak performance in identifying inholdings and setting priorities for acquiring them , as required by the act . finally , the agencies have yet to develop effective procedures to fully comply with the act and national mou . one exception to this is the nevada state - level agreement . we are making five recommendations . with the federal land transaction facilitation act of 2000 ( fltfa ) set to expire in july 2010 , we were asked to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which the bureau of land management ( blm ) has generated revenue for the fltfa program , ( 2 ) identify challenges blm faces in conducting future sales , ( 3 ) determine the extent to which the agencies have spent funds under fltfa , and ( 4 ) identify challenges the agencies face in conducting future acquisitions .
