to meet urgent needs , the department of defense ( dod ) can authorize contractors to begin work and incur costs before reaching a final agreement on the contract terms and conditions — known as an undefinitized contract action ( uca ) . in january 2008 , these findings were reflected in section 809 of the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2008 . the act requires dod to issue guidance that would include ( 1 ) circumstances in which it is appropriate for dod to use ucas , ( 2 ) procedures for ensuring compliance with definitization timelines and obligation amounts , ( 3 ) procedures for compliance with regulatory limitations on profit or fee with respect to costs incurred prior to definitization , and ( 4 ) reporting requirements for ucas that fail to meet required timelines for definitization or regulatory limitations on the obligation of funds or on profit or fee . we selected eight local commands and developed and reviewed a random selection of 83 contract actions reported as ucas and valued at a total of $6.1 billion . the findings from this contract file review can not be generalized across dod but are illustrative of uca use . to determine whether dod's recent actions have resulted in local commands meeting uca management standards , we reviewed relevant policies and guidance to identify the standards for documenting the basis for negotiating contractor profit and fee , timeliness of definitization , obligation amounts at the time of contract award , and the circumstances that justify the use of a uca . ucas are considered risky contract vehicles for the government . dod has taken a number of steps aimed at enhancing its insight into and oversight of uca use among the components and local commands ; however , data limitations hinder its full understanding of the extent to which ucas are used . for instance , we found dod's centralized reporting did not include 8 of 24 ucas we reviewed that should have been reported in the april 2009 semi - annual report . these management plans are required to describe the actions taken by dod components to help ensure appropriate use , timely definitization , minimum obligation at time of award ( consistent with the contractor's requirements for the undefinitized period ) , appropriate recognition and documentation of the contractor's reduced risk during the undefinitized period in the profit and fee negotiations , and milestones for completing planned actions . despite dod's recent uca management policy , guidance , and instructions designed to improve their use , implementation varied at local commands we visited and the management policy standards were not fully met . in the remaining 32 of 66 ucas we reviewed , the contract files included weighted guideline worksheets , but it was not always clear whether the contracting officers considered any reduced cost risk to the contractor during the undefinitized period as a factor when determining allowable profit or fee as required . of the 66 actions that obligated near 50 percent of the not - to - exceed price , 34 — 52 percent — exceeded the 180-day time frame for definitization . also , in instances when cost - plus - award - fee contracts were awarded and weighted guidelines were not required , guidance was not clear as to how to consider and document any reduced risk borne by the contractor during the undefinitized period . to ensure dod officials are able to gain insight into the risk assessment that is required to be documented in the contract file and the basis for the government's profit or fee negotiation objective , redesign the weighted guidelines worksheet to explicitly show the incurred cost calculations and a narrative description of the reason for assigning a specific contract - type risk value .
