the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( pub . l. no . 111-23 ) , section 304 ( b ) , directed us to perform a review of weaknesses in dod's operations that affect the reliability of financial information on assets acquired through mdaps . to address the objective , we searched databases of audit reports issued during calendar years 2005 through 2009 using key terms ( e.g. , military equipment ) to identify weaknesses in business operations that impair dod's ability to account for the cost of military equipment based on relevant federal financial accounting standards . using applicable criteria , we assessed whether the actions taken adequately addressed the identified weaknesses . our review of prior reports , studies , and analyses to identify weaknesses in dod's operations identified the following seven categories of weaknesses that impaired the department's ability to account for the cost of military equipment: ( 1 ) support for the existence , completeness , and cost of recorded assets is needed ; ( 2 ) more detail is needed in dod contracts to allocate costs to contract deliverables ; ( 3 ) additional guidance is needed to help ensure consistency for asset accounting ; ( 4 ) monitoring is needed to help ensure compliance with department policies ; ( 5 ) departmentwide cost accounting requirements need to be defined ; ( 6 ) departmentwide cost accounting capabilities need to be developed ; and ( 7 ) systems integration is needed . these officials told us that until the department fully addresses the weaknesses that prevent it from accurately and completely accounting for the cost of its military equipment , it will continue to rely on a methodology to estimate the cost of its military equipment assets for financial reporting purposes . specifically , the contracts were not structured in a manner that facilitated application of the appropriate accounting treatment for costs , including the identification of those costs that should be captured as part of the full cost of a deliverable . in addition , dod policy requires contract deliverables , including military equipment , that meet predefined criteria , be assigned a unique item identifier . since dod has stated that it intends to support the identification , aggregation , accounting , and reporting of cost information through the implementation of the enterprise resource planning ( erps ) , it is important that dod define its cost accounting requirements to ensure that these systems provide these capabilities . although agencies should first define their requirements , which are then used to evaluate the system's capabilities to determine if it will meet users' needs before it is developed or acquired , the department has not yet defined its cost accounting requirements at the major component level , including how sfis will be used to support cost accounting in the existing and erp system environments . dod acknowledged that it does not yet have the capability to identify , aggregate , and capture the full costs of its military equipment and has stated that the erps are intended to provide this capability . dod had not fully integrated its property and logistics systems with acquisition and financial systems . for example , dod has taken important steps such as requiring greater detail in contract - related documentation , such as invoices , and the assignment of unique identifiers to individual items to aid its ability to identify , aggregate , and account for the cost of acquired assets . additional efforts are needed to issue additional guidance regarding how to identify the full cost of an asset to supplement its pfat4me guidance and to identify and define departmentwide cost accounting requirements at the major component level , including what information is needed to manage cost within and across acquisition programs and support asset valuation and life - cycle management and how implementation of sfis and the erps will support these requirements . in order to enhance corrective actions underway within dod to address previously reported weaknesses and improve dod's ability to provide reliable information on the full cost of military equipment acquired through mdaps , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the dod chief management officer to work jointly with the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) ; the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics ; and the military department chief management officers , as appropriate , to take the following nine actions: enforce compliance with the department's records management policy by periodically evaluating the extent to which the components are maintaining documentation in support of the full cost of military equipment . dod's high - risk areas: actions needed to reduce vulnerabilities and improve business outcomes .
