in 2001 , hhs — through its administration for children and families' ( acf ) children's bureau — began implementing a new federal review system , known as the child and family services reviews ( cfsr ) , to hold states accountable for improving child welfare outcomes . to better understand the cfsr process , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in their pips ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts , if any , that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to help ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being for children . acf and many state officials perceive the cfsr as a valuable process — highlighting many areas needing improvement — and a substantial undertaking , but some state officials and child welfare experts told us that data enhancements could improve its reliability . acf staff in 8 of the 10 regions considered the cfsr a helpful tool to improve outcomes for children . further , 26 of the 36 states responding to a relevant question in our survey commented that they generally or completely agreed with the results of the final cfsr report , even though none of the 41 states with final cfsr reports released through 2003 has achieved substantial conformity on all 14 outcomes and systemic factors . in addition , both acf and the states have dedicated substantial financial and staff resources to the process . while acf officials in the central office contend that stakeholder interviews and case reviews compliment the data profiles , many state officials and experts reported that additional data from the statewide assessment could bolster the evaluation of state performance . several of the state officials we visited and surveyed also questioned the reliability of data given the variation in states' data - reporting practice , which they believe may ultimately affect the validity of the measures and may place some states at a disadvantage . as states progress in pip implementation , some acf officials expressed a need for more guidance on how to monitor state accomplishments , and both acf and state officials were uncertain about how the estimated financial penalties would be applied if states fail to achieve the goals described in their plans . nevertheless , these officials also said that while penalties are a consideration , they have used the cfsr as an opportunity to provide better services . while acf officials in the central office said that the cfsr has become the primary method for evaluating states' performance , they acknowledged that regional staff might still be adjusting to the new way acf oversees child welfare programs . in addition , to ensure that acf regional offices and states fully understand the pip development , approval , and monitoring processes , and that regional offices fully understand acf's prioritization of the cfsr as the primary mechanism for child welfare oversight , we recommend that the secretary of hhs take the following two actions: issue clarifying guidance on the pip process and evaluate states' and regional offices' adherence to this instruction , and provide guidance to regional offices explaining how to better integrate the many training and technical assistance activities for which they are responsible , such as participation in state planning meetings and the provision of counsel to states on various topics , with their new cfsr responsibilities . the objectives of our study were to report on ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in the pip ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being . child welfare: improved federal oversight could assist states in overcoming key challenges .
