the constellation program is developing the ares i crew launch vehicle and the orion crew exploration vehicle , the agency's first major efforts to support implementation of the vision for space exploration . over $10 billion has already been obligated and nasa budget estimates indicate that over $97 billion is to be spent on the constellation program through 2020 . controlling for mass has led to significant design changes to the orion vehicle . the constellation program's integrated risk management system also identified this strategy as high risk and warned that funding shortfalls could occur in fiscal years 2009 through 2012 , resulting in planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones . according to project officials , these shortfalls limited nasa's ability to mitigate technical risks early in development and precluded the orderly ramp - up of workforce and developmental activities . in response to technical challenges and cost and funding issues , nasa is changing the orion project acquisition strategy . though these changes to overarching requirements are likely to increase the confidence level associated with the march 2015 first crewed flight , they do not guarantee that the program will conduct a successful first crewed flight in march 2015 . as nasa addresses the findings and recommendations of the review of u.s. human space flight plans committee , we recommend that the new nasa administrator direct the constellation program , or its successor , to develop a sound business case — supported by firm requirements , mature technologies , a preliminary design , a realistic cost estimate , and sufficient funding and time — before proceeding into implementation , and , if necessary , delay the preliminary design review until a sound business case demonstrating the program's readiness to move forward into implementation is in hand . gao staff that made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix iii . to assess nasa's progress toward establishing a sound business case for the ares i and orion projects and identify key technical challenges nasa faces in developing the ares i crew launch and the orion crew exploration vehicles , we obtained and analyzed constellation plans and schedules , risk mitigation information , and contract performance data relative to the standards in our knowledge - based acquisition practices including program and project plans , contracts , schedules , risk assessments , funding profile , budget documentation , earned value reports , and the results of nasa's assessments of the program .
