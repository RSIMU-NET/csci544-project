child welfare agencies seek to ensure the well - being of children and their families , including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have a safe and permanent home . as the u.s. constitution has been interpreted , states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare . in fy2008 , congress appropriated just under $7.9 billion for child welfare purposes . these protections must generally be provided to all children in foster care , regardless of whether they meet federal foster care eligibility criteria . this represents a modest decline from the estimated 511,000 children in care on the last day of fy2005 , but is well below the recorded high of 567,000 children in care on the last day of fy1999 ( when there were about 8.0 children in foster care per 1,000 in the population ) . legislation that would respond to a number of the concerns raised in the child welfare hearings held during 2007 , including proposals to change the federal child welfare financing structure , has been introduced in the 110 th congress . the bills introduced would expand the eligible populations served with title iv - e funds and provide some additional support for child and family services . other legislative proposals would authorize or require new services and protections for children in ( or about to enter ) foster care ; seek to improve services for youth who are aging out of care ( including those who have already exited due to age ) ; encourage greater access to a range of services for kinship caregivers and further encourage their involvement as decision - makers and use as caregivers for children who cannot remain safely with their parents ; aim to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts of state child welfare agencies ; permit direct access to federal title iv - e funds for tribal governments ; and make other related changes intended to enhance the safety , permanence , and well - being of children . the following program funding or other authorizations are set to expire with fy2008 or have already expired . h.r . 5466 and s. 3038 would fix this base year at fy2007 . 5466 and s. 3038 would permit states to earn incentive awards related to placing children from foster care into legal guardianships . 4198 and s. 2395 ( see " foster and adoptive parent recruitment ," above ) . it further proposed that current law adoption incentive payments be revamped to permit states that successfully found permanent homes for children ( whether via family reunification , adoption , or guardianship ) to receive these bonus funds ; sought provisions that would permit states to transfer ( "re - invest" ) certain "unspent" title iv - e foster care dollars in the safe children , strong families grant ; recommended payment of an enhanced federal matching rate for the safe children , strong families grant â€” if a state showed increased competence and reduced caseloads among its child welfare workforce ; proposed investment of at least some of a state's assessed penalties for noncompliance with federal child welfare policy in that state's program improvement plan ( with this spending directed by hhs ) and , finally , recommended continued reservation of funds for research , evaluation , and sharing of best practices . however some of the proposals have been addressed in legislation introduced in this congress and described in the body of the report .
