this report responds to your request that we assess the internal revenue service's ( irs ) performance during the 1997 tax filing season . besides providing data on various indicators that irs uses to measure its filing season performance , we discuss five areas that have been problematic in past filing seasons: ( 1 ) the ability of taxpayers seeking answers to questions to reach irs via the telephone , hereafter referred to as telephone accessibility ; ( 2 ) the number of returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method ; ( 3 ) irs' efforts to deal with returns that have missing or incorrect social security numbers ( ssn ) ; ( 4 ) the use of banks , known as lockboxes , to process certain tax payments ; and ( 5 ) performance of the imaging system irs uses to process certain tax returns . after noting how accessibility had improved to 51 percent , the commission noted that “the level of access continues to be unacceptable and inferior to service performance in private sector service organizations.” as table 2 showed , the increase in irs' telephone accessibility between the 1996 and 1997 filing seasons was due to a combination of more calls being answered and fewer calls coming in ( i.e. , “call attempts” ) . although the increase in the overall number of returns filed was small , the increase in the number filed through alternative methods was significant — about 25 percent higher than last year . an important change for the 1997 filing season involved irs' implementation of new procedures for handling returns filed with missing or incorrect ssns . irs' ssn error procedures changed in 1997 as a result of a provision in the welfare reform act of 1996 . that is about 150 percent more than the amount of revenue irs reported as having been protected as a result of the procedures used in 1996 . our concerns about the form 1040 lockbox program were heightened this year by new information relating to the interest cost avoidance figures that irs and fms have used to show the program's cost effectiveness . scrips is one such system . successful optical character recognition operations depend , in part , on the kind of clearly printed data provided by a label . although fms had planned another study to further assess the comparative processing times and costs for lockboxes and service centers , those plans have been deferred , and it is unclear when such a study will be done . irs says that the scrips sites succeeded in processing over 90 percent of the forms 1040ez through scrips .
