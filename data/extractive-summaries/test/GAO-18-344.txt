we found in april 2015 that dhs's funding plans for major acquisition programs did not reflect all of the estimated costs for certain programs , particularly for o&s , resulting in potential operational shortfalls . this report assesses , for selected major acquisition programs , the extent that ( 1 ) dhs's budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight ; and ( 2 ) o&s life - cycle cost estimates ( lcces ) are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated . operations and support â€“ provides funds necessary for operations , mission support , and associated management and administration activities , including salaries . figure 2 outlines the acquisition life - cycle for major acquisition programs at dhs . each of our 11 selected programs has an approved cost estimate . in accordance with dhs policy and gao's cost estimating and assessment guide , the o&s costs in the lcce should inform the o&s portion of the program's budget request and the funds provided to the program . while some program - oriented o&s data are available at the component level , this information does not appear in dhs's budget reports to congress . this disparity is due , in part , to the format of the budget reports . officials across dhs identified operational flexibility as the primary benefit of the department's mission - oriented budget management . if a new mission requires a specific aircraft capability , flexible o&s funds will support using that asset , as opposed to another . additionally , while dhs has program - level expenditure data for most of the programs we reviewed , it also relies on fragmented financial management systems that further limit reporting . visibility of dhs's o&s costs by program is further limited in congressional budget submissions , as personnel costs are not fully captured . providing data on full program costs permits congress to better understand the long term costs of a program and the budgetary and programmatic effect of its decisions . this change also aligns to federal standards for internal control and communicating quality information . while we could not determine that selected programs' lcces were accurate based on the information reviewed , we found that the department is regularly updating lcces , a gao best practice that promotes accuracy . dhs's recent proposal to shift back to reporting program - level o&s funding in the future years homeland security program report demonstrates that the department sees value in providing such information to congress and that such information is available to some extent .  ( recommendation 3 ) . to determine whether the ppas we identified in the o&s budget request were all - inclusive of o&s costs , we developed and disseminated a data collection instrument to program offices , which collected information on selected programs' o&s budget requests , budget authority , obligations , and expenditures , including personnel expenditures , from fiscal years 2015 to 2017 . using the gao cost estimating and assessment guide , gao cost experts assessed selected dhs major acquisition programs against 2 of the 4 characteristics of a quality cost estimate .
