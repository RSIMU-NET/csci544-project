the impact aid program , administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) , was originally established in 1950 by p.l . 81-815 and p.l . 81-874 , 15 years prior to the enactment of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) . impact aid compensates local educational agencies ( leas ) for a "substantial and continuing financial burden" resulting from federal activities . these activities include federal ownership of certain lands , as well as the enrollments in leas of children whose parents work or live on federal property and children living on indian lands . the federal government provides compensation because leas are unable to collect property or other taxes from these individuals ( e.g. , members of the uniformed services living on military bases ) or their employers , even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children . thus , impact aid is intended to compensate leas , in part , for the resulting loss of tax revenue . the impact aid program authorizes several types of payments: federal property ( section 7002 ) , federally connected children: basic support payments ( section 7003 ( b ) ) , payments for children with disabilities ( section 7003 ( d ) ) , construction ( section 7007 ) , and facilities maintenance ( section 7008 ) . in addition to the impact aid programs administered by ed , a smaller set of programs administered by the department of defense ( dod ) are often referred to as the "dod impact aid" programs . these two programs include one that provides supplemental aid to leas serving children with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services , and one that provides assistance to leas serving children with severe disabilities with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services . this is followed by information about recent appropriations for impact aid . esea title vii authorizes several types of impact aid payments . the payment provided to an lea for each child with severe disabilities is based on the expenditures made by the lea on behalf of the child that are in excess of the appe in the state in which the lea is located , less the sum of funds received by the lea from the state to defray the costs of educational and related services for the child ; under the idea to defray the costs of services for the child ; and from any other source to defray the costs of services for the child provided specifically because the child has a severe disabling condition . appendix a .
