in its place , congress instituted a system of supervised release , which applies to all federal crimes committed after november 1 , 1987 . both parole and supervised release call for a period of supervision following release from prison and for reincarceration upon a failure to observe designated conditions . sentencing courts determine the terms and conditions of supervised release at the same time that they determine other components of a defendant's sentence , and "[t]he duration , as well as the conditions of supervised release are components of a sentence. . sentencing courts are said to have broad discretion when imposing the conditions for supervised release , although such discretion must be understood within the confines established for mandatory conditions , the scope of permissible standard discretionary conditions and special conditions , and the deference that must be afforded the sentencing guidelines . section 3583 ( b ) sets the authorized duration for a term of supervised release , subject to exceptions for certain drug , terrorism , and sex offenses . in any event , the court may terminate a defendant's term of supervised release at any time after the defendant has served a year on supervised release , based on the defendant's conduct , the interests of justice , and consideration of several of the general sentencing factors . in addition to earlier termination of a defendant's term of supervised release , a court may modify supervised release conditions at any time , may revoke a defendant's term of supervised release , require him to return to prison for an addition term of imprisonment , and impose an additional term of supervised release to be served thereafter . the constitution limits the range of permissible conditions . on the other hand , a condition which raises constitutional concerns is likely to offend statutory norms as well and can be resolved on those grounds . in some cases , it is a question of whether the task assigned a probation officer in a condition of supervised release touches upon a defendant's significant liberty interest . elsewhere , it has been said a search condition must satisfy the "reasonably related" standards . the popularity of the challenge may have something to do with the fact that the statutory and guideline conditions are worded generally in order to allow sentencing courts to adjust them to the facts before them .
