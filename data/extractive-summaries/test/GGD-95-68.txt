for this review , we assessed the impact of title i assistance on ( 1 ) broad - based , sustainable development in recipient countries and ( 2 ) long - term market development for u.s. agricultural goods in those countries . food security was defined in the 1990 act as “access by all people at all times to sufficient food and nutrition for a healthy and productive life.” while the 1990 act emphasized food security — an economic development and food assistance issue — it also assigned title i program management responsibilities to usda , whose international responsibilities are foreign market development for u.s. agricultural goods , rather than to the agency for international development ( aid ) , which is an international economic development agency . although u.s. agricultural products have been exported under the title i program for 40 years , none of the many studies we reviewed has established a link between food aid and long - term commercial market share for u.s. agricultural products . price reduction . usda has had little success exporting certain items on the p.l . 480 funds between the title i and title iii programs . the state department and aid also have influenced the selection of title i recipients . usda agreed with our conclusions that ( 1 ) title i's contribution to sustainable economic development is minimal because of the current program's small size relative to each country's overall development needs ; ( 2 ) the 1990 act streamlined the management of title i , but the 1990 act did not significantly improve the program's ability to accomplish its market or economic development objectives ; and ( 3 ) several program requirements impair the usefulness of title i as a market development tool ( i.e. , cargo preference requirements , commodity eligibility , and government - to - government loans ) . we found that the primary way in which title i can contribute to sustainable economic development in recipient countries is by helping the country save foreign exchange to invest in projects that promote long - term economic development .
