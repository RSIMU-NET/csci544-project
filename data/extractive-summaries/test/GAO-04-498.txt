the activity group's average price for in - house work almost doubled between fiscal years 2000 and 2004 . our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what factors were primarily responsible for the price increase , ( 2 ) if the prices charged customers during fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003 recovered the reported actual costs of performing the work , and ( 3 ) if the air force has taken effective steps to improve efficiency and control the activity group's costs . by far the most significant of these factors was material costs , which accounted for about 67 percent of the total increase . however , because air force depot maintenance officials have not completed a comprehensive analysis to determine the underlying causes of why their material costs have increased , they cannot quantify the impact of the identified causes and are unsure if they have identified all of the major causes . our analysis also showed that the fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge was unnecessary because the air force working capital fund's $2.5 billion cash balance as of january 31 , 2004 , was already more than $1.3 billion higher than the maximum level allowed by dod policy . either the office of the secretary of defense or the congress could use this unneeded cash to satisfy other requirements . further , our analysis showed that about 61 percent of the higher labor cost was due to factors that are largely beyond the activity group's control , such as annual cost - of - living increases and increased costs for health benefits for federal employees . in other words , the activity group generally incurs financial losses on its “carryover” work because ( 1 ) the cost of doing the work generally goes up from one year to the next and ( 2 ) the stabilized price policy prevents the activity group from increasing its prices to cover the higher costs . when we contacted office of the secretary of defense officials in march 2004 about the air force working capital fund's excess cash , in general , and the depot maintenance activity group's fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge , in particular , they stated that they allowed the air force to include a cash surcharge in its depot maintenance activity group's fiscal year 2004 sales prices because ( 1 ) problems related to ongoing efforts to implement a new accounting system made the reliability of the activity group's accounting data questionable and ( 2 ) uncertainty related to ongoing actions to remove contract depot maintenance operations from the air force working capital fund made it difficult to reliably project future cash collections and disbursements . air force officials at the three air logistics centers and the air force materiel command informed us that the activity group's prices were not set high enough because the air force artificially constrained the activity group's prices for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 by not including all anticipated costs in the prices . the air force changed its sales price development philosophy in 2002 in an effort to bring prices charged customers in fiscal year 2004 more in line with operating costs . air force officials told us the prices were constrained to help ensure that the activity group's customers would be able to get needed work done with the amount of funds provided them through the budget process . this out - of - cycle increase resulted in the prices charged customers increasing from $179.42 an hour to $199.66 an hour , approximately $20 per hour . although these efforts represent a positive step in trying to better understand and control its depot maintenance costs , the command has not ( 1 ) completed a successful methodology for analyzing the reasons for the rapid material cost increases and ( 2 ) entered data into a data repository that is to be used to share cost - saving ideas among the three air logistics centers on process improvements and track the costs and savings for these improvements . the air force depot maintenance activity group has not always operated like a business entity and thus , has not achieved the goals envisioned under the working capital fund concept — that is , to operate like a business by developing and using effective methods to control operating costs , charging customers prices that recover operating costs , and ensuring that established management tools to measure the results of operational improvement efforts are used as intended . to determine what factors were primarily responsible for causing the composite sales price to increase from $119.99 per hour in fiscal year 2000 to $237.84 per hour in fiscal year 2004 , we obtained and analyzed budget documents that provided information on cost factors , such as material costs , overhead costs , and salaries used in developing the prices .
