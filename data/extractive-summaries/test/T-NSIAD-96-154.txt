although the department of defense ( dod ) is taking steps to improve the readiness of u.s. ground forces to conduct operations in a chemical or biological environment , units designated for early deployment today face many of the same problems that were experienced during the persian gulf conflict in 1990 and 1991 . dod has acted . during 1994 and 1995 , it established the joint service integration group to prioritize chemical and biological defense research efforts and develop a modernization plan ; and the joint service materiel group to develop research , development , acquisition , and logistics support plans . however , dod has not succeeded in fielding other needed equipment and systems designed to address critical battlefield deficiencies identified during the persian gulf conflict and earlier . despite dod efforts — such as doctrinal changes and command directives — designed to improve training in defense against chemical and biological warfare since the persian gulf conflict , u.s. forces continue to experience serious weaknesses in ( 1 ) donning protective masks , ( 2 ) deploying detection equipment , ( 3 ) providing medical care , ( 4 ) planning for the evacuation of casualties , and ( 5 ) including chemical and biological issues in operational plans . this clearly demonstrates the lack of chemical and biological warfare training at the joint service level . there are two fundamental reasons for this . medical units supporting early - deploying army divisions we visited often lacked critical equipment needed to treat casualties in a chemically or biologically contaminated environment . today , dod still has inadequate stocks of vaccines for known threat agents , and so far has chosen not to implement existing immunization policy and procedures .
