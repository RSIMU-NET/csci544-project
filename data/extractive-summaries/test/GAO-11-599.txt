some experts believe that more children have died from maltreatment than are captured in these estimates . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the principal federal agency that provides oversight of state child welfare systems , which are intended , in part , to protect children who have been maltreated and help prevent maltreatment . to obtain more information about the quality of national data on child fatalities and near fatalities from maltreatment , the chairman , house ways and means committee , asked us to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which hhs collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment , ( 2 ) the challenges states face in collecting and reporting information on child fatalities from maltreatment to hhs , and ( 3 ) the assistance hhs provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child fatalities from maltreatment . of all children who died in fiscal year 2009 , ncands estimates that 1,770 children died from various types of maltreatment . however , hhs does not report some information it collects on the circumstances surrounding child fatalities . although nccdr conducts in - house analyses for federal partner organizations , such as the national highway traffic safety administration , according to nccdr officials , or of sudden cardiac deaths for a hospital , cdr data on child maltreatment deaths have not yet been synthesized or published , according to the nccdr director . ï‚· lack of definitive medical evidence: without definitive medical evidence , it can be difficult to determine that a child's death was caused by abuse or neglect . for example , investigators we spoke with in california said that determining the cause of death in cases such as sudden unexplained infant death is challenging because the child may have been intentionally suffocated but external injuries are not readily visible . the ncands technical team also hosts the ncands annual state technical assistance meeting , a key means of assistance to states in which hhs officials provide ncands training and updates and states share questions and information . although hhs provides a variety of assistance to states on how to report data to ncands , state officials indicated a need for additional assistance collecting child fatality as well as near - fatality data to use for prevention efforts . in conclusion , children's deaths from maltreatment are especially distressing because they involve a failure on the part of adults responsible for protecting them . hhs also noted that ncands data collection has always been voluntary , as our report acknowledges . the report will be available at no charge on gao's web site at http: / / www.gao.gov . the survey included questions about state laws related to child maltreatment , child welfare department coordination with other agencies or entities , state challenges related to identifying and collecting information on child maltreatment fatalities and reporting these data to ncands , child death review teams , state challenges related to collecting information on child maltreatment near fatalities , and federal assistance from hhs to states on data collection and reporting .
