the 115 th congress and the trump administration are reviewing existing u.s. policies and programs in sub - saharan africa ( henceforth , "africa" ) as they establish their budgetary and policy priorities toward the region while also responding to emerging crises . key issues for congress include the authorization and appropriation of u.s. aid to africa , the authorization and appropriation of funds for u.s. military activities on the continent , and oversight of u.s. programs and policies . in support of congressional deliberations , this report provides background on select issues related to africa and u.s. policy in the format of frequently asked questions . enhancing democracy , the rule of law , and respect for human rights in the region have long been u.s. policy priorities , often as mandated by congress . the obama administration pursued several global development initiatives that sought to benefit africa , as well as a number of africa - specific initiatives and major programs . in 2012 , the obama administration released a policy document entitled u.s. strategy toward sub - saharan africa , which prioritized as u.s. goals the strengthening of democratic institutions ; the expansion of economic growth , trade , and investment ; the advancement of peace and security ; and the promotion of opportunity and development . analysts continue to debate whether that strategy reflected an appropriate mix and ranking of priorities , and the degree to which the obama administration's actions reflected its stated goals . trump administration views on many u.s. - africa policy issues have not been publicly stated . the united states is a major funder of regional stabilization operations in africa , drawing on bilateral security assistance funding to prepare troop contributors and support deployment logistics . the united states also supports various conflict prevention , mitigation , and mediation efforts in africa . maritime security . these discussions are progressing in the context of the trump administration's release on march 16 , 2017 , of its fy2018 "budget blueprint," which suggests significant shifts in executive branch foreign policy priorities and foreign aid funding levels . the implications for u.s. africa policy , u.s. diplomatic relations with african governments , and aid programs on the continent remain to be seen . other legislative initiatives and oversight activities are also likely to shape u.s. policy toward africa and toward specific countries , as was the case in the 114 th and previous congresses . congressional responses to emerging crises , such as famine concerns in three african countries , increasingly intractable conflicts in south sudan and mali ( among others ) , transnational security threats , and the appropriate balance between u.s. diplomacy , development , and defense priorities in africa , may also influence or direct u.s. policy .
