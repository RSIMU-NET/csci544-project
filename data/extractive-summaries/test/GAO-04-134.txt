to facilitate access to local television stations for households located in nonserved and underserved areas , the congress passed the launching our communities' access to local television act of 2000 ( local tv act or act ) . the act created the local television loan guarantee program ( program or local tv program ) . the program provides for loan guarantees of up to 80 percent of loans totaling no more than $1.25 billion to finance projects to enable local television access to communities where distance and topography limit access to over - the - air television broadcast signals or cable service . the act established the local television loan guarantee board ( board ) , which is comprised of the secretary of the treasury , the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system , the secretary of agriculture , and the secretary of commerce , or their designees , primarily to approve loan guarantees and the department of agriculture ( usda ) rural utilities service ( rus ) as program administrator ( administrator ) to issue and administer approved loan guarantees . this report addresses the act's requirement that we perform an annual audit of the ( 1 ) administration of the provisions of the act and ( 2 ) financial position of each applicant who receives a loan guarantee under the act , including the nature , amount , and purpose of investments made by the applicant . the program was funded in fiscal year 2002 ; however , because it was not fully implemented in that year , there were no loan guarantee applicants for gao to audit . therefore , this report primarily addresses whether program administration during fiscal year 2002 satisfied the provisions of the act . specifically , the act required the board to: ( 1 ) direct the administrator to prescribe regulations within 120 days after the congress appropriated funds , ( 2 ) develop underwriting criteria in consultation with the director , office of management and budget ( omb ) and an independent public accounting firm ( ipa ) within 120 days after the congress appropriated funds , ( 3 ) establish and collect loan application and loan guarantee origination feesto offset the cost of administering the program under the act , including the costs of the board and the administrator , and ( 4 ) consider other numerous specialized technical and business requirements prior to approving a loan guarantee . since funds were appropriated in november 2001 , the target time frame was march 2002 . however , as of the end of august 2003 , neither of these key documents had been finalized . according to board and rus officials , three factors contributed to program delays: ( 1 ) initial uncertainties over program funding , ( 2 ) inadequate dedicated staff resources for program activities , and ( 3 ) the decision to issue a proposed rule . total costs of administering the program , including those incurred by the respective departments and agencies providing support to the board , were not accumulated and charged to the program . statement of federal financial accounting standard no . 4 , managerial cost accounting standards ( sffas no . 4 ) requires federal agencies to capture the costs of federal programs to assist the congress in authorizing , modifying , and discontinuing programs and to provide agencies with reliable cost data for making informed managerial decisions and evaluating performance . the local tv program has not been implemented within the time frames specified in the local tv act .
