in reports to congress since 1997 , we have identified information security as a governmentwide high - risk issue . concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act ( fisma ) of 2002 , which permanently authorized and strengthened information security program , evaluation , and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies . in my testimony today , i will summarize ( 1 ) security incidents reported at federal agencies , ( 2 ) the effectiveness of information security at federal agencies , ( 3 ) agencies' reported progress in performing key control activities , and ( 4 ) opportunities to enhance fisma reporting and independent evaluations . more specifically , fisma requires agency information security programs that , among other things , include ● periodic assessments of the risk ; ● risk - based policies and procedures ; ● subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks , facilities , and systems or groups of information systems , as appropriate ; ● security awareness training for agency personnel , including contractors and other users of information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency ; ● periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies , procedures , and practices , performed with a frequency depending on risk , but no less than annually ; ● a process for planning , implementing , evaluating , and documenting remedial action to address any deficiencies ; ● procedures for detecting , reporting , and responding to security ● plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations . personally identifiable information about millions of americans has been lost , stolen , or improperly disclosed , thereby exposing those individuals to loss of privacy , identity theft , and financial crimes . agencies have experienced a wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft , computer intrusions , and privacy breaches , underscoring the need for improved security practices . most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent , limit , or detect access to computer networks , systems , or information . of the 24 major agencies , 22 had access control weaknesses . agencies did not always configure network devices and services to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity , such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely manner ; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction ; and maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information systems . an underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively implemented all the fisma - required elements for an agencywide information security program . however , igs at several agencies sometimes disagreed with the information reported by the agency and have identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities . in summary , as illustrated by recent incidents at federal agencies , significant weaknesses in information security controls threaten the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations , assets , and personnel of federal agencies . despite these persistent weaknesses , agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements . further , opportunities exist to enhance reporting under fisma and the independent evaluations completed by igs .
