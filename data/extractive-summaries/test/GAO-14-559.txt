in 2012 , motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol - impaired drivers killed 10,322 people . while the number of such fatalities has dropped by 21 percent over the last 10 years , almost one third of all traffic fatalities annually resulted from crashes involving an alcohol - impaired driver over the same period . to identify the types of assistance that nhtsa provides to states to help them establish and implement their ignition - interlock programs , we interviewed nhtsa officials about their activities and reviewed reports describing nhtsa's ignition - interlock - related research , technical assistance , and conferences . little research exists on which specific interlock program characteristics may improve installation rates or otherwise improve the effectiveness of ignition - interlock programs , but nhtsa's ongoing and planned research — expected to be completed between 2014 and 2015 — may fill this gap . most studies use dwi arrest as a proxy for alcohol - impaired driving ; however researchers have noted that arrest for dwi is a rare event , with some estimating that less than 1 a 2011 review of percent of alcohol - impaired drivers are detected.literature assessing the effectiveness of ignition interlocks identified 15 studies ( 12 in the u.s. , 2 in canada , and 1 on sweden ) that observed that ignition interlock installation reduced the risk of being re - arrested for dwi offenders , compared to dwi offenders not using ignition interlocks . research we identified on the effectiveness of ignition interlocks also indicates that once the devices are removed , dwi arrest rates return to pre - interlock rates.dwi offenses in new mexico observed a reduction in re - arrest while the ignition interlocks were installed , but in a period following removal of the ignition interlock , there was no significant difference in dwi re - arrest rates between offenders who had installed the ignition interlock and those who had not . for example , nhtsa officials told us that in an ongoing study of state ignition - interlock programs , they were able to identify only eight states with sufficient data ( e.g. , the number of ignition interlocks ordered and the number of dwi offenders who actually installed the ignition interlocks ) to estimate the program's installation rate . research and interviews we conducted suggests that most states require installation for at least 5 months . according to some state officials , exemptions are seldom used in practice , but are important to maintain because they facilitate the ability of offenders to work . nhtsa offered a variety of assistance to help states establish and improve their ignition - interlock programs . state officials questioned how nhtsa implemented one aspect of the new ignition - interlock grant program ; specifically that states did not qualify for funding if they included exemptions in their alcohol ignition - interlock programs . as described previously , states qualify for this grant by requiring that all individuals convicted of a dwi offense be limited to driving motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock . nhtsa officials stated that they based their implementation of the ignition - interlock grant on the plain meaning of the authorizing language in map - 21 , which did not include any reference to exemptions or exclusions . specifically , nhtsa's digest indicated that as of may 2012 at least 5 states allowed exemptions for employer vehicles , and additional states had other factors that would prevent them from qualifying for the ignition - interlock grant . based on experience in reviewing state impaired driving laws , nhtsa officials recognized that many states would have to change existing laws to apply to first time offenders and eliminate exemptions . few states were expected to qualify in the grant's first years because it would be difficult for state legislatures to change their ignition interlock laws in that time frame . state legislatures in arizona and washington were able to eliminate employer exemptions and other disqualifying factors from their laws in order to qualify for the grant in fiscal year 2014 , bringing the total grant recipients to four that year . because the ignition - interlock grant is relatively new , the extent to which additional state legislatures would be willing or able to modify their laws to qualify for the grant is unclear . dot also provided technical corrections , which we incorporated as appropriate . the objectives of our review were to determine ( 1 ) what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks in reducing alcohol - impaired driving and ( 2 ) the extent to which the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) ignition - interlock grant program .
