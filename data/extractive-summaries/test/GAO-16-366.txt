in fiscal year 2014 , medicare processed 1.2 billion fee - for - service ( ffs ) claims submitted by providers or suppliers on behalf of beneficiaries . level 5 appeals are reviewed by federal courts . recently , the administrative appeal levels ( i.e. , levels 1 through 4 ) have experienced pronounced increases in the number of medicare ffs appeals filed and some levels have also experienced increases in the backlog of appeals , which are pending appeals that remain undecided after statutory time frames . to examine trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 — the 5 most recent and complete fiscal years at the time we began our analysis — we analyzed extracts of three data systems we obtained from the hhs components responsible for the medicare appeals process: cms ; the office of medicare hearings and appeals ( omha ) , an hhs staff division ; and the medicare appeals council ( the council ) within the departmental appeals board ( dab ) , which is also an hhs staff division . to examine data hhs uses to monitor the medicare appeals process , we reviewed documentation describing each appeals data system in use during the time frame of our evaluation to understand the data that track an appeal and appeal decision and how those data are collected and used . we also reviewed applicable federal standards for internal control . as a result of these checks or reviews , cms's contractors may deny medicare payment for the claim . the total number of medicare appeals filed and the number of appeal decisions that were issued after statutory time frames at levels 1 through 4 increased from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , with the largest rate of increase at level 3 . while level 3 handled fewer appeals overall , it experienced the largest rate of increase in appeals from 41,733 to 432,534 appeals — 936 percent — during this period . among the four levels , level 3 experienced both the largest increase in appeals overall , as well as the largest increase in part a appeals , which increased over 2,000 percent between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 . our review found data inconsistencies across the three appeals data systems and within the appeal levels that use mas , such as variation in how appeal decisions are recorded at the claim level and how hhs agencies track appeal decisions . these data inconsistencies limit hhs agencies' ability to monitor emerging trends in appeals using consistent and reliable data . federal standards for internal control call for agencies to establish and control operations using reliable information . however , the medicare appeals backlog is likely to persist despite actions taken to date , and hhs efforts thus far do not address inefficiencies with the way certain repetitive claims are adjudicated . in order to provide more timely adjudication of appeals of medicare claim denials , hhs agencies have taken various actions , which can be grouped into three categories: 1. changes to medicare prepayment and postpayment claims reviews , which may reduce claim denials and , therefore , the number of filed appeals ; 2. actions aimed at reducing the number of decisions at lower appeal levels that lead to appeals at levels 3 and 4 ; and 3. actions aimed at resolving the current backlog of undecided appeals at levels 3 and 4 . in exchange , the hospital withdrew its pending appeals and waived its right to file a future appeal related to the claims . if the appeal for the initial claim is later reversed in favor of the appellant , the appeals of the subsequent claims must continue to go through the appeals process , awaiting separate decisions , because the favorable appeal decision on the initial claim cannot generally be applied to the other appeals of subsequently denied claims . it is unclear whether hhs will be granted this authority . in commenting , hhs provided further information for two of the recommendations with which it generally agreed . this appendix provides additional details regarding our analysis of ( 1 ) trends in medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 ; ( 2 ) differences in claim - level and appeal - level reversal rates ; ( 3 ) appeals resolved by the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) global settlement ; ( 4 ) cms's estimate of interest paid by the agency to certain providers ; and ( 5 ) data reliability . type of appellant: to determine the type of appellant that filed the appeal , we used the mas field “requester type ; ” a field created by omha for us that indicates that the mas appeal record included a beneficiary identification number , thus indicating the appeal was filed by a beneficiary ; and a file provided to us by omha that identified appeals filed by a state medicaid agency that could not be identified using the field “requester type.” type of service: to determine whether the appeal was for a part a , part b , or dmepos service , we used two mas fields — “medicare type” and the name of the qic . dab officials indicated this approach was generally appropriate . to better understand the effect of late appeal decisions on the amount of interest paid by cms to certain providers who have their postpayment claim denials reversed upon appeal , we asked cms for ( a ) the amount of interest cms paid to providers on the overpayments the agency initially collected and then returned after the appellant won a level 3 appeal ; and ( b ) the amount of interest that cms would have paid to those providers if level 3 had adhered to the 90-day statutory time frame for issuing appeal decisions .
