our previous work has found fragmentation and overlap among federal assistance programs . over 40 federal entities have roles in combating terrorism , and past federal efforts have resulted in a lack of accountability , a lack of a cohesive effort , and duplication of programs . as state and local officials have noted , this situation has led to confusion , making it difficult to identify available federal preparedness resources and effectively partner with the federal government . for the nation's preparedness programs , however , outcomes of where the nation should be in terms of domestic preparedness have yet to be defined . given the recent and proposed increases in preparedness funding as well as the need for real and meaningful improvements in preparedness , establishing clear goals and performance measures is critical to ensuring both a successful and a fiscally responsible effort . a careful choice of the most appropriate tools of government to best implement the national strategy and achieve national goals . involving all levels of government and the private sector in developing key aspects of a national strategy that i have discussed today — a definition and clarification of the appropriate roles and responsibilities , an establishment of goals and performance measures , and a selection of appropriate tools — is essential to the successful formulation of the national preparedness strategy and ultimately to preparing and defending our nation from terrorist attacks .
