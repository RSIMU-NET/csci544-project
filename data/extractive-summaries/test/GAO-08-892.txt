however , the total number of alleged incidents is likely to be higher for four reasons: household workers' fear of contacting law enforcement authorities , ngos' protection of victim confidentiality , limited information on some allegations handled by the u.s. government , and federal departments' difficulties in tracking household worker abuse allegations and investigations involving foreign diplomats . state has several offices that receive allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats , but no single office maintains information on all allegations . the u.s. government's process of investigating foreign diplomats for alleged abuse is complicated by three factors — ( 1 ) constraints posed by immunity , ( 2 ) household workers' heightened vulnerabilities due to their employers' status , and ( 3 ) the length of time it takes for justice to obtain state's opinion on the use of specific investigative techniques in trafficking investigations . although certain techniques , such as searching the residence of a diplomat who has full immunity and inviolability without the diplomat's consent , are clearly prohibited , other techniques may touch the diplomat's “sphere of privacy.” according to state officials , the permissibility of these techniques under international law is less clear . according to a justice official , obtaining some of this information can be difficult and time - consuming . state may need to consider reciprocity , such as how use of a specific technique might affect treatment of u.s. diplomats abroad . officials from both agencies told us they are considering developing an interagency process that would outline time frames for discussing the use of investigative techniques , but they have , thus far , not taken any formal actions toward creating one . at the four consular posts we visited , we found weaknesses in state's process for ensuring that its policies for issuing a - 3 and g - 5 visas are implemented correctly and consistently , and some consular officers were unfamiliar with or unclear about aspects of guidance relating to these visas . in some cases , the contracts were clearly deficient in one or more areas . state is considering steps to address confusion about refusing a - 3 and g - 5 visas , but has not taken actions to implement them . in addition , officials in state headquarters do not currently alert consular officers if they have information that could help in the adjudication of an a - 3 or g - 5 visa based on a pattern of employee disappearance , abuse allegations , or other irregularities because that information is not included in state's databases . supervisory officials at consular posts abroad review a selection of visas that were issued or refused at that post each day . as such , they do not routinely and independently monitor compliance with a - 3 and g - 5 policies and procedures . they are often poor , uneducated , and unfamiliar with their rights under u.s. law . to ensure that the office of protocol and the office of the legal adviser are aware of all cases involving alleged abuse of household workers by foreign diplomats that have come to the attention of the department , we recommend that the secretary of state ( 1 ) emphasize to the relevant bureaus and offices the importance of the foreign affairs manual requirement to report all cases that come to their attention and ( 2 ) direct the office of protocol and the office of the legal adviser to create a system for collecting and maintaining records on these cases . our objectives were to ( 1 ) seek to determine how many a - 3 and g - 5 visa holders have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , ( 2 ) review the u.s. government's process for investigating abuse allegations involving foreign diplomats with immunity , and ( 3 ) describe and assess how state ensures correct and consistent implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa polices and procedures . homeland security also provided us with the number of individuals who had received t visas and identified themselves as a - 3 or g - 5 visa holders on their t visa applications . to review the u.s. government's process for investigating abuse allegations involving foreign diplomats with immunity , we reviewed state documents including the foreign affairs manual , cables sent to consular officers on a - 3 and g - 5 visas , “diplomatic and consular immunity guidance for law enforcement and judicial authorities,” diplomatic notes to chiefs of diplomatic missions in the united states regarding conduct of diplomatic agents in the united states , usun's diplomatic notes to permanent missions and permanent observer offices , and state's 2007 document to the senate committee on foreign relations entitled “state's initiatives to promote fair treatment of domestic workers by diplomatic personnel.” we also interviewed officials from state's office of the chief of protocol , office of the legal adviser , diplomatic security service , usun , and office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons . the total number of a - 3 and g - 5 visas issued in manila accounts for almost 10 percent of all a - 3 and g - 5 visas issued during this period . at post , we reviewed two application files , including all documentation available for these a - 3 or g - 5 visa applications .
