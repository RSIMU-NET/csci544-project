china , as any other developing country , has needed foreign technology for its economicdevelopment . with its 1.28 billion people and rapidly rising incomes and purchasing power , china presents a hugepotential market .  ( 14 ) the surge in fdi into china coincided with a similar trends worldwide . direct investment in china , 1990-2001 ( billion dollars ) sources: china , ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation . the differences between the two sets of figures have not been reconciled , but they likely can be traced to: differences in reporting criteria ; u.s. investments originating in or going throughoffshore u.s. affiliated companies ( particularly in hong kong ) ; investments that fell under the u.s.threshold for counting ; more complete data gathered by the u.s. department of commerce on repaidloans and other data internal to companies that are not generally accounted for by the chineseministry that approves foreign investments ; changes in exchange rates ; and overstatements ofinvestment amounts by local chinese officials and foreign investors . according to chinese figures , in 1990 , the flowof american fdi into china was only about $456 million ; by 2000 , it had reached $4.4 billion ; andin 2001 it rose to almost $ 4.7 billion . the united states has been the second largest source of fdi for china ( next only to hong kong ) and during 1999-2001 accounted for an average of about 10.5% of china's total inflows ( using china's figures ) . the caravelcompany's list of u.s. firms operating in china in 2002 totaled 1,466 companies ( up from 1,383 in2000 ) with 570 in beijing , 448 in shanghai , and 223 in guangdong province across the border fromhong kong . fdi ( including reinvested earnings of affiliates ) has come to play an important role in thechinese economy . another effect of fdi in china and the price competitiveness of chinese exports has been the possibility that china is exporting deflation to the world economy . foreign direct investment in china affects security primarily through three avenues: itscontribution to economic growth which funds china's military , technology transfers , and economicinterests . with fdi contributing to rising economic power , china can devote more resources to its military , although in view of growing domestic needs , military spending has been taking secondplace to economic expansion and modernization . in the case of china , the questionis whether foreign direct investment is enhancing the competitiveness of chinese exports to the pointwhere u.s. firms and american security are being threatened .  ( 41 ) inshort , u.s. firms producing in china could be sellingproducts there from their chinese factories rather than from sources in the united states . u.s. exports of satellite technology , as is the case withother sensitive , dual - use technologies , are controlled by u.s. export laws .  ( 43 ) in the electronics and telecommunication sectors , technology transfers have enabled china to catch up in some electronics - related sectors , but in most cases the technology transfers are in formof co - production and assembly and in terms of access to "soft" technologies . this is seen by many to place anincentive on beijing to seek peaceful solutions to foreign policy issues but , at times , also places u.s.businesses in a position of attempting to protect their investments by siding with beijing on certainissues ( such as opposing economic sanctions ) . one likely place that hostilities might occur involving china is along the taiwan strait . fdi contributes to economic growth . these groups have directfinancial interest in maintaining stability , amicable sino - foreign relations , and liberalized trade .
