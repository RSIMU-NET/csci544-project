we appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the status of efforts by the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) to plan for and coordinate the transformation of the nation's current air traffic control ( atc ) system to the “next generation air transportation system” ( ngats ) — a system intended to safely accommodate an expected tripling of air traffic by 2025 . authorized in 2003 , jpdo is housed within the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , whose air traffic organization ( ato ) is responsible for modernizing and operating the nation's current atc system . according to vision 100 , the legislation that authorized jpdo , the transformation to ngats will be completed by 2025 with the assistance of seven organizations that make up jpdo's senior policy committee: the departments of transportation , commerce , defense , and homeland security ; faa ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and the white house office of science and technology policy .  ( 2 ) what key challenges does jpdo face in moving forward with its planning efforts ? . the following summarizes our findings to date: jpdo has developed a framework for planning and coordination with its partner agencies and nonfederal stakeholders that is consistent with the requirements of vision 100 and with several practices that our previous work has shown can facilitate federal interagency collaboration and enterprise architecture development . these elements , which make up jpdo's framework , include an integrated plan that provides a vision for ngats , an organizational structure and processes for leveraging the resources and expertise of federal and nonfederal stakeholders , and an enterprise architecture that defines the specific requirements for ngats . jpdo faces leadership , leveraging , and commitment challenges as it moves forward with planning for ngats . currently , two leadership positions critical to jpdo's success are vacant: jpdo has not had a permanent director for over 6 months , and since the secretary of transportation resigned , the senior policy committee has been without a permanent chairperson . in addition , despite early successes in leveraging its partner agencies' resources and expertise for ngats initiatives , jpdo may have difficulty continuing to do so because its partner agencies have a variety of missions and priorities in addition to ngats , and jpdo does not yet have formal , signed agreements with the agencies on their respective roles and responsibilities . jpdo also faces the challenge of convincing nonfederal stakeholders that the government is fully committed to ngats because , in the past , the government has discontinued work on new technologies for the national airspace system , including one technology in which a nonfederal stakeholder had already invested . faa faces challenges in institutionalizing recent improvements in its management and acquisition processes , as well as in obtaining the expertise and resources needed to implement ngats . in late 2003 , recognizing that the current approach to managing air transportation is becoming increasingly inefficient and operationally obsolete , congress created jpdo to plan ngats , a system intended to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic demand expected by 2025 . recognizing the complexity of the ngats implementation effort and the possibility that faa may not have the in - house expertise to manage it without assistance , we have identified potential approaches for supplementing faa's capabilities . finally , faa expects to save costs through outsourcing .
