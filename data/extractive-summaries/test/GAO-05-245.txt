in fiscal year 2003 , the federal food stamp program , administered by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , reported it made payment errors totaling about $1.4 billion in benefits . this sum represents about 7 percent of the total $21.4 billion in benefits provided each year to a monthly average of 21 million low - income program participants . because the government must make the best use of funding , it is important to minimize payment errors . due to concerns about ensuring payment accuracy , we examined ( 1 ) what is included in the national food stamp payment error rate and how has the rate changed over time , ( 2 ) what is known about the causes of food stamp payment errors , and ( 3 ) what actions usda and states have taken to reduce these payment errors . these components include creating a work environment that promotes accountability and the reduction of payment error , analyzing program operations to identify areas that present the risk of payment error , making policy and program changes to address the identified risks , and monitoring the results and communicating the lessons learned to support further improvement . the national food stamp program payment error rate combines overpayments and underpayments to participants , and has declined by about one - third in recent years from 9.86 percent in 1999 to a record low of 6.63 percent in 2003 . error rates fell in 41 states and the district of columbia , and 18 states reduced their error rates by one - third or more , as shown in figure 3 . despite the decrease in many states' error rates over the past few years , some states continue to have high payment error rates . almost two - thirds of the payment errors in the food stamp program are caused by caseworkers , usually when they fail to act on new information or make mistakes when applying program rules , and one - third are caused by participants , when they unintentionally or intentionally do not report needed information or provide incomplete or incorrect information ( see fig . 5 ) . program complexity and other factors , such as the lack of resources and staff turnover , can contribute to caseworker mistakes . however , this is sometimes difficult to determine . for example , local officials from texas told us that because of the way the state chose to implement the simplified reporting option , caseworkers are held responsible for failing to act on a change when a birth is reported to the medicaid program , even though participants are not required to report the change to the food stamp program , according to a recently approved policy option . in 2003 , about 5 percent of all payment errors were referred for fraud investigation . fns and the states we reviewed have taken many approaches to increasing food stamp payment accuracy , most of which are parallel with internal control practices known to reduce improper payments . these include practices to improve accountability , perform risk assessments , implement changes based on such assessments , and monitor program performance . the officials said they agreed with our findings and conclusions .
