i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement the human resources information technology ( hrit ) investment . to address these issues , dhs initiated hrit in 2003 to consolidate , integrate , and modernize the department's information technology ( it ) infrastructure that supports human resources . specifically , my remarks today summarize key findings from that study , which ( 1 ) evaluated the progress dhs has made in implementing the hrit investment and how effectively dhs managed the investment , ( 2 ) determined whether the performance and learning management system ( palms ) — hrit's only ongoing program — is being implemented enterprise - wide , and ( 3 ) evaluated the extent to which palms is implementing selected it acquisition best practices . for our report , we , among other things , compared hrit's goals , scope , and implementation time frames to the investment's actual accomplishments . according to dhs , the limitations in its human resources environment , which includes fragmented systems and duplicative and paper - based processes , were compromising the department's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission . as a result of the limited progress in implementing hrit , dhs is unaware of when critical weaknesses in the department's human capital environment will be addressed , which is , among other things , impacting dhs's ability to carry out its mission . we recommended in our report that dhs's under secretary for management update the hrit executive steering committee charter to establish the frequency with which the committee meetings are to be held , and ensure that the committee is consistently involved in overseeing and advising hrit . specifically , neither schedule was updated to reflect that dhs did not implement 13 of the 15 improvement opportunities by their planned completion dates — several of which should have been implemented over 3 years ago . accordingly , we recommended that dhs develop a complete life - cycle cost estimate for the implementation of the hrit investment . to this end , following a meeting we had with dhs's under secretary for management in october 2015 , in which we expressed concern about hrit's lack of progress , officials from the offices of the chief human capital officer and chief information officer stated that hrit was asked by the deputy under secretary for management in late october 2015 to re - evaluate the blueprint's strategic improvement opportunities and to determine the way forward for those improvement opportunities and the hrit investment . hrit's minimally involved executive steering committee during a time when significant problems were occurring was a key factor in the lack of progress .
