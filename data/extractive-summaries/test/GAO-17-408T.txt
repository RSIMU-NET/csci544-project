as you know , the use of it is crucial to helping va effectively serve the nation's veterans and , each year , the department spends billions of dollars on its information systems and assets . however , over many years , va has experienced challenges in managing its it projects and programs , raising questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and its ability to deliver intended outcomes needed to help advance the department's mission . at your request , my testimony today summarizes findings from a number of our reports that addressed va's efforts toward exchanging electronic health records with the department of defense ( dod ) and highlighted it challenges that have contributed to our designation of va health care as a high - risk area . in addition , it discusses our prior work on the department's development and use of its benefits claims processing system , the veterans benefits management system ( vbms ) , as well as our recent reports that addressed va's data center consolidation and legacy systems . va reported spending about $3.9 billion to improve and maintain its it resources in fiscal year 2015 . in addition , in its 2017 budget submission , the department requested appropriations to make improvements in a number of areas , including: veterans' access to health care , to include enhancing health care - related systems , standardizing immunization data , and expanding telehealth services ( $186.7 million ) ; veterans' access to benefits by modernizing systems supporting benefits delivery , such as vbms and the veterans services network ( $236.3 million ) ; veterans' experiences with va by focusing on integrated service delivery and streamlined identification processes ( $171.3 million ) ; va employees' experiences by enhancing internal it systems ( $13 information security , including implementing strong authentication , ensuring repeatable processes and procedures , adopting modern technology , and enhancing the detection of cyber vulnerabilities and protection from cyber threats ( $370.1 million ) . in light of va and dod not implementing a solution that allowed for the seamless electronic sharing of health care data , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included requirements pertaining to the implementation , design , and planning for interoperability between the departments' electronic health record systems . although va has proceeded with its program to modernize vista ( known as vista evolution ) , the department's long - term plan for meeting its electronic health record system needs beyond fiscal year 2018 is uncertain . yet , a significant concern is that these departments have not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts , and the value and benefits these efforts are expected to yield . further , since that time , va has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome - oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas , and it also has begun to establish baseline measurements . we also issued several prior reports regarding the plans for separate systems , in which we noted that the two departments did not substantiate their claims that va's vista modernization , together with dod's acquisition of a new system , would be achieved faster and at less cost than developing a single , joint electronic health record system . we recommended that va and dod develop cost and schedule estimates that would include all elements of their approach ( i.e. , to modernize both departments' health information systems and establish interoperability between them ) and compare them with estimates of the cost and schedule for developing a single , integrated system . in february 2015 , we designated va health care as a high - risk area . we have previously reported on the department's outpatient appointment scheduling system , which is about 30 years old . in may 2010 , we reported that , after spending an estimated $127 million over 9 years on its outpatient scheduling system modernization project , va had not implemented any of the planned system's capabilities and was essentially starting over by beginning a new initiative to build or purchase another scheduling system . the department generally concurred with our recommendations , but as of may 2016 , had not addressed four of the six recommendations . in september 2015 , we reported that vba had made progress in developing and implementing vbms , its system that is to be used for processing disability benefit claims . we recommended , among other actions , that the department develop a plan with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing vbms , establish goals for system response time , assess user satisfaction , and establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement . specifically , we reported that va's closure of 20 out of its total of 356 data centers gave the department a 6 percent closure rate through fiscal year 2015 â€” ranking its closure rate 19th lowest out of the 24 agencies we studied . with regard to cost savings and avoidance resulting from data center consolidation , our analysis of the department's data identified a total of $19.1 million in reported cost savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2011 though fiscal year 2015 . this equated to only about 0.7 percent of the total of approximately $2.8 billion that all 24 agencies reported saving or avoiding during the same time period . va also lagged behind other agencies in making progress toward addressing data center optimization metrics established by omb in 2014 . further , va has not justified the development and operation of an electronic health record system that is separate from dod's system , even though the departments have common system needs .
