in summary , my statement includes the following major points: the time demands on bankruptcy judges are largely a function of the number and complexity of the cases on their dockets . some types of cases may take more judge time than others . in assessing the need for new bankruptcy judgeships , the judicial conference relies on the weighted case filings to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related bankruptcy judge workload . whether weighted case filings are a reasonably accurate workload measure rests in turn on the soundness of the methodology used to develop the case weights . on the basis of the documentation provided for our review and discussions with fjc and aousc officials , we concluded that weighted case filings , as approved by the judicial conference in 1991 and amended in 1996 , were likely to be a reasonably accurate means of measuring the case - related workload of bankruptcy judges . the original case weights are now about 18 years old and were based on time data that are now about 21 years old . changes in the intervening years in such factors as case characteristics , case management practices , or new statutory and procedural requirements , such as the implementation of the 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act ( the bankruptcy reform act ) , may have affected whether the case weights continue to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related judge workload . to the extent that the case weights may now understate or overstate time demands on bankruptcy judges , the weights could potentially result in the judicial conference understating or overstating the need for new bankruptcy judgeships . the judicial conference's committee on the administration of the bankruptcy system has approved a revision of the current weights , a study currently underway , whose methodological design is essentially identical to that used to develop the current case weights â€” a methodology we concluded in 2003 was reasonable . the accuracy of the case weights is also dependent upon accurately assigning each case filed in each bankruptcy court to the appropriate case weight category . the federal judiciary has developed workload measures for bankruptcy judges to estimate the national average amount of a judge's time that different types of cases may require . the judicial conference has established 1,500 annual weighted case filings per authorized judgeship as an indicator of a bankruptcy court's potential need for additional judgeships . however , our analysis focused solely on the weighted case filings workload measure . total annual weighted case filings for any specific bankruptcy court is the sum of the weights associated with each of the cases filed in the court in a year . total annual weighted case filings per judgeship represent the estimated average amount of judge time that would be required to complete the cases filed in a specific bankruptcy court in a year . weighted case filings per judgeship is the total weighted filings divided by the number of authorized judgeships . the federal judicial center ( fjc ) developed the weights , adopted by the judicial conference in 1991 , based on a 1988-1989 time study in which 272 bankruptcy judges ( 97 percent of all bankruptcy judges in those years ) recorded the time they spent on specific cases for a 10-week period . each active and recalled bankruptcy judge is to participate during one of the 5 reporting periods . all current records related to bankruptcy filings that are reported to the administrative office of the u.s. courts and used for the bankruptcy court case weights are generated by the automated case management systems in the bankruptcy courts . different procedures were used in these two time studies .
