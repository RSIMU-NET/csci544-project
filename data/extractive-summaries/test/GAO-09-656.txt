under the superfund program — the federal government's principal program to clean up hazardous waste sites — the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has the authority to compel parties responsible for contaminating these sites to clean them up , or to conduct cleanups itself and then seek reimbursement from the responsible parties . finally , to help identify contributing factors for the trends we found in our analysis of data on epa's enforcement actions , litigation to resolve superfund liability , and the program's status and costs , as well as to obtain information on the factors that influence parties' decisions , we interviewed superfund program experts , including epa and doj officials , attorneys that represent responsible parties , and other subject matter experts . while courts are involved in judicial actions , epa can take administrative actions on its own . superfund litigation — as measured by the number , duration , and complexity of cercla cases — decreased from fiscal years 1994 through 2007 , the period for which reliable data were available . these decreases in litigation may have led to a decrease in associated costs . according to experts , litigation decreased because fewer sites had cleanups underway , epa changed its enforcement process to further encourage settlements , and court decisions clarified several initial legal uncertainties , making parties less inclined to litigate . epa's expenditures for litigation , which decreased by 50 percent , from more than $50 million in fiscal year 1999 to $25 million in fiscal year 2007 , provide further evidence of this trend . however , epa does not provide the congress with sufficient information to make decisions about future funding needs of the superfund program . we identified three factors that could affect epa's ability to fund and conduct site cleanups: ( 1 ) the number of sites on the npl has declined over time ; ( 2 ) the types of sites added to the npl may require greater epa expenditures for cleanup ; and ( 3 ) fewer sites may have responsible parties who can contribute to cleanup , although epa data do not clearly indicate the number of sites without viable responsible parties or the value of the orphan shares at sites . in 1983 , the first year of the npl , epa added over 400 sites , but epa added only an average of 20 new sites annually for fiscal years 1998 through 2007 . other cleanup programs have been used to clean up sites . mining sites . sites that often have contaminated sediments or groundwater plumes with no identifiable source . however , epa's expenditures on its remedial program declined by 37 percent from fiscal year 1999 through 2007 , and accounted for the majority of the decline in superfund program expenditures during this period . while epa's superfund appropriation and expenditures have declined over time , the average amount epa spent for individual sites has increased in recent years . to help assess these financial constraints , epa needs comprehensive and reliable data that can be aggregated to provide information on key issues , such as the ( 1 ) status and cost of cleanups at sites that are not construction complete , particularly sites where cleanup is likely to be complex and expensive ; ( 2 ) extent to which sites lack responsible parties capable of paying for some or all of a site's cleanup activities ; and ( 3 ) financial impacts of having epa shoulder these sites' cleanup costs . to assist the congress in making decisions about funding the superfund program , we are recommending that the administrator , epa , assess the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data the agency collects and , where necessary , improve the data for the purpose of providing aggregated information on the following issues: the status and cost of cleanups at individual sites , particularly complex and expensive sites ; the extent to which there are viable responsible parties at npl sites ; and the potential financial impacts from epa's inability to obtain reimbursement for agency cleanup costs from nonviable responsible parties . for example , at some sites , cleanup actions have been completed and the statute of limitations on cost recovery and other enforcement efforts may have passed . information we collected on the outcomes of cases included whether the case docket contained evidence of any of the following types of outcomes: settlement ( concurrent ) — parties reached a settlement and the docket included evidence of the settlement concurrently with ( or within a week of ) the case filing ; settlement ( nonconcurrent ) — parties reached a settlement and the docket included evidence of the settlement more than a week after the case filing ; dismissal ( court ) — the court dismissed parties or claims , not as a result of a settlement , such as when a court granted a defendant's motion to dismiss claims against it ; dismissal ( voluntary ) — a plaintiff dismissed parties or claims voluntarily and not as a result of a settlement ; nonconsensual judgment — the court or jury made a judgment on liability ( not accompanied by a settlement ) , or the court granted a motion for summary judgment or declared a party to be in default ; and remand — the court remanded a case or individual claims to a state or local court . often than those filed by other plaintiffs .
