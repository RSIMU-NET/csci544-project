my testimony is based on our report , released today , that discusses steps the forest service and interior agencies have taken to ( 1 ) address key operational areas that could help contain the costs of preparing for and responding to wildland fires and ( 2 ) improve their management of their cost - containment efforts . the forest service and interior agencies have initiated a number of steps to address issues that we and others have identified as needing improvement to help federal agencies contain wildland fire costs , but the effects of these steps on containing costs are unknown , in part because many of the steps are not yet complete . first , federal firefighting agencies have made progress in developing a system to help them better identify and set priorities for lands needing treatment to reduce accumulated fuels . second , the agencies have also taken some steps to improve how they acquire and use firefighting personnel , aviation resources , and equipment — assets that constitute a major cost of responding to wildland fires — but much remains to be done . however , they have yet to complete the more fundamental step of determining the appropriate type and quantity of firefighting assets needed for the fire season . over the past several years , the agencies have been developing a fire program analysis ( fpa ) system , which was proposed and funded to help the agencies determine national budget needs by analyzing budget alternatives at the local level — using a common , interagency process for fire management planning and budgeting — and aggregating the results ; determine the relative costs and benefits for the full scope of fire management activities , including potential trade - offs among investments in fuel reduction , fire preparedness , and fire suppression activities ; and identify , for a given budget level , the most cost - effective mix of personnel and equipment to carry out these activities . third , the agencies have clarified certain policies and are improving analytical tools to assist agency officials in identifying and implementing an appropriate response to a given fire . nevertheless , other policies limit the agencies' use of less aggressive strategies , which typically cost less . federal agencies , working with nonfederal entities , have recently taken steps to clarify guidance and better ensure that firefighting costs are shared consistently for fires that threaten both federal and nonfederal lands and resources . first , although the agencies have established a broad goal of suppressing wildland fires at minimum cost considering firefighter and public safety and the resources and structures to be protected , they have established neither clear criteria by which to weigh the relative importance of these often - competing priorities nor measurable objectives by which to determine if they are meeting their goal . without such criteria and objectives , according to agency officials we interviewed and reports we reviewed , officials in the field lack a clear understanding of the relative importance that the agencies' leadership places on containing costs and , therefore , are likely to select firefighting strategies without due consideration of costs . finally , the agencies have also taken , or are beginning to take , steps to improve their oversight and accountability framework , although the extent to which these steps will assist the agencies in containing costs is unknown . thus , to help the agencies manage their ongoing efforts to contain wildland fire costs effectively and efficiently , and to assist congress in its oversight role , we recommended in our report that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior work together to direct their respective agencies to ( 1 ) establish clearly defined goals and measurable objectives for containing wildland fire costs , ( 2 ) develop a strategy to achieve these goals and objectives , ( 3 ) establish performance measures that are aligned with these goals and objectives , and ( 4 ) establish a framework to ensure that officials are held accountable for achieving the goals and objectives .
