in june 2006 , we testified that effective implementation of the cmp is vulnerable due to weaknesses in existing un oversight and procurement practices . for example , we found that the un has yet to incorporate guidance for construction procurement into its procurement manual . in this report , we ( 1 ) determine whether the continued development of the cmp has been consistent with leading industry practices , ( 2 ) examine what factors contributed to the changes in the cost estimate from 2002 to 2005 and determine whether the cost estimate was updated using industry practices , ( 3 ) review the status of financing of the planned renovation , ( 4 ) identify decisions needed for the renovation to continue as planned , and ( 5 ) review the un's efforts to oversee and the u.s. department of state's ( state ) efforts to monitor the planned renovation . to address these objectives , we reviewed pertinent un design and planning documents , including the 2002 and 2005 cost estimates , and compared them with industry standards . in addition , according to a un procurement official the un procurement division will be involved in processing contract amendments and ensuring compliance with un procurement rules and procedures . the estimated total cost of the cmp increased from about $1.19 billion to almost $1.75 billion — an almost $560 million increase — between 2002 and 2005 to reflect inflation arising from a later start date , refinements to the design , and a multiphased renovation approach . we have previously reported that changes in the cost estimate should be expected as the design progresses and more project details become known . several uncertainties outside the un or cmp office's control could also have a significant impact on the final cost of the project . under the cash assessment approach , each member state would likely be assessed the cost of the renovation based on the rate of its annual regular budget contributions to the un . while the general assembly has passed a resolution stating that cash assessments would be the simplest and most cost - effective approach for funding the cmp , it has yet to decide how to finance the remaining $1.43 billion , which excludes scope options . specifically , the un would need a decision by the general assembly on a financing arrangement and a total cmp budget to ensure that funds could be available by december 2007 so that the un can procure construction services . without a general assembly decision on a financing arrangement and approval of a total cmp budget by the end of 2006 , the cmp office may not be able to determine a start date for renovation work . oios has been conducting oversight of the cmp office since 2003 and has not found any material weaknesses in its work . oios relies on funds from the cmp budget to conduct effective oversight of the cmp , which may impair its ability to secure sufficient funds . since 2000 , the un has been developing its cmp , a comprehensive renovation of its headquarters complex . to review un oversight efforts and state monitoring activities , we reviewed un documents such as the office of internal oversight services ( oios ) and board of auditor reports submitted to the general assembly , oios management letters to the cmp office , un resolutions pertaining to the oversight of the cmp , and the mission statements of oios , the board of auditors , and state's working group on the cmp .
