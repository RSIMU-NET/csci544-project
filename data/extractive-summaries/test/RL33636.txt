at their march 2007 summit , eu member states moved to boost european coordination to help secure and diversify energy supplies , increase the development and use of renewable and alternative energy resources within the eu , and reduce energy demand and consumption . although member state governments remain reluctant to cede national sovereignty over energy - security aspects of their foreign policies , they have set binding eu - wide targets for the use of renewable energies and biofuels , and have agreed to ambitious but non - binding energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction targets for the year 2020 . the strain on global demand exerted by the emerging economies of countries such as china and india , persistent instability in energy producing regions , the threat of terrorist strikes against energy infrastructure , and russia's apparent willingness to use its energy power for political ends , are all raising concerns in europe over how to address external influences that could affect future energy requirements . in several hearings during the first session of the 110 th congress , members of congress voiced concern about europe's dependence on russian energy resources , and the potential for russian manipulation of european energy markets . european leaders have responded by renewing efforts to establish a more cohesive european energy policy . commission officials place particular emphasis on the links between energy security , energy efficiency , and an eu - wide reduction in carbon emissions . although the eu approach appears to be focused largely on developing new and alternative technologies , the mckinsey study suggests it may be more cost efficient for the eu to focus more of its efforts on reducing energy use than on developing and promoting alternative and renewable energy sources . in addition , the eu has called for the formation of a european energy dialogue with african countries of strategic importance . with regard to russia , some member states hope to institutionalize a common commitment to market principles as outlined in the energy charter treaty through an eu - russia energy dialogue and in a new eu - russia partnership and cooperation agreement . european leaders are expected to agree on a solution during the first half of 2008 . although european leaders increasingly pay lip - service to the need for enhanced energy cooperation , the success of an eu energy strategy will likely depend on the ability of member states to overcome differences in addressing three fundamental challenges . within the deepening transatlantic economic relationship , energy security policy is becoming a higher priority for both the united states and the eu . just as eu member states have expressed concern regarding a perceived u.s. reluctance to link transatlantic energy security to pursuit of a global climate change treaty , u.s. administration officials and analysts point to a potential long - term threat to transatlantic relations arising from european dependence on russian energy and gazprom's growing influence in large segments of europe's energy infrastructure .
