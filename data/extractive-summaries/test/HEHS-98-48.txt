in the mid - 1990s , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) began to fundamentally change the way it delivers health care to veterans to increase the efficiency of its health care system and to improve access to medical services .  ( see app . they also use educational programs to inform people of alternatives to expensive inpatient care . prevention efforts vary by medical center . va's goal is for its medical centers to perform at least 65 percent of selected surgical procedures on an outpatient basis . most va medical centers now have outpatient surgery capability , and the percentage of such surgeries has increased nationwide from 34 to 66 percent between fiscal year 1993 and mid - fiscal year 1997 . not all networks are planning facility integrations , however . at the pittsburgh medical center , officials estimated that savings from an increase in outpatient surgeries for fiscal year 1997 totaled more than $7.5 million through may 31 , 1997 . integrations within and among medical centers have helped generate savings and increase operational efficiency . va hospitals have increased the number of primary care teams , added or improved space to accommodate additional primary care patients , shortened appointment waiting times , increased the number of locations providing community - based care , and redefined the role of va inpatient nursing home care . appointments enable va to improve scheduling of its workload and resources , reducing the time patients spend waiting for an appointment as well as that spent waiting upon arrival to be seen . this medical center is also more than doubling the number of physicians assigned to primary care . some of va's goals for cbocs are to shorten hospital lengths of stay by doing preadmission work - up or providing postdischarge follow - up care closer to the patient's home ; reduce veterans' need to travel long distances to receive care ; redirect patients currently served at medical center clinics , shortening waiting times or relieving congestion at these sites ; shorten waiting times for follow - up care , for example , postsurgical care or after a hospitalization ; and improve access to care for historically underserved veteran populations . va headquarters' monitoring of changes to the health care system is important because network and medical center directors are responding to incentives to change va's health care delivery . these changes , which are intended to improve efficiency and access , could lead to outcomes that compromise care received by some veterans . to assess va's progress in increasing the efficiency of its health care system , we examined va records documenting effects of efficiency initiatives , including increased outpatient visits , decreased bed - days of care and operating beds , reduction and reassignment of staff , and integration of services .
