the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking . addressing a federal budget deficit that is unsustainable over the long run involves strategic choices . fundamentally , the issues require deciding what government goods , services , and transfers are worth paying taxes for . most people would agree that the country benefits from a wide range of government services — air traffic controllers , border security , courts and corrections , and so forth — provided by the federal government . therefore , to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run , it is likely that ( 1 ) transfer payments , such as social security , medicare , and medicaid , to or on behalf of individuals ( which already account for half of federal spending and are growing ) must be reduced ; ( 2 ) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced ( which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government ) ; ( 3 ) taxes must be raised ; or some combination of the three . central findings of this analysis include the following: a comparatively small share of federal spending is for the direct provision of domestic government goods and services . transfers and payments to persons and to state and local governments constitute most of federal spending , about 75% of all federal spending . defense spending , accounting for about 15% of federal spending , has declined as a share of output over the past 35 years , but it also tends to vary depending , in part , on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts . the problem with the debt lies not in the past but in the future , as spending growth for health and social security is projected to continue faster than the economy as a whole . the increase in debt , in turn , leads to a significant increase in interest payments . because much of the pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in social security and medicare part a ( hospital insurance ) trust funds , keeping these funds and their sources of financing intact is a concern that could constrain choices . preserving entitlements would likely require significant increases in taxes , such as raising rates , reducing tax expenditures , increasing other taxes , or introducing new revenue sources . reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level ; thus , limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending , including entitlement programs such as social security , medicare , and medicaid . because the federal government provides about one - fifth of the revenue for state and local governments , cutbacks in transfers to these governments may , in part , shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services .
