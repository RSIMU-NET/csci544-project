given the concerns about the ability of the direct care workforce to meet current and future demands for ltss and the reported lack of data needed to estimate the size and characteristics of this workforce , you asked us for current information about direct care workers who provide ltss , such as their wages , hours , and attrition rates . oregon collected data about direct care workers through its own survey initiative and was selected for geographic variation and its high survey response rate . to identify hrsa's efforts to develop information , project supply and demand , and overcome data limitations related to the direct care workforce , we analyzed agency documents that contain details about hrsa's strategic plan , health workforce efforts , assessment of available direct care workforce data , and related workforce data needs . in addition to the congressional commission on long - term care report , hrsa reported in 2004 that informed workforce planning is needed to document the extent of shortages in direct care occupations so that states and institutions can address them and assess the impact of present and future initiatives to balance supply and demand . one of hrsa's primary goals is strengthening the health workforce . while the acs provides information on the number and characteristics of direct care workers , these data are subject to limitations , which affect their usefulness for workforce planning . the fourth state we reviewed ( oregon ) collected data in 2014 on direct care worker compensation , attrition , and the relationship between workers' wages and medicaid payment rates over time . we obtained summary results from independent provider surveys for maine and minnesota , which showed that most responding independent providers worked for a family member , a neighbor , a friend , or someone else they knew . according to hrsa's website , the national center for health workforce analysis conducts projections of the supply of and demand for the u.s. health workforce and works to overcome inherent data challenges in making these projections by improving available data ; hrsa has not yet done this for direct care workers . in spite of finding the data insufficient , hrsa has also not developed methods to overcome data limitations in projecting the direct care workforce . it has been over 10 years since hrsa last produced a comprehensive assessment of the available data on direct care workers , despite the advent of new data sources since that time ; some of these new data sources were unknown to hrsa officials . hrsa officials told us that state - collected data are often not uniform from one state to another and this limits the data's usefulness . direct care workers are responsible for providing the majority of paid hands - on care to millions of elderly and individuals with disabilities needing ltss . unless hrsa takes actions to overcome data limitations in order to make projections of supply and demand , the ability of policymakers and other stakeholders to develop appropriate workforce strategies to ensure a sufficient number of qualified direct care workers will continue to be hampered . to improve available data about the direct care workforce , we recommend that the acting administrator of the health resources and services administration take steps to produce projections of direct care workforce supply and demand and develop methods to address data limitations in order to do so . congruent with the message of our report , hhs stated that given the growth in the aging population and the challenges in recruiting and retaining direct care workers , having clear information on this workforce is critical for workforce planning . the broad occupation referred to as “nursing , psychiatric , and home health aides” also includes orderlies . we considered an industry to provide ltss if the industry , as defined by naics , ( 1 ) primarily served the elderly or those living with chronic health conditions ( i.e. , physical , cognitive , or mental disabilities ) who need assistance with activities of daily living on an ongoing basis ; ( 2 ) provided services that help individuals perform everyday activities , including health care , personal care , and supportive services , such as feeding , bathing , administering topical medication , and supported employment ; and ( 3 ) provided the services and supports in institutions ( e.g. , nursing homes ) or home - and community - based settings . the data include information on the percentage of direct care workers out of all health workers , and direct care workers' demographics , wages , hours , and benefits .
