the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides health care services to veterans who have been diagnosed with psychosis — primarily schizophrenia , a disorder that can substantially limit their ability to care for themselves , secure employment , and maintain relationships . these veterans also have a high risk of premature death , including suicide . for many of them , effective treatment , especially antipsychotic drug therapy , has reduced the severity of their illnesses and increased their ability to function in society . va's guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is consistent with published clinical practice guidelines commonly used by public and private health care systems . like most other practice guidelines , va's guideline recommends that physicians use their best medical judgment , based on clinical circumstances and patients' needs , when choosing among the atypical drugs . va's prescribing guideline also recommends that physicians use cost as a factor in deciding which atypical antipsychotic to prescribe when no clinical reason exists to choose one drug over another — a practice most of the public and private sector psychiatric experts we interviewed agreed is reasonable , appropriate , and consistent with providing quality cost - effective medical care . this policy conflicts with the prescribing guideline , because cost has greater weight than physicians' clinical judgment .
