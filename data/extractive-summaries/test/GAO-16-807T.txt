also , for much of this same time period , va has been planning and taking steps toward the modernization of its electronic health record system , with the intent of ensuring that the department can effectively deliver care for the millions of veterans and others that it serves . while the department has made progress in these efforts , it has also faced significant information technology challenges that contributed to our designation of va health care as a high risk area . in light of va and dod not implementing a solution that allowed for the seamless electronic sharing of health care data , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included requirements pertaining to the implementation , design , and planning for interoperability between the departments' electronic health record systems . even as va has undertaken numerous initiatives with dod that were intended to advance electronic health record interoperability , a significant concern is that these departments have not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts , and the value and benefits these efforts are expected to yield . accordingly , we recommended that the departments , working with the ipo , establish a time frame for identifying outcome - oriented metrics ; define related goals as a basis for determining the extent to which the departments' modernized electronic health record systems are achieving interoperability ; and update ipo guidance accordingly . further , since that time , va has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome - oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas , and it also has begun to establish baseline measurements . following the termination of the iehr initiative , va moved forward with an effort to modernize vista separately from dod's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system . the department took this course of action even though it has many health care business needs in common with those of dod . further , the results of a 2008 study pointed out that over 97 percent of inpatient requirements for electronic health record systems are common to both departments . we also issued several prior reports regarding the plans for separate systems , in which we noted that the departments did not substantiate their claims that va's vista modernization , together with dod's acquisition of a new system , would be achieved faster and at less cost than developing a single , joint system . moreover , we noted that the departments' plans to modernize their two separate systems were duplicative and stressed that their decisions should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches . however , as of june 2016 , the departments had not provided us with a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous approaches . further , with respect to their assertions that separate systems could be achieved faster , both departments had developed schedules which indicated that their separate modernization efforts are not expected to be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the previous single - system approach . as va has proceeded with its program to modernize vista ( known as vista evolution ) , the department has developed a number of plans to support its efforts . these include an interoperability plan and a road map describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018 . according to the road map , the first set of capabilities was delivered by the end of september 2014 and included access to the joint legacy viewer and a foundation for future functionality , such as an enhanced graphical user interface and enterprise messaging infrastructure . however , a recent independent assessment of health it at va reported that lengthy delays in modernizing vista had resulted in the system becoming outdated . further , this study questioned whether the vista evolution program to modernize the electronic health record system can overcome a variety of risks and technical issues that have plagued prior va initiatives of similar size and complexity . in speaking about this matter , va's under secretary for health has asserted that the department will follow through on its plans to complete the vista evolution program in fiscal year 2018 . in addition , va's unsuccessful efforts over many years to modernize its vista system raise concern about how the department can continue to justify the development and operation of an electronic health record system that is separate from dod's system , even though the departments have common system needs .
