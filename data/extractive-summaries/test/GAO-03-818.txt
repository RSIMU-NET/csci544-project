the department of defense ( dod ) is currently examining a core competency - based approach for making sourcing decisions — that is , the decision to use a public or private sector source to perform a necessary agency function or activity based on whether the function or activity is core to the agency's mission . it has expressed interest in examining the use of other alternatives , such as public - private partnering , transferring functions to other agencies , employee stock ownerships , and quasi - government corporations . progress in assessing core functions has been varied and limited across the major defense components , and affected by somewhat ambiguous and subjective definitions of what constitutes a “core function.” these multiple and somewhat ambiguous definitions of what is a “core function” have made it difficult for the components to easily employ the core competency approach to decision - making , and some dod components have sought additional guidance and / or applied their own criteria to identify core functions . in addition , the army , which has devoted the greatest attention to assessing core functions , has found that distinguishing between core and non - core functions , by itself , has limited value because that distinction alone does not necessarily prescribe a sourcing decision . additional factors must also be considered . at the same time , some dod officials indicated that the use of some alternatives could be limited without special legislative authorities and / or repeal of various existing prohibitions . dod has made some progress in identifying and using sourcing arrangements that are alternatives to a - 76 , including some as part of an initiative to identify alternatives through use of pilot projects , and a few others that have been identified by the services as they have focused on the core initiative . to meet omb's goal of directly converting or studying 15 percent of the 453,000 commercial activity positions identified in the 2000 fair act inventories by the end of fiscal year 2003 , dod would need to complete a - 76 studies on about 68,000 positions between fiscal year 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2003 . under the core - competency process , the air force identified large numbers of military personnel who could be reassigned to meet other military requirements and be replaced by civilian or contractor personnel who may be a more economical alternative . specifically , the objectives of this report were to assess ( 1 ) the department's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , ( 2 ) the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and ( 3 ) the current status of dod's a - 76 program . where used previously: u.s . description: the defense logistics agency ( dla ) is proposing that the repair and rebuilding of depot - level industrial plant equipment by in - house personnel at the defense supply center richmond's facility in mechanicsburg , pennsylvania , be subject to direct conversion through an a - 76 waiver in accordance with the office of management and budget circular a - 76's revised supplement handbook , part i , chapter i , section e. alternative: waiver to a - 76 full cost comparison study positions affected: approximately 82 civilians status: dod assessed the applicability of omb circular a - 76 to this function and determined that the mechanicsburg facility is a depot level maintenance and repair operation and is therefore exempt from omb circular a - 76 . dod competitive sourcing: air force reserve command a - 76 competitions .
