prior assessments of va management , both internal and external , have found shortcomings in va procurement . as part of our work for our september 2016 report , in order to evaluate va's procurement organizational structure , we reviewed policy documents and interviewed officials in leadership , local contracting office management , and contracting officer roles . to assess va's procurement policies , we obtained and analyzed policy documents , and interviewed officials responsible for making and implementing procurement policy . to assess opportunities to improve va's key procurement functions and to save money , we obtained and analyzed information regarding va's medical - surgical prime vendor program and interviewed officials with roles in management , contracting , and operations for the program . the office of acquisition and logistics ( oal ) is responsible for oversight of contracting across va , including setting policy and issuing warrants to contracting officers . its 167 medical centers are currently organized into 19 veterans integrated service networks ( visn ) , regional networks that manage some aspects of operations . given va procurement's highly decentralized structure , a given customer — such as a department in a medical center or a program office — may need to work with multiple contracting entities to meet its procurement needs . at one visn we visited , an official reported procuring one type of high - tech medical equipment through the sac even though this area is specifically designated as nac's responsibility because she expected that the sac could execute the purchase more quickly . however , many of va's regulations and policies are outdated , most notably the va acquisition regulation ( vaar ) , which has not been updated since 2008 . in addition , va communicates interim procurement policies in a number of different forms , some of which can be duplicative . figure 3 illustrates the numerous sources that contracting officers must turn to for guidance . use of these national contracts is also required by va policy and regulation . in our september 2016 report , we recommended that va take steps to facilitate the transition to the new mspv process , including ensuring that sac collects data to monitor the use of national contracts in the new system , that sac and vha establish achievable time frames for eliminating federal supply schedule items from the mspv catalog once national contracts are in place , and that the new ordering interface clearly distinguish between items on national contracts and the 4,500 items on the federal supply schedules . va's substantial buying power presents many opportunities for procurement cost savings , but the department has not consistently taken advantage of them . a key aspect of strategic sourcing is consolidating similar requirements to manage them collectively , reaping cost savings and efficiency gains . there are opportunities to better apply strategic sourcing principles at the regional level , as well .
