our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs' progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in our year 2000 assessment guide , ( 2 ) identify the risks irs faces to completing the year 2000 effort on time , and ( 3 ) identify risks to the continuity of irs operations in the event of year 2000-induced system failures . some of the steps involved in converting existing systems include ( 1 ) converting applications ; ( 2 ) upgrading hardware and / or systems software for mainframes , minicomputers / file servers , and personal computers ; ( 3 ) upgrading telecommunications networks ; and ( 4 ) ensuring that external data exchanges are year 2000 compliant . irs is experiencing delays in completing conversion efforts for its existing systems and major systems replacement efforts . as of april 24 , 1998 , irs reported that it had completed the first 12 steps of its 14-step conversion process on applications for about 46 percent ( 59 systems ) of its 127 mission - critical systems . irs' schedule calls for completing the first 12 steps for the remaining 54 percent ( 68 systems ) of the mission - critical systems by january 1999 . the completion schedule for consolidating the data processing portion of service center operations has been extended from december 1998 until after june 1999 . irs officials said they expect to complete the year 2000 portions of mainframe consolidation ( i.e. , terminal replacement and the communication replacement system ) by the original completion date of december 1998 . according to our assessment guide , a master conversion and replacement schedule should be a part of an agency's year 2000 program plan . thus , irs faces the risk that resources may not be available when needed . irs' century date change project office has developed a “century date change contingency management plan.” this plan states that “developing contingency procedures for all of irs' numerous systems will require a significant amount of knowledgeable resources , in most cases the same resources assigned to perform the actual century date change conversion effort.” to minimize the number of contingency plans that irs would have to develop , the contingency management plan calls for developing contingency plans only for those business functions or processes that are supported by application software projects that are at risk of not being made year 2000 compliant on schedule . irs expects to make its existing service center mainframe computers year 2000 compliant by january 1999 . for example , in 1996 , as part of an effort to redesign its work processes , irs began an effort to identify and map core business processes . we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue take the following steps to better ensure that irs has adequately assessed the vulnerabilities of its core business processes in the event of year 2000-induced system failures: solicit the input of business functional area officials to identify irs' core business processes and prioritize those processes that must continue in the event of year 2000-induced failures ; map irs' mission - critical systems to those core business processes ; determine the impact of information system failures on each core business assess any existing business continuity and contingency plans that may have been developed for non - year 2000 reasons to determine whether these plans are applicable to year 2000-induced failures , and develop and test contingency plans for core business processes if existing plans are not appropriate . implementation . irs , treasury , and contractors have formed integrated teams to address the year 2000 telecommunications issues . u.s. general accounting office p.o .
