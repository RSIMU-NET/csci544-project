about 7,500 peace corps volunteers currently serve in 70 “posts” ( country missions ) around the world . volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable communications , police , or medical services . as americans , they may be viewed as relatively wealthy and , hence , good targets for criminal activity . my testimony today will summarize and update , where possible , key findings from our 2002 report related to ( 1 ) trends in crime against volunteers and the agency's system for generating such information , ( 2 ) the agency's field implementation of its safety and security framework , and ( 3 ) the underlying factors that contributed to peace corps' performance in the field . reported incidence rates for most types of assaults have increased since peace corps began collecting data in 1990 , but have stabilized in recent years . peace corps' system for gathering and analyzing data on crime against volunteers has produced useful insights , but we reported in 2002 that steps could be taken to enhance the system . the full extent of crime against volunteers , however , is unknown because of significant underreporting . however , these new systems have not yet been put into operation . in 2002 , we reported that , while all posts had tested their emergency action plan , many of the plans had shortcomings , and tests of the plans varied in quality and comprehensiveness . also , our analysis showed improvement in the quality of information forwarded to headquarters . these included high staff turnover , uneven application of supervision and oversight mechanisms , and unclear guidance . the agency has made some progress but has not completed implementation of these initiatives . the agency's new crime data analyst is a part of this directorate . in addition , peace corps has appointed six additional field - based safety and security officers , bringing the number of such individuals on duty to nine ( with three more positions to be added by the end of 2004 ) ; authorized each post to appoint a safety and security coordinator to provide a point of contact for the field - based safety and security officers and to assist country directors in ensuring their post's compliance with agency policies , including policies pertaining to monitoring volunteers and responding to their safety and security concerns ( all but one post have filled this position ) ; appointed safety and security desk officers in each of peace corps' three regional directorates in washington , d.c. , to monitor post compliance in conjunction with each region's country desk officers ; and appointed a compliance officer , reporting to the peace corps director , to independently examine post practices and to follow up on inspector general recommendations on safety and security . to clarify agency guidance , peace corps has created a “compliance tool” or checklist that provides a fairly detailed and explicit framework for headquarters staff to employ in monitoring post efforts to put peace corps' safety and security guidance into practice in their countries , strengthened guidance on volunteer site selection and development , developed standard operating procedures for post emergency action plans , concluded a protocol clarifying that the inspector general's staff has responsibility for coordinating the agency's response to crimes against volunteers .
