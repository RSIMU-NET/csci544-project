as you know , the radio - frequency spectrum is used to provide an array of wireless communications services that are critical to the u.s. economy and various government missions , such as national security . my statement today will identify ( 1 ) the extent to which the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has adopted market - based mechanisms for commercial uses of spectrum , ( 2 ) the extent to which market - based mechanisms have been adopted for federal government use of spectrum , ( 3 ) options for improving spectrum management , and ( 4 ) potential barriers to spectrum reform . market - based mechanisms can help promote the efficient use of spectrum by invoking the forces of supply and demand — that is , they provide users an incentive to use the spectrum as efficiently as possible . for example , although fcc currently employs largely a command - and - control process for spectrum allocation , it has provided greater flexibility within certain spectrum bands . in addition , fcc began using auctions to assign spectrum licenses for commercial uses in 1994 . finally , fcc has taken steps to facilitate greater secondary market activity , which may provide an additional mechanism to promote the efficient use of spectrum . while some countries have adopted market - based mechanisms to encourage the efficient use of spectrum by government agencies , the department of commerce's national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) has not adopted similar mechanisms for federal government use in the united states . ntia imposes fees that recover only a portion of its cost to administer spectrum management , rather than incentive - based fees — that is , fees that more closely resemble market prices and thus encourage greater spectrum efficiency among government users ; currently , ntia does not have authority to impose fees that exceed its spectrum management costs . however , adopting market - based mechanisms for federal government use of spectrum might be difficult or undesirable in some contexts because of the primacy of certain government missions , the lack of flexibility in use of spectrum for some agencies , and the lack of financial incentives for government users . the most frequently cited options include ( 1 ) extending fcc's auction authority , ( 2 ) reexamining the use and distribution of spectrum , and ( 3 ) ensuring clearly defined rights and flexibility in commercially licensed spectrum bands ; there was no consensus on these options , except for extending fcc's auction authority . the current management framework may pose barriers to reform since , while two agencies have been given responsibility for aspects of spectrum management , neither has been given ultimate decision - making authority over all spectrum use or the authority to impose fundamental reform , such as increasing the reliance on market - based mechanisms . under this divided management framework , fcc manages spectrum for nonfederal users while ntia manages spectrum for federal government users . however , spectrum management issues and major reform cross the jurisdictions of both agencies . given the success of fcc's use of auctions and the overwhelming support among industry stakeholders and experts for extending fcc's auction authority , we suggested that the congress consider extending fcc's auction authority . in february 2006 , the congress extended fcc's auction authority to 2011 with the passage of the deficit reduction act of 2005 . as such , fcc and ntia have different perspectives on spectrum use . as such , contentious and protracted negotiations arise over spectrum management issues .
