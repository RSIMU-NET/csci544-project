we have previously reported that government facilities — some of which contain high - security space used for classified operations , data centers , and to store items such as weapons and sensitive evidence — are vulnerable to threats from foreign sources that may affect their information systems and the physical security of the occupants . we reviewed: ( 1 ) what is known about foreign ownership of high - security space leased by gsa ; ( 2 ) what potential risks , if any , are posed by foreign ownership of high - security gsa - leased space associated with physical and cybersecurity and sources of funding ; and ( 3 ) what policies and procedures guide gsa's leasing of space from foreign - owned entities and how gsa follows them . to determine what is known about foreign ownership of high - security space leased by gsa , we conducted our own assessment of the ownership of high - security gsa - leased space and compared our findings with a list of leased high - security space that gsa provided . we visited three foreign - owned high - security facilities that gsa is leasing to interview tenant agencies about security - related issues . dhs implemented our recommendation in 2016 . we found that 26 different agencies and departmental components occupy high - security leased space in buildings that we identified as foreign owned , 22 of which occupy space that we identified as owned by companies based in non - nato countries ( china , israel , south korea , and japan ) . the total amount of space leased was about 3.3 million square feet at an annual cost of about $97 million . the other five agencies that knew about occupying foreign - owned space had taken actions to mitigate the risk or were not concerned . several federal officials who assess foreign investments in the united states and selected real estate company representatives we spoke to told us that leasing space in foreign - owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage , unauthorized cyber and physical access to the facilities , and sabotage . another potential risk to the government regarding foreign - owned leased space is the possibility of entering into leases with hidden beneficial owners of buildings that are using the investment to launder money . when leasing space , gsa is required , among other things , to determine whether the prospective lessor is a responsible party . “immediate owner” means an “entity , other than the offeror , that has direct control of the offeror.” this definition includes “ownership or interlocking management , identity of interests among family members , shared facilities and equipment , and the common use of employees.” a highest level owner means “the entity that owns or controls an immediate owner of the offeror , or that owns or controls one or more entities that control an immediate owner of the offer.” of the 8 lessors based in non - nato countries that we identified from leases entered into prior to november 1 , 2014 , and thus not required to include immediate and highest level ownership information , 7 did not self - identify as foreign owners on their certifications and representations form . because gsa is not required to identify beneficial ownership information for the space it leases and because gsa is not informing tenant agencies when the space they are occupying is leased from foreign owners , tenants may not be aware that they are occupying space that is foreign owned and may not be addressing any security risks associated with foreign ownership . however , because ownership information was not available regarding about one - third of the buildings with high - security leased space , gsa is likely leasing from more foreign companies than is readily identifiable . as a result , gsa cannot rely on cfius to identify and mitigate these risks . we provided a draft of this report for review and comment to gsa , the departments of defense ( dod ) , energy ( doe ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( doj ) , state , the treasury , and veterans affairs ( va ) ; the administrative office of united states courts ; the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) ; the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) ; the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) ; the social security administration , and agencies which determined that the information about the foreign - owned buildings that they occupy is for official use only and is not included in this report .
