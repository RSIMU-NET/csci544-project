the conservation title ( title ii ) of the agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l . total mandatory spending for the title is projected at $28.3 billion over 5 years ( fy2014-fy2018 ) and $57.6 billion over 10 years ( fy2012-fy2023 ) . 97-98 ) . debate on the 2014 farm bill focused on a number of controversial issues . while many did not consider conservation to be controversial , nonetheless , a number of policy issues shaped the final version of the title and ultimately its role in the enacted farm bill . these programs are not generally addressed in the context of a farm bill and are not covered in detail in this report , except for cases where the 2014 farm bill made amendments to the program . the 2014 farm bill included several program consolidation measures , including the repeal of 12 active and inactive programs , the creation of two new programs , and the merging of two programs into existing ones . the two main working lands programs are the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) and the conservation stewardship program ( csp ) . eligible producers enter into contracts to receive payment for implementing conservation practices . the 2014 farm bill repeals whip and amends eqip to require that 5% of total eqip payments benefit wildlife habitat . other sub - programs of crp , such as the farmable wetlands ( fw ) program , were also reauthorized and amended . the 2014 farm bill repealed the conservation easement programs — wetlands reserve program ( wrp ) , farmland protection program ( fpp ) , and grp — and created a new agricultural conservation easement program ( acep ) . acep retains most of the program provisions in the repealed easement programs by establishing two types of easements: agricultural land easements ( similar to fpp and grp ) that limit non - agricultural uses on productive farm or grass lands , and wetland reserve easements ( similar to wrp ) that protect and restore wetlands . similar to the consolidation of the easement programs , the 2014 farm bill consolidated a number of the "other" conservation programs that provided partnership opportunities or multi - state funding for watershed - scale projects . the regional conservation partnership program ( rcpp ) creates partnership opportunities to target and leverage federal conservation funding for specific areas and resource concerns . rcpp incorporates the agricultural water enhancement program ( awep ) , the cooperative conservation partnership initiative ( ccpi ) , the chesapeake bay watershed program ( cbwp ) , and the great lakes basin program for soil erosion and sediment control ( glbp ) . one of the most significant changes made by the 2014 farm bill was the addition of federal crop insurance premium subsidies to the list of benefits that could possibly be lost if a producer were found out of compliance . 113-79 are included in brackets in the "enacted 2014 farm bill" column .
