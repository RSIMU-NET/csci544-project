because tritium has a relatively short half - life of 12 years and therefore decays at a rate of about 5.5 percent per year , tritium in existing weapons must be periodically replenished , and an assured source of tritium is necessary to maintain the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile . since that time , as the united states decreased the size of its nuclear arsenal , nnsa has been able to meet its tritium requirements by harvesting and recycling it from dismantled nuclear warheads . nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium are established jointly by the department of defense ( dod ) and nnsa . to produce tritium , stainless steel rods containing lithium aluminate and zirconium — called tritium - producing burnable absorber rods ( tpbar ) — are irradiated in the tennessee valley authority's ( tva ) watts bar 1 commercial nuclear power reactor in tennessee . in this context , in response to your request that we review the tritium readiness program , we ( 1 ) determined the extent to which nnsa has been able to overcome technical challenges producing tritium , ( 2 ) determined the extent to which nnsa is able to meet current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , and ( 3 ) assessed the management of nnsa's tritium readiness program . despite the fact that the pacific northwest national laboratory has redesigned several components within the tpbars to reduce the amount of tritium permeating into the reactor coolant at the watts bar 1 reactor , tritium is still leaking from the tpbars at higher - than - expected rates . however , to date , these plans have not been actively coordinated with nrc , which ultimately must approve any modifications to reactor operations . nnsa has been unable to solve the technical challenges it has been experiencing producing tritium . faced with significantly lower tritium production than originally planned due to tritium permeation , nnsa and tva have been developing plans to increase the number of tpbars being irradiated at watts bar 1 during each reactor fueling cycle as well as the number of reactors irradiating tpbars , according to nnsa and tva officials . although the number of nuclear weapons in the u.s. stockpile is decreasing , these reductions are unlikely to result in a significant decrease to tritium requirements . although nnsa has attempted to ensure a reliable long - term supply of tritium , our review found two problems with nnsa's management of the tritium readiness program . first , nnsa was unable to provide us with evidence about its adherence to the appropriate contracting procedures when purchasing components and services for the tritium readiness program . second , because of , among other things , the contract structure nnsa has entered into with suppliers of components and services for the tritium readiness program , program funds are being expended much more slowly than planned . as a result , the program is accumulating large unexpended funding balances beyond thresholds established by doe . however , to ensure large amounts of unexpended funding do not accumulate that could be better used for other purposes , doe has established thresholds of acceptable levels of unexpended funds that may be carried over from one fiscal year to the next . while large unexpended funding balances do not necessarily indicate that the tritium program is being mismanaged , the fact that they have been increasing indicates that nnsa is requesting more funding than it needs on an annual basis — funds that could be appropriated for other purposes . to increase confidence in the nation's continued ability to produce a reliable supply of tritium in the future and to improve the management of nnsa's tritium readiness program , we recommend that the secretary of energy direct the administrator of nnsa to take the following four actions: in cooperation with tva and nrc , develop a comprehensive plan to manage releases of tritium from tva's watts bar 1 and any other reactors chosen to irradiate tpbars in the future .
