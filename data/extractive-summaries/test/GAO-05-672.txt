by early 2003 , dod was planning for doe to be involved in both removing and disposing of sources from iraq . the final packaging of the sources did not occur until may 2004 when doe experts packaged them for shipment to the united states . dtra initially said it could not accept this contract provision because it did not control the troops who could provide such protection . despite dtra's efforts , however , the total number of radiological sources in iraq remains unknown . during approximately 140 collection missions conducted between september 2003 and may 2004 , dtra and its contractor collected about 1,400 unsecured radiological sources and inventoried and left in place about 700 sources that dtra deemed secure . state is also facilitating technical assistance . according to state officials , because of uncertainties associated with the continuing formation of the iraqi government , state will have to monitor iraqi efforts to ensure the continued growth and success of an independent , competent , and sustainable regulatory authority for the control of radioactive sources and materials . dod asked its national defense university ( ndu ) to study dod's overall mission to find and eliminate wmd in iraq , determine what lessons could be learned from it , and recommend improvements . in addition , to ensure that planning and preparing for potential future missions is carried out in advance , we recommend that the secretary of defense provide specific guidance for collecting and securing radiological sources , including integrating the objective of collecting and securing radiological sources with military combat objectives , including specifying how security protection , if needed , would be provided to the organization with responsibility for managing radiological sources and whether combat troops would be required to secure sources and provide protection for operations to collect and secure radiological sources ; determining criteria to define which radiological sources ( 1 ) are of greatest risk and should be collected , ( 2 ) are being properly used and secured and thus can be left in place , and ( 3 ) pose minimal threat and thus do not need to be collected ; specifying the health and safety standards , after considering how u.s. standards for handling , securing , transporting , and disposing of radiological sources were modified for use in iraq ; officially designating the organization responsible within dod for collecting , securing , and disposing of sources and establishing agreements between that organization and other dod organizations that may be involved with these efforts ; establishing agreements and points of contact with doe and other federal agencies , as needed , to specify the coordination , technical expertise , equipment , and facilities that may be needed to collect and secure sources in , or remove them from , a foreign country ; identifying under which circumstances and for what purposes dod will contract with private firms to conduct activities to collect and secure radiological sources , and address legal and contracting issues to ensure the timely use of contractors ; and establishing guidelines concerning the role of radiological experts from the country where sources need to be collected and secured . this report ( 1 ) assesses department of defense ( dod ) readiness to collect and secure radiological sources in iraq from the start of the 2003 war , ( 2 ) presents information on the number of radiological sources the defense threat reduction agency ( dtra ) secured by the time of the june 2004 transition to the interim iraqi government , ( 3 ) describes the assistance the united states has provided , and plans to provide in the future , to the iraqi government to help regulate radiological sources in iraq , and ( 4 ) examines dod and department of energy ( doe ) actions to assess their experiences in iraq and apply any lessons learned to possible future radiological source collection missions . based on the iraq experience , the ndu report recommended that dod develop and maintain the capability to quickly eliminate wmd in hostile environments .
