since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , tsa has implemented a multilayered system of security composed of people , processes , and technology to protect the transportation system . one of tsa's security layers is nedctp , composed of over 800 explosives detection canine teams — a canine paired with a handler — aimed at deterring and detecting the use of explosive devices in the u.s. transportation system . through nedctp , tsa trains , deploys , and certifies explosives detection canine teams . l. no . my testimony today addresses the extent to which tsa has ( 1 ) regularly analyzed data to identify program trends and areas working well or in need of corrective action , and ( 2 ) comprehensively assessed the effectiveness of pscs , and coordinated with stakeholders to deploy psc teams to the highest - risk airports and utilize them as intended . this statement is based on our january 2013 report and includes selected updates on the status of tsa's efforts to implement the recommendations in that report . since our january 2013 report , tsa has taken steps to analyze key data on the performance of its canine teams to better identify program trends , as we recommended . we concluded that without conducting the assessments and analyzing the results of these tests to determine if there were any search areas or type of explosives in which canine teams were more effective compared with others , and what , if any , training may have been needed to mitigate deficiencies , tsa was missing an opportunity to fully utilize the results . in january 2013 , we recommended that tsa regularly analyze available data to identify program trends and areas that are working well and those in need of corrective action to guide program resources and activities . tsa also reinstated short notice assessments in july 2013 , and in the event a team fails , the fcc completes a report that includes an analysis of the team's training records to identify an explanation for the failure . we also reported in january 2013 that tsa had not completed an assessment to determine where within the airport psc teams would be most effectively utilized , but rather tsa leadership focused on initially deploying psc teams to a single location within the airport — the sterile area — because it thought it would be the best way to foster stakeholders' , specifically airport operators' and law enforcement agencies' , acceptance of the teams . although this assessment was not intended to be included as part of dhs s&t's and tsa's formal assessment of psc effectiveness , the results of the assessment suggested , and tsa officials and dhs s&t's canine explosives detection project manager agreed , that a systematic assessment of pscs with conventional canines could provide tsa with information to determine whether pscs provide an enhanced security benefit compared with conventional leo aviation canine teams that have already been deployed to airport terminals . we recommended that tsa expand and complete testing , in conjunction with dhs s&t , to assess the effectiveness of pscs and conventional canines in all airport areas deemed appropriate prior to making additional psc deployments to help ( 1 ) determine whether pscs are effective at screening passengers , and resource expenditures for psc training are warranted , and ( 2 ) inform decisions regarding the type of canine team to deploy and where to optimally deploy such teams within airports . tsa concurred and has taken some actions to address our recommendation , but further action is needed to fully address it . although tsa has taken steps to determine whether psc teams are effective and where in the airport environment to optimally deploy such teams , as of june 2014 , tsa has not compared the effectiveness of pscs and conventional canines in order to determine if the greater cost of training canines in the passenger screening method is warranted . in our january 2013 report , we found that tsa's 2012 strategic framework calls for the deployment of psc teams based on risk ; however , airport stakeholder concerns about the appropriateness of tsa's response resolution protocols for these teams resulted in psc teams not being deployed to the highest - risk airports . specifically , as of june 2014 , the psc teams for which tsa had funding and not already deployed to a specific airport at the time our report was issued have been deployed to , or allocated to , the highest - risk airports .
