iraq obtained more than $67 billion in oil revenues through the program ; as of november 2003 , about $31 billion in commodities and humanitarian assistance had been delivered to iraq . internal controls also serve as the first line of defense in safeguarding assets and preventing fraud , waste , and abuse . for example , the un allowed iraq to control contract negotiations for imported commodities with little oversight , allowing the regime to obtain illicit funds through contract surcharges and kickbacks . several countries in the region depended on iraqi trade , but no provisions were made to address the economic impact of the sanctions on these countries . the sanctions helped prevent the iraq regime from obtaining prohibited military and dual - use items , but little attention was given to oversight of the economic activities related to the oil for food program , such as monitoring the price and value of iraq's contracts . the un did not adequately address other key internal control elements as it implemented the oil for food program: ( 1 ) establishing clear authorities , ( 2 ) identifying and addressing program risks , and ( 3 ) ensuring adequate monitoring and oversight . moreover , the un did not assess emerging risks as the oil for food program expanded from a 6-month emergency measure to deliver food and medicine to a 6-year program that provided more than $31 billion to 24 economic sectors . both oip , as an office in the un secretariat , and the security council's iraq sanctions committee were responsible for the management and oversight of the iraq sanctions and oil for food program . these inspectors mostly verified the arrival of goods in the country for the purpose of paying the contractor . however , iraq did not tender a contract for the meter . a comprehensive risk assessment following the decision to allow iraqi control over contracting and monitoring might have revealed the need for more rigorous activities to review the prices the regime charged and the quality of goods it contracted to prevent or help lessen the opportunity for illicit charges . although the un focus on screening military and dual - use items was largely effective in constraining iraq's ability to import these goods through the oil for food program , the un's neglect of iraq's illicit revenue streams from smuggling and kickbacks undermined the program's goal of using iraqi oil revenues to benefit the iraqi people . establish clear authorities for key management , oversight , and monitoring activities . assess the role of internal audit and evaluation units and take steps to ensure that these entities have the resources and independence needed for effective oversight . although the un's internal audit office audited some aspects of the oil for food program and identified hundreds of irregularities , it lacked the resources and independence to provide effective oversight of this costly and complex un effort . in our report on the oil for food program's internal controls , we recommend that the secretary of state and the permanent representative of the united states to the un work with other member states to encourage the secretary general to ensure that un programs with considerable financial risks establish , apply , and enforce the principles of internationally accepted internal control standards , with particular attention to comprehensive and timely risk assessments ; and strengthen internal controls throughout the un system , based in part on the lessons learned from the oil for food program .
