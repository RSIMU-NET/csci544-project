because a number of bills have been introduced in congress that would establish a national breach notification requirement , you asked us to review the costs and benefits of such a requirement and the link between data breaches and identity theft . breaches of sensitive personal data in recent years at companies , universities , government agencies , and other organizations have heightened public awareness about data security and the risks of identity theft , and have led to the introduction of breach notification requirements in many state legislatures . for example , representatives of a variety of organizations — including the department of justice , california's office of privacy protection , the consumer data industry association ( a trade group representing many information resellers ) , and the ponemon institute ( a private research organization ) — characterized data breaches in the united states as being “prevalent” or “common.” although we did not identify comprehensive data on the extent of data breaches , available information from several sources does corroborate the anecdotal evidence that such breaches occur frequently . data breaches have been reported at a wide range of public and private institutions , including federal , state , and local government agencies ; public and private colleges and universities ; hospitals and other medical facilities ; retailers ; banks and other financial institutions ; information resellers ; and others . several cases have been identified in which a data breach appears to have resulted in identity theft , but available data and information from law enforcement and industry association representatives indicated that most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft . many of the law enforcement officials said that , based on their experience , data breaches that result in harm have usually involved fraud on existing accounts ( such as credit card fraud ) rather than the unauthorized creation of new accounts . for example , credit or debit card information such as card numbers and expiration dates generally cannot be used alone to open unauthorized new accounts . hardware requirements . breach notification requirements have several potential benefits , including creating incentives for entities to improve their data security practices ( and thus prevent potential breaches from occurring ) , allowing affected consumers to take measures to prevent or mitigate identity theft , and serving to respect individuals' basic right to know when their personal information is compromised . thus , policymakers face the challenge of setting a notification standard that allows individuals to take steps to protect themselves where the risk of harm exists , while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level of risk warrants such action . public reporting of data breaches may raise general awareness among consumers about the risks of identity theft and ways they can mitigate these risks , such as periodically reviewing their credit reports . for example , entities may incur costs for developing and formalizing incident response plans . entities experiencing a breach also often provide affected individuals with free credit monitoring services . for example , vermont requires notification unless an entity can demonstrate that misuse of the breached data “is not reasonably possible.” in contrast , north carolina requires notification only when it has been determined that the breach has resulted , or is reasonably likely to result , in illegal use of the data or creates a material risk of harm to a consumer . however , because breaches vary in the risk they present , and because most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft , a notification that is risk based appears appropriate . should congress choose to enact a federal breach notification requirement , use of the risk - based approaches that the federal banking regulators and the president's identity theft task force advocate could avoid undue burden on organizations and unnecessary and counterproductive notifications to consumers . our report objectives were to examine ( 1 ) what is known about the incidence and circumstances of breaches of sensitive personal information ; ( 2 ) what information exists on the extent to which breaches of sensitive personal information have resulted in identity theft ; and ( 3 ) the potential benefits , costs , and challenges associated with breach notification requirements . we analyzed the three independent lists to create a single , nonduplicative list of data breaches that had been reported in the news media from january 2005 through december 2006 .
