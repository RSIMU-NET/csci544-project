cercla authorizes epa to compel the parties responsible for the contamination to clean up the sites ; allows epa to pay for cleanups , then seek reimbursement from the responsible parties ; and establishes a trust fund to help epa pay for cleanups and related program activities . until 1995 , the trust fund was financed primarily by a tax on crude oil and certain chemicals and an environmental tax on corporations . the npl is epa's list of the nation's most contaminated sites . since fiscal year 2000 , the superfund program has increasingly relied on the revenues from general fund appropriations to supplement the superfund trust fund , with general fund supplements growing overall — in constant 2002 dollars — from $283 million in fiscal year 1995 to $676 million in fiscal year 2002 . epa and state officials told us that they consider a variety of additional factors , the most common of which are determinations of whether ( 1 ) other federal or state programs are available to cleanup the site , ( 2 ) a viable responsible party has been identified to clean up the site , and ( 3 ) the cost or complexity of the cleanup effort is likely to require federal assistance through the superfund program . however , epa officials expect that the balance of the superfund trust fund available for future appropriations will be depleted at the end of fiscal year 2003 . because superfund lacks indicators to fully measure the outcomes of the program's cleanup efforts , epa has asked the advisory council to develop criteria by which to measure the program's progress . however , it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations ; and its findings are not expected until december 2003 , at the earliest . as the superfund program continues to add sites to the npl and funding sources shift toward general revenues , the effect of epa's actions to address future program challenges remains uncertain . while the superfund program has implemented indicators to gauge the impacts of its efforts on human health and the environment , epa has acknowledged the limitations of its current means of measuring program performance and agrees that this shortcoming prevents the agency from communicating the outcomes of its work at hazardous waste sites to the public , congress , states , and the regulated community . if successfully implemented for the superfund program , establishing these measures would also help epa and the congress make the difficult funding , policy , and program decisions that the current budget environment demands . the objectives of this review were to examine ( 1 ) the current status of the superfund program , ( 2 ) the factors guiding the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) selection of sites to be placed on the national priorities list ( npl ) , and ( 3 ) the program's future outlook .
