since 1979 , egypt has received about $60 billion in military and economic assistance overall with about $34 billion in the form of foreign military financing ( fmf ) grants and loans that enable egypt to purchase u.s. - manufactured military goods and services . to fund this program , approximately $1.3 billion has been appropriated annually and disbursed through a cash flow financing arrangement that allows egypt to spread the payments over several years . specifically , we ( 1 ) describe the types and amounts of fmf assistance provided to egypt , ( 2 ) assess the financing arrangements used to provide fmf assistance to egypt , and ( 3 ) evaluate how the united states assesses fmf assistance to egypt and its contribution to the advancement of u.s. foreign policy and security goals . egypt is currently among the largest recipients of u.s. foreign assistance , along with israel , afghanistan , and iraq . these interests include building friendly nations' capabilities for self - defense and coalition operations , strengthening military support for containing transnational threats , protecting democratically elected governments , and fostering closer military ties between u.s. and recipient nations.according to state , the objectives of the fmf program worldwide include: assisting friendly foreign militaries in procuring u.s. defense articles and services for their countries' self defense and other security needs ; promoting coalition efforts in regional conflicts and the global war on improving capabilities of friendly foreign militaries to assist in international crisis response operations ; contributing to the professionalism of military forces ; enhancing rationalization , standardization , and interoperability of friendly foreign military forces ; maintaining support for democratically elected governments ; and supporting the u.s. industrial base by promoting the export of u.s. defense - related goods and services . over the life of the fmf program , egypt has purchased 36 apache helicopters , 220 f - 16 aircraft , 880 m1a1 tanks , and the accompanying training and maintenance to support these systems , among other items ( see fig . as of march 22 , 2006 , the value of loas anticipating future funding totaled approximately $2 billion , some of which are not due for full payment until 2011 . egyptian and u.s. officials cited several examples of egypt's support for u.s. goals . dod has not defined the degree of interoperability that it seeks to achieve with the egyptian military , nor has it determined how to measure progress towards this goal . achieving interoperability in egypt is complicated by both the lack of a common definition of interoperability and limitations on some types of sensitive equipment transfers . given the longevity of the fmf program , its relatively high appropriation levels , the strategic importance of egypt in the middle east , and congressional interest in assessing the balance between economic and military assistance provided to egypt , we recommend that the secretaries of state and defense take the following two actions: conduct an assessment of the impact of potential shifts in future appropriations on the egypt fmf program . evaluating the degree to which the program meets its goals would be important information for congressional oversight , particularly as congress assesses the balance between economic and military assistance to egypt , as well as the impact on u.s. foreign policy interests . specifically , we interviewed u.s. department of defense ( dod ) , and defense security cooperation agency ( dsca ) officials . in addition , we interviewed egyptian military officials in cairo and ministry of foreign affairs officials at the egyptian embassy in washington , d.c. to assess the financing arrangements used to provide fmf assistance to egypt , and determine how undisbursed balances accumulated in the egypt fmf program accounts , we examined data from dsca's credit system database and interviewed officials from the dsca middle east and south asia division and comptroller's office , as well as the defense finance and accounting service .
