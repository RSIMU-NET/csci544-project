this urbanized area formula program received 42 percent of fta grant funds — about $22 billion from fiscal years 2004 through 2009 . specifically , we identified ( 1 ) to what extent fta's triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , ( 2 ) the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process , and ( 3 ) fta's performance measures for the triennial review and to what extent fta's measures meet key attributes of successful performance measures . fta also uses a similar , general review to oversee grantees that receive rural area formula funds — a state management review . while fta uses several tools to help grantees meet more requirements , especially in areas with the greatest number of findings , it could do more to improve grantees' performance by identifying the underlying causes and by objectively noting the severity of the finding . one management practice included linking the job descriptions of pertinent individuals to the triennial review — a practice that grantee executives said contributed to a culture of accountability . however , we found a few areas where fta could improve the triennial review process by ensuring and documenting grantees receive a complete review at least once every three years and by coordinating the schedules of multiple oversight reviews in the same fiscal year . one strength of the triennial review program is that the process is well defined . in 1998 , we criticized fta for not making full use of its information system because its regional staff had not been uniformly updating the system and its headquarters staff was not enforcing its use as a management tool . specifically , headquarters officials explained that regional staff and contractors discuss the results of special oversight reviews conducted in the prior two years , such as any outstanding findings from the prior reviews , and reach consensus on the extent to which a grantee would be reviewed in the related area during the triennial review , ranging from an area not being reviewed at all to a more detailed review in the area , depending on the situation . further , fta is aware of the burden oversight reviews place on grantees and works to limit this burden . fta established two performance measures to assess timeliness of steps in the triennial review program: ( 1 ) 80 percent of triennial review findings are to be closed within 30 days of their due date ( “close findings timely” ) ; and ( 2 ) 95 percent of the final triennial review reports are to be issued within 30 days of the completion of the review ( “issue reports timely” ) . figure 6 compares fta's triennial review performance measures to these key attributes , showing that they meet some but not all attributes . limited overlap . objectivity . reliability . both triennial review performance measures do not meet the triennial review program's core program activity , evaluating whether grantees meet federal requirements over time . while fta's existing performance measure of close findings timely may increase adherence to federal requirements by encouraging grantees to address findings , it does not provide an overall program level assessment of grantees' performance over time . governmentwide priorities . quality . balance . although one of the goals of the triennial review program is to assist grantees in meeting more federal requirements over time , our analysis of otrak data shows many grantees with mixed success in reducing their numbers of findings over three triennial reviews from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 ; and 17 percent of the grantees we reviewed met fewer federal requirements in their latest triennial review than they did in their two previous reviews . to help ensure that a complete performance review and evaluation of each grantee is conducted at least once every three years , in accordance with the statutory requirement , revise the contractors' guide to remove the “not reviewed” category , require an updated evaluation of areas reviewed in the prior two years of the triennial review , and describe how contractors should document the triennial review reports with updates to other reviews , such as special oversight reviews conducted in the prior two years . 3 . 5 . to determine fta's performance measures for the triennial review and to what extent fta's performance measures meet nine key attributes , we obtained , reviewed , and analyzed , among other documents: gao reports describing the importance of establishing effective performance measures , gao guidance on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of federal agencies' performance measures and identifying the key attributes of successful performance measures , fta triennial review end - of - year reports , and fta performance appraisal templates . programs must have a drug and alcohol testing program in place for all safety - sensitive employees .
