the department of defense ( dod ) manages a portfolio of real property assets that reportedly included about 568,000 facilities with a combined plant replacement value of about $1 trillion and nearly 27.2 million acres of land in fiscal year 2016 . in may 2017 , the house armed services committee , subcommittee on readiness , requested that we evaluate the progress that the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) and the military services have made toward maintaining complete and accurate inventories of their real property assets and toward using real property inventory data to make sound decisions regarding defense support infrastructure management . for this report , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) rpad accurately and completely reflects dod's real property assets ; ( 2 ) dod has processes to help ensure the accuracy and completeness in recording and reporting real property data ; and ( 3 ) dod has addressed the risks that may affect use of real property information for managing its assets . we used rpad data to conduct tests related to accuracy among five data elements for facilities for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to identify the extent to which entries comply with dod's inventory requirements , such as entries that were missing , out of range , or overdue , and compared each year's results to identify changes in the magnitude of those discrepancies . asset review . the military services' real property efforts to prepare for financial audit have included developing manuals , monitoring activities such as testing of the implementation of real property procedures , and implementation of corrective actions to address identified deficiencies in the processes and procedures . dod's rpad has data quality issues specific to accuracy of certain data elements and completeness of the dataset , although certain data we reviewed improved since fiscal year 2014 . specifically , we found ( 1 ) the military services have not recorded all assets that existed and reflected previously disposed facilities that no longer existed as active in their respective data systems , ( 2 ) the military services did not report all assets in the rpad submission to osd that were recorded in each military service's data system , and ( 3 ) osd did not include all assets reported by the military services in rpad , as shown in figure 4 . osd also requires that the military services report their real property data for rpad following osd requirements and that they utilize osd's verification and validation tool to identify discrepancies between data entries and dod's real property information requirements . by osd not defining significant data elements and coordinating corrective action plans to remediate discrepancies , the military services may continue to submit information with discrepancies from year to year in some data elements and will miss an opportunity to improve the accuracy of inventory data . dod has not addressed three risks — unfilled real property positions to manage its data , lack of a department - wide approach to improving data quality , and a limited plan for the implementation of its expanded data platform — that diminish its ability to use real property information to manage its real property . however , in part , dod's weaknesses with quality information on real property and accessibility to this information continue to exist because dod has not developed a strategy that identifies and addresses risks , such as those previously described , and includes time frames and performance metrics . without a strategy for improving the quality of the data and information used to manage its real property , dod , congress , the office of management and budget , and the general services administration will not have information needed for effective decision making and do not have reasonable assurance that risks to data quality and information accessibility are being managed appropriately . dod partially concurred with our recommendation that the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment collaborate with the military services to develop a strategy that identifies and addresses risks to data quality and information accessibility ( recommendation 6 ) . defense infrastructure: dod needs to improve its efforts to identify unutilized and underutilized facilities , gao - 14-538 .
