thank you for the opportunity to discuss our prior work on weaknesses in the small business administration's ( sba ) oversight and monitoring of alaska native corporations ( anc ) subsidiary firms ( “anc - owned firms” ) that participate in the agency's 8 ( a ) program and the actions sba has taken to address these weaknesses . federal obligations under sba's 8 ( a ) business development program totaled about $10.9 billion in fiscal year 2019 . from 2006 through 2016 , gao issued three reports detailing the limitations of sba's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 ( a ) program . over the course of the program , qualified small , disadvantaged businesses can receive business development support from sba , such as mentoring , procurement assistance , business counseling , training , financial assistance , surety bonding , and other management and technical assistance . one of the key areas of support is eligibility for competitive and sole - source federal contracts that are set aside for 8 ( a ) businesses , which can be an important factor of the financial development for anc - owned firms . across three reports on sba's 8 ( a ) program , we have found persistent weaknesses in the oversight and monitoring of participating tribal firms , in particular anc - owned firms . specifically , we found that sba had ( 1 ) incomplete information and documentation on anc - owned firms' compliance with regulatory requirements ; ( 2 ) limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of tribal firms , including anc - owned firms ; ( 3 ) insufficient staffing in its alaska district office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) inadequate program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations . limitations in tracking and sharing key program data needed to enforce 8 ( a ) revenue rules: in all three reports mentioned in this testimony , we found that sba faced limitations in tracking information on the primary revenue generators for tribal firms , including anc - owned firms , to ensure that multiple firms under one parent anc are not generating their revenue in the same primary line of business — that is , expressed as and operating under the same north american industry classification system ( naics ) code — which sba's regulation intends to limit . to address the weaknesses described above , as well as others related to oversight and monitoring , our 2006 , 2012 , and 2016 reports contained a total of 21 recommendations to sba . while sba has fully implemented 15 of these recommendations , sba has not implemented six recommendations — three of which we highlight in this statement . in response to our recommendations , sba's actions included providing training to its staff that emphasized regulations governing the requirement for procuring agencies to specifically state whether a contract is a follow - on contract in their offer letters , which could help reduce the award of a follow - on , sole - source contracts to sister anc - owned firms ; developing and enacting a regulation that gives sba the authority , under certain circumstances , to change an anc - owned firm's primary line of business ( expressed as a naics code ) to the naics code that generates the greatest portion of the firm's revenue ; this action is intended to help sba enforce rules preventing sister anc - owned firms from operating in the same primary lines of business ; and updating and providing written guidance to field staff officials on the enforcement of follow - on sole - source contract regulations . however , to date sba has not provided us with evidence that it has implemented the three following recommendations , which if implemented as intended , could significantly improve its oversight of the 8 ( a ) program . absent action on these recommendations , sba exposes the program to continued noncompliance . sba agreed to implement this 2016 recommendation . sba's estimated completion date for the evaluation and implementation of this tool was december 31 , 2018 , but as of october 2019 , sba has not been able to provide documentation on whether this action has been implemented . small businesses potentially losing contracts to 8 ( a ) anc - owned firms: in our 2006 report , we found sba's oversight had fallen short in that it did not consistently determine whether other small businesses were losing contracting opportunities when large , sole - source contracts were awarded to anc - owned firms . instead , sba reported to us that in 2009 it performed a single analysis of a limited set of procurement data from a limited period and concluded the data did not indicate that other small 8 ( a ) firms ( e.g. , small businesses which are unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals , such black - owned and hispanic - owned firms ) were losing contracting opportunities to anc - owned firms .
