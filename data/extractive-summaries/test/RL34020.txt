among the creative works that u.s. copyright law protects are sound recordings , which the copyright act defines as "works that result from the fixation of a series of musical , spoken , or other sounds. . some transmissions of sound recordings are exempt from the public performance right , for example , a nonsubscription broadcast transmission ; a retransmission of a radio station's broadcast within 150 miles of its transmitter ; and a transmission to a business establishment for use in the ordinary course of its business . a licensee under § 114 may also qualify for a statutory license under 17 u.s.c . enactment of the copyright royalty and distribution reform act of 2004 , p.l . rates established pursuant to the original ratemaking determination and swsa were to remain in effect through 2005 . the general process for statutory license ratemaking factors in a three - month period , during which interested parties are encouraged to negotiate a settlement agreement . rates are as follows: for commercial webcasters: $.0008 per performance for 2006 , $.0011 per performance for 2007 , $.0014 per performance for 2008 , $.0018 per performance for 2009 , and $.0019 per performance for 2010 . commercial and noncommercial webcasters will pay an annual , nonrefundable minimum fee of $500 for each calendar year or part thereof . however , in making their proposal , this group of five webcasters clearly is unconcerned with the actual structure of the fee , except to the extent that a revenue - based fee structure — especially one in which the percent of revenue fee is a single digit number ( i.e. , 5% ) — can protect them against the possibility that their costs would ever exceed their revenues.... small commercial webcasters' focus on the amount of the fee , rather than how it should be structured , is further underlined by the absence of evidence submitted by this group to identify a basis for applying a pure revenue - based structure to them . some members of congress voiced concern as well . what follows below are descriptions of the responses to the crb decision in different settings: the negotiating table , the federal courts , and the congress . although the past two years have been consumed with the reactions to the copyright royalty board's may 2007 decision , time marches on , and the crb announced on january 5 , 2009 , that it would begin the third proceeding ( "webcaster iii" ) to determine the royalty rates for the statutory license covering internet transmissions of sound recordings , applicable to the next royalty period that runs from january 1 , 2011 , through december 31 , 2015 . any webcaster that chooses not to opt - in to one of the settlement agreements described above may participate in this proceeding and would be bound by the rates and terms that the crb shall determine .
