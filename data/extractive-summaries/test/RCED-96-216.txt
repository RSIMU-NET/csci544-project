doe conducts three types of stockpile surveillance tests — flight tests , nonnuclear systems laboratory tests , and nuclear and nonnuclear component tests — on nine types of nuclear weapons . doe is currently behind schedule in conducting some flight tests , nonnuclear systems laboratory tests , and nuclear and nonnuclear components laboratory tests . these schedule slippages are the result of a variety of factors , including an unapproved safety study , suspension of testing at some facilities , and the transfer of testing functions to new facilities . according to doe officials , in november 1992 , doe reduced its plan for testing air force intercontinental ballistic missiles from three tests per year to two — or eight tests over a 4-year period . the w88 is a warhead used by the navy on the trident ii missile . according to doe officials , the department ideally tests one pit per year per weapon type . doe has taken actions to increase the number of stockpile surveillance tests but has not prepared detailed plans for returning the stockpile surveillance program to its schedule . depending on the nature of the problem at the original facility , the length and nature of the outage , and the specific weapon ( s ) involved , doe would determine the best course of action . we recommend that the secretary of energy direct that the assistant secretary for defense programs develop detailed , written plans to restore stockpile surveillance tests to the contingency plans for testing facilities to provide for continued testing operations in the event that a testing facility is shut down for an extended period of time .
