despite the improvement , the deficit still remains above its historical average . because this table is based on the cbo baseline , policies that maintain current policy but change current law , such as extending expiring tax provisions , are classified as legislative changes . payroll taxes were temporarily reduced by two percentage points from 2011 to 2012 . budget authority for oco has fallen from a peak of $187 billion in 2008 to $93 billion in 2013 as overseas operations , primarily in iraq and afghanistan , have been scaled back . in 2013 and 2014 , legislative changes reduced total discretionary spending relative to cbo's september 2008 projection , but the resulting deficit reduction was more than offset by legislative changes to mandatory spending and revenues that increased the deficit . overall , the effect of legislative changes on the deficit was more than twice as large as economic and technical changes combined from 2009 to 2014 , and would have been larger if assistance to the gses was classified as a legislative change . under a long - term projection of current policy , cbo projects deficits would exceed 10% of gdp by 2073 . in other words , were a recession to occur in the next 10 years , it would likely increase cumulative budget deficits over the course of the budget window by more than the baseline projection of steady growth , even after accounting for higher than projected growth in expansion years . this would avoid deficit reduction during a recession that added contractionary pressures on the economy . because deficits are projected to continue to grow in the long run , growing reductions in spending or increases in taxes would be required over time to maintain sustainability . cbo projects that spending would need to be cut or revenues increased by 1.8% of gdp immediately and permanently to stabilize the debt - to - gdp ratio over the next 75 years , or 7.4% of gdp under the alternative fiscal scenario . although economic theory suggests that larger deficits provided a stimulative boost to the economy during the recent recession by partially offsetting the contraction of private spending , continued deficits would be expected to eventually have a negative effect on the economy . despite the significant decline in the budget deficit since 2012 , crowding out and higher interest rates will likely become a more pressing issue as the economy returns to full employment because of the anticipated increase in business investment back to historically normal levels , particularly if the increase in private saving following the recession proves not to be permanent . the projected increase in net interest is due to the growth in the federal debt and the return to more normal interest rates from the current below - average rates . discretionary spending has fallen from 12.3% of gdp in 1962 to a projected 6.8% of gdp in 2014 . the baseline , based on current law , assumes that discretionary spending will adhere to the levels set in the budget control act ( bca ) through 2021 and discretionary spending not subject to the caps ( notably , oco ) will rise at the rate of inflation . in part , the link between entitlement spending and deficits is driven by the assumptions that go into these projections — other spending is assumed to gradually fall relative to gdp in the long run , revenues are projected to gradually rise relative to gdp because of bracket creep , while health spending per capita is projected to continue to grow faster than gdp per capita . for health programs , it is less straightforward , and there is a lack of consensus on how excess cost growth , which has persisted for decades , can be effectively minimized . in 2009 and 2010 , revenues were at historically low shares of gdp across all major categories — individual income taxes were at their lowest share of gdp since 1950 , corporate income taxes were at their lowest share of gdp since the 1930s , social insurance receipts were at their lowest share of gdp since the 1970s , and excise taxes were at their lowest share of gdp since 1934 , the first year for which data are available .
