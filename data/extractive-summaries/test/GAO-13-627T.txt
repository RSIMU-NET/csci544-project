in response , the office of management and budget's ( omb ) federal chief information officer ( cio ) launched the federal data center consolidation initiative ( fdcci ) in 2010 . for example , in july 2012 , we reported on the progress the 24 participating federal departments and agenciesmaking on this initiative and found that , while progress had been made , nearly all of the agencies had not yet completed a data center inventory or the consolidation plans needed to implement their consolidation initiatives . were you asked us to testify on our report being released today that evaluated agencies' reported progress against omb's planned consolidation and cost savings goals and assessed the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by omb for fdcci are adequately performing oversight of agencies' efforts to meet these goals . in addition , omb identified two additional organizations to assist in managing and overseeing fdcci: the gsa fdcci program management office is to support omb in the planning , execution , management , and communications for fdcci . launched by omb in march 2012 , portfoliostat requires agencies to conduct an annual agency - wide it portfolio review to , among other things , reduce commodity it spending , demonstrate how its it investments align with the agency's mission and business functions , and make decisions on eliminating duplication . specifically , agencies are no longer required to submit the data center consolidation plans previously required under fdcci . the remaining 21 agency submissions had weaknesses in several areas . omb generally agreed with our recommendations and has since taken steps to address them . have documented the need for initiatives the 24 agencies have collectively made progress towards omb's data center consolidation goal to close 40 percent , or approximately 1,253 of the 3,133 data centers , by the end of 2015 . to track their progress , omb requires agencies to report quarterly on their completed and planned performance against that goal via an online portal . however , omb has not measured agencies' progress against the cost savings goal of $3 billion by the end of 2015 . specifically , in july 2012 , we reported that most agencies had not reported their expected cost savings in their 2011 consolidation plans . officials from several agencies reported that this information was still being developed . in addition , omb launched a publically available electronic dashboard to track and report on agencies' consolidation progress . in an october 2010 memorandum , omb stated that its approval of agencies' consolidation plans was in progress and would be completed by december 2010 . omb has not reported on agencies' progress against its key performance goal of achieving $3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015 . improved oversight could better position omb to assess progress against its cost savings goal and minimize agencies' risk of not realizing anticipated cost savings . specifically , we are recommending that the director of omb direct the federal cio to track and annually report on key data center consolidation performance measures , such as the size of data centers being closed and cost savings to date ; extend the time frame for achieving cost savings related to data center consolidation beyond the current 2015 horizon , to allow time to meet the initiative's planned cost savings goal ; and establish a mechanism to ensure that the established responsibilities of designated data center consolidation oversight organizations are fully executed , including responsibility for the documentation and oversight of the peer review process , the review of agencies' updated consolidation inventories and plans , and approval of updated consolidation plans . further , omb's march 2013 memorandum does not address whether the task force and gsa's program management office will continue their oversight roles , which does not help to mitigate this risk .
