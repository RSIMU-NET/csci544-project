zika — a virus primarily transmitted through mosquito bites — can cause symptoms that include fever , rash , conjunctivitis ( red eyes ) , and joint and muscle pain , though many infected individuals do not have symptoms or will only experience mild symptoms . in response to the outbreak , congress appropriated $932 million in september 2016 through the zika response and preparedness act to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and its agencies for activities such as responding to the zika virus , developing vaccines , and reimbursement for health care costs related to the zika virus . the agencies had until september 30 , 2017 , to obligate the funding , for example , by awarding a contract or a grant to an entity ( awardee ) . in this report , we describe 1. the status of obligations and disbursements of zika supplemental funding by hhs agencies ; and 2. how selected awardees used their zika supplemental funding , and their experiences with applying for and managing the funding . we interviewed officials from each agency to discuss the status of the agencies' obligations and disbursements of the zika supplemental funding , the different mechanisms used to award the funding , and the various factors that influenced the obligation and disbursement of the funding to awardees . from those 45 states , we judgmentally selected 10 states — 5 states with the highest funding and 5 states with the lowest funding — which included the 2 states that experienced local zika virus transmissions ( florida and texas ) . to describe how selected awardees used their zika supplemental funding and gain their perspectives on applying for and managing this funding , we reviewed documentation from the 12 selected awardees to identify the activities they funded . we also interviewed officials from the selected awardees ( state officials and officials from one county and one city ) about their experiences with using the zika supplemental funding and to obtain examples of awardees' zika activities . hhs reports that almost all of this funding ( $354 million ) was distributed to three hhs agencies , as follows: cdc received $222 million for various activities including field staff , state response teams , zika virus testing , tracking of pregnant women who were infected with the zika virus , and grants for mosquito control and other zika prevention activities ; barda received $85 million for private sector development of zika vaccines , treatments , and technologies to protect the blood supply , and other countermeasures ; and nih received $47 million for zika medical countermeasure development , including clinical trials on the leading zika vaccine candidate . we found that as of december 31 , 2017 , the hhs agencies had disbursed about 21 percent ( approximately $195.5 million of $932 million ) of the zika supplemental funding . local administrative processes for spending federal supplemental funds can result in varied disbursement time frames . collectively , the activities included four primary types: medical surveillance , vector control , laboratory capacity building , and providing health care services , as described below . awardees also funded other activities , such as outreach campaigns . while a majority of the 12 selected awardees we spoke with reported positive experiences with the process of applying for and managing the zika supplemental funding , some awardees cited aspects of the process that were challenging . in october 2017 , cdc issued a new notice of funding opportunity that , according to agency officials , was intended to help minimize the administrative burden on these awardees ( e.g. , preparing applications and other paperwork ) during significant public health emergencies by pre - approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to rapidly receive future awards . hhs provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
