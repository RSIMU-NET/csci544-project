in particular , evaluation and management ( e / m ) billing codes — codes used to bill for face - to - face patient visits that are provided in various settings such as physicians' offices or hospitals — are widely used by all physicians regardless of their specialty , accounting for over half of the $69.1 billion spent on all physician fee schedule services in 2017 . the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( 2018 bba ) defines longitudinal comprehensive care planning ( lccp ) as a service that includes the following five components: a conversation with a beneficiary diagnosed with a serious or life - shared decision - making through an interdisciplinary team that includes a physician , registered nurse , and social worker ; development of a longitudinal comprehensive care plan ( care plan ) that is discussed with the beneficiary that addresses the progression of the disease and treatment options ; a care plan that addresses the beneficiary's goals , values , and a care plan that discusses the availability of other resources or social supports that may help mitigate the beneficiary's health risks . the 2018 bba included a provision that we examine medicare physician fee schedule billing codes established by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program — that may be used for care planning services provided to beneficiaries diagnosed with a serious or life - threatening illness or illnesses . 1. existing medicare physician fee schedule billing codes that providers may use to bill for lccp - type services ; 2. trends in medicare spending on lccp - type services from 2013 3. stakeholders' views on the need for a new billing code representing the lccp service as defined in the 2018 bba . to examine existing medicare physician fee schedule billing codes that providers may use to bill for lccp - type services , we reviewed relevant information from cms and the american medical association ( ama ) and interviewed key stakeholders . to determine trends in medicare spending on lccp - type services , we analyzed medicare part b claims data from 2013 through 2017 for the specific billing codes we identified as covering lccp - type services . unlike broadly - defined codes , these narrowly - defined codes can only be used for lccp - type services . the vast majority of this spending — about $28.3 billion in 2017 — was on services represented by the 45 broadly - defined codes we identified earlier ( henceforth we refer to these services as “broadly - defined services.” ) by comparison , medicare spending on lccp - type services represented by the 13 narrowly - defined codes ( henceforth referred to as “narrowly - defined services” ) was about $467 million in 2017 . the growth in spending on narrowly - defined services was driven by increased utilization — that can be attributed in part to the development of new codes for these services — rather than increases in medicare fees for these services . the number of beneficiaries receiving narrowly - defined lccp - type services increased substantially from 2013 to 2017 , as more of these medicare billing codes were added and began to be utilized during this time . in 2017 , a total of about 100,000 providers billed for narrowly - defined services , representing a 227 percent increase from about 31,000 providers in 2013 . 5. ) . hhs provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
