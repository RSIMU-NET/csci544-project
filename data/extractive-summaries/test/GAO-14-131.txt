pweda , as amended , authorizes eda to provide financial assistance through grants to rural and urban communities experiencing substantial and persistent economic distress . house report 112-463 included a requirement that gao review grants eda made under the public works and eaa programs . eda's two largest grant assistance programs are public works and eaa . eda has a history of inconsistently documenting the results of committee meetings in which proposed projects are recommended for funding . in december 2000 , the commerce office of inspector general ( oig ) reported that it found inconsistencies in how eda's regional offices documented the project review committee ( now referred to as the irc ) process and recommended that eda keep better documentation of actions by these committees . despite the new guidance and procedures , we found that eda regional offices did not consistently complete the required irc template in fiscal year 2012 . standards for internal control in the federal government requires that all transactions and other significant events be clearly documented and the documentation be readily available for examination . until eda ensures that its regional offices consistently and fully complete an irc record template for all proposed projects considered for funding , eda will not have adequate assurance that its funding decisions are consistent and transparent . based on our analysis of the economic distress characteristics of the counties where eda funded projects under its public works and eaa programs in fiscal years 2007 and 2011 , we found that counties where eda funded projects generally had lower per capita income and higher unemployment rates than national and state averages . furthermore , some projects that eda funded under the public works and eaa programs in fiscal years 2007 and 2011 had a special need , as defined by eda . in addition , we found that for fiscal years 2007 and 2011 , more than half of the projects eda funded were located in counties that were part of nonrural areas , or areas with an urban center of more than 50,000 people . according to the u.s. department of agriculture economic research service's rural - urban continuum codes , 52 percent of all eda grants awarded in fiscal year 2007 and 67 percent of those awarded in fiscal year 2011 funded projects in nonrural areas . as figure 9 shows , eda most often funded projects in two categories under its public works program: infrastructure ( projects that involve , among other things , constructing and repairing various modes of transportation ; constructing and repairing water , sewer , gas , and electrical systems ; and developing telecommunications and broadband infrastructure ) and commercial and industrial ( projects that involve the design , construction , demolition , or renovation of commercial buildings and industrial and business parks , including infrastructure to support the parks and financial support to existing businesses ) . while eda took steps in fiscal year 2012 to address long - standing issues with its documentation of irc decisions , we found inconsistencies in regional offices' use of the new template , including offices that did not include a discussion of the pros and cons associated with the projects being considered and one office that did not use the irc template to document any of the discussions we sampled from its fiscal year 2012 records . to increase transparency in the award selection process , the secretary of commerce should direct the deputy assistant secretary for economic development to develop and implement procedures to ensure that eda regional offices consistently complete the required investment review committee record template for each proposed project considered for funding . this report examines , for the economic development administration's ( eda ) public works and economic development ( public works ) and economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) programs , ( 1 ) the extent to which eda documented grant selection decisions ; ( 2 ) the indicators of economic distress for counties with eda - funded projects and how these funds have been distributed to rural and nonrural areas ; and ( 3 ) the types of projects that have been funded by these programs . these exclusions resulted in final counts of 135 public works projects and 116 eaa projects for the fiscal year 2007 per capita income analysis , 80 public works projects and 150 eaa projects for the fiscal year 2011 per capita analysis , 135 public works projects and 120 eaa projects for the fiscal year 2007 unemployment analysis , and 81 public works projects and 152 eaa projects for the fiscal year 2011 unemployment analysis .
