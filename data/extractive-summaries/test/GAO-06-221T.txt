i am pleased to have the opportunity to provide information on our recent review of the 2004 – 05 influenza vaccine shortage , with lessons to consider as the nation improves its ability to respond to an influenza pandemic ( a global influenza outbreak resulting from a major genetic change in the influenza virus ) . studies suggest that a pandemic's effects in the united states could be severe , and shortages of vaccine could occur . the nation's experience responding to the shortage of annual influenza vaccine for the 2004 – 05 influenza season — in which the nation faced an unexpected loss of nearly half its projected vaccine supply — offers insight into the some of the challenges that federal , state , and local entities will face if a pandemic occurs . in summary , a number of lessons emerged from federal , state , and local responses to the 2004 – 05 influenza vaccine shortage that carry implications for handling future vaccine shortages in either an annual influenza season or an influenza pandemic . first , limited contingency planning slows response . at the start of the 2004 – 05 influenza season , when the nation unexpectedly lost roughly half its projected influenza vaccine supply , the nation lacked a contingency plan specifically for a severe vaccine shortage . during the 2004 – 05 shortage , for example , federal purchases of vaccine licensed for use in other countries but not the united states were not completed in time to meet peak demand . some states' experience also highlighted the importance of mechanisms to transfer available vaccine quickly and easily from one state to another . third , effective response requires clear and consistent communication . consistency among federal , state , and local communications is critical for averting confusion . state and local health officials also emphasized the value of updated information when responding to changing circumstances , using diverse media to reach diverse audiences , and educating providers and the public about prevention alternatives . the absence of such a plan led to delays and uncertainty on the part of many state and local entities on how best to ensure access to vaccine during the shortage by individuals at high risk of severe complications and others in priority groups . for example , experiences during the 2004 – 05 influenza season led maine state officials to recognize the need to speed completion of their pandemic influenza preparedness plan . we have also urged hhs to complete its pandemic preparedness and response plan , which the department released in draft form in august 2004 . on november 2 , 2005 , hhs released its pandemic influenza plan . we did not , however , have an opportunity to review the plan before issuing this statement to determine whether the plan addresses these critical issues . a second lesson from the experience of the 2004 – 05 vaccine shortage that is relevant to future vaccine shortages in either an annual influenza season or a pandemic is the importance of streamlined mechanisms to make vaccine available in an expedited manner . as our work over the past 5 years has noted , it is important for federal , state , and local governments to develop and communicate plans regarding critical issues — such as how vaccine will be purchased and distributed , which population groups are likely to have priority for vaccination , and what communication strategies are most effective — before we face another shortage of annual influenza vaccine or , worse , an influenza pandemic . gao - 05-984 .
