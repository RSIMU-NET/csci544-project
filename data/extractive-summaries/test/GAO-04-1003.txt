we initiated this review in response to a mandate in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 . our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and ( 2 ) assess dod's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals . we also reviewed dod's rationale and supporting evidence for the legislative proposals , reviewed the legislative history of provisions affecting general and flag officers , and obtained information from the military services on the management of general and flag officers . congress did not enact these proposals . currently , commissioned officers generally must retire upon reaching age 62 . a proposal to eliminate a provision limiting the number of active officers who may serve above the pay grade of o - 7 to no more than 50 percent of the total number of general and flag officers in a service . at this promotion point , they averaged 26 years of active commissioned service . table 5 provides promotion data by service . although dod provided various rationales for its fiscal year 2005 legislative proposals and sponsored a study on issues related to general and flag officer management , dod did not provide evidence showing that the current legislative framework has hindered dod's management of general and flag officers or degraded the department's performance . in addition , the fiscal year 2005 legislative proposals ( 1 ) would reduce congressional oversight and provide broad latitude to the executive branch in managing general and flag officers , ( 2 ) could impede the upward flow of officers , and ( 3 ) would likely increase federal retirement outlays . finally , the executive branch has not made frequent use of existing legislative authority that provides some flexibility to extend the careers of general and flag officers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory limits . the career profile data we developed show that large numbers of general and flag officers are retiring several years before the statutory retirement limits on age and years of active commissioned service . efforts to extend general and flag officer careers , however , would have to account for factors other than the statutory limits that have a role in the timing of general and flag officer retirements â€” factors including personal considerations and a military culture that encourages senior leaders to step aside and make way for others to move up . this evaluation should include an assessment of ( 1 ) factors that contribute to the retirement of senior general and flag officers prior to the statutory retirement limits , ( 2 ) the need for changes in dod policy or procedure to make greater use of existing authority to extend general and flag officers careers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory retirement limits , and ( 3 ) the long - term cost implications of proposals to change retirement compensation . as our report states , many general and flag officers are retiring several years before reaching their statutory limits on age and years of commissioned service . for example , more than three - fourths of general and flag officers who retired in grades o - 9 and o - 10 between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 could have served 3 or more years before reaching the current statutory retirement limits .
