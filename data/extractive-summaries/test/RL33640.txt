during the cold war , the u.s. nuclear arsenal contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons , including short - range missiles and artillery for use on the battlefield , medium - range missiles and aircraft that could strike targets beyond the theater of battle , short - and medium - range systems based on surface ships , long - range missiles based on u.s. territory and submarines , and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states . the long - range missiles and heavy bombers are known as strategic nuclear delivery vehicles . under the terms of the 2002 strategic offensive reduction treaty ( known as the moscow treaty ) between the united states and russia , this number was to decline to no more than 2,200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads by the end of 2012 . and , even though the president pledged to reduce the roles and numbers of u.s. nuclear forces , the 2010 nuclear posture review noted that "the fundamental role of u.s. nuclear weapons , which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist , is to deter nuclear attack on the united states , our allies , and partners. . the report not only reaffirms the basic contours of the current u.s. force structure and the ongoing modernization programs , it also calls for the development of a new low - yield warhead for deployment on trident ii ( d - 5 ) missiles . this report reviews the ongoing programs that will affect the expected size and shape of the u.s. strategic nuclear force structure . the obama administration concluded , in its npr , that the united states could reduce its forces to 1,550 deployed warheads , and agreed to do so under the new start treaty , but it also planned to retain the capability to restore warheads to its deployed forces . moreover , the navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes a line for 5 additional heavy missile submarines , after the completion of the columbia class program , that might serve as replacements for the ohio - class cruise missile submarines . they also noted that this change need not reduce the number of operational warheads on slbms , because the united states would deploy each submarine with 24 missiles , rather than the 20 planned under new start , and could increase the number of warheads on each missile . however , with so few submarines , the united states might have to eliminate one of its submarine bases , leaving it with submarines based only in the atlantic or only in the pacific ocean . these changes may not be consistent with current submarine operations and employment plans . analysts outside government have also questioned the administration's plans to replace the air - launched cruise missile ( alcm ) with the new long - range strike missile ( lrso ) in the 2020s . the air force has disputed the assertion that the bomber and cruise missile capabilities are redundant . in response to both the growing concerns about the pending costs of nuclear weapons modernization programs and the confusion about how to calculate the annual costs of the nuclear enterprise , congress directed the congressional budget office ( cbo ) to estimate the costs of u.s. plans for operating , maintaining , and modernizing nuclear weapons , the delivery systems , and the doe nuclear weapons complex over the next 10 years . neither of these categories had been included in the administration's estimate in 2010 . this estimate is consistent with others that have been presented by organizations outside government .
