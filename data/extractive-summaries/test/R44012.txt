tax expenditures — revenue losses associated with targeted provisions outside the normal tax code — are a long - standing feature of the u.s. income tax code . in some ways , tax expenditures resemble direct spending . they both have similar budgetary effects and provide incentives that alter the allocation of resources . tax expenditures , like direct spending , are one of the ways that the federal government plays a role in shaping the economy . tax expenditures , however , do not regularly receive the same level of scrutiny as direct spending programs . also , unlike direct spending programs , the revenue loss associated with most tax expenditures is only limited by eligibility — much like mandatory spending programs . a consequence of the limited oversight placed on tax expenditures is that activities may be supported by tax expenditures that have insufficient political support for funding through a direct spending program . tax expenditures are a common target when base - broadening tax reform is pursued — like with the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-514 ) . this may be the result of tax expenditures being defined as being outside the normal tax code — making them a clear source for base broadening . section 3 ( 3 ) of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 ( budget act ) defines tax expenditures as … those revenue losses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion , exemption , or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit , a preferential rate of tax , or a deferral of tax liability . there are two main take - aways from table 1 . that is , corporate tax expenditures are roughly 15% of individual tax expenditures , while corporate tax revenue is 23% of individual tax revenue . overall , taxpayers in the top quintile claim 51% of the benefits of the tax expenditures included in the cbo analysis , with the remaining 49% going to taxpayers in the bottom four quintiles . the eitc , child tax credit , and the exclusions of social security and medicare benefits are examples of tax expenditures that target benefits to lower - income individuals and change the distribution of after - tax income . some tax expenditures are difficult to quantify , while others represent income that the taxpayer will not receive during a given tax year .
