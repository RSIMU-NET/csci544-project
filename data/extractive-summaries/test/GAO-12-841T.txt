thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on two satellite acquisition programs within the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) . the joint polar satellite system ( jpss ) and the geostationary operational environmental satellite - r ( goes - r ) programs are meant to replace current operational satellites , and both are considered critical to the united states' ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting . as requested , this statement summarizes our two reports being released today on ( 1 ) the status , plans , and risks for jpss and ( 2 ) the status , schedule management process , and risk management process within the goes - r program . as noted in those reports , we found that the jpss cost and goes - r contractor cost data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . further , while we found that the goes - r schedule and management reserve data were not sufficiently reliable , we reported on the data's shortcomings in our report .
