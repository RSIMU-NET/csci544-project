under a growing number of consumer and employment agreements , companies are requiring disputes to be resolved through arbitration , a method of dispute resolution involving a neutral , private third party , rather than a judicial proceeding . while arbitration is often viewed as a faster and less expensive alternative to litigation , consumer advocates and others maintain that mandatory arbitration agreements create one - sided arrangements that deny consumers and employees advantages afforded by a judicial proceeding , such as the availability of a jury trial . the federal arbitration act ( faa or the act ) was enacted in 1925 to ensure the validity and enforcement of arbitration agreements in any "maritime transaction or ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce[.] . the u.s. supreme court ( court ) has recognized the faa as evidencing "a national policy favoring arbitration. . the application of the faa , however , particularly in light of various state law requirements and the use of different types of arbitration agreements , has raised numerous legal questions and been the subject of several cases before the court . concern over a perceived lack of "meaningful choice" to decide whether to submit a claim to arbitration has also spurred recent federal regulatory action , as well as legislation that would amend the faa to render pre - dispute arbitration agreements unenforceable . this report examines the faa and reviews the court's decisions involving the statute's preemption of state law requirements . the report also explores the court's decisions involving mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit a consumer or employee from maintaining a class or collective action . in its october 2017 term , the court will consider three consolidated cases that challenge such agreements on the grounds that they violate the right to engage in "other concerted activities" under the national labor relations act ( nlra ) . in 2001 , the court confirmed that the faa also covers employment agreements that require arbitration to resolve work - related disputes . examples include the following: arbitration fairness act of 2017 ( h.r . 1374 / s. 537 ) . in an effort to curb the use of pre - dispute arbitration agreements , these bills would amend section 2 of the faa to provide that the act's requirements on the enforceability of arbitration agreements would not apply to specific claims brought by individuals or certain small businesses that arise from a violation of federal or state statutes , the u.s. constitution , or a state constitution , unless a written arbitration agreement is entered into by both parties after the claim has arisen and applies only to the existing claim .
