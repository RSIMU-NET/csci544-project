social security covers about 96 percent of all u.s. workers ; the vast majority of the remaining 4 percent who are not covered are public employees . although these noncovered workers do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings , they may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses' or their own earnings from other covered employment . to address concerns with how noncovered workers are treated compared with covered workers , social security has provisions in place to take noncovered employment into account when calculating social security benefits for public employees , but the provisions have been difficult to administer . alternatively , as part of social security reform , others have proposed extending mandatory coverage to all state and local government employees who are not currently covered ; under mandatory coverage , the need for these provisions would be phased out over time . today , i will discuss social security's coverage of public employees , social security's current provisions affecting noncovered public employees , and proposals to modify those provisions or make coverage mandatory for all public employees . in summary , about one - fourth of public employees are not covered by social security for various historical reasons . currently , social security has two provisions in place that attempt to ensure these workers' noncovered employment is taken into consideration when calculating their social security benefits: ( 1 ) the government pension offset ( gpo ) , which affects spouse and survivor benefits , and ( 2 ) the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) , which affects retired worker benefits . some proposals specifically address the gpo and the wep and would either revise or eliminate them . in 2005 , social security actuaries estimated that mandating coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees would reduce the 75-year actuarial deficit by about 11 percent . also , the provisions are a source of confusion and frustration for public employees and retirees . as long as the gpo and wep remain in effect , we continue to believe that the irs should be given the authority to collect the information that ssa needs on government pension income to administer these provisions accurately and fairly . critics of the measures contend that the provisions are basically inaccurate and often unfair . there is an element of unfairness in a situation where practically all contribute to social security , while a few benefit both directly and indirectly but are excused from contributing to the program.‚Äù another advantage of mandatory social security coverage is that it could improve benefits for the affected workers , but it could also increase pension costs for state and local governments . also , mandatory coverage would not immediately address the issues and concerns regarding the gpo and the wep , as these provisions would continue to apply to existing employees and beneficiaries for many years to come before eventually becoming obsolete . in conclusion , there are no easy answers to the difficulties of equalizing social security's treatment of covered and noncovered workers . as long as the gpo and the wep remain in effect , it will be important to administer the provisions as effectively and equitably as possible .
