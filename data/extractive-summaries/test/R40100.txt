as the debate on reducing greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) has progressed , increasing concern has been raised about how a u.s. reduction program would interact with programs in other countries . in a global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do not — i.e. , differentiated global carbon policies — the potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis - à - vis countries without comparable policies . the risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies , in the absence of similar policies among competing nations , have been central to debates on whether the united states should enact greenhouse gas legislation . specifically , concerns have been raised that if the united states adopts a carbon control policy , industries that must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passed - through by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share ( and jobs ) to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies . in addition , this potential shift in production could result in some of the u.s. carbon reductions being diluted by increased production in more carbon intensive countries ( commonly known as "carbon leakage" ) . each of these is discussed below . there are three basic approaches to assisting greenhouse - gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries: ( 1 ) assist domestic industry ; ( 2 ) penalize foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) develop alternative sectoral approaches . support for domestic industries , the approach most commonly included in legislative proposals , is not focused on this objective ; it is focused on preserving the industry's current competitive position and jobs and may , depending on the details , help transition that industry to the future . trade measures for foreign competitors , another approach commonly included in legislative proposals , may provide a stick for international negotiation , but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries from "unfair" competition while the country awaits an international agreement . finally , the sectoral approach represents a range of options focused on integrating developing countries' industrial bases into a mutually acceptable international framework that provides a level playing field for all participants . whether any of these approaches would have appreciable effects on carbon leakage is unclear . the design of an assistance program — the goals , eligible participants , implementation , and enforcement — would be difficult to define in a manner that satisfies all parties . there is every incentive for any industry facing a cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished , thereby justifying special consideration by the government . the government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers , sometimes without access to important but proprietary data .
