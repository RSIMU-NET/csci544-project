in that budget , the office of management and budget ( omb ) stated that , of approximately 1,200 major it projects , about half — 621 projects , representing about $22 billion — were on a ‘‘management watch list.'' this information was reiterated in testimony in march 2004 , during which omb officials stated that the list consisted of mission - critical projects that needed to improve performance measures , project management , and it security . this section provides policy for planning , budgeting , acquisition , and management of federal capital assets and instructs agencies on budget justification and reporting requirements for major it investments . each of about 12 analysts is responsible for overseeing it projects for a specific agency or ( more commonly ) several agencies . our objectives were to describe and assess omb's processes for ( 1 ) placing projects on its management watch list and ( 2 ) following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list . to examine omb's processes for developing the list , we requested a copy of the management watch list ; we reviewed related omb policy guidance , including its circular a - 11 and capital programming guide , as well as the analytical perspectives for the president's budget submissions for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 ; and we interviewed omb analysts and their managers , including the deputy administrator of oira and the chief of the information technology and policy branch , to identify the processes and criteria they have in place to determine which it projects to include on the management watch list . omb officials said that they did not aggregate these projects into a single list describing projects and their weaknesses . nevertheless , omb has not fully exploited the opportunity to use its management watch list as a tool for analyzing it investments on a governmentwide basis . omb officials also stated that those management watch list projects that did receive follow - up attention were not tracked centrally , but only by the individual omb analysts with responsibility for the specific agencies . accordingly , omb could not readily tell us which of the 621 watch list projects for fiscal year 2005 were followed up on , nor could it use the list to describe the relationship between its follow - up activities and the changes in the numbers of projects on the watch list between fiscal year 2005 ( 621 projects ) and fiscal year 2006 ( 342 ) . without tracking specific follow - up activities , omb could not know whether the risks that it identified through its management watch list were being managed effectively ; if they were not , funds were potentially being spent on poorly planned and managed projects . by scoring agency it budget submissions and identifying weaknesses that may indicate investments at risk , omb is identifying opportunities to strengthen investments . however , omb has not developed a single , aggregate list identifying the projects and their weaknesses , nor has it developed a structured , consistent process for deciding how to follow up on corrective actions . however , our review showed that omb did not develop a structured , consistent process or criteria for deciding how it should follow up on corrective actions that it asked agencies to take to address the weaknesses of the projects on the management watch list .
