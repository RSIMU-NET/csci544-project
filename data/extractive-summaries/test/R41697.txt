once binding on federal courts , the guidelines are now the starting point for federal sentencing in most cases . sentencing under the guidelines is essentially a score - keeping exercise , not unlike the procedure for filling out a federal income tax return . the sentencing ranges for any term of imprisonment depend both on the final offense level and upon the offender's criminal history score calculated on the basis of his past criminal record and divided into categories . having identified the applicable guideline range , the court , in the exercise of its sentencing discretion , considers it along with the other sentencing factors found in 18 u.s.c . in most instances , the guideline index notes the guideline offense section that corresponds to the offense of conviction . four of those set minimum offense levels when the offense also involves a serious injury ; the fifth refers to the drug quantity table which contains an array of 17 escalating offense levels based on the amount and type of drug involved . adjustments : the guidelines make adjustments for victim - related factors , the extent of the offender's participation ( role in the offense ) , obstruction , conviction for multiple offenses , and the offender's acceptance of responsibility . the guidelines devote five sections to matters related to the offender's role in the crime of conviction: ( 1 ) aggravating roles , ( 2 ) mitigating roles , ( 3 ) abuse of a position of trust or use of special skill , ( 4 ) use of a minor , and ( 5 ) use of body armor in a drug trafficking offense or a crime of violence . chapter 8 of the guidelines establishes a separate , related but distinct , sentencing regime for organizations . 3553 ( a ) to determine the appropriate sentence .
