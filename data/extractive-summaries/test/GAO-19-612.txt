in certain circumstances when needed health care services are not available at federally operated or tribally operated facilities , care may be obtained from private providers and paid for through ihs's purchased / referred care ( prc ) program . you asked us to review how ppaca has affected ai / an access to health care . in this report we describe , for fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , 1. trends in health insurance coverage among ai / an populations served by federally operated and tribally operated facilities as well as trends in third - party collections at these facilities , and 2. the effects of any changes in health insurance coverage and third - party collections on federally operated and tribally operated facilities . we also analyzed ihs data on the amount and source of third - party collections at all ihs facilities — including hospitals , health centers , health clinics or other types of facilities — that were federally operated throughout this period . for information and context on trends in coverage and collection at federally operated and tribally operated facilities , we interviewed officials from ihs headquarters and all 12 area offices , as well as those from 17 facilities , which we selected to include a mix of federally operated and tribally operated facilities , including hospitals and health centers ranging in size and location and those operating in states that had expanded their medicaid programs as of september 2018 as well as those that had not . our analysis of ihs data shows that from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018 , the percent of patients at 73 federally operated ihs hospitals and health centers who reported having health insurance coverage increased an average of 14 percentage points , from 64 percent in fiscal year 2013 to 78 percent in fiscal year 2018 . the largest increase in coverage occurred among those reporting medicaid coverage . ihs officials we interviewed noted several reasons why third - party collections may vary over time and by location , including the size of the facility and any changes in the number of providers , patients , or business office staff that process billing and collections ; the ability to collect payment from certain tribal health insurance , which may opt to not pay for services provided to enrolled members ; and the number of patients enrolled in medicaid managed care plans , which may identify ihs facilities as out - of - network providers and not pay for covered services . officials we interviewed from selected federally operated and tribally operated facilities stated that increases in coverage and third - party collections helped them to ( 1 ) continue their facilities' operations , ( 2 ) expand the services they offer onsite at their facilities , and ( 3 ) expand the services they cover offsite through ihs's prc program . 6. ) . for example , according to ihs officials , one federally operated ihs facility reported using $7 million in third - party collections to fund an over 11,000 square foot expansion to house an expanded emergency room and a new urgent care clinic ; two federally operated ihs facilities reported using third - party collections to purchase modular buildings to provide medical services such as audiology , behavioral health , and dental services ; and one federally operated ihs facility reported saving third - party collections for six years to fund the construction of a new 23,000 square foot building to provide additional space for an increased volume of services , including dental , optometry and physical therapy services , and to pay for the new medical equipment to support these services ( see fig . for example , officials at some federally operated ihs facilities reported that having more providers onsite has allowed them to offer patients more rapid access to care , and officials from some tribally operated facilities reported that an expansion of onsite services has allowed them to serve more patients . the department did not have any comments on the draft report . in the years since the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) authorized states to expand access to medicaid and offer health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , the percent of american indian and alaska native ( ai / an ) in the general population with health insurance has increased . gao - 17-317 . indian health service: most american indians and alaska natives potentially eligible for expanded health coverage , but action needed to increase enrollment . indian health service: health care services are not always available to native americans .
