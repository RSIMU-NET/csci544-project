in addition , projected funding levels from the administration are about $2 billion less than faa had planned to spend for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 . in light of past problems with and continuing concerns about funding major atc system acquisitions under the atc modernization program , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) faa's experience in meeting cost , schedule , and / or performance targets for major system acquisitions under its atc modernization program ; ( 2 ) the steps faa has taken to address long - standing challenges with the atc modernization program and additional steps that are needed ; and ( 3 ) the potential effects of the constrained budget environment on faa's ability to modernize the atc system . to fulfill its mission , faa must rely on an extensive use of technology , including many software - intensive systems . for more than two decades , faa has experienced cost growth , schedule extensions , and / or performance problems in acquiring major systems under its atc modernization program and has been on our list of high - risk programs since 1995 . these major system acquisitions had total cost growth ranging from $1.1 million to about $1.5 billion over their original cost targets . furthermore , several systems experienced safety - related performance problems . the ato's chief operating officer testified in april 2005 that receiving multiyear rather than annual funding from congress for system acquisitions would help faa to address this problem by providing funding stability for system acquisitions .  ( 2 ) the system acquisition experienced requirements growth and / or unplanned work . it also set and met its annual cost performance goals for each of these 41 system acquisitions . consequently , they do not provide a consistent benchmark for assessing progress over time . moreover , as indicators of annual progress , they cannot be used in isolation to measure progress in meeting cost and schedule targets over the life of an acquisition . the ato is currently reviewing all of its capital projects to reassess priorities . however , additional steps are needed in these areas . however , ato did not mandate the use of the process improvement model for all software - intensive acquisition projects . for example , while ams provides some discipline for acquiring major atc systems , it does not use a knowledge - based approach to acquisitions , characteristic of best commercial and dod practices . ato business practices: to improve its investment management decision - making and oversight of major atc acquisitions , the ato has informed us that it has initiated the following steps , which we have reported are important to effective oversight: integrated ams and omb's capital planning and investment control process to develop a process for analyzing , tracking , and evaluating the risks and results of all major capital investments made by faa ; conducted executive council reviews of project breaches of 5 percent in cost , schedule , and / or performance to better manage cost growth ; issued monthly variance reports to upper management to keep them apprised of cost and schedule trends ; and increased the use of cost monitoring or earned value management systems to improve oversight of programs . to fund its major system acquisitions while remaining within the administration's budget targets , the ato has eliminated planned funding to start new projects and substantially reduced planned funding for other areas . to help ensure that key administration and congressional decision - makers have more complete information to assess the potential impact of annual budget submissions on individual atc system acquisitions , the overall atc modernization program , and related larger - scale nas modernization activities funded through the facilities and equipment budget , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct faa to identify which activities under the atc modernization program have had funding deferred , reduced , or eliminated and to provide detailed information about the impact of those decisions on faa's ability to modernize the atc system and related components of the nas in the near , mid , and longer term . this information should be reported to congress annually . we selected these 16 systems in july 2004 , when this review was still a part of our broader work on faa's efforts to modernize the national airspace system ( nas ) .specifically , we selected the 16 atc system acquisitions with the largest life - cycle costs that met the following criteria: each system had cost , schedule , and / or performance targets , was discussed in our prior and department of transportation inspector general reports , had not been fully implemented or deployed by 2004 , and received funding in 2004 . we also interviewed officials with other organizations cited above .
