various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country . in recent years , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , which controls lake sakakawea and five other mainstem missouri river reservoirs , has identified surplus water in these reservoirs and considered how it would contract with industrial and municipal users interested in the temporary use of this water . using lake sakakawea as an example , this report analyzes the legal authority of the corps to charge for stored surplus water . it also analyzes state authority over water within state boundaries and discusses the relationship between federal and state authority , including examples of congressional actions that have addressed competing federal and state roles regarding water resources . in 1899 , the court explained that the states' control of the appropriation of their waters was subject to "the superior power of the general government to secure the uninterrupted navigability of the all navigable streams within the limits of the united states. . the court has indicated that the constitutional "authority is as broad as the needs of commerce. . in addition to the corps' general constitutional authority , congress has provided statutory authority for specific actions by the corps related to m&i water supplied at its projects . states in the missouri river basin have objected to the corps' plan to charge a fee for surplus water stored at its reservoirs . states have argued that maintaining surplus water supply in the federal reservoir and charging citizens for the right to access that water which otherwise would be available through natural flow of the river violates their legal right to state waters . north dakota , in which lake sakakawea is located , has asserted ownership of the waters flowing within the state boundaries , claiming that charging for access to that water while it is stored in a corps' project violates that legal right . on one hand , the corps' constitutional authority to manage its projects for a variety of authorized purposes is broad ; it has been delegated authority from congress to store water for m&i purposes ; and it has been authorized to charge for surplus water stored at the project . likewise , it may be argued that , although congress provided statutory authorizations to the corps related to storage and sale of water stored in a corps' project , it also indicated a certain degree of deference to state uses of the water , particularly in western states like north dakota , when exercising that authority .
