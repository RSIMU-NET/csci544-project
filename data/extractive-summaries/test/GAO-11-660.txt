the washington metropolitan area transit authority's ( wmata ) public rail transit and bus systems are vital to meeting the transportation needs of the national capital region , accounting for nearly 1.2 million passenger trips per weekday . in 2010 , two reports concluded that weaknesses in wmata's governance contributed to the safety and operational reliability challenges facing the transit system and recommended changes to wmata's governance structure . to determine how wmata's practices align with these leading governance practices , we reviewed and compared elements of the composition and structure of the wmata board and senior management , communication between the board and management , policies and other documentation in place to guide wmata's practices , and wmata's internal and external oversight practices to the leading governance and strategic planning practices that we identified . wmata board members , officials , and other stakeholders have reported that the board sometimes focuses on management's day - to - day responsibilities rather than higher level board responsibilities such as policy , oversight , and strategic planning . this lack of strategic focus may have resulted from inadequate delineation and documentation of the board's responsibilities , as well as inadequate communication among board members . governance practices based on previous gao work and other relevant studies state that an effective transit board: focuses on policy making , principally specific elements such as guidance and strategic issues as well as oversight and monitoring of management and performance ; clearly defines and formally documents its roles and responsibilities and has a clear view of its role in relationship to that of management . in addition , board procedures further delineate that the board “determines agency policy and provides oversight for the funding , operation and expansion of safe , reliable , and effective transit service within the transit zone.” although the compact and board procedures provide some guidance , there is a perception among wmata officials , some board members , and other stakeholders that the described roles and responsibilities are too broad and not clearly defined . additionally , wmata's board does not conduct a self - assessment . however , past board practices such as infrequent meetings of the audit and investigations subcommittee and the lack of routine briefings on the status of recommendations from outside parties may have impaired the ability of the board to use this information to effectively carry out its oversight role . for example , one of the board's key governance areas is its responsibility to annually adopt a capital budget for the agency . however , given the variety in other transit agencies' practices and the lack of clear criteria on how often audit committees should meet , there is no clear standard against which to measure wmata's practices . wmata has implemented this recommendation . the board's other committees have additional oversight responsibilities . wmata has developed elements of strategic planning over the past 4 years , but the agency's board and management could improve their strategic focus and long - term planning processes . according to the literature , the process for strategic planning should also include assessing the organization's external and internal environments , conducting a stakeholder analysis and involving the board and key stakeholders in the strategic planning process , identifying key strategic issues facing the organization , developing a process for implementing and managing these issues , and reassessing the strategic planning process . wmata officials acknowledged several failed efforts at strategic planning , which they said occurred because of a lack of management support and employee buy - in , a lack of specific actions to execute the plans , and a focus on tactical versus strategic decision making . in commenting on a draft of this report , wmata noted that in june 2011 it launched a new strategic planning initiative that will include input from external stakeholders . although wmata board members and officials indicated that the office is a good start to improving the performance management of the agency , some of wmata's performance metrics and targets are out of date and the board has not been fully involved in assessing the metrics and their criteria . improve the agency's strategic planning process by ( 1 ) defining and documenting roles for the board , management , and stakeholders in strategic planning ; ( 2 ) ensuring that the strategic plan is sufficiently long term ; ( 3 ) ensuring that board - approved strategic goals and objectives are linked to updated performance measures ; ( 4 ) including internal and external assessments and program evaluations ; and ( 5 ) reviewing the strategic plan on a regular basis and updating it as needed . however , wmata felt the report could be strengthened by additional information on wmata's recent actions .
