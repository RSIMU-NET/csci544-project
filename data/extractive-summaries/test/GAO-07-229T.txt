in addition , dod shares responsibility for six governmentwide high - risk areas . dod's business area weaknesses result in reduced efficiencies , ineffective performance , and inadequate accountability to congress and the american people , wasting billions of dollars each year at a time when dod is competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment . specifically , i will discuss dod's efforts to ( 1 ) develop a comprehensive , integrated , enterprisewide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach and ( 2 ) comply with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability . the nature and severity of dod's financial management business operations and system deficiencies not only affect financial reporting , but also impede the ability of dod managers to receive the full range of information needed to effectively manage day - to - day operations . however , i cannot emphasize enough how critical to the success of these efforts are top management attention and structures that focus on transformation from a broad perspective and a clear , comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide plan that , at a summary level , addresses all of the department's major business operations . this plan should cover all of dod's key business functions ; contain results - oriented goals , measures , and expectations that link institutional , unit , and individual performance goals and expectations to promote accountability ; identify people with needed skills , knowledge , experience , responsibility , and authority to implement the plan ; and establish an effective process and related tools for implementation and oversight . while dod has developed plans that address aspects of business transformation at different organizational levels , these plans have not been clearly aligned into a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide approach to business transformation . the department has made important progress in complying with legislation pertaining to its financial management improvement and business systems modernization efforts . however , formidable challenges remain relative to extending the architecture and implementing its tiered accountability investment approach across the military services and defense agencies , and ensuring that the department's thousands of business system investments are implemented on time and within budget and provide promised capabilities and benefits . more recently , dod issued version 4.0 of its business enterprise architecture and etp . at the same time , dod components continue to invest billions of dollars in new and existing business systems each year . further , it does not include dod component architectures ( e.g. , services and various dod agencies ) as distinct yet coherent members of a federated dod business enterprise architecture . clearly , much remains to be accomplished to implement the federated strategy and create dod's federated business enterprise architecture . a major reason the department has thousands of business systems is that it has historically failed to consistently employ the range of effective institutional investment management controls , such as an architecture - centric approach to investment decision making , that our work and research show are keys to successful system modernization programs . the weaknesses that we have found raise questions as to the extent to which the structures , processes , and controls that dod has established in response to the fiscal year 2005 national defense authorization act are actually being implemented , and illustrate the range of system acquisition and investment management controls ( beyond those provided for in the act ) that need to be effectively implemented in order for a given investment to be successfully acquired and deployed . specifically , section 321 of the act limits dod's ability to obligate or expend any funds for the purpose of any financial management improvement activity relating to the preparation , processing , or auditing of financial statements until it has submitted to the congressional defense committees a written determination that each activity proposed to be funded is ( 1 ) consistent with the dod financial management improvement plan required by section 376 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 and ( 2 ) is likely to improve internal controls or otherwise result in sustained improvements in the ability of the department to produce timely , reliable , and complete financial management information . however , this is not happening within dod . in fact , all of these areas — along with weapon systems acquisition — are on our high - risk list of major government programs and operations . in addition , we are continuing to review the performance measures dod is using to track the plan's progress in resolving supply chain problems and dod's efforts to develop a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide strategy to guide logistics programs and initiatives .
