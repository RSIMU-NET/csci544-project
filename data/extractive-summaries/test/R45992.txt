article i , section 9 , clause 8 provides that "no person holding any office of profit or trust under [the united states] , shall , without the consent of congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state" ; 2 . more specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) the history and purpose of the clauses ; ( 2 ) whether the president is a person holding an "office of profit or trust under [the united states]" for purposes of the foreign emoluments clause ; ( 3 ) the scope of the emoluments clauses , focusing specifically on disputes over the breadth of the term "emolument" ; and ( 4 ) how the clauses may be enforced . an important threshold issue in examining the emoluments clauses is determining who is subject to their terms . the scope of the domestic emoluments clause is clear: it applies to "[t]he president. . there has been significant academic debate about whether olc's conclusion comports with the original public meaning of the foreign emoluments clause . some legal scholars have argued that the foreign emoluments clause does not apply to elected officials such as the president , but only to certain appointed federal officers . to support the view that the foreign emoluments clause does not apply to the president , academics have observed that , among other things , ( 1 ) a 1792 list produced by alexander hamilton of "every person holding any civil office or employment under the united states" did not include elected officials such as the president and vice president ; ( 2 ) â george washington accepted gifts from the marquis de lafayette and the french ambassador while president without seeking congressional approval ; and ( 3 ) â thomas jefferson similarly received and accepted diplomatic gifts from indian tribes and foreign nations , such as a bust of czar alexander i from the russian government , without seeking congressional approval . a key disputed issue regarding the scope of the emoluments clauses is what constitutes an "emolument. . this question has divided legal scholars and has only recently been addressed by any federal courts . some scholars argue that this employment - or office - centric definition of the term is the definition encompassed by the emoluments clauses , meaning that the clauses prohibit covered officials from receiving compensation "for the personal performance of services" as an officer or employee but do not bar "ordinary business transactions" between a covered official and government . these opinions have at times appeared to adopt a fact - specific , functional view of the clauses , focusing on the purpose and potential effect of the specific payments or benefits at issue as they relate to the clauses' goals of limiting influence on the president and federal officers . the limitation includes a constitutional component stemming from article iii of the u.s. constitution , which limits the exercise of federal judicial power to "cases" or "controversies. . each set of plaintiffs implicate distinct legal issues and precedents related to standing . with respect to private - party competitor plaintiffs , the district court in the sdny litigation concluded that several such plaintiffs lacked standing because it was "wholly speculative" that any loss of business or increase in competition could be traced to alleged violations of the emoluments clauses rather than "government officials' independent desire to patronize [the] businesses" allegedly involved in those violations based on factors such as service and location . but the second circuit recently reversed the district court's ruling regarding the competitor plaintiffs , concluding that "a plaintiff - competitor who alleges a competitive injury caused by a defendant's unlawful conduct that skewed the market in another competitor's favor [has standing] notwithstanding other possible , or even likely , causes for the benefit going to the plaintiff's competition. . finally , as to members of congress , the district court in the congressional litigation determined in 2018 that over 200 members had standing to sue under the foreign emoluments clause based on the deprivation of their "opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote on whether to consent prior to . according to the court , although congress as a whole could pass "legislation on the emoluments issue" to consent to or reject perceived emoluments , the political process would do nothing to address the deprivation of the members' opportunity to give advance approval or disapproval of particular emoluments in the first instance . as with the court rulings on the definition of the term "emolument," the judicial decisions on standing to enforce the emoluments clauses are all subject to further review by the respective circuit courts .
