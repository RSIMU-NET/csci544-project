however , when passenger airlines have accidents or serious incidents , regardless of their rarity , the consequences can be tragic , as a single accident can result in hundreds of deaths . keys to making this safety oversight system work are to: ( 1 ) establish programs that focus resources on areas of highest safety risk and on mitigating risks ; ( 2 ) provide training and other communication to ensure that inspectors maintain the skills and knowledge to consistently carry out the agency's oversight programs ; and ( 3 ) have processes and data to continuously monitor , evaluate , and improve the numerous oversight programs that make up the safety oversight system . this statement focuses on these three key areas of faa's “early warning system” and is based on our recent reports on faa's inspection oversight programs , industry partnership programs , enforcement program , and training program . faa's aviation safety oversight system includes programs that focus on risk identification and mitigation through a system safety approach , the leveraging of resources , and enforcement of safety regulations , but the benefits of these programs are not being fully realized . faa's system safety approach has many strengths , including the addition of a program that emphasizes risk identification to its traditional inspection program for overseeing non - legacy airlines , which is not based on risk . however , it is likely that the benefits of this approach could be enhanced if the inspection workload for non - legacy airlines was not still heavily oriented to the traditional inspection program's non - risk based activities . faa leverages resources through its designee programs , in which designees perform about 90 percent of certification - related activities , thus allowing faa to better concentrate its limited staff resources on the most safety - critical functions . faa also leverages its resources through industry partnership programs , which are designed to assist the agency in receiving safety information . faa's enforcement program , which is an outgrowth of its inspection process , is intended to ensure industry compliance with safety regulations and is another important element of its safety oversight system . we have reported that faa has generally followed effective management practices for planning , developing , delivering , and assessing the impact of its technical training for safety inspectors , although some practices have yet to be fully implemented . for example , we found that faa lacked requirements or criteria for evaluating its designee programs . for example , faa's nationwide enforcement database is not as useful as it could be because of missing or incomplete historical information about enforcement cases . in recent reports , we found that faa's safety oversight system has programs that focus on risk identification and mitigation through a system safety approach , the leveraging of resources , and enforcement of safety regulations , but that the benefits of these programs are not being fully realized . faa has made training an integral part of its safety inspection system and has established mandatory training requirements for its workforce as well as designees .
