during the past decade , the congress and the executive branch have sought to improve federal management and instill a greater focus on results . one of gpra's major purposes is to encourage a closer and clearer link between planning , performance — that is , results , and the budget process . the objectives of this report on the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , and its two companion studies on the administration for children and families within the department of health and human services and the veterans health administration within the department of veterans affairs , are ( 1 ) to document what managers in these three agencies considered successful efforts at creating links between planning and performance information to influence resource choices and ( 2 ) the challenges they face in doing so . within these organizations , we interviewed officials at various levels of management involved in the budget decision - making process , including office directors , division directors , and unit managers . implementation of pbpm is a work in progress . pbpm was created by nrc to improve program and service performance by integrating nrc's strategic planning and budgeting processes . this section describes how components of the process were designed to operate , while the next section ( “planning and performance information influences resource allocation decisions in various ways” ) explains how performance information informs resource decisions in those offices that have implemented pbpm and its techniques . in addition , the commission provides direction to its managers on programs and operations through various written directives . nrc informs its resource allocation decisions by providing strategic direction to operating units prior to budget formulation and by monitoring actual performance against performance targets during budget execution . pbpm also promotes agencywide coordination of budget formulation and execution decisions by providing a common language and common goals . our report on federal agency efforts in linking performance plans with budgets found that nrc's budget presentation linked its program activities to performance goals , which showed funding needed to achieve goals . agency officials noted challenges in ( 1 ) creating performance measures that balance competing goals and keep performance measures current , ( 2 ) associating resource requests with outcomes , ( 3 ) standardizing pbpm practices and techniques but still allowing individual offices to tailor the process to their needs , ( 4 ) developing the assessment component , and ( 5 ) committing significant effort to maintaining pbpm . in addition , nrc must continue developing a cost accounting system to support pbpm . several examples illustrate these points .
