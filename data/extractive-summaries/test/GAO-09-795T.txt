recent congressional interest has focused on minority cdes' participation in the program . as agreed , the report ( 1 ) identified how many minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have applied for and received allocations and how much they have applied for and received from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 2 ) explained the nmtc application process and summarized nmtc application scores for minority and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes by cde type from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 3 ) described the challenges minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have faced in applying for and receiving nmtc allocations ; and ( 4 ) identified efforts the cdfi fund and others are taking to assist minority - owned or controlled cdes in applying for nmtc allocations . to prepare the report , we analyzed cdfi fund nmtc application data from 2005 through 2008 . as of the time of this hearing , the cdfi fund in the department of the treasury has authorized $21 billion of the $26 billion in tax credit authority to be awarded between 2001 and 2009 to cdes that manage nmtc investments in low - income community development projects . since we issued the report on which this statement is based , the cdfi fund announced on may 27 , 2009 an additional 32 nmtc awards to 2008 applicants totaling $1.5 billion under authority granted by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ) . according to our analysis , minority cdes received three of these awards totaling $135 million . from 2005 through 2008 , minority - owned cdes were successful with about 9 percent of the nmtc applications that they submitted to the cdfi fund and received about $354 million of the $8.7 billion for which they applied , or about 4 percent . by comparison , non - minority cdes were successful with about 27 percent of their applications and received $13.2 billion of the $89.7 billion for which they applied , or about 15 percent . the cdfi fund's process for making nmtc awards takes place in two phases . it is not clear from our analysis why minority status is associated with a lower probability of obtaining an allocation or whether any actions taken or not taken by the department of the treasury or the cdfi fund contributed to this statistical relationship . according to cdfi fund officials , the cdfi fund has conducted outreach intended to reach all cdes that may have an interest in applying for nmtcs and cdfi fund staff have given presentations to industry associations , such as the new markets tax credit coalition ; the national bankers association ( nba ) , an industry organization that represents minority - owned banks ; and at fdic conferences targeted to minority - owned institutions . this debriefing provides the unsuccessful cde with information about its scores in each of the application sections and written comments on areas of weakness within each of the four main application sections . potential changes that could be considered include , but would not be limited to the following: ( 1 ) similar to provisions for certain federal grant programs , requiring that a certain portion of the overall amount of allocation authority be designated for minority cdes ; ( 2 ) in accordance with information we obtained in discussions with several experts in economic development , exploring the potential for creating a pool of nmtc allocation authority to be dedicated specifically for community banks ( minority banks that are certified cdes , in most cases , would likely compete with non - minority community banks with similar characteristics for nmtc allocations ) ; or ( 3 ) similar to other federal programs where preferences are given to targeted populations , offering priority points to minority cdes that apply for nmtc allocations . although these options could increase the amount of nmtc authority awarded to minority cdes , in part because we could not definitively identify the reasons why minority cdes have scored lower on the nmtc application than non - minority cdes , the options may not address the underlying reasons for lower minority cde success .
