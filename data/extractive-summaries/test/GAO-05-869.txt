in this context , you asked us to determine for 2004 the ( 1 ) extent of grazing on , and program purposes for , lands managed by the 10 federal agencies in the fiscal year ; ( 2 ) amount spent in the fiscal year by these agencies , and other federal agencies that have grazing - related activities , to manage livestock grazing on public lands ; ( 3 ) total receipts collected during the fiscal year for grazing privileges by the 10 federal agencies with grazing programs , and the amounts disbursed to counties , states , or the federal government ; and ( 4 ) fees charged by the 10 federal agencies , western states , and private ranchers , and the reasons for any differences among the fees . the 10 federal agencies spent at least $135.9 million , of which the forest service and blm spent the majority of funds , about $132.5 million . agencies that have grazing - related activities include the following: several usda agencies that provide research , insurance , resource management , and other agricultural services to farmers and ranchers on both federal and private lands ; justice , the interior's office of the solicitor , and usda's office of general counsel , which perform legal services for blm and the forest service ; the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) and the u.s . the 10 federal agencies collected a total of about $21 million from fees charged for their grazing permits and leases in fiscal year 2004 — less than one - sixth of the expenditures needed to manage grazing ; the largest amount of funds , $17.5 million , was collected by blm and the forest service . fees charged in 2004 by the 10 federal agencies , as well as state land agencies and private ranchers , varied widely , depending on the purpose for which the fees were established and the approach to setting the fee . in effect , the fee is adjusted to reflect ranchers' ability to pay . under u.s . of the 15 state agencies charging fees , 6 agencies used competitive methods to determine the fair market value of their lands in fiscal year 2004 ; 6 used appraised prices or formulas to estimate the fair market value of their lands ; and 3 used only formulas that do not start with a market price . as we noted in our 1991 report on the blm and forest service grazing fee , fees can vary depending on the purposes for which they are charged . if the purpose of the fee were to recover expenditures and if each agency were to charge a fee that recovered its expenditures , blm would have had to charge up to $7.64 per aum , and the forest service would have had to charge up to $12.26 per aum in 2004 , according to our analysis of the agencies' estimated expenditures and the number of aums billed ( 7.6 million aums for blm and 6.1 million aums for the forest service ) . the primary purpose of the blm and forest service fee formula is also not to achieve fair market value prices . dod did not provide official written comments , but the air force and army provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . in its comments , interior did not agree nor disagree with the findings in the report . blm calls this amount “active” or “authorized,” and the forest service calls this amount “permitted.” similarly , blm refers to the amount of grazing that it bills for annually — which can vary from the amount it authorizes because of range or climate conditions — as “billed,” and the forest service refers to this amount of grazing as “authorized.” we use the term “aums approved” to refer to the amounts of grazing authorized by blm and permitted by the forest service and “aums billed” to refer to the amount of grazing for which blm billed ranchers and the amount of grazing authorized each year on forest service lands . these states' land offices manage more than 46 million acres of trust lands , of which more than 37 million acres were grazed in fiscal year 2004 , bringing in grazing revenues of more than $40.7 million . generally , the states charge a fee per aum . rangeland management: current formula keeps grazing fees low . gao / aimd - 98-11 .
