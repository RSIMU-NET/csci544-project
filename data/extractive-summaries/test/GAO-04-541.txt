although national parks remain primarily a public responsibility , parks benefit from other sources of support , including individuals , corporations , and nonprofit organizations . however , there have been some recent concerns within the park service that the foundation is not supporting its priority needs . in this context , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the foundation's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the park service , ( 2 ) the amount and kinds of donations the foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the contributions obtained by the foundation assist the park service in addressing park priorities . to determine the extent that contributions assisted the park service in addressing park priorities , we reviewed the foundation's available discretionary funds and grants to park service units and interviewed foundation officials about how these funds and grants are used to satisfy park requests . although congressionally chartered , the foundation does not receive federal appropriations . the 1967 legislative charter provides the foundation with broad discretion in determining its fund - raising approach . for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 , private contributions more than doubled , from approximately $18 million in 1999 to just over $41 million in 2003 . most corporate donations are targeted for a specific use ( restricted ) . the foundation has made a concerted effort to direct its fund - raising efforts primarily at corporations . the foundation may use various means to distribute general donations to support park activities . corporate donors support the foundation's proud partners of america program , which was initiated in november 2000 . the foundation's approach to fund - raising for systemwide programs has led some park service officials to contend that the foundation's support is not being focused where it could do the most good — to better support individual higher priority projects at local parks . to reduce the confusion and misunderstanding and improve communication between the national park foundation and the park service , we are recommending that the secretary of the interior require the director of the national park service to take the following five steps: work collaboratively with the foundation to develop an overall written agreement that , among other things , articulates the foundation's fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the foundation and the park service in their partnering relationship ; identify and document all current and future fund - raising agreements made with the foundation , specifying the terms of work agreed to by each party ; provide a list of individual park project priorities , including those potentially fundable by nonprofits , and communicate them to the foundation for consideration in fund - raising ; develop and implement internal controls such that fund - raising agreements are documented in writing and subsequent performance is tracked against the agreement ; and clarify whether the exclusivity terms in foundation agreements with proud partners apply to park - based cause - related marketing arrangements and communicate this information to all of the park service's fund - raising partners . to improve its communication with the park service and improve management controls , we are making four recommendations to the national park foundation , namely that it take the following four steps: enter into an overall written agreement with the park service that includes its fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the foundation and the park service in their partnering relationship ; identify and document all current and future fund - raising agreements made with the park service , specifying the terms of work agreed to by each party ; develop a process , either through training or briefings , to help ensure complete and consistent understanding of its fund - raising strategy and roles and responsibilities with the park service headquarters , regional , and local park officials ; and in developing its fund - raising approach , consider the list of individual park priorities compiled and provided by the park service — this list could be used for identifying patterns of park needs for systemwide projects as well as for identifying specific needs that may be of interest to potential donors .
