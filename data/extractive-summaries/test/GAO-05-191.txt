nothing in these statutes appears to prohibit either agency from entering into research arrangements with nonprofit organizations such as acc . similarly , ord relied on broad authorities granted to epa under sections of the clean air act , as amended ; the clean water act , as amended ; and the solid waste disposal act , as amended , to enter into its research arrangement with acc ( sections 103 , 104 , and 8001 , respectively ) . however , in light of the lack of policies on this issue , neither agency formally evaluated the potential for conflicts before finalizing their arrangements with acc . because the research conducted under these arrangements supported the agencies' existing research agendas , officials believe that the acc arrangements helped them effectively leverage federal research dollars . however , the policy's guidance on evaluating and managing potential conflicts is extremely broad , lacking clarity and consistency . as a result , the gift policy does not provide the public sufficient assurance that potential conflicts of interest between nih and donor organizations will be appropriately considered . none of the nonprofit partners in the nine research arrangements we found at nih represents industry in the same direct manner that acc represents the chemical industry . while these processes were appropriate for managing the arrangements , they were not specifically designed to address conflict - of - interest concerns and therefore cannot be considered adequate substitutes for formal conflict - of - interest evaluations . consequently , without policies requiring officials at nih and epa to formally evaluate and manage potential conflicts of interest when they enter into collaborative arrangements such as those with acc , neither agency can ensure that similar arrangements in the future will be systematically evaluated and managed for potential conflicts of interest . the director of nih should further revise the nih gift acceptance policy to require nih officials to evaluate gifts , particularly from organizations that represent regulated industry , for potential conflicts of interest and to document the basis for their decisions , including what , if any , steps are needed to manage potential conflicts . as requested by the ranking member of the subcommittee on environment , technology and standards , house committee on science , and the ranking member of the subcommittee on research , house committee on science , we determined the ( 1 ) legal authority the national institutes of health's ( nih ) national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) and the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) office of research and development ( ord ) used to enter into arrangements with the american chemistry council ( acc ) ; ( 2 ) extent to which niehs and ord evaluated and managed the possibility that conflicts of interest could result from their arrangements ; ( 3 ) extent to which niehs complied with nih's gift acceptance policy when accepting acc's funds ; and ( 4 ) extent to which similar research arrangements exist within other offices and programs within nih and epa , as well as other regulatory agencies . we did not test the niehs or ord internal controls governing the administration of grants awarded under the arrangements . the two agencies selected were the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the federal aviation administration ( faa ) because each agency had a research component to its mission , a corresponding research budget , and a regulatory role .
