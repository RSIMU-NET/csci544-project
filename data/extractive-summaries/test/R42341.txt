sourcing policy refers , generally , to determining which sector — public ( government ) or private — will perform an agency's function ( s ) . sourcing policy encompasses two major strains . delving into the history of sourcing policy is necessary for understanding the strain that emerged in the 1950s , and for providing context for the strain that emerged during president barack obama's administration . an unwritten corollary of this strain of sourcing policy has been that certain functions performed by federal employees may be subjected to public - private competition . generally , the term introduced by the administration of president george w. bush — competitive sourcing — is associated with this strain of sourcing policy . any agency function designated as governmental ( or , later , inherently governmental ) must be performed by federal employees . with the continued emphasis on governmental reliance on the private sector finding expression in a "[g]overnment policy [that] has favored contracting for goods and services rather than providing them in - house," the commercial / inherently governmental dichotomy and the focus on public - private competitions sufficed for a number of years . determining who should do the work of the federal government became more challenging as , for example , certain practices were called into question ( e.g. , using companies to conduct passenger screening at airports ) ; controversy swirled around some events that involved private security contractors ( e.g. , private security guards reportedly shot iraqi civilians in 2007 ) ; and concerns surfaced that , in the rush to expand its capabilities , the federal government was at risk of having contractor employees perform inherently governmental work . the obama administration , through guidance issued by the office of management and budget , refers to this strain as multi - sector workforce management . unlike competitive sourcing , the multisector workforce management strain relies chiefly ( though not entirely ) on an expanded typology of functions and associated guidance to determine who — federal employees or contractor employees — should perform which agency functions . additions to the existing typology ( commercial functions and inherently governmental functions ) are critical functions and functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions . according to the obama administration's guidance , multi - sector workforce management was devised to ensure that agencies' reliance on contractors is not excessive . policy issues that may be of interest to the 112 th congress are also discussed . the introduction of multi - sector workforce management , combined with the issuance of policy letter 11-01 and the enactment of a statutory provision requiring agencies to develop insourcing guidelines , represents , perhaps , a new chapter in sourcing policy . it remains to be seen how this strain of sourcing policy , which is predicated on safeguarding the government's missions and operations , might mesh with the longstanding policy of governmental reliance on the private sector . p.l . 105-270 , federal activities inventory reform ( fair ) act , at http: / / www.congress.gov / cgi - lis / togpo / http: / / www.gpo.gov / fdsys / pkg / plaw - 105publ270 / pdf / plaw - 105publ270.pdf .
