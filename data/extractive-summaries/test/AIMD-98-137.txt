in 1996 the congress made sweeping changes to national welfare policy in passing public law 104-193 , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) . you asked us to review states' fiscal decisions for the tanf block grant and to address whether states are taking steps now to prepare for the effects of future economic downturns on their welfare programs . specifically , you asked us to report on ( 1 ) how state budgetary resources , including federal aid , have been allocated since states have had access to tanf funds , ( 2 ) what plans states are making to assure programmatic stability in times of fiscal and economic stress , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states have used , or plan to use , the program's federal contingency fund and the loan fund which are available for downturns or other emergencies affecting states . federal funding under the tanf grant is fixed , and states are required to maintain a significant portion of their own historic financial commitment to their welfare programs as a condition of receiving their full tanf grant — referred to as their maintenance of effort requirement ( moe ) .these two funding streams — federal tanf and state general funds for moe — represent the bulk of the resources available to states as they design , finance , and implement their new low - income family assistance programs . these resources must be left in the u.s. treasury until they are needed . however , unless there are reserves specifically earmarked for low - income family assistance programs , these programs will have to compete for “rainy day” fund resources with all other programs in a state's general fund in times of budgetary stress . overall , we calculated that under the block grant , 46 states wouldhave more total resources — state and federal — for their new welfare programs than they would have had under the old welfare programs — with a median increase of 22 percent — or about $4.7 billion more nationwide . in addition , new york enhanced funding for child care services by about $100 million . officials in most of the states we visited indicated that they would not use the contingency fund for state welfare programs ( contingency fund ) nor the federal loan fund for state welfare programs ( loan fund ) even if they became eligible to do so . officials in some states indicated that borrowing specifically for social welfare spending in times of fiscal stress would not receive popular support . states currently have more resources available for these programs under tanf than would have been available under the old financing system , but future fiscal demands are uncertain . the fixed nature of the tanf block grant , the potential volatility of welfare caseloads and program spending along with the “pro - cyclical” budgetary pressures states face under their balanced budget requirements highlight the importance of both the states' own funding for contingencies as well as prwora's provisions for contingencies — allowing states to save unused tanf funds for future years' use and the two safety net mechanisms , the contingency fund and the loan fund . we continue to believe that the congress would benefit from more complete information on states' plans for future contingencies , including unspent tanf balances . our analysis shows that 38 states received an increase of 25 percent or more .
