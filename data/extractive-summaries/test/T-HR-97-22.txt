we are pleased to be here today to discuss major government programs and operations we have identified as high risk because of vulnerabilities to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement . today , we will highlight the legislative and agency actions that have resulted in progress toward fixing these problems . without additional attention to resolve problems in the 25 areas that are the current focus of our high - risk initiative , the government will continue to miss huge opportunities to save billions of dollars , make better investments to reap the benefits of information technology , improve performance and provide better service , and more effectively manage the cost of government programs . effective and sustained follow - through by agency managers is essential to make further headway and achieve greater benefits . continued oversight by the congress , such as this hearing by the subcommittee , will add essential impetus to ensuring progress as well . landmark legislation passed by the congress in the 1990s has established broad management reforms , which , with successful implementation , will help resolve high - risk problems and provide greater accountability in many government programs and operations: the expanded chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 requires agencies to prepare financial statements that can pass the test of an independent audit and provide decisionmakers reliable financial information . overall , agencies are taking high - risk problems seriously , trying to correct them , and making progress in many areas . the congress has also acted to address several problems affecting these high - risk areas through oversight hearings and specific legislative initiatives . full and effective implementation of legislative mandates , our suggestions , and corrective measures by agencies , however , has not yet been achieved because the high - risk areas involve long - standing problems that are difficult to correct . as countless studies we have performed have long noted and our high - risk series of reports demonstrates , federal agencies often fail to appropriately manage their finances , identify clearly what they intend to accomplish , or do the job effectively with a minimum of waste . gpra requires agencies to set goals , measure performance , and report on their accomplishments . gpra will be more difficult for some agencies to apply than for others . but gpra has the potential for adding greatly to government performance â€” a particularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited and public demand is high . reliable financial information is key to better managing government programs , providing accountability , and addressing high - risk problems . as a result of situations such as these , financial information has not been reliable enough to use in federal decision - making or to provide the requisite public accountability . the landmark chief financial officers ( cfo ) act spelled out a long overdue and ambitious agenda to help resolve these types of financial management deficiencies . important and steady progress is being made under the act to bring about sweeping reforms and rectify the devastating legacy from inattention to financial management .
