to meet its expansive homeland security mission , dhs spends billions of dollars on service acquisitions for critical trade , transportation , and border security investments . in fact , more than 80 percent of dhs's total procurement dollars are spent on services . prior gao work has found that appropriate planning , structuring , and monitoring of acquisitions is critical to ensuring that the services provided meet the government's needs . to help improve service acquisition outcomes , federal procurement policy calls for agencies to use a performance - based approach to the maximum extent practicable . specifically , i will discuss how contract outcomes are influenced by how well dhs components have defined and developed contract requirements and performance standards . this report focused on contracts for major investments with complex service acquisitions at the coast guard , customs and border protection ( cbp ) , and the transportation security administration ( tsa ) â€” three of the dhs components reporting among the highest obligations for performance - based service acquisitions in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 . the federal acquisition regulation requires all performance - based service acquisitions to include a performance work statement that describes outcome - oriented requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work ; measurable performance standards describing how to measure contractor performance in terms of quality , timeliness , and quantity ; and the method of assessing contract performance against performance standards , commonly accomplished through the use of a quality assurance surveillance plan . prior gao and dhs inspector general reviews of complex dhs investments using a performance - based approach point to a number of shortcomings . the dhs inspector general has also indicated numerous opportunities for dhs to make better use of sound practices , such as well - defined requirements . while all eight contracts for these investments had outcome - oriented requirements , the requirements were not always well - defined . complex investments with contracts that did not have well - defined requirements or complete measurable performance standards at the time of contract award or start of work experienced either cost overruns , schedule delays , or did not otherwise meet performance expectations . in managing its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based , dhs has faced oversight challenges , including a lack of reliable data and systematic management reviews . moreover , the chief procurement officer ( cpo ) , who has responsibility for departmentwide procurement oversight , has begun some initial review of performance - based service acquisitions , but has not conducted systematic management assessments of this acquisition method . our analysis of information provided by contracting representatives at the coast guard , cbp , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and tsa showed that about 51 percent of the 138 contracts we identified in fpds - ng as performance - based had none of the required performance - based elements: a performance work statement , measurable performance standards , and a method of assessing contractor performance against performance standards . the report we are releasing today recommends that the secretary of homeland security take several actions to increase dhs's ability to achieve improved outcomes for its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based . these actions include routinely assessing requirements for complex investments to ensure that they are well - defined and developing consistently measurable standards linked to those requirements ; systematically evaluating outcomes of major investments and relevant contracting methods ; and improving the quality of fpds - ng data to facilitate identifying and assessing the use of various contracting methods . dhs generally concurred with our recommendations , noting some departmental initiatives under way to improve acquisition management .
