the restrictions prohibit federal employees from engaging in certain activities , such as lobbying or other advocacy communications , for a specified period of time after leaving federal service . in addition to these laws and other lobbying disclosure requirements , such as the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amended , congress has enacted the foreign agents registration act ( fara ) to ensure that the u.s. government and the american people are informed of the source and identity of persons engaging in representational activities or otherwise trying to influence u.s. government policy on behalf of foreign entities . to identify the number of senior - level federal officials who registered as foreign agents after leaving government service between calendar years 2000 and 2007 , we obtained a list from justice of all individuals registered as foreign agents during those years , and provided these names to the office of personnel management ( opm ) to match against all executive branch senior federal employees in its central personnel data file ( cpdf ) . under fara , a person is considered an agent of a foreign principal when the person acts in any capacity at the order or request or is under the control , supervision , or financing of the foreign principal , and engages in the following within the united states: political activities for or in the interest of the foreign principal ; public relations , information - service employment , or political consulting for or in the interest of the foreign principal ; fundraising , collecting , or disbursing of money or things of value for or in the interest of the foreign principal ; and representing the interests of a foreign principal before any agency or official of the u.s. government . certain activities , such as humanitarian , commercial , and legal activities , are exempt from fara . the agencies ( state , treasury , usaid , and ustr ) we reviewed are not required to and generally do not collect and maintain information on and monitor the post - government employment activities of persons who leave government employment , including former senior government employees who represent foreign entities . justice collects and maintains information on all individuals who register with the department as foreign agents , but this information does not identify registrants who are former senior federal employees . justice collects and maintains information on all entities that register with the department as foreign agents ; however , this information does not identify individuals who were former senior federal employees , and justice is not required to do so . the agencies we reviewed face information , legal , and resource challenges in promoting compliance with post - government employment restrictions and in enforcing and monitoring the registration requirements of fara . for example , while the ethics officials provide guidance and information to employees on post - government employment restrictions , they do not consistently document specific advice provide to senior federal employees . in addition , justice officials have cited a lack of clear legal authority and a lack of resources as barriers to monitoring compliance with fara registration requirements . in addition , oge has encouraged the executive branch agencies to document such advice . the agencies document information such as ethics training courses given , subject matters covered , and counseling services offered to employees . the inspector general officials we met with said documentation of specific advice on post - government employment restrictions provided to senior federal employees can assist the agencies to prove intent to violate the post - government employment restrictions ; however , this advice is not consistently documented . without advance written notification , justice has no way of knowing whether persons exempting themselves should in fact be registered . to enhance justice's ability to ensure that the american people know the identity of persons trying to influence u.s. government policy in the united states on behalf of foreign entities , congress may wish to consider ( 1 ) granting the department of justice civil investigative demand authority to inspect records of persons justice believes should be registered as foreign agents and ( 2 ) requiring persons claiming certain exemptions to provide advance written notification to justice before engaging in the exempt activities . to enhance executive branch enforcement of the post - government employment restrictions , we recommend that the director of the office of government ethics strongly encourage agency ethics officials to implement the suggested actions described in the november 2005 oge memorandum and its subsequent 2008 reminder to designated agency officials on documenting ethics advice , and also encourage agency ethics officials to work closely with their inspectors general to ensure that this information is shared when needed .
