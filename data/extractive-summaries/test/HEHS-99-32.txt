in response to the request of the previous chairman of the subcommittee for information on how well kinship care is serving foster children , this report describes ( 1 ) the quality of care that children in kinship care receive compared with that received by other foster children , as measured by a caseworker's assessment of a caregiver's parenting skills , the extent to which a foster child is able to maintain contact with familiar people and surroundings , and a caregiver's willingness to enforce court - ordered restrictions on parental visits ; ( 2 ) the frequency with which state child welfare agencies pursue various permanent living arrangements ( that is , permanency planning goals ) and the time children in kinship care have spent in the system compared with other foster children ; and ( 3 ) recent state initiatives intended to help ensure that children in kinship care receive good quality foster care and are placed in permanent homes in a timely manner . our analysis of the caseworkers' responses to our survey of open foster care cases in california and illinois showed that , overall , the quality of both kinship care and other foster care was good and that in most respects the experiences of children in kinship care and in other foster care settings were comparable . california and illinois provide fewer kinship caregivers with training than other foster caregivers . previous research on children who have left the foster care system has shown that children who had been in kinship care were less likely to be adopted and stayed longer in foster care than other foster children . in california , there was no difference between kinship care and other foster care in the length of time children spent in foster care . according to state officials , illinois has found that kinship caregivers , contrary to popular belief , are willing to adopt , and illinois is actively pursuing adoption in these cases . since the fall of 1997 , both california and illinois have been instituting new programs and practices that are designed to ( 1 ) increase the likelihood that permanent living arrangements will be found for children in kinship care , as well as other foster care settings , who cannot return to their parents and ( 2 ) continue to ensure that kinship care is of good quality . while california and illinois apply less stringent standards or approval criteria for kinship caregivers , both states are taking steps to better ensure good quality kinship care . specifically , in illinois , children in kinship care and children who had entered foster care at an early age were more likely to have guardianship or adoption as the goal than children in other foster care settings . sources are noted after each table .
