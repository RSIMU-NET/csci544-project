in 2003 , recognizing the need for a new and different type of air traffic control system to deal with the expected growth , congress authorized the creation of jpdo to lead a collaborative effort of federal and nonfederal aviation stakeholders to conceptualize and plan the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) . as you know , the current authorization for faa , the airport and airway trust fund ( trust fund ) , and most of the excise taxes that provide revenue for the trust fund will expire at the end of this fiscal year . 2881 and s. 1300 — specify various revenue sources to fund faa , including nextgen . among these sources are the current excise taxes , including fuel taxes ; certification and registration fees ; and flight surcharges .  ( 2 ) what issues could affect the overall cost of nextgen ? . my remarks are based on recent gao reports and testimonies on faa's current funding structure , nextgen , and funding options that might address concerns about faa's current funding structure . it provides all of the funding for three of faa's four accounts , including ( 1 ) the facilities and equipment ( f&e ) account , which funds technological improvements to the air traffic control system ; ( 2 ) the research , engineering , and development ( re&d ) account , which funds research on issues related to aviation safety , mobility , and the environment as well as most of faa's contribution to jpdo ; and ( 3 ) the airport improvement program ( aip ) , which provides grants for construction and safety projects at airports . the current funding structure — excise taxes plus a general fund contribution — has funded faa for many years , and estimates indicate that this structure can potentially provide sufficient funds for the next several years to support the transition to nextgen . policy choices , structural changes in the aviation industry , and external events have affected revenues flowing into and out of the fund . assuming that the general fund provides about 19 percent of faa's budget , cbo estimates that through 2017 the trust fund can support about $22 billion in additional spending over the baseline faa spending levels cbo has calculated for faa ( the 2006 funding level , growing with inflation ) provided that most of that spending occurs after 2010 . for example , congress could raise more revenue from airspace system users for modernization or for other purposes by raising the rates on one or more of the current excise taxes . other issues include the cost savings that might result from more efficient faa operations and acquisition processes , which could reduce the need for new nextgen funding , and the extent to which faa uses public - private partnerships or leasing arrangements to acquire nextgen infrastructure as flexibly and cost - effectively as possible . several proposals , including a recommendation from a house committee and selected provisions of the house and senate reauthorization bills , specify different types of revenue sources to fund faa and nextgen . these proposals have implications for revenue generation , but could also lead to unintended consequences . however , the increases , although relatively small , might also lead to reductions in fuel purchases by general aviation aircraft operators . 2881 would allow airports to increase pfcs to a maximum of $7 , while an s. 1300 provision would retain the cap at $4.50 . these calculations assume that the increased pfc would not affect passenger demand for air travel . h.r . however , in general , when fees are imposed for aviation activities , care must be taken to ensure that efforts to avoid the fees do not compromise safety . advocates of this approach say that funding faa in part through such a charge would do more than the current structure to ensure that revenues are adequate to cover costs over time and to create incentives for efficient use of the national airspace system by directly connecting charges with the costs imposed by users . another s. 1300 provision would grant faa the authority to seek debt financing by issuing bonds directly to the private capital market . the costs of borrowing may also be higher if the revenue option — such as taxes or user charges — used to pay back the bond is subject to appropriations because there would most likely be a risk premium added to the credit rating to compensate for the risk that appropriations may not be provided .
