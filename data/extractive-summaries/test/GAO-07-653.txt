while the results of some research cannot be disseminated because of national security or intellectual property disseminated because of national security or intellectual property concerns , dissemination of most federally funded research helps ensure a concerns , dissemination of most federally funded research helps ensure a maximum return on the public's investment in this research . nasa's researchers are subject to agency - level policies and center - specific policies for the dissemination of research through publications , presentations , press releases , and media interviews , and these policies generally facilitate dissemination . regarding press releases , noaa public affairs officials have also interpreted approval requirements differently from one another . in addition , more researchers at the three agencies are confident that they understand their agency's policies on the dissemination of research through publications and presentations well enough to comply with them , than are confident that they understand their agency's media interview and press release policies . headquarters and several center officials told us that little or no formal training had been conducted on nasa's recently revised media policy . most researchers at nasa , nist , and noaa feel confident that they know how to comply with their agency's policies for publications and presentations , but many do not feel as confident that they know how to comply with their agency's policies on media interviews and press releases . in contrast , nearly one - half of researchers at nasa and over one - third of researchers at noaa are not confident that they understand their agency's policies on media interviews well enough to follow them , and 40 percent of nasa researchers and 35 percent of noaa researchers are not confident they understand their agency's policies on press releases . noaa researchers , like nist researchers , are also subject to commerce's policy that restricts their ability to discuss their personal views . similarly , regarding dissemination through media interviews , significantly fewer researchers , ranging from 54 percent at noaa to 68 percent at nist , believe that their agency is supportive of this dissemination route . in contrast , more researchers at nasa believe that the agency consistently applies its policies for publications than believe the agency consistently applies its policies for press releases and media interviews . 5. ) . according to our survey , over 85 percent of the researchers within nist and approximately 75 percent of the researchers at noaa believe their agencies consistently apply their dissemination policies for publications , presentations , press releases , and media interviews . to ensure that ( 1 ) researchers have a clear process to follow for appealing decisions regarding dissemination of research results and ( 2 ) all researchers are aware of and understand how to comply with their agencies' policies for disseminating research , we recommend that the secretary of commerce , the nasa administrator , the nist director , and the noaa administrator each take the following two actions: review their dissemination policies and ensure that they clearly identify a process by which researchers can appeal dissemination decisions . our objectives for this review were to ( 1 ) identify and evaluate the policies that guide the dissemination of federal research results at the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) ; ( 2 ) determine how effectively the dissemination and dispute resolution policies of these agencies have been communicated to researchers ; ( 3 ) determine the extent to which researchers at these agencies have experienced restrictions on the dissemination of their research results , and ( 4 ) provide an overview of the role of the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) in helping agencies develop and implement policies related to the dissemination of research results . information about accessing the survey was provided via e - mail for all survey participants .
