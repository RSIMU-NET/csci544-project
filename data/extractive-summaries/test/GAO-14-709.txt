the department of justice's ( doj ) federal bureau of prisons ( bop ) requested about $6.9 billion in fiscal year 2014 to provide for the custody and care of an inmate population that has increased from about 24,000 in fiscal year 1980 to over 216,000 in july 2014 . moreover , according to bop's most recent long - range capacity plan included in doj's annual congressional budget justification for bop , the bureau projects annual inmate growth of between 2,500 and 3,000 or more from fiscal years 2015 through 2020 . bop is currently working to activate these institutions — a process by which bop staffs and equips institutions , and populates them with inmates — and has received or is waiting for congressionally directed funding to activate all six of these new institutions . why did doj purchase the thomson correctional center , and how , if at all , will it affect costs ? . additionally , we evaluated the extent to which bop's schedule documents used for completing activation for each institution complied with and reflected best practices outlined in gao's schedule assessment guide . interviewed bop officials to discuss crowding , cost and schedule estimates , and any potential cost implications of the thomson purchase . bop communicates its schedule estimates related to activating new institutions to congress through the annual budget process . in contrast , bop's annual according to bop officials , when bop is congressionally directed to investigate a particular location , bop generally considers this as a direction to focus its efforts on constructing an institution in that specific location . standards for internal control in the federal government states that management should ensure that there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders , such as congress , that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals.activations limit bop's ability to reduce crowding as bop intended , doj and bop would be better positioned for future activations and could more effectively manage activation costs and timelines by using bop's annual congressional budget justification to communicate to congress the factors that might delay future activations , such as challenges hiring staff and placing inmates , associated with the locations of new institutions . bop's central office reviews aggregated data of staffing system - wide , but it does not monitor or analyze staffing data by individual institutions , such as those located on a complex , or track how long it takes individual activating institutions to hire staff . gao / aimd - 00-21.3.1 . crowding by security level . bop estimates that once administrative usp thomson is fully activated , it will cost $160 million each year to operate it as a high - security institution that primarily houses special management unit ( smu ) inmates . bop's six new institutions will reduce crowding system - wide , but doing so has cost more and taken longer than bop initially estimated because of internal and external challenges , many of which , according to bop officials , are outside of bop's control . to better address obstacles that occur during the activation process and to help ensure that institutions are activated within estimated timeframes , including those institutions that do not currently have inmates , such as administrative usp thomson and usp yazoo city , we recommend that the director of the bureau of prisons take the following three actions: direct the central office to analyze staffing data at individual institutions in the activation process to assess their progress toward reaching authorized staffing levels and use that assessment to develop effective , tailored strategies to mitigate those challenges ; develop and implement a comprehensive activation policy that incorporates the knowledge of staff with experience activating institutions ; and develop and implement an activation schedule that incorporates the four characteristics of scheduling best practices . none of the six institutions is at rated capacity — the number of inmates that a given institution can safely and securely house . comprehensive . well constructed .
