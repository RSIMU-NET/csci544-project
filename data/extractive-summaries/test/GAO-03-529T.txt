i am here today to discuss our work on the nationwide problem of leaking underground storage tanks ( ust ) and the recommendations that we made to address this problem in our may 2001 report on the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) tank program . under the program , epa required tank owners to install new leak detection equipment by the end of 1993 and new spill - , overfill - , and corrosion - prevention equipment by the end of 1998 . because the states are primarily implementing the provisions of the program , we conducted a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia in the fall of 2000 to determine the extent to which tanks comply with program requirements , how epa and the states inspect tanks and enforce requirements , and whether upgraded tanks still leak . furthermore , we estimated that almost 30 percent of the tanks — more than 200,000 — were not being operated and maintained properly , thus increasing the chance of leaks and posing health risks . for these and other reasons , states reported that leaks persisted even in the tanks with the required equipment installed . both epa and the states attribute operational and maintenance problems primarily to poorly trained staff . in response , epa has been working with states and contractors to develop less costly training opportunities , such as internet - based training . states said they did not have the available funding , staff , or authority to conduct more inspections or more strongly enforce tank compliance . we also suggested that the congress may want to ( 1 ) consider increasing the amount of funds it appropriates from the trust fund and allow states to spend a limited portion on inspections and enforcement , ( 2 ) authorize epa to require physical inspections of all tanks on a periodic basis , ( 3 ) authorize epa to prohibit fuel deliveries to non - compliant tanks , and ( 4 ) require states to adopt this enforcement authority . states still face a considerable workload in ensuring that contamination from leaking tanks , including those that leak mtbe , is cleaned up , and that funding is available to address these cleanups . as of september 30 , 2002 , states and epa regions had to ensure the completion of ongoing cleanups for about 99,427 leaks and initiation of cleanups for another 43,278 . as figure 3 illustrates , at the time of our survey , 27 states reported that they did not have the authority to prohibit suppliers from delivering fuel to stations with problem tanks , one of the most effective tools to ensure compliance . however , in addition to their known workload , states may likely face a potentially large but unknown future cleanup workload for several reasons: ( 1 ) as many as 200,000 tanks may be unregistered or abandoned and not assessed for leaks , according to an epa estimate ; ( 2 ) tens of thousands of empty and inactive tanks have not been permanently closed or had leaks identified ; and ( 3 ) some states are reopening completed cleanups in locations where mtbe was subsequently detected .
