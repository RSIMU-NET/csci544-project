to meet the objectives of this assignment , we requested that dod and the military services provide us with the ( 1 ) status of dod and the military services' efforts in implementing the provisions of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 and the dod appropriations act , 2003 , ( 2 ) status of actions taken to implement the recommendations included in the four gao reports , and ( 3 ) administrative or disciplinary actions taken against individuals we identified as having made potentially fraudulent , improper , and abusive or questionable transactions . the proliferation of cardholders also resulted in a span of control problem for some approving officials . in response to the concerns we expressed about dod's management of the purchase card program , the congress included section 1007 in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 ( public law 107-314 ) and section 8149 in the fiscal year 2003 dod appropriations act ( public law 107-248 ) to require dod to take specific actions to improve the management of the purchase card program , and in particular the weaknesses we identified . as shown in table 2 , these laws limit the number of purchase cards and require dod to train purchase card officials , monitor purchase card activity , discipline cardholders who misuse the purchase card , and assess the credit worthiness of cardholders . the department is pursuing an alternative solution that would rely on a self - certification process by prospective cardholders . rather , the military services told us they modified their policies and procedures to prohibit similar acquisitions in the future . dod is seeking additional legislative action required to implement credit checks . a number of systems issues have been discussed with the banks and dcaa has finalized its audit recommendations . all compromised accounts are closed . in addition , all “benefiting individuals” who have requested personal items to be purchased for their use may also be required to reimburse the government for such purchases .
