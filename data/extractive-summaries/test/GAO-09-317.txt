federal , state , and local decision makers have had a renewed interest in looking at how high speed rail might fit into our national transportation system and address increasing mobility constraints on the nation's highways and at airports due to congestion . while several u.s. corridors exhibit characteristics that suggest potential economic viability , decision makers have faced difficulties in ascertaining whether any specific proposed line will be viable due to uncertainties in how accurately project sponsors forecast riders and estimate costs , and to the lack of agreement and standards regarding how a project's public benefits should be valued and assessed . federal funding that has historically been made available for high speed rail has been derived from general revenues , rather than a dedicated funding source . consequently , high speed rail projects must compete with other nontransportation demands on federal funds , such as national defense , education , or health care , as opposed to being compared with other alternative transportation investments or policies in a corridor . in the countries we visited , the central government generally funds the majority of up - front costs of their country's respective high speed rail projects , and they do so without the expectation that their investment will be recouped through ticket revenues . sustaining public support over this length of time can be difficult and can have significant impacts on a project . these organizations are often limited in terms of institutional and financial resources . the recently enacted priia , in addition to authorizing funding , provides numerous other opportunities for a greater federal role in high speed rail development , as follows: the act requires the secretary of transportation to establish and carry out a rail cooperative research program that will address , among other things , new high speed wheel on rail systems ; the fra administrator is tasked with the development of a long - range national rail plan consistent with approved state rail plans and the rail needs of the nation ; the fra administrator is required to support high speed rail development , including high speed rail planning ; the act explicitly provides a framework for the establishment of a high speed rail corridor development program , which permits the secretary to make grants to states , groups of states , and others to finance capital projects in high speed rail corridors ; the act requires the secretary to issue a request for proposals for the financing , design , construction , operation , and maintenance of high speed intercity passenger rail systems operating within high speed rail corridors ; and the secretary is to study high speed rail routes and establish a process for states or groups of states to redesignate or modify designated high speed rail corridors . we discuss japan's incentive structure further in the next section on analytical tools . these include using quantitative analyses based on identifying benefits and costs , managing existing transportation capacity , and developing public - private partnerships . project selection criteria encourage a project sponsor to evaluate public benefits . in the context of high speed rail , fiscal sustainability includes consideration of such things as whether federal , state , and other funding is affordable and stable over the short - and long - term ( i.e. , both while a project is being planned and constructed as well as after the high speed rail line is in operation ) ; the extent to which costs and revenues are shared among federal , state , local , and private participants ; and whether any project fees and taxes are aligned with use and benefits . to better understand the potential viability of high speed rail service in the united states , we reviewed ( 1 ) the factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail projects — that is , whether a project's total social benefits offset or justify the total social costs — and difficulties in determining the economic viability of proposed projects ; ( 2 ) the challenges that u.s. project sponsors experience in developing and financing high speed rail projects ; and ( 3 ) the federal role in the potential development of high speed rail systems . this included analyzing selected high speed rail legislation from 1965 to 2008 , including the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 . authority officials did not provide an average speed .
