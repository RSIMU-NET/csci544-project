to help reverse this trend , gao embarked on a concerted effort to learn how leading private and public sector organizations controlled system development projects and successfully applied technology to improve their performance . our resulting study identified a specific set of strategic practices that these organizations use to improve performance through information management . senior executives in the successful organizations we studied were personally committed to improving the management of technology . the legislation assigns a wide range of duties and responsibilities to cios , foremost of which are working with the agency head and senior program managers to implement effective information management to achieve the agency's strategic goals ; helping to establish a sound investment review process to select , control , and evaluate spending for information technology ; promoting improvements to the work processes used by the agency to carry out its programs ; increasing the value of the agency's information resources by implementing an integrated agencywide technology architecture ; and strengthening the agency's knowledge , skills , and capabilities to effectively manage information resources , deal with emerging technology issues , and develop needed systems . specifically , agencies should appoint a cio with expertise and practical experience in technology position the cio as a senior partner reporting directly to the agency head ; ensure that the cio's primary responsibilities are for information have the cio serve as a bridge between top management , line management , and information management support professionals , working with them to ensure the effective acquisition and management of the information resources needed to support agency programs and missions ; task the cio with developing strategies and specific plans for the hiring , training , and professional development of staff in order to build the agency's capability to develop and manage its information resources ; and support the cio position with an effective cio organization and management framework for implementing agencywide information technology initiatives . shortly after the clinger - cohen act went into effect , omb evaluated the status of cio appointments at the 27 agencies . omb noted that at several agencies , the cio's duties , qualifications , and placement met the requirements of the clinger - cohen act . however , omb had concerns about a number of other agencies that had acting cios , cios whose qualifications did not appear to meet the requirements of the clinger - cohen act , and / or cios who did not report directly to the head of the agency . omb also raised concerns about agencies where the cios had other major management responsibilities or where it was unclear whether the cios' primary duty was the information resource management function . one area that we will focus on during the coming year is cios who have major responsibilities in addition to information management . at present , only 12 agencies have cios whose responsibilities are focused solely on information management . we are particularly troubled by agencies that have vested cio and chief financial officer responsibilities in one person . because it may be difficult for the cio of a large department to adequately oversee and manage the specific information needs of the department's major subcomponents , we have also supported the establishment of a cio structure at the subcomponent and bureau levels . we have reported on instances where the subcomponent cios were not organizationally positioned and empowered to discharge key cio functions . in addition , the council annually reports on its progress in implementing financial management reforms . ultimately , the successful implementation of information management reforms depends heavily upon the skills and performance of the entire cio organization within departments and agencies â€” not just the cio as a single individual .
