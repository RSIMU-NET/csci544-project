ever since communist north vietnamese forces defeated u.s. - backed south vietnam in 1975 , reunified vietnam has been struggling with how to maintain a balance between two often contradictory goals — maintaining ideological purity and promoting economic development . by the mid - 1980s , disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt a more pragmatic line , enshrined in the doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms of 1986 . the state of vietnam's worker rights conditions has become part of the debate over whether congress should approve the vietnam - u.s. bta , which does not contain provisions that explicitly deal with labor rights . the linkage between labor rights and the bta would have become even more contentious if the bush administration had followed up on its proposal to bundle the bta into a broad - based trade bill that would also include a u.s. - jordan free trade agreement and new negotiating authority ( also known as "fast track" or "trade promotion authority" ) for the president to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements . they are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of a bilateral textile agreement , which the u.s. and vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year . some labor rights advocates contend that globalization occasionally has weakened vietnam's labor rights regime in the textile and apparel industries ; at times , textile multinationals and industrialized governments have pushed the vietnamese government — against the wishes of the vgcl — to relax its enforcement of certain provisions of the labor code . that agreement , which was signed in january 1999 , is designed to reward improvements in labor rights with increased access to the u.s. textile and apparel market . by promoting economic development , they argue , the bta will provide vietnamese workers with more opportunities , increased knowledge , and improved means to promote their rights . foreign investment , which is likely to increase if the bta is passed , is also thought by some to raise working conditions generally by bringing in multinational corporations that pay higher wages and have better health and safety conditions than do local enterprises . titles from the bld compilation are listed in vietnamese , with an english translation in brackets . general laws and regulations on labor relations the labor code of the socialist republic of vietnam of 1994 ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 122 ) decree 233-hdbt of june 22 , 1990 on labor for enterprises with foreign owned capital ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 9 ) [note: the labor code only partially repealed decree 223-hdbt] decree 72-cp of oct. 31 , 1995 providing details and guidelines for the implementation of a number of articles of the labor code with respect to employment ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 351 ) circular 16-ldtbxh - tt providing guidelines for the implementation of decree 72-cp of oct. 31 , 1995 with respect to recruitment of labor ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 515 ) decree 198-cp of dec. 31 , 1994 regarding the implementation of a number of articles of the labor code with respect to labor contracts ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 213 ) circular 21 / ldtbxh - tt of oct. 12 , 1996 on the implementation of a number of articles of decree 198-cp on labor contracts ( foreign investment laws of vietnam , p. iv - 551 ) decree 23-cp of apr .
