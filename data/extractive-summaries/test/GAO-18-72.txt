security assessments of facilities can uncover vulnerabilities and threats and recommend protective measures — called countermeasures — such as fences , access control systems , and closed - circuit television systems to mitigate those threats . this product is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued in august 2017 . in addition , we selected 13 facilities within these 4 agencies for site visits based on geographical dispersion and high levels of risk . for each facility , departments and agencies are required to ( a ) consider all of the “undesirable events” that could pose a risk to their facilities — such as active shooters , vandalism , and explosions — and ( b ) assess three factors of risk ( threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences ) to specific undesirable events . cbp conducts these assessments . the forest service's security officials have responsibility for conducting security assessments , but at the time of our review , usda security officials conducted the assessment at forest service's one higher - level facility . faa may need such equipment at all its higher - level facilities . in conducting risk assessments that do not fully align with the isc standard ( i.e. , not assessing threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences and measuring risks ) , agencies miss the opportunity for more informed funding decisions . without having long - term , agency - wide information to monitor whether assessments are conducted on schedule , ars and the forest service may not meet the isc standard , resulting in not adequately protecting their facilities and employees . faa's policy does not require ongoing monitoring of physical security information , such as the status of recommended countermeasures or assessment schedules . to address challenges in conducting timely assessments , agencies that had a backlog developed plans to address them , but the assumptions used in cbp's plans and time frames did not appear to fully reflect the agency's competing priorities and actual experience . to improve agencies' physical security programs' alignment with the isc risk management process for federal facilities and standards for internal control in the federal government for information and monitoring , we recommend that the commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection take the following three actions: with regard to the updated security policy and procedures handbook , the isc's risk management process for federal facilities requirement to assess all undesirable events , consider all three factors of risk , and document deviations from the standard , and data collection and analysis requirements for monitoring the performance of cbp's physical security program . secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to take the following three actions: develop a plan that provides sufficient details on the activities needed and time frames within the date when faa will implement an improved methodology ; update faa's policy to require the use of a methodology that fully aligns with the isc's risk management process for federal facilities for assessing all undesirable events , considering all three factors of risk , and documenting all deviations from the standard countermeasures ; and update faa's policy to include ongoing monitoring of physical security information . secretary of agriculture take the following two actions: include data collection and analysis requirements for monitoring the performance of agencies' physical security programs , in the department's revised physical - security manual , and direct the administrator of the agricultural research service and the chief of the forest service to implement and monitor a long - term assessment schedule with key milestones to ensure that higher - level facilities are reassessed at least once every 3 years . this report examines: ( 1 ) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the interagency security committee's ( isc ) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and ( 2 ) what management challenges , if any , selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results . this methodology purposely does not include federal buildings protected by fps and under the control of the general services administration as well as other agencies that we reported on in our previous work .
