i am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the claims processing challenges and opportunities facing the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) disability compensation and pension programs . for years , the claims process has been the subject of concern and attention within va and by the congress and veterans service organizations . many of their concerns have focused on long waits for decisions , large claims backlogs , and inaccurate decisions . our work and media reports of significant discrepancies in average disability payments from state to state have also highlighted concerns about the consistency of decision making within va . opportunities for improvement may lie in more fundamental reform of va's disability compensation programs . this would include reexamining program design and the context in which decisions are made as well as the structure and division of labor among field offices . for example , in recent years , gao has found that va and other federal disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions . the schedule on which disability decisions are made within va , for example , is based primarily on estimates made in 1945 about the effect service - connected impairments have on the average individual's ability to perform jobs requiring manual or physical labor . in addition , our work has shown that about one - third of newly compensated veterans could be interested in receiving a lump sum payment , which could potentially save va time and money associated with reopening cases over time and could be beneficial to veterans . while reexamining claims processing challenges in a larger context may be daunting , there are mechanisms for undertaking such an effort , including the congressionally chartered commission currently studying veterans' disability benefits . va continues to experience challenges processing veterans' disability compensation and pension claims . these include large numbers of pending claims and lengthy processing times . while va made progress in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in reducing the size and age of its inventory of pending claims , it has lost ground since the end of fiscal year 2003 . as shown in figure 1 , pending claims increased by over one - third from the end of fiscal year 2003 to the end of fiscal year 2005 , from about 254,000 to about 346,000 . in may 2000 testimony before the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations , committee on veterans' affairs , we underscored the conclusion made by the national academy of public administration in 1997 that va needed to study the consistency of decisions made by different regional offices , identify the degree of subjectivity expected for various medical issues , and then set consistency standards for those issues . recent history has shown that va's claims processing workload and performance are being affected by several factors , including the impacts of laws and court decisions and the filing behavior of veterans . for example , in designating federal disability programs as high risk in 2003 , gao noted that va's and the social security administration's ( ssa ) disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions . these included allowing va to assign the most experienced and productive adjudication officers and directors to the consolidated offices ; facilitating increased specialization and as - needed expert consultation in deciding complex cases ; improving the completeness of claims development , the accuracy and consistency of rating decisions , and the clarity of decision explanations ; improving overall adjudication quality by increasing the pool of experience and expertise in critical technical areas ; and facilitating consistency in decision making through fewer consolidated claims processing centers . questions include how well do disability benefits meet the congressional intent of replacing average impairment in earnings capacity , should lump sum payments be made for certain disabilities or level of severity of disability , and how does va's claims processing operation compare to other disability programs , including the location and number of processing centers .
