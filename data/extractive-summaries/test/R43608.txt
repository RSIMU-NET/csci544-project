on may 6 , 2010 , the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) , a broad stock index , fell by nearly 1,000 points over the course of several minutes and then quickly rebounded . this was one of the largest intraday declines in the history of the djia and was described by one commentator as "one of those eye - opening events that exposed many flaws in the structure of the market. . among them are whether ( 1 ) htf plays a role in exacerbating market fragility ; ( 2 ) it may heighten the market's systemic risk ; ( 3 ) it enhances or harms the quality of the securities market ; ( 4 ) certain kinds of hft may constitute an illegal form of front - running ; ( 5 ) hft helps foster a system of two - tiered trading markets that benefits certain traders at the expense of others due to their access to faster trading data and advantageous trade infrastructure ; and ( 6 ) the presence of hft has been to the detriment of non - hft investors and investor confidence in the securities market . in the 113 th congress , congressional interest in hft has been reflected in legislation that would levy securities transaction taxes on securities trades , presumably raising the cost and thus reducing the incidence of conducting hft . specifically , in the 113 th congress , s. 410 ( harkin ) , h.r . 880 ( defazio ) , and h.r . h.r . 2292 ( markey ) would require the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) to provide a regulatory definition of hft in the derivatives markets that the agency oversees . it would also require high - frequency traders in derivatives to register with the cftc , submit semiannual reports to the agency , and conform to business conduct requirements that the cftc may issue . the department of justice ( doj ) , federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , cftc , sec , new york attorney general , and massachusetts secretary of commerce are variously conducting investigations and probes into specific hft firms , certain hft strategies , and hft in general . in addition , the fbi is reportedly probing ( 1 ) whether hft firms are trading ahead of other investors based on information that other market participants cannot see , a possible form of front - running , a type of illegal insider trading ; ( 2 ) practices in which a hft trader submits trade orders and then cancels them to foster the illusion of market activity , a possible form of market manipulation that may prompt others to respond to illusory trade orders ; and ( 3 ) the use of hft to place orders to hide transactions that may be based on an illegal tip . in june 2014 , sec chair mary jo white made what was arguably the first explicit agency discussion of prospective hft - related regulatory initiatives . such concerns over hft , she indicated , had prompted her to direct sec staff to develop recommendations for "an anti - disruptive trading rule" that would "apply to active proprietary traders in short time periods when liquidity is most vulnerable and the risk of price disruption caused by aggressive short - term trading strategies is highest" ; clarify "the status of unregistered active proprietary traders to subject them to... [sec] rules as dealers" and look into crafting "a rule eliminating an exception from ... [financial industry regulatory authority] membership requirements for dealers that trade in off - exchange venue" ; and prepare recommendations for the sec "to improve firms' risk management of trading algorithms and to enhance regulatory oversight over their use. . this report provides an overview of equities hft and its potential economic and regulatory implications . it examines ( 1 ) recent developments regarding probes and investigations of hft , ( 2 ) what equities hft is , ( 3 ) the nature of the general equities hft landscape , ( 4 ) how equities hft works and who conducts it , ( 5 ) equity hft's perceived benefits and disadvantages , ( 6 ) the flash crash of 2010 and the alleged role of hft , ( 7 ) sec programmatic and regulation - related initiatives to potentially monitor hft and address its potentially negative market impact , ( 8 ) european union hft regulatory developments , ; and ( 9 ) various domestic hft regulatory ideas under discussion . such concerns intensified after the flash crash of 2010 and have continued with observations of ongoing mini - flash crashes . as in the equities markets , proponents of hft in the futures markets have argued that the rise of hft has tended to increase market liquidity and narrow bid - ask spreads , thereby reducing transaction costs . post - trade risk controls . these traders would be required to register with the cftc and maintain records and an audit trail that regulators could examine in case of a mini - flash crash or technological malfunction , he proposed .
