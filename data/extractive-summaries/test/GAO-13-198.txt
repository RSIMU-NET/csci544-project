within dhs , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and the u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) jointly administer the twic program . in november 2002 , mtsa further required dhs to issue a maritime worker identification card that uses biometrics to control access to secure areas of maritime transportation facilities and vessels . transportation security administration . august 2008 . dhs concurred with this recommendation . the results of the pilot are to inform the development of a proposed rule requiring the use of electronic card readers with twics at mtsa - regulated vessels and facilities . challenges related to pilot planning , data collection , and reporting affect the completeness , accuracy , and reliability of the pilot test aimed at assessing the technology and operational impact of using tsa's twic with card readers . as a result of these challenges , we recommended that dhs , through tsa and uscg , develop an evaluation plan to guide the remainder of the pilot that includes ( 1 ) performance standards for measuring the business and operational impacts of using twic with biometric card readers , ( 2 ) a clearly articulated evaluation methodology , and ( 3 ) a data analysis plan . if accurate data had been collected , adherence to the data analysis plan could have helped yield valid results . however , tsa and uscg did not fully identify how they would compensate for areas where the pilot did not provide the necessary information needed to report to congress and inform the twic card reader rule . pilot documentation shows that baseline throughput data were collected for all pilot sites . tsa and the independent test agent did not collect complete data on malfunctioning twic cards . pilot participants did not document instances of denied access . however , according to our review , the findings and lessons learned in dhs's report to congress were based on incomplete or unreliable data , and thus should not be used to inform the development of the future regulation on the use of twic with readers . dhs's report to congress stated that “when designed , installed , and operated in manners consistent with the business considerations of the facility or vessel operations , twic readers provide an additional layer of security by reducing the risk that an unauthorized individual could gain access to a secure area.” further , in a written statement by dhs officials presented before congress on june 28 , 2012 , dhs officials stated that twic enhances port facility and vessel security and that the pilot operation also highlighted security and operational benefits associated with readers , including the automation of access control , so that regular users could use their twics for quick and easy processing into a port . however , the validity of this assumption is questionable . gao - 11-657 . the depth and pervasiveness of the twic program's planning and implementation challenges require a reassessment of dhs's efforts to improve maritime security through the issuance of a u.s. government - sponsored twic card and card readers . for example , as discussed in the report: installed twic readers and access control systems could not collect required data , including reasons for errors , on twic reader use , and tsa and the independent test agent did not employ effective compensating data collection measures , such as manually recording reasons for errors in reading twics . to evaluate the extent to which the results from the twic reader pilot were sufficiently complete , accurate , and reliable for informing congress and the twic card reader rule , we assessed ( 1 ) twic reader pilot test planning and preparation activities , ( 2 ) pilot implementation and data collection practices , and ( 3 ) the findings reported in the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) february 2012 report to congress on the results of the twic reader pilot against underlying pilot data . twic reader pilot program baseline report , dated december 2010 ; twic initial technical test report , dated september 2010 ; twic card reader environmental specification conformance and evaluation test , signed march 2 , 2010 ; twic reader pilot program twic early operational assessment summary report , signed february 6 , 2012 ; early operational assessment reports ( final reports ) provided by tsa and the independent test agent for each of the 17 pilot sites ; twic reader pilot program system test and evaluation summary report , signed february 6 , 2012 ; systems test and evaluation reports ( st&e ) ( final reports ) provided by tsa and the independent test agent for each of the 17 pilot sites ; 117 pilot site trip reports where on - site observations were recorded against data recorded in final eoa and st&e reports ; twic reader pilot program data analysis plan , dated october 2010 ; 46 twic program weekly and monthly status reports provided by the independent test agent ; and tsa's twic reader pilot cost summary report by participant . these techniques provided us with the following summary and comparative views of collected pilot data , among others , which in part served as the basis of our data analysis: compiled data by pilot site ; compiled data on baseline population of users at each pilot site and reported access points ; comparison of the total population at baseline to total population reported during the st&e phase ; view of pilot site access point and reader matches across testing results ( baseline data , systems operational verification testing ( sovt ) data , eoa data , and st&e data ) ; view of tested reader and access control system characteristics ; comparison of baseline throughput times versus eoa and st&e throughput times for access points with similar readers used ; comparison of data across the pilot to identify trends , if any , in areas such as risk level , facility and vessel type , access point type , access decision location , testing mode throughput and transactions , reader hardware model and software version , reader types ( fixed versus portable ) , interface type ( contact versus contactless ) , communication protocol , whether or not registration was used , the enrollment process , the source of the biometric reference template , and canceled card list input frequency by site ; comparison of the total number of access points identified during baseline data collection versus the total of access points tested during the eoa and st&e phases of the pilot ; comparison of the mean , median , and mode based on the st&e number of throughput transactions ; and assessment of testing duration during eoa and st&e testing phases for both throughput and transaction data collection efforts . enhanced security .
