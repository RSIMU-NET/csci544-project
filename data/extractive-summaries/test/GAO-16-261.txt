in general , the act requires agencies to begin reporting financial spending data using these standards by may 2017 and publicly post spending data in machine - readable formats by may 2018 . to assess the extent to which omb and treasury established data standards that are consistent with leading practices , we analyzed omb's and treasury's 57 standardized data element definitions using criteria established under the data act as well as leading practices for well - constructed data definitions derived from standards developed by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) . we reviewed the selected agencies' implementation plans and related project plans and interviewed agency officials responsible for data act implementation . however , omb's may 2015 guidance directs agencies to continue reporting on awards data at least bi - weekly . the three agencies in our review — the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of agriculture ( usda ) — have begun addressing the requirements of the data act by forming data act teams , participating in government - wide deliberations on data standards , developing an inventory of their data , identifying systems containing pertinent data and the associated business practices , and assessing the policy , process , and technology changes that may be needed for successful implementation . if guidance is not timed to coincide with agencies' expected milestones for key steps in the implementation process , agencies could incur additional costs as they revise implementation plans to align with later versions of the guidance or could be forced to delay implementation . to help ensure that agencies report consistent and comparable data on federal spending , we recommend that the director of omb , in collaboration with the secretary of the treasury , provide agencies with additional guidance to address potential clarity , consistency , or quality issues with the definitions for specific data elements including award description and primary place of performance and that they clearly document and communicate these actions to agencies providing this data as well as to end - users . lastly , omb's interpretation is inconsistent with congress's intent when it passed the data act . regarding our second recommendation to align the release of finalized technical guidance to the implementation timelines specified in the data act implementation playbook , treasury officials generally concurred with our recommendation , noting that they recognize the importance of providing agencies with timely technical guidance and reporting submission specifications . this report ( 1 ) identifies steps taken by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of treasury ( treasury ) to establish government - wide data element definitions and the extent to which those definitions are consistent with leading practices or face challenges that could affect data quality ; ( 2 ) reviews efforts by omb and treasury to provide agencies with technical implementation guidance to standardize how data are collected and reported and related challenges ; and ( 3 ) examines the status of selected federal agencies' progress in meeting data act requirements . closed — not implemented . open . additional detail is provided in circular a‐11 .
