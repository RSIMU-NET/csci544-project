beginning in the late 1970s , congress deregulated the railroad industry by giving railroads more flexibility to set rates and negotiate confidential contracts with their customers . over the last decade , as major railroads have consolidated and have achieved higher profitability , some members of congress have questioned whether the present regime needs to be revised to protect the interests of rail customers who are poorly positioned to benefit from competition among freight transportation providers â€” a group often referred to as "captive shippers. . they typically claim that the railroad serving them acts like a monopoly , charging excessive rates and providing inadequate service . however , the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the division of revenue between shippers and railroads . an important policy question for congress is whether more competition will lead to a more robust and efficient railroad system or undermine it by discouraging investment in rail infrastructure . the surface transportation board ( stb or board ) recently began a review of its policies regarding these two issues , and they are addressed in legislation supported by captive shippers . railroads were prohibited from discriminating between shippers in rates and quality of service . the icc termination act left largely intact the regulatory framework that governs captive rail shipper issues . the question of whether a particular shipper is a "captive" has less to do with physical availability of alternatives to a single railroad than with the economic viability of those alternatives: a north dakota wheat farmer always has the option of hiring trucks to haul grain to the pacific coast for export , but if the cost would make his wheat uncompetitive , rail may be the only economically feasible alternative . in the senate , these bills have been reintroduced in the 112 th congress as s. 49 and s. 158 . the chairman and ranking member of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure , along with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee on railroads , wrote stb in january 2011 , "we would like to ... impress upon you the importance of maintaining the existing regulatory balance between the railroads and shippers," adding , "any policy change made by the stb which restricts the railroads' abilities to invest , grow their networks and meet the nation's freight transportation demands will be opposed by the committee. . with segments of the rail network now experiencing congestion , captive shippers argue that , as a matter of public policy , shippers should be given greater latitude to reroute their traffic to less capacity - constrained routes , even if those are not owned by the same carrier that serves a particular factory or distribution center .
