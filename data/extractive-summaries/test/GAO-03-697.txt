the coordination of these transportation services — through pooling resources , consolidating trips provided by various agencies under a single agency , or sharing information between programs — has been found to improve the quality and cost - effectiveness of service . this report addresses ( 1 ) the federal programs that provide transportation services for transportation - disadvantaged populations and the types of services they provide ; ( 2 ) federal , state , and local government spending for transportation services through these federal programs ; ( 3 ) the extent of coordination among state , local , and federal agencies in delivering transportation services for the transportation - disadvantaged , including actions taken by the coordinating council ; and ( 4 ) any obstacles that may impede effective coordination and potential options for overcoming such obstacles . these include 16 programs identified by the community transportation association of america ( ctaa ) as being routinely used to provide transportation and an additional 11 programs that we identified as spending at least $4 million for transportation services to transportation - disadvantaged populations in fiscal year 2001 on the basis of funding data or estimates that were available . these 16 programs are administered by dot , hhs , education , and dol . complete spending information is not available because many federal funding recipients are not required to distinguish transportation from other spending when reporting spending information to federal agencies . however , dot and hhs make only a few mentions of coordinating services for the transportation - disadvantaged in their strategic and annual performance plans , and other agencies do not mention such activities at all . even in states without such a coordinating body , however , some state and local agencies are engaged in coordination efforts . to mitigate these obstacles , these officials and other experts suggested three potential options: harmonizing standards and requirements among federal programs with a transportation component , providing and disseminating additional guidance and information on coordination , and providing financial incentives or mandates to coordinate . one set of obstacles was related to officials' reluctance to share vehicles or their tendency to give low priority to funding coordination activities . to promote and enhance federal , state , and local transportation coordination activities , we recommend that the secretaries of the departments of health and human services , labor , education , and transportation take the following actions: as member agencies of the coordinating council on access and mobility , ensure that the long - term goals in the council's strategic plan have clear links to the individual tasks in its action plan and that these actions are tied to measurable annual performance goals . at the federal level , we interviewed officials from the headquarters of the federal transit administration in the department of transportation ; the administration on aging , the administration for children and families , the centers for medicare & medicaid services , the health resources services administration , the office of intergovernmental affairs , and the substance abuse and mental health services administration in the department of health and human services ; the employment and training administration in the department of labor ; the department of agriculture ; the department of education ; the department of housing and urban development ; the department of the interior ; and the department of veterans affairs . the report is available on the coordinating council's web site . other agencies are also working to improve coordination .
