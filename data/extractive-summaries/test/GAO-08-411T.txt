senators conrad and gregg , thank you for your leadership . under any plausible scenario , the federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path . long - term fiscal simulations by gao , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and others all show that despite a 3- year decline in the federal government's unified budget deficit , we still face large and growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends . the passage of time only serves to worsen this situation: the size of the challenge has grown and the time to address it has shrunk . already the first members of the baby boom generation have filed for early social security retirement benefits — and will be eligible for medicare in only 3 years . our long - term fiscal challenge is primarily a health - care challenge . european union members also annually report on longer - term fiscal sustainability . the goal of these reports is to increase public awareness and understanding of the long - term fiscal outlook in light of escalating health care cost growth and population aging , to stimulate public and policy debates , and to help policymakers make more informed decisions . rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem ; they are our nation's number one fiscal challenge . as is true for the federal budget , growth in health - related spending — medicaid and health insurance for state and local employees and retirees — is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local governments . health care spending systemwide continues to grow at an unsustainable pace , eroding the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercutting their ability to compete internationally . addressing the unsustainability of health care costs is a major competitiveness and societal challenge that calls for us as a nation to fundamentally rethink how we define , deliver , and finance health care in both the public and the private sectors . this will be a major societal challenge that will affect all age groups . as we enter 2008 , what we call the long - term fiscal challenge is not in the distant future . the longer we wait , the more painful and difficult the choices will become . simply put , our nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable long - term fiscal path that is getting worse with the passage of time . as you are aware , during the past 3 years , i have traveled to 25 states as part of the fiscal wake - up tour . the passage of time is shrinking the window for action . this long - term challenge increases the importance of careful design of any stimulus package — it should be timely , targeted , and temporary .
