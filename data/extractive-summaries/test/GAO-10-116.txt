in recent years , the federal government has increasingly encouraged the use of biofuels and other alternatives to petroleum in response to concerns over u.s. dependence on imported oil , climate change , and other issues . to understand the potential effects of increased biofuel production on water resources , you asked us to describe ( 1 ) the known water resource effects of increased biofuel production in the united states ; ( 2 ) the agricultural conservation practices and technological innovations that exist or are being developed to address these effects , and any barriers that may prevent the adoption of these practices and technologies ; and ( 3 ) key research needs regarding the effects of biofuel production on water resources . water plays a critical role in many aspects of this life cycle . in contrast , many experts expect next generation feedstocks to require less water and provide some water quality benefits , but even with these feedstocks the effects on water resources will largely depend on which feedstock is selected , and where and how these feedstocks are grown . this will happen because corn requires high applications of fertilizers relative to soybeans and other potential biofuel feedstocks , such as perennial grasses . farmers could reduce the negative effects of residue removal by harvesting only corn cobs or part of the stover , but the optimal removal rate is not yet fully known , and is currently being studied by several federal agencies and academic institutions . for instance , if perennial grasses were harvested down to the soil , they would not reduce soil erosion as compared to conventional feedstocks in the long run , according to some experts . for example , officials from a company in the process of establishing a biorefinery expect the conversion of pine and other cellulosic feedstocks to consume less water than the conversion of corn to ethanol once the plant is operating at a commercial scale . similarly , the process of converting feedstocks to biofuels , technological innovations , and the use of alternative water sources can help reduce water supply and water quality impacts , but these options can be cost prohibitive and certain noneconomic barriers to their widespread use remain . several experts and officials said that in order to promote such practices , it is important to continue funding and enrollment in federal programs , such as usda's environmental quality incentives program , which pay farmers or provide education and technical support . furthermore , according to epa , planting drought - resistant crops , such as corn , may lead to increased cultivation in areas where it has not previously occurred and may result in problems including increased nutrient runoff . economic barriers . technological improvements have already increased water use efficiency in the ethanol conversion process . many experts and officials cited the need for more research into the development of drought - tolerant and water - and nutrient - efficient crop varieties to decrease the amount of water needed for irrigation and the amount of fertilizer that needs to be applied to biofuel feedstocks . for example , research into new technologies that further reduce water needs for biorefinery cooling systems would have a significant impact on the overall water use at a biorefinery , according to several experts . some experts also noted the need for research on the availability of lower - quality water sources such as brackish groundwater , which could be used for cultivation of some next generation feedstocks , especially algae . in its general comments , doi stated that the report is useful and agreed with the finding on the need for better data on water resources to aid the decision about where to cultivate feedstocks and locate biorefineries . doi also provided additional technical comments that we incorporated into the report as appropriate . we also interviewed senior officials , scientists , economists , researchers , and other federal officials from usda , the departments of defense and energy , epa , the national aeronautics and space administration , the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration , the national science foundation , and usgs about effects on the water supply and water quality during the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks and the conversion and storage of the finished biofuels .
